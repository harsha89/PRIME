Sub-category: Molecular Diagnostics and Imaging Category: Tumor Biology Meeting: 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstract No: e22188 Citation: J Clin Oncol 31, 2013 [suppl; abstr e22188] Author(s): Christian Apfel, Kimberly Souza, Cyrill Hornuss, Larry Weisenthal, Robert Alan Nagourney; SageMedic, Inc, Larkspur, CA; Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Weisenthal Cancer Group, Huntington Beach, CA; Rational Therapeutics, Long Beach, CA Abstract: Background: Cytometric analysis, or in-vitro functional profiling, has been developed as a method to predict tumor response to different drugs with the premise to personalize chemotherapy and improve patient outcomes. Methods: We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis a) of correlative studies using cytometric profiling that reported diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and b) of effectiveness studies comparing patient outcomes when allocated to treatment guided by a cytometric assay versus population-based standard of care. We used Meta-DiSc software to find pooled sensitivity and specificity and analyze the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve and used Review Manager 5.1 to generate forest plots on overall tumor response (50% or greater decrease in tumor diameter) and on 1-year overall survival. Results: We included 28 mostly retrospective trials (n=664) reporting accuracy data and 15 prospective trials (n=1917) reporting therapeutic efficacy data. The accuracy of correlative study revealed an overall sensitivity of 0.922 [95% confidence interval 0.888 to 0.948], specificity of 0.724 (95% CI 0.669 to 0.774) and an area under the sROC curve of 0.893 (SE=0.023, p<0.001). Studies comparing the clinical utility revealed a two-fold overall tumor response for an assay-guided therapy versus standard of care therapy (odds ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.57, p<0.001). Similarly, patients who received assay-guided therapy compared to those who received standard of care or physician\u0092s choice had a significantly higher 1-year survival rate (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95, p=0.02). Conclusions: Despite various limitations of individual studies, the aggregate and fairly consistent evidence of these data suggests cytometric profiling to be accurate, to improve overall tumor response, and to increase 1-year patient survival. Given the enormous potential for our society, a well-designed and sufficiently-powered randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to validate these results. http://abstracts2.asco.org/AbstView_132_118466.html",

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. During the 1960s, 70s and into the 90s, a field of investigation arose that examined buyer\u0092s practices when it came to the consumption of goods and services. Algorithms were developed to interrogate consumer choice. One such treatise was reported in 1994 (Carson, RT et al, Experimental Analysis of Choice, Marketing Letters 1994). What these researchers explored were the motivations and forces that drove consumption. When choices are offered, decisions are driven by such factors as complexity and utility. Complexity demands personal expertise or failing that, input from experts, while utility places a value on the good or service. A recent report from a small biotechnology company called Foundation Medicine has brought this field of endeavor to mind. It seems that this group will be offering DNA sequencing to select chemotherapy drugs. This service, currently priced at $5,800, will focus upon a small cassette of genes that they described as \u0093key\u0094 in tumor growth. Based on their technology they have already raised $33.5 million from the likes of Third Rock, Google and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, venture capital sources. The CEO of Foundation substantiates the approach by pointing out that fully 150 people have already used their services. One hundred and fifty! It seems from this report that our colleagues in the field of molecular profiling have studied the dictates of \u0093Experimental Analysis of Choice\u0094 to a \u0093T.\u0094 What we have is the perfect storm of medical marketing. First, the technology is so complex as to be beyond the ken of both patients and physicians alike. Thus, expertise is required and that expertise is provided by those engaged in the field. Second, the utility of drug selection is beyond reproach. Who in their right mind wouldn\u0092t want to receive a drug with a higher likelihood of a response when we consider the toxicities and costs, as well as the consequences of the wrong treatment? Dazzled by the prospect of curative outcomes, patients will, no doubt, be lining up around the block. But, let\u0092s deconstruct what this report is actually telling us. First, a scientifically interesting technology has been brought to the market. Second, it exists to meet an unmet need. So far, so good. What is lacking, however, is evidence. Not necessarily evidence in the rarefied Cochrane sense of idealized survival curves, nor even Level II evidence, but any evidence at all. Like whirling dervishes, patients and their physicians are drawn into a trancelike state, when terms like NextGen sequencing, SNP analysis and splice variants are bandied about. Despite the enthusiastic reception by investors, I fear a lack of competent due diligence. To wit, a recent article in Biotechniques, \u0093Will the Real Cancer Cell Please Stand Up,\u0094 comes to mind. It seems that cancer cells are not individual entities but networks. A harmonic oscillation develops between tumor, stroma, vasculature and cytokines. In this mix, the cancer cell is but one piece of the puzzle. Indeed, according to recent work from Baylor, some of the tumor promotion signals in the form of small interfering RNAs, may arise not from the cancer cells, but instead from the surrounding stroma. How then, will even the most punctiliously perfect genomic analyses of a cancer cells play out in the real world of human tumor biology and clinical response prediction? Not very well I fear. But then again such a discussion would require data on the predictive validity of the method, something that appears to be sorely lacking. Will today\u0092s gene profile companies prove to be the biotech Facebook IPOs of tomorrow?",

      "Content": "Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., and Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D. N Engl J Med 2013; 369:2369-2371December 19, 2013DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1314561 Article This year marks 60 years since James Watson and Francis Crick described the structure of DNA and 10 years since the complete sequencing of the human genome. Fittingly, today the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted marketing authorization for the first high-throughput (next-generation) genomic sequencer, Illumina's MiSeqDx, which will allow the development and use of innumerable new genome-based tests. When a global team of researchers sequenced that first human genome, it took more than a decade and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Today, because of federal and private investment, sequencing technologies have advanced dramatically, and a human genome can be sequenced in about 24 hours for what is now less than $5,000. This is a rare example of technology development in which faster, cheaper, and better have coincided: as costs have plummeted and capacity has increased, the accuracy of sequencing has substantially improved. With the FDA's announcement, a platform that took nearly a decade to develop from an initial research project funded by the National Institutes of Health will be brought into use for clinical care. Clinicians can selectively look for an almost unlimited number of genetic changes that may be of medical significance. Access to these data opens the door for the transformation of research, clinical care, and patient engagement. To see how this technology could be used, consider cancer. Comprehensive analysis of the genome sequence of individual cancers has helped uncover the specific mutations that contribute to the malignant phenotype, identify new targets for therapy, and increase the opportunities for choosing the optimal treatment for each patient. For instance, lung adenocarcinoma can now be divided into subtypes with unique genomic fingerprints associated with different outcomes and different responses to particular therapies. More broadly, recent work from the Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrates that the tissue of origin of a particular cancer may be much less relevant to prognosis and response to therapy than the array of causative mutations.1 As a result, patients diagnosed with a cancer for which there are few therapeutic options may increasingly benefit from drug therapies originally aimed at other cancers that share common driver mutations. The new technology allows us go from our current approach of targeted searches for specific mutations in individual cancers to widespread use of approaches that survey the entire genome. A major area of opportunity that has yet to be fully exploited is pharmacogenomics \u0097 the use of genomic information to identify the right drug at the right dose for each patient. More than 120 FDA-approved drugs have pharmacogenomics information in their labeling, providing important details about differences in response to the drug and, in some cases, recommending genetic testing before prescribing.2 But the full potential of pharmacogenomics is largely unrealized, because of the logistic challenges in obtaining suitable genomic information in a timely enough fashion to guide prescribing. Placing genomic information in the electronic medical record would facilitate this kind of personalized medicine. If the patient's entire genome were part of his or her medical record, then the complexities of acquiring a DNA sample, shipping it, and performing laboratory work would be replaced by a quick electronic query. Although this scenario holds great promise, the utility of genomic information for drug prescribing must be documented with rigorous evidence. For example, three recently published clinical trials raise questions about the clinical utility of using pharmacogenetic information in the initial dosing of vitamin K anatagonists.3 The FDA based its decision to grant marketing authorization for the Illumina instrument platform and reagents on their demonstrated accuracy across numerous genomic segments, spanning 19 human chromosomes. Precision and reproducibility across instruments, users, days, and reagent lots were also demonstrated. The marketing authorization of a sequencing platform for clinical use will probably expand the incorporation of genetic information into health care. But even the most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed. Already, key policy advances have helped smooth the way and address many of the public's concerns about the potential misuse of genetic information.4 For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibit health insurers from considering genetic information as a preexisting condition, as material to underwriting, or as the basis for denying coverage. GINA also protects against use of genetic information by employers. These protections do not, however, extend to the disease manifestations of genetic risks. Although genomic information showing a predisposition to cancer would be protected under GINA, other clinical signs or symptoms indicative of cancer are not protected. Provisions of the Affordable Care Act set to go into effect in 2014 go a step further and will preclude consideration of all preexisting conditions, whether genomic or not, in establishing insurance premiums. Current federal laws, however, do not restrict the use of genomic information in life insurance, long-term care insurance, or disability insurance. The legal landscape for the use of genomics in personalized medicine grew brighter in June of this year when the Supreme Court ruled (in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics) that isolated naturally occurring DNA cannot be patented. This decision was a breakthrough for access to individual genetic tests but also, even more important, for the integration of genome sequencing into clinical care. Before the Myriad decision, there were substantial concerns that in order to offer whole genome sequencing, clinical laboratories would have to pay royalties to a long list of gene patent holders. The decision has opened the creative doors to an as yet unimaginable set of products that may benefit the public health. The FDA has also been active in addressing other regulatory issues surrounding personalized medicine.5 Along with authorizing the Illumina technology for marketing, the FDA recognized the need for reference materials and methods that would permit performance assessment. As a result, the FDA collaborated with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop reference materials consisting of whole human genome DNA, together with the best possible sequence interpretation of such genomes. The first human genome reference materials are expected to be available for public use in the next 12 months. This marketing authorization of a non\u0096disease-specific platform will allow any lab to test any sequence for any purpose. Thus, putting in place an appropriate risk-based regulatory framework is now critical to ensure the validation and quality of tests (called laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs) developed in-house by clinical laboratories. The marketing authorization for the first next-generation genome sequencer represents a significant step forward in the ability to generate genomic information that will ultimately improve patient care. Yet it is only one step. There are many challenges ahead before personalized medicine can be considered truly embedded in health care. We need to continue to uncover variants within the genome that can be used to predict disease onset, affect progression, and modulate drug response. New genomic findings need to be validated before they can be integrated into medical decision making. Doctors and other health care professionals will need support in interpreting genomic data and their meaning for individual patients. Patients will want to be able to talk about their genetic information with their doctor. With the right information and support, patients will be able to participate alongside their doctors in making more informed decisions. Reimbursement issues need to be resolved to assure that patients have access to the best tests and that manufacturers have incentives to develop them. The arrival of next-generation sequencing at this regulatory landmark is only the beginning. We need to work together to ensure that research progresses, that regulatory policies are developed, that patients' rights and needs are addressed, and that clinical use of genomic information is based on rigorous evidence.

      "Content": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have come a long way since 1977 when Frederick Sanger developed chain-termination sequencing, but are they ready for prime time in drug selection? Researchers have realized that cancer biology is driven by signaling pathways. Cells speak to each other and the messages they send are interpreted via intracellular pathways known as signal transduction. Many of these pathways are activated or deactivated by phosphorylations on select cellular proteins. Sequencing the genome of cancer cells is explicitly based upon the assumption that the pathways - network of genes - of tumor cells can be known in sufficient detail to control cancer. Each cancer cell can be different and the cancer cells that are present change and evolve with time. Although the theory behind inhibitor targeted therapy is appealing, the reality is more complex. Cancer cells often have many mutations in many different pathways, so even if one route is shut down by a targted treatment, the cancer cell may be able to use other routes. In other words, cancer cells have \"backup systems\" that allow them to survive. The result is that the drug does not affect the tumor as expected. The cancer state is typically characterized by a signaling process that is unregulated and in a continuous state of activation. In chemotherapy selection, genotype analysis (genomic profiling) examines a single process within the cell or a relatively small number of processes. All a gene mutation study can tell is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to a mechanism of attack. The aim is to tell if there is a theoretical predisposition to drug response. It doesn't tell you the effectiveness of one drug (or combination) or any other drug which may target this in the individual. There are many pathways to altered cellular function. Phenotype analysis (functional profiling) measures the end result of pathway activation or deactivation to predict whether patients will actually respond (clinical responders). It measures what happens at the end, rather than the status of the individual pathway, by assessing the activity of a drug (or combinations) upon combined effect of all cellular processes, using combined metabolic and morphologic endpoints, at the cell population level, measuring the interaction of the entire genome. Should oncologists begin using deep genome sequencing in their clinical practice? At the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, two key opinion leaders battled it out over this topic in a debate.",

      "Content": "(Reuters Health) - Routine genome-wide screening of cancers is likely a long way off, a new paper says. The technology, known as next-generation sequencing, promises to revolutionize doctors' understanding of cancer and underpins perhaps the biggest paradigm shift taking place in cancer research today: the growing emphasis on a cancer's genetic makeup, rather than its location within the body. Understanding the genetic makeup of an individual patient's tumor may allow physicians to pick the drug that best targets that specific tumor, as well as recognize when a tumor has developed resistance to the drug through new genetic mutations. \"Next-generation sequencing is especially promising in cancer because in a single test, one can interrogate all clinically relevant cancer genes for all types of genomic alterations, including sequence mutations and chromosomal rearrangements,\" Dr. Michael Berger, a geneticist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told Reuters Health in an email. There are several different specific screening technologies that are considered \"next-generation\" - but all share the ability to sequence entire human genomes in a matter of days. When applied to cancer, the technology is used to screen the entire genome of cancer cells. By some measures, this promise is already being realized. For example, last year The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network used genome-wide screening of breast cancer tumors to demonstrate that there are four main breast cancer types defined by differing genomic and epigenetic mutations. The study showed that individual breast cancers have many genetic differences from each other but that one subgroup of breast cancers, basal-like breast cancer, was similar genetically to serous ovarian cancer. Cancer cells present unique and complex challenges, they note. Because they are genetically so different from normal human tissue, there is not always a 'reference sequence' against which to compare the tumor DNA. There are also frequent chromosome-scale as well as epigenetic changes, and even significant genetic differences among cells within the same tumor, an issue specific to cancer cells known as tumor heterogeneity. The authors of the new paper, writing online July 25 in the British Journal of Cancer, pointed out that this complexity creates a number of problems that must be solved before next-generation sequencing is a common part of cancer care. One of the first issues is developing the algorithms that are used to map the genome. \"The computational challenges involved in analyzing and storing clinical (next-generation sequencing) data cannot be overstated,\" said Dr. Berger, who wasn't involved in the new study. \"Better algorithms must be developed to reliably and accurately detect mutations in heterogeneous tumors.\" In genome-wide sequencing, a seemingly minuscule misstep in the analysis could have massive consequences. For example, say the authors of the new paper, led by Dr. Danny Ulahannan of the Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics in Oxford, UK, \"the sheer quantity of data means that getting 0.01% of the human genome wrong would correspond to 300,000 errors scattered along the three billion base pairs.\" Dr. Lynda Chin, the chair of Genomic Medicine and scientific director of the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MD Anderson Cancer Center, told Reuters Health this is often an overlooked problem. \"One barrier that is often overlooked or underestimated from the clinical side is the technical challenge of generating high-quality (next-generation sequencing) data,\" Dr. Chin said. \"There is a sense that generating (the data) is easy, and it is the analysis that is hard. I would disagree, as I believe that the technology is still unstable, for lack of a better word, not yet turn-key, and no matter how good the analytics-interpretation become, if the data is poor quality, the result will be poor.\" And mapping the genome is really only the first step. The next step is figuring out which mutations are relevant to the development of cancer and whether they can be targeted with a drug. \"I agree with the obvious barriers of interpretation. Not just analytically that we need improved algorithms, (but) more importantly, more knowledge and understanding of what each alteration means and how each event impact on clinical decision,\" Dr. Chin said. The advances will require a \"cultural change\" in cancer research, Dr. Chin said, that makes \"patient-oriented genomic research a standard, rather than a heroic effort by a researcher.\"",

Methods: We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis a) of correlative studies using cytometric profiling that reported diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and b) of effectiveness studies comparing patient outcomes when allocated to treatment guided by a cytometric assay versus population-based standard of care. We used Meta-DiSc software to find pooled sensitivity and specificity and analyze the summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve and used Review Manager 5.1 to generate forest plots on overall tumor response (50% or greater decrease in tumor diameter) and on 1-year overall survival. Results: We included 28 mostly retrospective trials (n=664) reporting accuracy data and 15 prospective trials (n=1917) reporting therapeutic efficacy data. The accuracy of correlative study revealed an overall sensitivity of 0.922 [95% confidence interval 0.888 to 0.948], specificity of 0.724 (95% CI 0.669 to 0.774) and an area under the sROC curve of 0.893 (SE=0.023, p<0.001). Studies comparing the clinical utility revealed a two-fold overall tumor response for an assay-guided therapy versus standard of care therapy (odds ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.57, p<0.001).

Conclusions: Despite various limitations of individual studies, the aggregate and fairly consistent evidence of these data suggests cytometric profiling to be accurate, to improve overall tumor response, and to increase 1-year patient survival. Given the enormous potential for our society, a well-designed and sufficiently-powered randomized controlled trial is urgently needed to validate these results. http://abstracts2.asco.org/AbstView_132_118466.html",

      "Content": "At ESMO, experts assess the clinical use of genome sequencing Vienna\u0097Should oncologists begin using deep genome sequencing in their clinical practice? Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have come a long way since 1977 when Frederick Sanger developed chain-termination sequencing, but are they ready for prime time? At the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, two key opinion leaders battled it out over this topic in a debate. The Argument for Deep Genome Sequencing Arguing the pro position, Fabrice Andre, MD, PhD, of the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, said that embracing deep sequencing in daily clinical practice is not only the right thing to do, it is a necessity. The number of genetic biomarkers known to influence patient outcomes and care has risen dramatically in recent years and is only expected to grow, he said. \u0093The current system is not sustainable for hospitals and academic centers,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. \u0093It\u0092s not possible for [them] to run more than 10 bioassays per patient. We need to move to multiplex technology.\u0094 For breast cancer, he said, clinicians can run tests for ER/HER2, TOP2A, FGR1, IGFR1R, EGFR, PAK1, BRCA1, CYP2D6, PTEN and PI3KCA among others. With whole genome sequencing, \u0093you can assess all the genes that you want,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. \u0093When you do one test for each biomarker, each biomarker has a cost. Keep in mind that three FISH [fluorescence in situ hybridization] is equal to the same cost of one whole genome CGH [comparative genomic hybridization] array.\u0094 Whole genome sequencing also offers a number of other potential advantages. High throughput approaches can identify a large number of rare targetable gene alterations. This is increasingly important as researchers find genetic alterations that exist in 1% or 2% of patients. The technology also can capture minority clones that may be hard to identify when there is a low percentage of tumor cells in a sample. The next-generation sequencers have been proven to be accurate and they do not need large samples of tissue. Dr. Andre pointed out that some protein-based assays, which are used because they are less expensive than FISH, are not reliable. One study found that the immunohistochemistry test for the HER2 protein was accurate only 81.6% of the time (J Clin Oncol 2006;24:3032-3038, PMID: 16809727). The \u0093robust\u0094 deep sequencing technology is already being used for patient care at academic centers. One such example is the MOSCATO trial, which began in fall 2011. This trial enrolled 120 patients with difficult-to-treat cancers and is using whole genome sequencing to identify potential therapeutic targets. Once a target has been identified, patients receive targeted therapy in a clinical trial if one is available. The turnover time for sequencing is 15 days and the total cost is 1,500 euros, or roughly $2,000 per patient. The cost of technology is expected to decrease dramatically in the next few years. By the end of 2012, Oxford Nanopore Technology is expected to launch a technology that is the size of a USB drive and will offer whole genome sequencing in 15 minutes for less than $1,000. Dr. Andre argued that deep sequencing will be less expensive than a multiplicity of tests. He pointed to a case study recently described in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology as an example of a success story (2012;7:e14-e16). In the case report, a 43-year-old never smoker with lung cancer had tested negative for EML4-ALK on the approved companion genetic test for crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer). Sensing that an oncogenic genetic driver was spurring the patient\u0092s cancer, clinicians ordered deep sequencing and identified a novel ALK fusion. The patient was treated with crizotinib and was recently reported to have had a complete response. \u0093In the context of prospective cohorts, but not clinical trials, I think we need to deliver NGS in order to detect a high number of rare, relevant genomic alterations and then treatment can be done in the context of Phase I trials or drug access programs,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. The Argument Against Deep Genome Sequencing According to Kenneth O\u0092Byrne, MD, a consultant medical oncologist at St. James Hospital and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, Dr. Andre is jumping the gun. \u0093He makes the fundamental error that all people who are enthusiastic about new technologies always make and that is the non-application of evidence-based medicine,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093Deep sequencing is a fantastic tool, but it is a research toy and an expensive toy at the moment. For day-to-day practical medicine, we have to go by evidence base.\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne cast doubt on Dr. Andre\u0092s success story example. \u0093They treated the patient with crizotinib and made the false conclusion that the ALK rearrangement they detected was responsible for the response. Do we know if that patient expressed MET? Is there any other reason [he] may have responded to crizotinib?\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. He agreed that the cost of the sequencing technology was decreasing, but argued that analysis would remain expensive. He argued that the clinical benefit of identifying genetic drivers is still uncertain. \u0093I would argue that in lung cancer, and indeed in almost every other tumor, there are only a few proven genetic alterations that can be identified that actually affect the way we treat our patients in clinic,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor] mutations and ALK rearrangements are the only validated predictive biomarkers in NSCLC [non-small cell lung cancer].\u0094 He pointed out that these affect only 15% of lung cancer patients, and although there are targeted agents available, the jury is still out on whether the drugs that target these mutations improve survival. As an example of this, he pointed out that an interim analysis of the PROFILE 007 trial presented at the ESMO meeting (abstract LBA1) showed that although crizotinib increased progression-free survival by 4.7 months compared with chemotherapy, there was no difference in overall survival. \u0093If you look at all of the EGFR TKI [tyrosine kinase inhibitor] randomized controlled trials versus cytotoxic chemotherapy in EGFR mutation\u0096positive disease, there has yet to be a proven [overall] survival benefit, despite obvious clinical benefits,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. Researchers say the lack of overall survival advantage in many of these trials can be blamed on the large numbers of patients who cross over to the experimental therapy. \u0093The argument is crossover, but we don\u0092t know that yet,\u0094 he said. Dr. O\u0092Byrne urged caution, as several years ago, it was thought that tumor angiogenesis inhibitors would be the salvation of lung cancer patients and that did not happen. There was clear evidence that new blood tumor vessels were associated with poor outcome, but when researchers tested a slew of antiangiogenic TKIs in patients with lung cancer, none of them worked. These included apatinib, axitinib, cedarinib, motesanib, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetanib. \u0093There is still some promise that some of these might break through,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said, pointing to Boehringer Ingelheim\u0092s BIBF1120. \u0093But to date, we\u0092ve spent billions of euros proving that many of these are of no value. \u0093In my view, and I feel this quite strongly, predictive biomarker tests must undergo validation and quality assurance before they are used rou- tinely in clinical practice,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093Deep DNA sequencing holds huge promise \u0085 but it is a research tool, and I do genuinely believe that a lot of clinically irrelevant data is generated that actually confuses the clinician and the patient.\u0094 Clinical Oncology News Issue: December 2012 | Volume: 07:12",

      "Content": "The addition of bevacizumab (Avastin) to standard adjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer failed to improve invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in a randomized clinical trial. Patients treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) had 92% iDFS with or without the bevacizumab. Subgroup analysis did not identify any group of patients that benefited from the addition of the angiogenesis inhibitor. Added to negative outcomes in several other studies, the results could spell the end of clinical investigation of anti-angiogenesis inhibitors in breast cancer, Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD, of the University of California Los Angeles, said here at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. \"All these anti-angiogenic strategies have really not impacted survival in breast cancer,\" said Slamon. \"There may still be something there if we were able to find the right markers, but, so far, they have all come out negative for any impressive survival advantage. \"The challenge in terms of the safety issues is that if you're not getting a lot of benefit and you're adding safety concerns, you have to wonder whether it's going to be worthwhile pursuing that much further. Unless there is a new drug or new strategy to define the subgroup, I think this is not going anywhere.\" Slamon reported findings from the multicenter BETH trial (Bevacizumab and Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer). The study involved 3,500 patients with early-stage HER2-positive, node-positive breast cancer or high-risk node-negative disease. Patients received either non-anthracycline or anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and trastuzumab and were randomized to bevacizumab or no additional therapy. The primary endpoint was iDFS, and secondary endpoints included DFS, overall survival, recurrence-free interval, distant recurrence-free interval, and toxicity. The patients had a median age of 51, almost half were node negative, half had tumors ≤2 cm, and 59% were hormone-receptor positive. When the trial ended after a median follow-up of 33 months, it had not met the primary endpoint. Overall survival was 96% to 97% in both treatment groups. Analysis of iDFS according to chemotherapy regimen showed no difference between groups. The addition of bevacizumab increased the toxicity burden. Patients treated with bevacizumab had a 27% incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events of interest, as compared with 8% in patients who did not receive the angiogenesis inhibitor. The bevacizumab group had significantly higher rates of hypertension (19% versus 4%, P<0.0001), bleeding (2% versus <1%, P<0.0001), heart failure (2.1% versus <1%, P=0.021), proteinuria (21 cases versus 1, P<0.0001), and gastrointestinal perforation (11 cases versus 1, P<0.031). Slamon showed results from previous studies to emphasize the progress in breast cancer survival. With surgery alone, long-term DFS was 26%. The introduction of adjuvant therapy increased DFS to 32%, and anthracyline-based therapy added another 4%. With the introduction of the taxanes, DFS increased to 62%, and then to 67% with dose-dense therapy and 84% with the introduction of targeted therapy. The BETH trial demonstrated iDFS of 92% in both groups. \"We have very little room at the top to think about new strategies for those patients who are not getting the benefit that we had hoped they would with targeted therapy,\" said Slamon. The results leave little doubt that angiogenesis inhibitors do not have a role in breast cancer -- HER2-positive disease in this case, said Jennifer Litton, MD, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. \"This study asked a question that has been ongoing for several years: Whether anti-angiogenesis -- and specifically bevacizumab in this case -- is going to add anything to the current treatment strategies,\" said Litton, who was not involved in the study. \"I feel that Dr. Slamon and his group have definitively answered this in the HER2 question. Bevacizumab adds really significant toxicity and no benefit.\" The BETH trial was sponsored by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, the Cancer International Research Group, Hoffmann-LaRoche, and Genentech. Slamon reported no relevant disclosures.

      "Content": "The first presentation of the BEATRICE trial, evaluating adjuvant Avastin with a physician\u0092s choice taxane- and/or anthracycline-based regimen in patients with triple-negative disease, was at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). Given the diminished recent role of Avastin in the metastatic setting and the well-publicized failure of the adjuvant trial in colorectal cancer, these negative results were not too surprising. Interestingly, Dr. Norman Wolmark is still frustrated that the signal of an impressive reduction in recurrence observed when Avastin was on board in the NSABP-C-08 colon cancer trial has not been further pursued. BEATRICE, like C-08, used one year of Avastin, and Wolmark continues to believe that more benefit would be seen with a greater duration of treatment, although this is not likely to be studied.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland; Andrew Love Cancer Centre, Geelong, Australia; National Cancer Center, Singapore, Singapore Background: Bevacizumab (BEV), an anti-VEGF antibody, significantly enhanced progression-free survival in metastatic breast cancer (BC) (E2100, AVADO, RIBBON-1, RIBBON-2) and pathologic complete response rates in the neoadjuvant setting (GeparQuinto, NSABP B-40) when combined with chemotherapy (CT). The dependence of micro-metastases on angiogenesis [Holmgren 1995] suggests that patients might benefit from anti-angiogenic strategies applied in the adjuvant setting. The BEATRICE trial was designed to test this hypothesis in patients with triple-negative BC, who have a poor prognosis and lack targeted options for treatment. Methods: In this open-label randomized multinational phase III trial, patients with centrally confirmed triple-negative operable primary invasive BC (pT1a-pT3) were randomized 1:1 after definitive surgery to receive ≥4 cycles of either CT alone or the same CT + 1 year of BEV 5 mg/kg/wk equivalent. CT was anthracycline [anth] and/or taxane-based. Patients were stratified by nodal status (0 vs 1-3 vs ≥4 involved nodes), CT backbone (anth vs anth + taxane vs taxane), hormone receptor status (negative vs low), and surgery (breast-conserving vs mastectomy). The primary objective is to compare invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) [Hudis 2007] with adjuvant CT ± 1 year of BEV. Secondary outcome measures are overall survival (OS), breast cancer-free interval, disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS, and safety (NCI CTCAE v3.0). The sample size was calculated to provide 80% power for a HR=0.75 at α=0.05 assuming 5-year IDFS of 72.0% with CT vs 78.2% with CT + BEV with 388 events. BEATRICE also includes evaluation of potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Results: Between Dec 2007 and Mar 2010, 2591 patients were randomized. At data cut-off (Feb 29, 2012), median follow-up was 32 months. http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs1...u=SABCS12L_754 http://www.researchtopractice.com/si...wnloadable.pdf",

      "Content": "According to Dr. Eric Topol, Director, Scripps Translational Science Institute, recent studies have highlighted the potential value of whole genome or exome sequencing to precisely guide therapy for patients with cancer. However, almost all samples today go into formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks, which alters the DNA and makes sequencing quite compromised and difficult. He told Medscape Connect that the company, Foundation Medicine, which works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, and gets about 250-300 genes, the exons or coding elements in those genes, and reads out any potential links to drugs. But the rate-liimiting step appears to be getting something beyond these paraffin blocks. This is, we could do better if we could use either fresh formalin-fixed or frozen tissue samples from a biopsy or surgical specimen. Topol says the problem is that pathologists are seemingly quite ritualistic. They don't want to go to frozen samples, which would be the best for whole genome sequencing. We're just at the cusp of getting started with this type of limited, not even full exome sequencing, just a few hundred genes, but that isn't enough. Rencent papers in multiple journals in Nature, Science, Nature Genetics and Cell have shown that with hundreds of tumor samples fully sequenced, no two cancers are the same and a lot of the action is not in the coding elements of the genes per se. Whole genome sequencing certainly appears to be an ideal path to pursue, but we can't do it with the fixed problems that we have with the way samples are handled today. Topol thinks that maybe we could get fresh formalin-fixed samples, as those appear to be well-suited to whole genome sequencing, although this is still a somewhat bootstrapped situation, like the paraffin-embedded samples. It appears that the long those samples are embedded, the harder it is to get a reasonable sequence beyond very targeted regions. There are no two cancer tissues that are the same on a molecular basis. There's quite a bit of heterogeneity within the samples and multiple sequencing could account for that. And we also want to anticipate recurrence, match up the right driver mutations and the backseat passenger mutations, whether or not there's needed immunotherapy; all those things that could be done if we could get the right information from the get go. So Dr. Topol asks this: How are we going to move to a world with a clinic of the future where patients with cancer can get whole genome sequencing rapidly? That is, to have annotation and interpretation of the genome with a day, and have your therapy precisely guided genomically?",

      "Content": "At ESMO, experts assess the clinical use of genome sequencing Vienna\u0097Should oncologists begin using deep genome sequencing in their clinical practice? Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have come a long way since 1977 when Frederick Sanger developed chain-termination sequencing, but are they ready for prime time? At the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, two key opinion leaders battled it out over this topic in a debate. The Argument for Deep Genome Sequencing Arguing the pro position, Fabrice Andre, MD, PhD, of the Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, said that embracing deep sequencing in daily clinical practice is not only the right thing to do, it is a necessity. The number of genetic biomarkers known to influence patient outcomes and care has risen dramatically in recent years and is only expected to grow, he said. \u0093The current system is not sustainable for hospitals and academic centers,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. \u0093It\u0092s not possible for [them] to run more than 10 bioassays per patient. We need to move to multiplex technology.\u0094 For breast cancer, he said, clinicians can run tests for ER/HER2, TOP2A, FGR1, IGFR1R, EGFR, PAK1, BRCA1, CYP2D6, PTEN and PI3KCA among others. With whole genome sequencing, \u0093you can assess all the genes that you want,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. \u0093When you do one test for each biomarker, each biomarker has a cost. Keep in mind that three FISH [fluorescence in situ hybridization] is equal to the same cost of one whole genome CGH [comparative genomic hybridization] array.\u0094 Whole genome sequencing also offers a number of other potential advantages. High throughput approaches can identify a large number of rare targetable gene alterations. This is increasingly important as researchers find genetic alterations that exist in 1% or 2% of patients. The technology also can capture minority clones that may be hard to identify when there is a low percentage of tumor cells in a sample. The next-generation sequencers have been proven to be accurate and they do not need large samples of tissue. Dr. Andre pointed out that some protein-based assays, which are used because they are less expensive than FISH, are not reliable. One study found that the immunohistochemistry test for the HER2 protein was accurate only 81.6% of the time (J Clin Oncol 2006;24:3032-3038, PMID: 16809727). The \u0093robust\u0094 deep sequencing technology is already being used for patient care at academic centers. One such example is the MOSCATO trial, which began in fall 2011. This trial enrolled 120 patients with difficult-to-treat cancers and is using whole genome sequencing to identify potential therapeutic targets. Once a target has been identified, patients receive targeted therapy in a clinical trial if one is available. The turnover time for sequencing is 15 days and the total cost is 1,500 euros, or roughly $2,000 per patient. The cost of technology is expected to decrease dramatically in the next few years. By the end of 2012, Oxford Nanopore Technology is expected to launch a technology that is the size of a USB drive and will offer whole genome sequencing in 15 minutes for less than $1,000. Dr. Andre argued that deep sequencing will be less expensive than a multiplicity of tests. He pointed to a case study recently described in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology as an example of a success story (2012;7:e14-e16). In the case report, a 43-year-old never smoker with lung cancer had tested negative for EML4-ALK on the approved companion genetic test for crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer). Sensing that an oncogenic genetic driver was spurring the patient\u0092s cancer, clinicians ordered deep sequencing and identified a novel ALK fusion. The patient was treated with crizotinib and was recently reported to have had a complete response. \u0093In the context of prospective cohorts, but not clinical trials, I think we need to deliver NGS in order to detect a high number of rare, relevant genomic alterations and then treatment can be done in the context of Phase I trials or drug access programs,\u0094 said Dr. Andre. The Argument Against Deep Genome Sequencing According to Kenneth O\u0092Byrne, MD, a consultant medical oncologist at St. James Hospital and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, Dr. Andre is jumping the gun. \u0093He makes the fundamental error that all people who are enthusiastic about new technologies always make and that is the non-application of evidence-based medicine,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093Deep sequencing is a fantastic tool, but it is a research toy and an expensive toy at the moment. For day-to-day practical medicine, we have to go by evidence base.\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne cast doubt on Dr. Andre\u0092s success story example. \u0093They treated the patient with crizotinib and made the false conclusion that the ALK rearrangement they detected was responsible for the response. Do we know if that patient expressed MET? Is there any other reason [he] may have responded to crizotinib?\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. He agreed that the cost of the sequencing technology was decreasing, but argued that analysis would remain expensive. He argued that the clinical benefit of identifying genetic drivers is still uncertain. \u0093I would argue that in lung cancer, and indeed in almost every other tumor, there are only a few proven genetic alterations that can be identified that actually affect the way we treat our patients in clinic,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093EGFR [epidermal growth factor receptor] mutations and ALK rearrangements are the only validated predictive biomarkers in NSCLC [non-small cell lung cancer].\u0094 He pointed out that these affect only 15% of lung cancer patients, and although there are targeted agents available, the jury is still out on whether the drugs that target these mutations improve survival. As an example of this, he pointed out that an interim analysis of the PROFILE 007 trial presented at the ESMO meeting (abstract LBA1) showed that although crizotinib increased progression-free survival by 4.7 months compared with chemotherapy, there was no difference in overall survival. \u0093If you look at all of the EGFR TKI [tyrosine kinase inhibitor] randomized controlled trials versus cytotoxic chemotherapy in EGFR mutation\u0096positive disease, there has yet to be a proven [overall] survival benefit, despite obvious clinical benefits,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. Researchers say the lack of overall survival advantage in many of these trials can be blamed on the large numbers of patients who cross over to the experimental therapy. \u0093The argument is crossover, but we don\u0092t know that yet,\u0094 he said. Dr. O\u0092Byrne urged caution, as several years ago, it was thought that tumor angiogenesis inhibitors would be the salvation of lung cancer patients and that did not happen. There was clear evidence that new blood tumor vessels were associated with poor outcome, but when researchers tested a slew of antiangiogenic TKIs in patients with lung cancer, none of them worked. These included apatinib, axitinib, cedarinib, motesanib, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetanib. \u0093There is still some promise that some of these might break through,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said, pointing to Boehringer Ingelheim\u0092s BIBF1120. \u0093But to date, we\u0092ve spent billions of euros proving that many of these are of no value. \u0093In my view, and I feel this quite strongly, predictive biomarker tests must undergo validation and quality assurance before they are used rou- tinely in clinical practice,\u0094 Dr. O\u0092Byrne said. \u0093Deep DNA sequencing holds huge promise \u0085 but it is a research tool, and I do genuinely believe that a lot of clinically irrelevant data is generated that actually confuses the clinician and the patient.\u0094 Clinical Oncology News Issue: December 2012 | Volume: 07:12",

      "Content": "Researchers have realized that cancer biology is driven by signaling pathways. Cells speak to each other and the messages they send are interpreted via intracellular pathways known as signal transduction. Many of these pathways are activated or deactivated by phosphorylations on select cellular proteins. Sequencing the genome of cancer cells is explicitly based upon the assumption that the pathways - network of genes - of tumor cells can be known in sufficient detail to control cancer. Each cancer cell can be different and the cancer cells that are present change and evolve with time. Although the theory behind inhibitor targeted therapy is appealing, the reality is more complex. Cancer cells often have many mutations in many different pathways, so even if one route is shut down by a targted treatment, the cancer cell may be able to use other routes. In other words, cancer cells have \"backup systems\" that allow them to survive. The result is that the drug does not affect the tumor as expected. The cancer state is typically characterized by a signaling process that is unregulated and in a continuous state of activation. In chemotherapy selection, molecular profiling examines a single process within the cell or a relatively small number of processes. All a gene mutation study can tell is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to a mechanism of attack. The aim is to tell if there is a theoretical predisposition to drug response. It doesn't tell you the effectiveness of one drug (or combination) or any other drug which may target this in the individual. There are many pathways to altered cellular function. Functional Profiling measures the end result of pathway activation or deactivation to predict whether patients will actually respond (clinical responders). It measures what happens at the end, rather than the status of the individual pathway, by assessing the activity of a drug (or combinations) upon combined effect of all cellular processes, using combined metabolic and morphologic endpoints, at the cell population level, measuring the interaction of the entire genome. Translational science: past, present, and future http://www.biotechniques.com/multime...49_O_3671a.pdf Note: Foundation Medicine is not any different than Caris Diagnostics in Phoenix (now Miraca Life Sciences), beyond testing for standard pathology \"targets\" such as ER, PR, Her2, EGFR mutations, KRAS, BRAF. They aren't worth much for the sorts of chemotherapy which is used in 95% of all cancers and useless with respect to drug combinations. While fresh tissue is very dear and hard to come by, function trumps structure, in terms of potency and robustness of information provided than using archival paraffin blocks.",

      "Content": "Needle biopsies assay on 33 pretherapy primaries and 17 mBCs. NGS of 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes. 117 \"potentially\" targetable driver mutations were identified (mean: 2.3 in primary tumors, 2.8 in mBCs); however, further research is needed. According to Dr. Neil Love of Research To Practice, one of several presentations at the ASCO trade show was in a variety of solid tumors on the now commercially available FoundationOne assay. This study of 50 patients with breast cancer \u0097 like similar reports in lung, prostate and colorectal cancer \u0097 documented that fine needle biopsies provided enough tissue to adequately perform the test. Even more relevant was that multiple potentially \u0093targetable\u0094 mutations were found in all these specimens. Although the authors suggest that some of these targets may correlate with benefit from approved agents (eg, crizotinib for ALK translocations), and it might be tempting to consider ordering the assay for patients who have run out of conventional options, this concept has not yet been tested. In that regard, it is worth reflecting on the wholly disappointing experience with BRAF inhibitors for patients with V600E mutation-positive colorectal cancer and appreciating that the term \u0093targetable\u0094 is highly theoretical at this point in time.

Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of genomic alterations in breast cancer potentially treatable with approved targeted agents or investigational drugs in clinical trials. NGS was performed in a CLIA setting (Foundation Medicine). Methods: DNA was extracted from needle biopsies of 33 pre-therapy primary and 17 MBCs (mean age 52 yrs; 58% ER+, 20% HER2+, 30% triple negative) obtained prospectively for biomarker discovery and preserved in RNAlater. Patients with MBC received an average of 7 drugs (range 5-17) including adjuvant therapy before biopsy for this research; 13 biopsies were from soft tissues, 3 from liver and 1 from bone. Sequencing was targeted to 3230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes often rearranged in cancer. Average median depth was >1200x. Results: All biopsies yielded sufficient DNA. NGS revealed a total of 117 known driver mutations across 36 genes (per-tumor average=2.5, range 1-6), including 37 base substitutions (32%), 28 indels (24%), 42 amplifications (36%) and 10 homozygous deletions (9%). NGS identified HER2 gene amplification in 6/7 cases scored HER2+ by FISH. The average number of functionally important alterations was surprisingly similar, 2.3 in primaries vs 2.8 in heavily treated MBCs (p=0.32). Remarkably, 25/33 (76%) of primary and 14/17 (82%) of MBCs had at least 1 genomic alteration targetable with an FDA approved drug or novel agent in clinical trials. These included: ERBB2 alterations (n=9), PIK3CA mutations [n=8], NF1 mutations (n=4, candidate for PI3K/MEK inhibitors), AKT1-3 mutations (n=5, PI3K inhibitors), BRCA1/2, (n=6, PARP inhibitors), and CCND2 (n=3)/CDKN2A (n=3) mutations (CDK inhibitors). Numerous other alterations with less apparent therapeutic implications were also observed. Conclusions: Comprehensive NGS profiling in breast cancer needle biopsies showed high frequency of genomic alterations linked to a clinical treatment option or clinical trials of targeted therapies. These results demonstrate it is feasible to use NGS to guide targeted therapy. Prospective testing of the diagnostic/predictive value of this patient selection approach is currently under way.",

      "Content": "There is the issue about cell-lines vs fresh cells. Cell-lines have always played, and continue to play, an important role in drug screening and drug development. The problem is that cell-lines do not predict for disease or patient specific drug effects. If you can kill cancer cell-lines with a given drug, it doesn\u0092t tell you anything about how the drug will work in real world, clinical cancer (real-world conditions). But you can learn certain things about general drug biology through the study of cell-lines. As a general rule, studies from established cell-lines (tumor cells that are cultured and maniplated so that they continue to divide) have proved worthless as models to predict the activity of drugs in cancer. They are more misleading than helpful. An established cell-line is not reflective of the behavior of the fresh tumor samples (live samples derived from tumors) in primary culture, much less in the patient. Established cell-lines have been a huge disappointment over the decades, with respect to their ability to correctly model the disease-specific activity of new drugs. What works in cell-lines do not often translate into human beings. You get different results when you test passaged cells compared to primary, fresh tumor. Research on cell-lines is cheap compared to clinical trials on humans. One gets more accurate information when using intact RNA isolated from \u0093fresh\u0094 tissue than from using degraded RNA, which is present in paraffin-fixed tissue. My question would be, do you want to utilize your tissue specimen for \u0093drug selection\u0094 against \u0093your\u0094 individual cancer cells or for mutation identification, to see if you are \u0093potentially\u0094 susceptible to a certain mechanism of attack?

      "Content": "(Reuters Health) - Routine genome-wide screening of cancers is likely a long way off, a new paper says. The technology, known as next-generation sequencing, promises to revolutionize doctors' understanding of cancer and underpins perhaps the biggest paradigm shift taking place in cancer research today: the growing emphasis on a cancer's genetic makeup, rather than its location within the body. Understanding the genetic makeup of an individual patient's tumor may allow physicians to pick the drug that best targets that specific tumor, as well as recognize when a tumor has developed resistance to the drug through new genetic mutations. \"Next-generation sequencing is especially promising in cancer because in a single test, one can interrogate all clinically relevant cancer genes for all types of genomic alterations, including sequence mutations and chromosomal rearrangements,\" Dr. Michael Berger, a geneticist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told Reuters Health in an email. There are several different specific screening technologies that are considered \"next-generation\" - but all share the ability to sequence entire human genomes in a matter of days. When applied to cancer, the technology is used to screen the entire genome of cancer cells. By some measures, this promise is already being realized. For example, last year The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network used genome-wide screening of breast cancer tumors to demonstrate that there are four main breast cancer types defined by differing genomic and epigenetic mutations. The study showed that individual breast cancers have many genetic differences from each other but that one subgroup of breast cancers, basal-like breast cancer, was similar genetically to serous ovarian cancer. Cancer cells present unique and complex challenges, they note. Because they are genetically so different from normal human tissue, there is not always a 'reference sequence' against which to compare the tumor DNA. There are also frequent chromosome-scale as well as epigenetic changes, and even significant genetic differences among cells within the same tumor, an issue specific to cancer cells known as tumor heterogeneity. The authors of the new paper, writing online July 25 in the British Journal of Cancer, pointed out that this complexity creates a number of problems that must be solved before next-generation sequencing is a common part of cancer care. One of the first issues is developing the algorithms that are used to map the genome. \"The computational challenges involved in analyzing and storing clinical (next-generation sequencing) data cannot be overstated,\" said Dr. Berger, who wasn't involved in the new study. \"Better algorithms must be developed to reliably and accurately detect mutations in heterogeneous tumors.\" In genome-wide sequencing, a seemingly minuscule misstep in the analysis could have massive consequences. For example, say the authors of the new paper, led by Dr. Danny Ulahannan of the Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics in Oxford, UK, \"the sheer quantity of data means that getting 0.01% of the human genome wrong would correspond to 300,000 errors scattered along the three billion base pairs.\" Dr. Lynda Chin, the chair of Genomic Medicine and scientific director of the Institute for Applied Cancer Science at MD Anderson Cancer Center, told Reuters Health this is often an overlooked problem. \"One barrier that is often overlooked or underestimated from the clinical side is the technical challenge of generating high-quality (next-generation sequencing) data,\" Dr. Chin said. \"There is a sense that generating (the data) is easy, and it is the analysis that is hard. I would disagree, as I believe that the technology is still unstable, for lack of a better word, not yet turn-key, and no matter how good the analytics-interpretation become, if the data is poor quality, the result will be poor.\" And mapping the genome is really only the first step. The next step is figuring out which mutations are relevant to the development of cancer and whether they can be targeted with a drug. \"I agree with the obvious barriers of interpretation. Not just analytically that we need improved algorithms, (but) more importantly, more knowledge and understanding of what each alteration means and how each event impact on clinical decision,\" Dr. Chin said. The advances will require a \"cultural change\" in cancer research, Dr. Chin said, that makes \"patient-oriented genomic research a standard, rather than a heroic effort by a researcher.\"",

      "Content": "Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., and Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D. N Engl J Med 2013; 369:2369-2371December 19, 2013DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1314561 Article This year marks 60 years since James Watson and Francis Crick described the structure of DNA and 10 years since the complete sequencing of the human genome. Fittingly, today the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted marketing authorization for the first high-throughput (next-generation) genomic sequencer, Illumina's MiSeqDx, which will allow the development and use of innumerable new genome-based tests. When a global team of researchers sequenced that first human genome, it took more than a decade and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Today, because of federal and private investment, sequencing technologies have advanced dramatically, and a human genome can be sequenced in about 24 hours for what is now less than $5,000. This is a rare example of technology development in which faster, cheaper, and better have coincided: as costs have plummeted and capacity has increased, the accuracy of sequencing has substantially improved. With the FDA's announcement, a platform that took nearly a decade to develop from an initial research project funded by the National Institutes of Health will be brought into use for clinical care. Clinicians can selectively look for an almost unlimited number of genetic changes that may be of medical significance. Access to these data opens the door for the transformation of research, clinical care, and patient engagement. To see how this technology could be used, consider cancer. Comprehensive analysis of the genome sequence of individual cancers has helped uncover the specific mutations that contribute to the malignant phenotype, identify new targets for therapy, and increase the opportunities for choosing the optimal treatment for each patient. For instance, lung adenocarcinoma can now be divided into subtypes with unique genomic fingerprints associated with different outcomes and different responses to particular therapies. More broadly, recent work from the Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrates that the tissue of origin of a particular cancer may be much less relevant to prognosis and response to therapy than the array of causative mutations.1 As a result, patients diagnosed with a cancer for which there are few therapeutic options may increasingly benefit from drug therapies originally aimed at other cancers that share common driver mutations. The new technology allows us go from our current approach of targeted searches for specific mutations in individual cancers to widespread use of approaches that survey the entire genome. A major area of opportunity that has yet to be fully exploited is pharmacogenomics \u0097 the use of genomic information to identify the right drug at the right dose for each patient. More than 120 FDA-approved drugs have pharmacogenomics information in their labeling, providing important details about differences in response to the drug and, in some cases, recommending genetic testing before prescribing.2 But the full potential of pharmacogenomics is largely unrealized, because of the logistic challenges in obtaining suitable genomic information in a timely enough fashion to guide prescribing. Placing genomic information in the electronic medical record would facilitate this kind of personalized medicine. If the patient's entire genome were part of his or her medical record, then the complexities of acquiring a DNA sample, shipping it, and performing laboratory work would be replaced by a quick electronic query. Although this scenario holds great promise, the utility of genomic information for drug prescribing must be documented with rigorous evidence. For example, three recently published clinical trials raise questions about the clinical utility of using pharmacogenetic information in the initial dosing of vitamin K anatagonists.3 The FDA based its decision to grant marketing authorization for the Illumina instrument platform and reagents on their demonstrated accuracy across numerous genomic segments, spanning 19 human chromosomes. Precision and reproducibility across instruments, users, days, and reagent lots were also demonstrated. The marketing authorization of a sequencing platform for clinical use will probably expand the incorporation of genetic information into health care. But even the most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed. Already, key policy advances have helped smooth the way and address many of the public's concerns about the potential misuse of genetic information.4 For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibit health insurers from considering genetic information as a preexisting condition, as material to underwriting, or as the basis for denying coverage. GINA also protects against use of genetic information by employers. These protections do not, however, extend to the disease manifestations of genetic risks. Although genomic information showing a predisposition to cancer would be protected under GINA, other clinical signs or symptoms indicative of cancer are not protected. Provisions of the Affordable Care Act set to go into effect in 2014 go a step further and will preclude consideration of all preexisting conditions, whether genomic or not, in establishing insurance premiums. Current federal laws, however, do not restrict the use of genomic information in life insurance, long-term care insurance, or disability insurance. The legal landscape for the use of genomics in personalized medicine grew brighter in June of this year when the Supreme Court ruled (in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics) that isolated naturally occurring DNA cannot be patented. This decision was a breakthrough for access to individual genetic tests but also, even more important, for the integration of genome sequencing into clinical care. Before the Myriad decision, there were substantial concerns that in order to offer whole genome sequencing, clinical laboratories would have to pay royalties to a long list of gene patent holders. The decision has opened the creative doors to an as yet unimaginable set of products that may benefit the public health. The FDA has also been active in addressing other regulatory issues surrounding personalized medicine.5 Along with authorizing the Illumina technology for marketing, the FDA recognized the need for reference materials and methods that would permit performance assessment. As a result, the FDA collaborated with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop reference materials consisting of whole human genome DNA, together with the best possible sequence interpretation of such genomes. The first human genome reference materials are expected to be available for public use in the next 12 months. This marketing authorization of a non\u0096disease-specific platform will allow any lab to test any sequence for any purpose. Thus, putting in place an appropriate risk-based regulatory framework is now critical to ensure the validation and quality of tests (called laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs) developed in-house by clinical laboratories. The marketing authorization for the first next-generation genome sequencer represents a significant step forward in the ability to generate genomic information that will ultimately improve patient care. Yet it is only one step. There are many challenges ahead before personalized medicine can be considered truly embedded in health care. We need to continue to uncover variants within the genome that can be used to predict disease onset, affect progression, and modulate drug response. New genomic findings need to be validated before they can be integrated into medical decision making. Doctors and other health care professionals will need support in interpreting genomic data and their meaning for individual patients. Patients will want to be able to talk about their genetic information with their doctor. With the right information and support, patients will be able to participate alongside their doctors in making more informed decisions. Reimbursement issues need to be resolved to assure that patients have access to the best tests and that manufacturers have incentives to develop them. The arrival of next-generation sequencing at this regulatory landmark is only the beginning. We need to work together to ensure that research progresses, that regulatory policies are developed, that patients' rights and needs are addressed, and that clinical use of genomic information is based on rigorous evidence.

      "Content": "Tailoring Targeted Therapy To The Cancer Targeted therapies are typically not very effective when used singularly or even in combination with conventional chemotherapies. The targets of many of these drugs are so narrow that cancer cells are likely to eventually find ways to bypass them. Durable responses are rare and no one with advanced cancer has yet to be cured with targeted therapy. Physicians may have to combine several targeted treatments to try an achieve cures or durable responses. So, some clinical studies are trying to delineate the benefit achieved when combining two innovative targeted treatments together. However, these targeted therapies produce limited results because they can help a relatively small subgroup of cancer patients, and tests to pinpoint those patients are desperately needed. The trick is figuring out which patients will respond. The challenge is to figure out which patients to give them to. There is a targeted assay to match targeted cancer therapies to those cancer patients. The targeted assay uses \"whole cell profiling\" which is a variety of metabolic (cell metabolism) and morphologic (structure) measurements to determine if a specific drug is successful at killing the patient's cancer cells. Whole cell profiling measures genes before and after drug exposure. It makes the statistically significant association between prospectively reported test results and patient survival. And it is the only cell-death endpoint assay system in which drug effect upon cancer cells is visualized directly. Photomicrographs of actual tumor cells show the condition of cells as they are received and enriched in the lab, and also the conditions of control cells post-culture. In this visualization, the microscopic slides sometime show that the exact same identical individual culture well, shows some clusters have taken up vast amounts of the molecular drug, while right next door, clusters of the same size, same appearance, same everything haven't taken up any of the drug. It doesn't matter though if there is a target molecule (protein or receptor) in the cell that the targeted drug is going after. If the drug either won't \"get in\" in the first place or if it gets pumped out/extruded or if it gets immediately metabolized inside the cell, drug resistance is multifactorial. The one advantage of whole cell profiling is that it can show this at the cell \"population\" level, measuring the interaction of the entire genome. This could help solve the problem of knowing which patients can benefit from these molecular drugs. Afterall, these \"smart\" drugs do not work for everyone, and a test to determine the efficacy of these drugs in a patient could be the first crucial step in personalizing treatment to the individual.

      "Content": "Discussion? Sounded more like a personal tirade on your part than a discussion. It would be \"legitimate\" to discuss the subject instead of personally attacking someone you do not know enough about to make all your accusations. If you are an example of decorum from some doctors, no wonder some are having a harder time. You seemed to have a hang-up about \"what is\" and \"what is not?\" By your standard, if someone doesn't read medical journals, you accuse them of having unscientific conclusions. If someone does read medical journals, you accuse them of knowing everything. Which is it? Why all the hostility? Chill out! I do not want to make this thread any more personal than I have already, but I've been personally attacked and I have to defend myself. Her-2/neu testing is not available in every laboratory. Both IHC and FISH require experience and special training to perform and interpret. However, according to the College of American Pathologists, results demonstrate that there is poor agreement between the results from local laboratory-based HER2 testing and those of central testing by experienced investigators, in terms of both HER2 protein expression and gene amplification. Even more unexpected, there was poor agreement in terms of FISH testing in a central laboratory compared to the local laboratories. This later fact comes as a surprise because the prevalent notion regarding FISH was that it was 100 percent accurate. There are some real technical difficulties involved in FISH analysis. This was a wake-up call about how HER2 assays performed in the real world. Community laboratories don?t have the same performance when compared to commercial reference laboratories. Therefore, it is important to find out who is doing the HER2 testing. To get a good deal of evidence, a lab has to read a lot of them and the only way to do that is to be in a commercial laboratory. I've often wondered if the underlying science of Herceptin is sound? Her2 just happens to be one molecule which has been implicated in the process but there may be more. If it were the only protein involved, then one would expect that Her2 expression would correlate with Herceptin activity 100% of the time but it actually does so only about 20% of the time. Monoclonal antibodies, which are usually water soluble and large, target extracellular (outside) components of these pathways. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors can enter cells, thereby blocking receptor signaling and interfering with downstream intracellular molecules. Many of these drugs cry out for validated clinical biomarkers to help set dosage and select people likely to respond. And optimal and reproducible Her2 testing continues to evade the diagnositcs of the disease. Numerous other genes, tumor, and patient factors contribute to the risk of the cancer coming back and the effectiveness of chemotherapy for breast cancer. It could be vastly more beneficial to measure the net effect of all processes (systems) instead of just individual molecular targets. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins, and other cellular constituents that produce functions. One needs to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not just one or a few targets (pathways/mechanisms). What would be more beneficial is to test those pharmacodynamic endpoints with the ability to measure multiple parameters in cellular screens now in hand using flow cytometry. Using a systems biology approach where compounds are first screened in cell-based assays, with mechanistic understanding of the target coming only after validation of its impact on the biology. Unlike a test for the presence of receptors to a specific antigen, which only \"implies\" dependence upon that antigen, a functional assay actually assesses the direct or indirect effect of the drug upon the whole cell, whether it is a tumor cell or an endothelial cell. A \"functional\" assay doesn't just focus on Her2 or any one protein or mechanism. Whether it's Her2 alone (unlikely) or in combination with other proteins and other mechanical factors, the assay works by assessing the net effect of all those factors. There are many pathways/mechanisms to the altered cellular (forest) function, hence all the different \"trees\" which correlate in different situations. Improvement can be made by measuring what happens at the end (the effects on the forest), rather than the status of the individual trees.",

      "Content": "LF I wouldn't consider 74% as being close to 100%. You may be referring to clinical trials that suggest FISH testing more accurately determines HER2 status than conventional IHC testing. Intra-laboratory agreements for virtually all types of analogous laboratory tests is nowhere near perfect, but HER2/neu testing has been found to have about a 25% rate of disagreement between laboratories. All peer reviewed published studies have shown there to be a strong correlation between laboratory results and clinical outcome, however, such studies have been specifically excluded from comprehensive reviews published a year ago in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Unless you can supply those excluded studies, I feel your accusations are moot. The problem with Herceptin is the tendency to use it in the adjuvant setting. Herceptin has been in use for only a few years. We don't know what will happen ten or twenty or thirty years from now in women who didn't need any adjuvant therapy at all, who would have been cured by surgery alone. Only a minority of patients who receive adjuvant therapy benefit from it. Adjuvant therapy is worth it if the women have to suffer only short term, temporary toxicity and if it even slightly reduces the probability that their cancer will come back. But if it produces permanent toxicity, whether chemo brain, heart muscle damage, or even further metastasis, then that is a whole different order of magnitude in terms of risk.",

      "Content": "Direct anti-tumor and anti-vascular effects were studied of Tykerb, Nexavar and Avastin in fresh biopsy specimens of breast cancer and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Symposium on September 5, 2008. While the other clinically-available 'nib' drugs have been shown to have anti-vascular activity, anti-vascular activity of Tykerb has not been previously reported. Angiogenesis studies are limited by the clinical relevance of laboratory model systems. They don't do \"real world\" studies under \"real world\" conditions. Patient outcomes need to be reported in real-time, so patients and cancer physicians can learn immediately if and how patients are benefiting from new drug therapies. Cell culture detection of microvascular cell death in clinical specimens of human neoplasms and peripheral blood can identify the activity of both single drugs and combinations of drugs at the level of individual patients with individual cancers. It works by measuring drug effects (real-time) upon endothelial cells which make up blood vessels. Drugs like Avastin had striking anti-microvascular effects but minimal anti-tumor effects. Tarceva and Gleevec had mixed antitumor and anti-microvascular effects. Anti-microvascular effects of Tarceva and Iressa were equal to those of Sutent and Nexavar. Anti-microvascular additivity was observed between Avastin and other drugs on an individual basis. Conclusions of the study had shown that Tykerb has antivascular activity superior to that of Nexavar. Avastin + Tykerb may be the first clinically-exploitable antivascular drug combination. High dose, intermittent 'bolus' schedules of Tykerb to coincide with Avastin administration may be clinically advantageous, even in HER2-negative tumors. The system utilized for the study was a functional profiling assay, which may be used to individualize antivascular therapy. It can be adapted for simple, inexpensive and sensitive/specific detection of tissue and circulating microvascular cells in a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, for drug development, and individualized cancer treatment. It can accurately sort drugs into categories of above average probability of providing clinical benefit on one hand and below average probability of providing clinical benefit on the other hand, based both on tumor response and patient survival. http://www.weisenthal.org/Weisenthal_ASCO.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/1...8.01955.x/full",

      "Content": "Needle biopsies assay on 33 pretherapy primaries and 17 mBCs. NGS of 3,230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes. 117 \"potentially\" targetable driver mutations were identified (mean: 2.3 in primary tumors, 2.8 in mBCs); however, further research is needed. According to Dr. Neil Love of Research To Practice, one of several presentations at the ASCO trade show was in a variety of solid tumors on the now commercially available FoundationOne assay. This study of 50 patients with breast cancer \u0097 like similar reports in lung, prostate and colorectal cancer \u0097 documented that fine needle biopsies provided enough tissue to adequately perform the test. Even more relevant was that multiple potentially \u0093targetable\u0094 mutations were found in all these specimens. Although the authors suggest that some of these targets may correlate with benefit from approved agents (eg, crizotinib for ALK translocations), and it might be tempting to consider ordering the assay for patients who have run out of conventional options, this concept has not yet been tested. In that regard, it is worth reflecting on the wholly disappointing experience with BRAF inhibitors for patients with V600E mutation-positive colorectal cancer and appreciating that the term \u0093targetable\u0094 is highly theoretical at this point in time. Use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect high frequency of targetable alterations in primary and metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of genomic alterations in breast cancer potentially treatable with approved targeted agents or investigational drugs in clinical trials. NGS was performed in a CLIA setting (Foundation Medicine). Methods: DNA was extracted from needle biopsies of 33 pre-therapy primary and 17 MBCs (mean age 52 yrs; 58% ER+, 20% HER2+, 30% triple negative) obtained prospectively for biomarker discovery and preserved in RNAlater. Patients with MBC received an average of 7 drugs (range 5-17) including adjuvant therapy before biopsy for this research; 13 biopsies were from soft tissues, 3 from liver and 1 from bone. Sequencing was targeted to 3230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes and 37 introns in 14 genes often rearranged in cancer. Average median depth was >1200x. Results: All biopsies yielded sufficient DNA. NGS revealed a total of 117 known driver mutations across 36 genes (per-tumor average=2.5, range 1-6), including 37 base substitutions (32%), 28 indels (24%), 42 amplifications (36%) and 10 homozygous deletions (9%). NGS identified HER2 gene amplification in 6/7 cases scored HER2+ by FISH. The average number of functionally important alterations was surprisingly similar, 2.3 in primaries vs 2.8 in heavily treated MBCs (p=0.32). Remarkably, 25/33 (76%) of primary and 14/17 (82%) of MBCs had at least 1 genomic alteration targetable with an FDA approved drug or novel agent in clinical trials. These included: ERBB2 alterations (n=9), PIK3CA mutations [n=8], NF1 mutations (n=4, candidate for PI3K/MEK inhibitors), AKT1-3 mutations (n=5, PI3K inhibitors), BRCA1/2, (n=6, PARP inhibitors), and CCND2 (n=3)/CDKN2A (n=3) mutations (CDK inhibitors). Numerous other alterations with less apparent therapeutic implications were also observed. Conclusions: Comprehensive NGS profiling in breast cancer needle biopsies showed high frequency of genomic alterations linked to a clinical treatment option or clinical trials of targeted therapies. These results demonstrate it is feasible to use NGS to guide targeted therapy. Prospective testing of the diagnostic/predictive value of this patient selection approach is currently under way.",

      "Content": "There is the issue about cell-lines vs fresh cells. Cell-lines have always played, and continue to play, an important role in drug screening and drug development. The problem is that cell-lines do not predict for disease or patient specific drug effects. If you can kill cancer cell-lines with a given drug, it doesn\u0092t tell you anything about how the drug will work in real world, clinical cancer (real-world conditions). But you can learn certain things about general drug biology through the study of cell-lines. As a general rule, studies from established cell-lines (tumor cells that are cultured and maniplated so that they continue to divide) have proved worthless as models to predict the activity of drugs in cancer. They are more misleading than helpful. An established cell-line is not reflective of the behavior of the fresh tumor samples (live samples derived from tumors) in primary culture, much less in the patient. Established cell-lines have been a huge disappointment over the decades, with respect to their ability to correctly model the disease-specific activity of new drugs. What works in cell-lines do not often translate into human beings. You get different results when you test passaged cells compared to primary, fresh tumor. Research on cell-lines is cheap compared to clinical trials on humans. One gets more accurate information when using intact RNA isolated from \u0093fresh\u0094 tissue than from using degraded RNA, which is present in paraffin-fixed tissue. My question would be, do you want to utilize your tissue specimen for \u0093drug selection\u0094 against \u0093your\u0094 individual cancer cells or for mutation identification, to see if you are \u0093potentially\u0094 susceptible to a certain mechanism of attack?

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. During the 1960s, 70s and into the 90s, a field of investigation arose that examined buyer\u0092s practices when it came to the consumption of goods and services. Algorithms were developed to interrogate consumer choice. One such treatise was reported in 1994 (Carson, RT et al, Experimental Analysis of Choice, Marketing Letters 1994). What these researchers explored were the motivations and forces that drove consumption. When choices are offered, decisions are driven by such factors as complexity and utility. Complexity demands personal expertise or failing that, input from experts, while utility places a value on the good or service. A recent report from a small biotechnology company called Foundation Medicine has brought this field of endeavor to mind. It seems that this group will be offering DNA sequencing to select chemotherapy drugs. This service, currently priced at $5,800, will focus upon a small cassette of genes that they described as \u0093key\u0094 in tumor growth. Based on their technology they have already raised $33.5 million from the likes of Third Rock, Google and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, venture capital sources. The CEO of Foundation substantiates the approach by pointing out that fully 150 people have already used their services. One hundred and fifty! It seems from this report that our colleagues in the field of molecular profiling have studied the dictates of \u0093Experimental Analysis of Choice\u0094 to a \u0093T.\u0094 What we have is the perfect storm of medical marketing. First, the technology is so complex as to be beyond the ken of both patients and physicians alike. Thus, expertise is required and that expertise is provided by those engaged in the field. Second, the utility of drug selection is beyond reproach. Who in their right mind wouldn\u0092t want to receive a drug with a higher likelihood of a response when we consider the toxicities and costs, as well as the consequences of the wrong treatment? Dazzled by the prospect of curative outcomes, patients will, no doubt, be lining up around the block. But, let\u0092s deconstruct what this report is actually telling us. First, a scientifically interesting technology has been brought to the market. Second, it exists to meet an unmet need. So far, so good. What is lacking, however, is evidence. Not necessarily evidence in the rarefied Cochrane sense of idealized survival curves, nor even Level II evidence, but any evidence at all. Like whirling dervishes, patients and their physicians are drawn into a trancelike state, when terms like NextGen sequencing, SNP analysis and splice variants are bandied about. Despite the enthusiastic reception by investors, I fear a lack of competent due diligence. To wit, a recent article in Biotechniques, \u0093Will the Real Cancer Cell Please Stand Up,\u0094 comes to mind. It seems that cancer cells are not individual entities but networks. A harmonic oscillation develops between tumor, stroma, vasculature and cytokines. In this mix, the cancer cell is but one piece of the puzzle. Indeed, according to recent work from Baylor, some of the tumor promotion signals in the form of small interfering RNAs, may arise not from the cancer cells, but instead from the surrounding stroma. How then, will even the most punctiliously perfect genomic analyses of a cancer cells play out in the real world of human tumor biology and clinical response prediction? Not very well I fear. But then again such a discussion would require data on the predictive validity of the method, something that appears to be sorely lacking. Will today\u0092s gene profile companies prove to be the biotech Facebook IPOs of tomorrow?",

      "Content": "A study from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute identified central nervous system (CNS) metastases in women who receive trastuzumab-based (Herceptin) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Central nervous system disease is defined as one or more brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (carcinomatous meningitis). Central nervous system metastases was identified in 34% of patients at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and 6 months from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease frequently developd brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin. The authors of the study say that efforts to characterize other risk factors for development of CNS disease, optimal screening algorithms, and new treatment strategies may be warranted. (Cancer 2003 Jun 15;97(12):2972-7) The potential benefits and risks of Herceptin have renewed concerns about the reliability of HER2 testing. Some studies have shown that the test produces false positives as often as 26% of the time, and may also carry some risk of false negatives. Herceptin also doesn't offer any benefit to women with HER2-negative cancer.",

      "Content": "The needed change in the \"war on cancer\" will not be on the types of drugs being developed, but on the understanding of the drugs we have. There are already over 100 different therapeutic drug regimens out there, and 400 are in the pipeline. Any one or combination of them can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and under loaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. There are many cancer drug regimens, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. Tumors grow and spread in different ways and their response to treatment depends on these unique characteristics. The amount of chemotherapy that each patient can tolerate varies considerably from patient to patient. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. Under this approach, scientists study how an individual's cancerous cells respond to drugs. Doctors have learned that even when the disease is the same type, different patients' tumors respond differently to chemotherapeutic drugs. More and more physicians and patients are turning to \"individualized therapies\" to treat cancers, not just \"targeted therapies.\" Without individualized testing, it's difficult to determine which drugs are best for patients who don't respond to standard therapies. Herceptin is only for the estimated 20% of breast cancer women at risk for recurrence. However, Gene Expression Assays are panels of markers that can predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence in various populations. By testing the gene expression markers of a patient, oncologists can identify those patients unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy from those that would, saving the other 80% of cancer patients the added expense, suffering and even death from having to take chemotherapy. What a cancer patient would like ideally, is to know whether they would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. If so, which active drugs have the highest probability of working, which Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Resistance Assays can test for drug activity against a tumor, and what drugs are relatively non-toxic in a given patient , which Pharmacogenomic Testing can identify. Whether a patient would benefit from adjuvant therapy depends on two things: (1) whether the tumor is \"destined\" to come back in the first place and (2) whether the tumor is sensitive to drugs which might be used to keep it from coming back. The gene expression markers (assays) actually can be calibrated to provide information both about the possibility of recurrence and also chemosensitivity. The problem is dissecting one from the other. Studies to date have just looked at whether people had a recurrence. You can identify gene expression patterns (via assays) which correlate with this. But it can be hard and even impossible to tell what exactly you are measuring: is it intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor? sensitivity to adriamycin? sensitivity to cyclophosphamide? sensitivity to taxol? sensitivity to tamoxifen? You find a gene expression panel which correlates with something, but picking apart the pieces is hard. You can begin to do this if you combine gene expression studies with cell culture studies. Use the cell culture as the gold standard to define the difference between sensitivity and resistance. Then see which pattern correlates with which for individual tumors and individual drugs. It can theoretically be done (and certainly will be done, over time), but it's not easy. And then you come to the 1,000 pound gorilla of a question: What effect will the different individual drugs have in combination in different, individual tumors? This is where cell culture assays will always be able to provide uniquely valuable information. But it's not one versus the other. The best thing is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. One month's worth of herceptin + avastin costs $8000. That's without any docetaxel and blood cell growth factors and anti-emetics. If nothing else, we can't afford too much trial and error treatment.

      "Content": "According to Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical and laboratory director at Rational Therapeutics, Inc., in Long Beach, California, and an instructor of Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, modern cancer research can be divided into three principal disciplines based upon methodology: 1. Genomic - the analysis of DNA sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), amplifications and mutations to develop prognostic and, to a limited degree, predictive information on cancer patient outcome. 2. Proteomic - the study of proteins, largely at the level of phosphoprotein expressions. 3. Functional - the study of human tumor explants isolated from patients to examine the effects of growth factor withdrawal, signal transduction inhibition and cytotoxic insult on cancer cell viability. Contrary to analyte-based genomic and proteomic methodologies that yield static measures of gene or protein expression, functional profiling provides a window on the complexity of cellular biology in real-time, gauging tumor cell response to chemotherapies in a laboratory platform. By examining drug induced cell death, functional analyses measure the cumulative result of all of a cell's mechanisms of resistance and response acting in concert. Thus, functional profiling most closely approximates the cancer phenotype. Insights gained can determine which drugs, signal transduction inhibitors, or growth factor inhibitors induce programmed cell death in individual patients' tumors. Functional profiling is the most clinically validated technique available today to predict patient response to drugs and targeted agents. Epigentics may have important implications for the treatment of cancer. The cell-based functional profiling platform has the capacity to measure genetic and epigenetic events as a functional, real-time adjunct to static genomic and proteomic platforms. By examining small clusters of cancer cells (microspheroids or microclusters) in their native state, it can provide a snapshot of the response of tumor cells to drugs, combinations and targeted therapies. The proteomic platform does not clarify how the response to targeted drugs compares with that to chemotherapy, combinations, or other targeted therapies. There is a challenge to identify which patients the targeted treatment will be effective. The analysis is unique in that each microspheroid examined contains all the complex elements of tumor biosystems found in the human body and have a major impact on clinical response. Cell function analysis is a conduit that connects novel drugs to clinicians and patients in need. There are any number of variables that affect drugs, including the rate of excretion of the drugs by the kidneys and liver, protein binding and a myriad of other biological factors. In the body, these cells interact with and are supported by other living cells, both malignant and non-malignant cells. That is why cell-death functional profiling assays study cancer cells in microspheroids or microclusters. Three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture methods have an invaluable role in tumor biology and provides very important insights into cancer biology. As well as increasing our understanding of homeostasis, cellular differentiation and tissue organization, they provide a well defined environment for cancer research in contrast to the complex host environment of an in vivo model. Due to their enormous potential, 3D tumor cultures are currently being exploited by many branches of biomedical science with therapeutically orientated studies becoming the major focus of research. Recent advances in 3D culture and tissue engineering techniques have enabled the development of more complex heterologous 3D tumor models.

      "Content": "Multigene predictors of patient response to chemotherapy derived from breast cancer cell lines combining knowledge-based and data-driven methods Nan Song, Shara Rice, Dave Gingrich, Dakun Wang, Chunqiao Tian, Zhenyu Ding, Stacey Brower, Paul Ervin, Shuguang Huang, Mike Gabrin, Kui Shen Precision Therapeutics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA Background: Responses of breast cancer patients to chemotherapy treatments vary considerably, and population treatment response rates remain low. To improve patient outcomes, genomic profiles have been used to identify patients who would benefit from specific treatments. Several studies have used cancer cell lines to develop pharmacogenomic predictors by identifying genes associated with drug response. However, pharmacogenomic predictors derived by this data-driven approach may not readily elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with drug responses, because the identified predictors by computational methods may not directly associate with drug responses considering the complex genetic regulatory network. To overcome this issue, we proposed a strategy to integrate data-driven methods with biological knowledge- based approaches to identify genomic predictors. We then applied this approach to breast cancer cell lines to identify genomic predictors of paclitaxel-5-ﬂuorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (TFAC) from breast cancer cell lines, the identified predictors are then evaluated by their ability to predict the clinical outcome of the breast cancer patients who are treated by TFAC. Material: Thirty immortalized breast cancer cell lines were exposed to various concentrations of TFAC using a chemosensitivity assay. Area under the dose-response curves was calculated to measure chemoresponses. Gene expression profiles of the 30 cell lines, the expression profiles as well as the pathologic complete response (pCR) information of 133 breast cancer patients treated by TFAC were publicly available. Methods: We performed pathway enrichment analysis in breast cancer cell lines to assess the association between drug response and curated gene sets predefined by molecular signature database. Pathways with p-value less than 0.01 were considered enriched. The genes from the enriched pathways whose expression values were highly correlated with drug sensitivity were selected as the pharmacogenomic predictors. To validate these predictors, the performances of their prediction for patients\u0092 pCR were evaluated using principle component regression method. Results: Using pathway enrichment analysis, 17 pathways were identified to be related to TFAC drug response. These pathways are related to different biological functions, including breast cancer ER status and BRCA type, immune response, differentiation, and drug response. Using supervised principal component regression, 59 genes involved in at least one of these 17 pathways were selected as genomic predictors. The prediction accuracy of patient pCR was 0.70, sensitivity was 0.71, and specificity was 0.70. Conclusion: By combining knowledge-based and data-driven methods, we have identified 59 genes from breast cancer cell lines as pharmacogenomic predictors of drug response to TFAC. These results support the viability of using breast cancer cell lines to predict breast cancer patient response to chemotherapy. Further functional study of these pharmacogenomic predictors will extend our understanding of individual drug response and facilitate personalized treatment.",

      "Content": "Precision Therapeutics Announces New Tumor Profiling Product To Augment Utility Of ChemoFx And Further Personalize Cancer Treatment Precision Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the launch of a new product line, BioSpeciFx, will help further the personalization of cancer treatments. BioSpeciFx is composed of carefully selected sets of well validated and clinically useful biomarker tests that identify critical molecular targets within a patient's cell. By using the information generated by BioSpeciFx in combination with Precision's sophisticated drug response marker ChemoFx, physicians may gain a more complete understanding of a patient's tumor. When combined, both products offer a complementary sum of information which will enable physicians to look at both the relevant molecular targets as well as the synergistic activity of drug combinations on the entire cell. BioSpeciFx provides proteomic and genomic information, while ChemoFx takes into account all of the functional characteristics of a tumor including those not captured by biomarker testing, providing both sensitivity and resistance information. \"The Comprehensive Tumor Profile developed by Precision presents the most complete offering available to cancer patients today, because it integrates both genomic and proteomic information with the functional profiling of ChemoFx,\" says Sean McDonald, CEO of Precision Therapeutics. \"We are very excited to provide physicians with a closer look at each patient's tumor as we continue to develop products aimed at personalizing treatments for cancer patients.\" Source: Precision Therapeutics Precision Therapeutics is using ChemoFx as a complement to BioSpeciFx. They run ChemoFx on a population of tumors (i.e. breast cancer). They identify the responsive, intermediately responsive, and non-responsive patients. Then they take the molecular markers and find out what these patients have in common with respect to 150 different genes. Then they work on eliminating the genes that are irrelevant. What they get is a multi-gene predictor. It can't work without ChemoFx working. They claim their MGP for breast cancer is accurate 85% of the time according to MD Anderson and US Oncology. Each drug has it's own signature, but couldn't happen if ChemoFx wasn't accurate. ChemoFx is the backbone of MGP. The oncologist can pick and choose which markers he/she wants to see.",

      "Content": "According to Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical and laboratory director at Rational Therapeutics, Inc., in Long Beach, California, and an instructor of Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, modern cancer research can be divided into three principal disciplines based upon methodology: 1. Genomic - the analysis of DNA sequences, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), amplifications and mutations to develop prognostic and, to a limited degree, predictive information on cancer patient outcome. 2. Proteomic - the study of proteins, largely at the level of phosphoprotein expressions. 3. Functional - the study of human tumor explants isolated from patients to examine the effects of growth factor withdrawal, signal transduction inhibition and cytotoxic insult on cancer cell viability. Contrary to analyte-based genomic and proteomic methodologies that yield static measures of gene or protein expression, functional profiling provides a window on the complexity of cellular biology in real-time, gauging tumor cell response to chemotherapies in a laboratory platform. By examining drug induced cell death, functional analyses measure the cumulative result of all of a cell's mechanisms of resistance and response acting in concert. Thus, functional profiling most closely approximates the cancer phenotype. Insights gained can determine which drugs, signal transduction inhibitors, or growth factor inhibitors induce programmed cell death in individual patients' tumors. Functional profiling is the most clinically validated technique available today to predict patient response to drugs and targeted agents. Epigentics may have important implications for the treatment of cancer. The cell-based functional profiling platform has the capacity to measure genetic and epigenetic events as a functional, real-time adjunct to static genomic and proteomic platforms. By examining small clusters of cancer cells (microspheroids or microclusters) in their native state, it can provide a snapshot of the response of tumor cells to drugs, combinations and targeted therapies. The proteomic platform does not clarify how the response to targeted drugs compares with that to chemotherapy, combinations, or other targeted therapies. There is a challenge to identify which patients the targeted treatment will be effective. The analysis is unique in that each microspheroid examined contains all the complex elements of tumor biosystems found in the human body and have a major impact on clinical response. Cell function analysis is a conduit that connects novel drugs to clinicians and patients in need. There are any number of variables that affect drugs, including the rate of excretion of the drugs by the kidneys and liver, protein binding and a myriad of other biological factors. In the body, these cells interact with and are supported by other living cells, both malignant and non-malignant cells. That is why cell-death functional profiling assays study cancer cells in microspheroids or microclusters. Three-dimensional (3D) tissue culture methods have an invaluable role in tumor biology and provides very important insights into cancer biology. As well as increasing our understanding of homeostasis, cellular differentiation and tissue organization, they provide a well defined environment for cancer research in contrast to the complex host environment of an in vivo model. Due to their enormous potential, 3D tumor cultures are currently being exploited by many branches of biomedical science with therapeutically orientated studies becoming the major focus of research. Recent advances in 3D culture and tissue engineering techniques have enabled the development of more complex heterologous 3D tumor models.

      "Content": "All women in the BEATRICE trial with triple negative early breast cancer received chemotherapy. One half were also given Avastin (bevacizumab). There was no difference in outcome with or without Avastin. According to Dr. Silvana Martino, though there was much excitement with this drug when it was first available and initial preliminary results were positive, two studies further confirm that in breast cancer Avastin adds little benefit yet adds toxicity. Avastin (bevacizumab) has failed to show substantial efficacy in yet another breast cancer setting, according to a Spanish\u0096German study presented here at the 35th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). This time, bevacizumab was added to either letrozole (Femara, Novartis) or fulvestrant (Faslodex, AstraZeneca) as first-line treatment for advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer. But the combination therapy failed to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival compared with endocrine monotherapy, according to Miguel Martin, MD, who presented the results on behalf of investigators from the Letrozole/Fulvestrant and Avastin (LEA) trial. Dr. Martin is from the Instituto de Investigacion Gregorio Marañón in Madrid, Spain, and is a member of the Spanish Group for Breast Cancer Research (GEICAM). The study was cosponsored by the German Breast Group. The first efficacy results from the study show that progression-free survival was better with the combination of bevacizumab plus endocrine therapy than with endocrine monotherapy (18.4 vs 13.8 months; P = .14). This translated into a nonsignificant hazard ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.65 - 1.06). There were 131 progression-free survival events in the combination group and 117 in the monotherapy group over the 4-year study period. The difference in progression-free survival of 4.6 months resulted in a 17% reduction in time to progression, which fell short of the goal of a 31% reduction, said Dr. Martin. Adding bevacizumab to endocrine therapy did not improve median overall survival, which was 41 months for the 191 women receiving combination therapy and 42 months for the 189 women receiving monotherapy (P = .469). However, the addition of bevacizumab to endocrine therapy resulted in significantly more hematologic and nonhematologic adverse events. The trial was designed to test the hypothesis that antivascular endothelial growth-factor (VEGF) treatment can delay resistance to endocrine therapy in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer, Dr. Martin said. He explained the origin of the hypothesis. Preclinical and retrospective clinical data have suggested that high VEGF levels in tumor tissue from breast cancer are associated with a decreased response to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, early clinical data suggest that the downregulation of VEGF can overcome resistance to hormonal therapy and improve efficacy. Neither trial of bevacizumab presented here at SABCS showed statistically significant benefits in new settings. The absence of a robust positive effect in the LEA trial and the BEATRICE trial (of women with triple-negative disease) had one expert doubting the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibition in breast cancer. \"It makes me wonder if there is a role for angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab in breast cancer,\" Kent Osborne, MD, from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, told Medscape Medical News. He is one of the codirectors of the symposium. The collective data on bevacizumab suggest that the drug will have a \"very limited role, if any\" in breast cancer, he told reporters at a meeting press conference. More Toxicity With Bevacizumab Participants in the LEA trial were postmenopausal and had histologically confirmed inoperable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The women had estrogen- and/or progesterone-positive cancers that were also HER2-negative. About half of both groups had received previous adjuvant endocrine therapy, and about half had received previous chemotherapy. A small minority of women had locally advanced disease (about 3%); most had metastatic disease (about 80%). About 15% had advanced disease that was not precisely determined. About two thirds of the women had multiple metastatic sites. In the LEA trial, about 90% of the women received letrozole 2.5 mg/day and about 10% received intramuscular fulvestrant 250 mg every 28 days. The dose of bevacizumab was 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. In terms of hematologic toxicities (all grades), there was more neutropenia (11.2% vs 5.7%; P = .061) in the combination group than in the monotherapy group, more leukopenia (24.6% vs 11.4%; P = .001), and more thrombocytopenia (19.3% vs 9.1%; P = .006). In terms of nonhematologic toxicities (all grades), there was more fatigue (50.5% vs 29%; P < .001) in the combination group than in the monotherapy group, more hypertension (59% vs 15.9%; P < .001), more hemorrhage (18.6% vs 1.7%; P < .001), more elevated liver enzymes (46.5% vs 28%; P < .001), and more proteinuria (30.3% vs 2.8%; P < .001).

      "Content": "Results of using the CellSearch System indicate that monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTC's) can contribute to the understanding of tumor-blood interactions and may provide a valuable tool for therapy monitoring in solid tumors like breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. With cells being alive in circulation, it may mean that a patient would need additional treatment. These ciculating tumor cells can detach from solid tumors and enter the blood stream, thus beginning the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, circulating tumor cells travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ (like the lungs, bones, liver, adrenals and even the brain). Immunicon's founder/scientist (immunologist) Paul Liberti's Immunicon team developed all the technology to help researchers and oncologists monitor CTC's. Immunicon licensed their technology to Johnson & Johnson who formed a new unit called Veridex to market Immunicon's CellSearch technology. The technology gives the patient and oncology community a great method to monitor treatment. The CellSearch system can be very complimentary to an array of tools that oncologists should be using to counsel their patients. The only problem with this method is that the patient may receive potentially toxic and ineffective drugs before circulating tumor cells are measured. The CellSearch System could be utilized for confirmation after being administered the assay-directed most beneficial therapeutic agents. The CellSearch technique can be done earlier than other currently approved diagnostic modalities like CT, MRI or PET imaging. However, you are measuring the drug effects on tumors \"in\" the patient, one treatment at a time. The outcome for metabolic responders and non-responders with imaging and the CellSearch System is basically what is going on with a \"functional\" profiling assay, showing what patients are benefiting from what drug agents, \"before\" introducing them into the patient. Anti-cancer treatments often effectively shrink the size of tumors, but some might have an opposite effect, actually expanding the small population of cancer stem cells believed to drive the disease. Some treatments could be producing more cancer stem cells which are then capable of metastasizing, because these cells are trying to find a way to survive the therapy. The tumor escapes from chemotherapy by induction of stem cell marker expression. The small number of cells that survive the treatment could then generate another tumor that metastasizes. This may help explain why the expression of stem cell markers has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatments and poor outcome for patients with cancers including prostate, breast and lung cancers. That tells us that understanding how to target these markers and these cells could prove useful in treating these cancers. Analysis of stem cell expression before and after treatment reveals that even as some anti-cancer treatments shrank tumors, they increased expression of stem cell markers like Nanog and BMI1 (both of which contibute to stem cells' defining ability to renew themselves and differentiate into different cell types). Some treatments are not enough to completely inhibit tumor growth, and the cancer stem cell markers are still present. Even if one or more chemotherapy regimen is identified as being likely to work on a particular cancer, has the science advanced to tell us whether application of the chosen chemotherapy regimen will not cause other changes that also cause cancer to later return and perhaps be even harder to treat? Is it a case of chemotherapy being bad, in cases where it apparently works? Chemotherapy can be mutagenic (changes in form). It might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more aggressive fashion. Much more work needs to be done, and oncologists need to adapt treatment to the patient. There are hundreds of chemotherapeutic agents, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing individual properties of each patient's cancer. Are Stem Cells the root of the problem? Stem cells have that infinite ability to renew themselves and produce the many different cell types that make up a human. Cancer's hallmark is its ability to grow infinitely, multiplying into various cells that make up a tumor. Is cancer the result of a normal stem cell turned bad or an ordinary cell that somehow acquires a stem cell's immortality and versatility? A recent finding that Temodar (temozolomide) increased the number of cancer cells with stem-like characteristics sounds eerily similar to the increase in the number of metabolic activity of mitochondria of the surviving cells from taxane (Taxol) therapy, even in cases where the majority of the cells are being killed by taxanes. It may indeed give clinical response (tumor shrinkage), however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a reponse to taxanes are often dramatic. In stem cell research, anti-cancer treatments often effectively shrink the size of tumors, but some might have the opposite effect, actually expanding the small population of cancer stem cells that then are capable of metastasizing. Using the CellSearch System technique that quantifies circulating tumor cells, scientists had shown that chemotherapy with Taxol causes a massive release of cells into the circulation, while at the same time reducing the size of the tumor, explaining that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from solid tumors and entered the blood stream. This can begin the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, CTCs travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ. Even before the advent of the CellSearch technique, it had been observed in Cell Function Analysis that there was an increase in the number of metabolic activity of mitochondria of the surviving cells from Taxol therapy, even in cases where the majority of the cells were being killed by Taxol. This new research hightens the faults of gene amplificaton/mutation studies. Genetic profiling assumes that all drugs within a class will produce precisely the same effect, even though from clinical experience, this is not the case. Nor can genetic profiling tell anything about drug combinations. Are you sure that you've identified every single protein that might influence sensitivity or resistance to drugs? The \"cell\" is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not theoretical predispositions. Cancer is a complex disease and needs to be attacked on many fronts. Cellular profiling holds the key to solving some of the problems confronting the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.",

      "Content": "The FDA\u0092s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) met to debate the value of the FDA's accelerated approval program for cancer drugs. The goal of the accelerated program is to provide novel and promising treatments to patients faster than through the traditional, longer route to FDA approval. Accelerated approval is granted based on a surrogate endpoint study rather than the gold standard of overall survival, bona fide clinical efficacy, or quality of life improvement. Surrogate endpoint trials are generally faster than the traditional efficacy trials that are required for full drug approval because the surrogate endpoints are typically laboratory readouts that are available before direct measure of effectiveness. Subsequent to an accelerated approval, drug makers are required to confirm clinical efficacy and demonstrate drug safety with post-marketing trials called Phase 4 confirmatory trials. If the drug does not live up to its anticipated clinical benefit, the FDA can use an expedited procedure to withdraw the drug from the market. The meeting was prompted by the recent decision to remove the breast cancer indication from Roche's cancer drug, Avastin, from the market. Accelerated approval is based on likely, but not yet proven clinical benefit. Therefore, the right surrogate marker study is crucial, as is the post-marketing effectiveness trial. The panel discussed both the design of trials required for accelerated approval as well as post-marketing studies. The committee debated whether a randomized, two-arm trial rather than a single-arm trial should be required in certain accelerated approval cases. The committee also discussed whether a minimum of two post-marketing trials is necessary and whether accelerated approval should be delayed until the confirmatory trials are actually underway. Ideally, the FDA Office of Oncology would like drug makers\u0092 to have confirmatory trials underway, with set completion dates, at the time of accelerated approval. Two years ago, the breast cancer indication for Avastin was approved under the accelerated program, however the FDA officially announced its recommendation to remove the breast cancer indication from Avastin\u0092s label in December 2010, following an independent advisory committee\u0092s 12-1 vote for indication removal. The greatest benefit that breast cancer patients have seen on Avastin is improvement in progression-free survival by a few months when the drug is combined with chemotherapy. Genentech responded to the FDA in January 2011 with evidence the company says demonstrate why the label should stay in place and has requested an FDA hearing. The company is still awaiting a response. The goal of the ODAC is not to remove the accelerated program but to improve the regulation, design, and conduct of the trials required for accelerated approval and for confirmatory trials. If the FDA is able to put forth more stringent rules about accelerated approval trial design and enforce the timely execution of Phase 4 trials, this should, at least in theory, allow necessary access to promising medication while decreasing the time an ineffective treatment stays on the market.

      "Content": "Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. Although this process is normal in the growth of development of children, it happens rarely in adults. For example, angiogenesis occurs during the healing of a deep cut. Otherwise, angiogenesis in adults is usually part of a disease process such as cancer. Angiogenesis is essential for the growth and metastasis (spread) of cancer. A growing tumor requires nutrients and oxygen, which helps it grow, invade nearby tissue, and metastasize. To reach these nutrients, the tumor builds new blood vessels. In fact, growing tumors can become inactive if they can't find a new supply of nutrients. Angiogenesis starts when cancer cells produce a variety of growth factors and other activators (biologic molecules that begin a process). Growth factors cause endothelial cells (the cells that line blood vessels) to produce chemicals that break down the nearby tissue and the extracellular matrix (the spaces between cells). Then, the endothelial cells divide into more cells and begin building new blood vessels. Other elements, such as stromal cells (cells that form connective tissue), provide structural support for the new blood vessels. Because angiogenesis is necessary in the growth and spread of cancer, each part of the angiogenesis process is a potential target for new cancer therapies. The assumption is that if a drug can stop the tumor from receiving the supply of nutrients, the tumor will \"starve\" and die. The role of VEGF Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important activator of angiogenesis. Like the name indicates, VEGF causes endothelial cells to grow. Research has shown that oncogenes (genes that help cancer cells grow), cytokines (substances produced by the immune system), and hypoxia (a low-oxygen environment, which is common in tissues around solid tumors) can all directly or indirectly activate VEGF, thereby starting angiogenesis. VEGF causes angiogenesis by attaching to special receptors (proteins on the outside of cancer cells that act like doorways), and this action starts a series of chemical reactions inside the cell. Because VEGF is so important to angiogenesis, it is a target of new cancer treatments. For example, the drug bevacizumab (Avastin) blocks a receptor for VEGF. In addition to VEGF, researchers have identified a dozen other activators of angiogenesis, some of which are similar to VEGF. There are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF. There are other proangiogenic factors that can affect whether Avastin works or not, FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL8, etc. You need to attack these other targets as well. The problem with Avastin is the same thing that was a problem with AZT for HIV/AIDS. Early results, then rapid resistance. The solution is \"combination therapy\" to attack all the different targets. We need to attack these other targets as well. If you can achieve this, then you really don't need the other drugs, which really don't get into the tumor so well. But angiogenic attack provides true selective toxicity, something which is sorely lacking with all of the other treatments. There are a number of new classes of drugs that target VEGF, at the protein level (Avastin), at the tyrosine kinase level (Nexavar, Sutent) and at the intracellular metabolic pathway mTOR (Afinitor, Torisel). It's going to take \"combination\" antivascular therapy to make the big difference, but this is definitely coming and it's the most promising thing on the therapeutic horizon. Given the current state of the art, cell-based in vitro drug sensitivity testing (with functional profiling) could be of significant clinical value. One aspect of a functional profiling assay is that microvascular viability can measure dead microvascular cells in tissue, fluid and peripheral blood specimens to identify potential responders to anti-angiogenic drugs (Avastin, Nexavar, Sutent) and to assess direct and potentiating anti-angiogenic effects of tyrosine kinase targeted therapy drugs (Tarceva, Iressa). The AngioRx Assay can be of significant clinical value. Source: Cell Function Analysis",

      "Content": "According to Merriall Goozner (who occasionaly writes for the Journal of the National Cancer Institute), two clinical trials showed no improvement in mortality among women with metastatic breast cancer. Those trials didn\u0092t even replicate the delay in progression of disease that had been shown in the original trial that led to accelerated approval in 2007. Now comes the firestorm from patient advocacy groups, who will use anecdotal stories to claim the drug works for some women. Here\u0092s the truth of those matters: Anecdotes are not science. Those who insist their use of the drug is the reason why they are remaining alive longer than average will still have access to the drug since most insurance companies and Medicare will continue to follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. NCCN\u0092s guideline writing committee, a third of whom have financial ties to Roche/Genentech, has said it will not withdraw Avastin\u0092s use in metastatic patients. A few years ago, CMS passed a rule that said it would reimburse any use of a cancer drug, even if the FDA had not approved it for that use, if it was included in the NCCN guidelines and accompanying formulary. http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/UCM279485 One breast cancer patient\u0092s life saving therapy is another\u0092s pulmonary embolism without clinical benefit. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology, we will confront one Avastin after another. The solution to this problem is to investigate the VEGF targeting agents in each individual patient\u0092s tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that vascular targeting will favorably influence each patient\u0092s outcome.",

      "Content": "A meta-analysis focusing on cardiovascular events in randomized studies of chemotherapy with or without Avastin (bevacizumab) in the metastatic disease setting demonstrated the expected risk of hypertension but also a modest but statistically significant increase in left ventricular dysfunction. Rates of arteriothrombotic events were not statistically different. A Meta Analysis of Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Treated with Anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Therapy \u0096 Bevacizumab. Nasim S, Sousa BA, Dent RA, Pritchard KI. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, ON, Canada Background and objectives: Bevacizumab, used in combination with chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials in MBC. Hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy have been reported in trials of bevacizumab in breast cancer. The aim of this systematic review and meta analysis is to determine the overall risk of grade 3-4 hypertension (HTN), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and venous (VT) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) related to Bevacizumab in patients with MBC. Methods: We selected randomized phase III trials which compared chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in MBC as first or second line therapy. Data extraction was carried out from results published in the literature or from conference proceedings of the selected studies. For the analysis, we used a fixed-effects and random effects models to calculate the pooled event-based relative risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistics were first calculated to assess the heterogeneity among the proportions of the included trials. We collected all grade 3-4 events reported in these trials in relation to cardiovascular events: HTN, LVD, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, VT and ATE. Results: Five trials were included in the meta-analysis: E2100, AVADO, RIBBON-1, RIBBON-2 and Miller et al study (capecitabine alone or plus bevacizumab in previously treated MBC). In total 2126 patients received chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and 1444 chemotherapy alone. When there was tendency for heterogeneity, random-effects models were used. Thromboembolic events were pooled together as VT and ATE as information was not clear in some of the reported studies. CHF and cardiomyopathy were considered for LVD events in the Miller study as LVD was not reported. Patients treated with bevacizumab-containing regimens had a RR for HTN of 10.32 (95% CI, 4.23- 24.79; p<.0001), RR for LVD 2.58 (95% CI, 1.06 - 6.32; p=0.04) and RR for VT and ATE of 1.71 (95% CI, 0.81- 3.60; p=0.16) as shown in figure 1. Conclusion: HTN is a recognized side effect of bevacizumab therapy. The risk of LVD is also significantly higher with bevacizumab therapy RR 2.58 as shown in this pooled analysis, but the risk of thrombotic events is not increased. Another Phase II study demonstrated good tolerability and encouraging efficacy when docetaxel 75 mg/m2 was combined with Avastin (bevacizumab) in HER2-negative disease, as well as when Herceptin (trastuzumab) was added to the regimen in patients with HER2-positive tumors. Phase II Multicenter Study of Docetaxel and Bevacizumab (Bev) +/- Trastuzumab as First-Line Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC). Schwartzberg LS, Hermann R, Blakely J, Richey SS, Tauer KW, Childs BH. West Clinic, Memphis, TN; Northwest Georgia Oncology Center, Marietta; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ Background: The addition of Bev to the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel has resulted in improved progression-free survival (PFS) in the first line setting of HER2- MBC. The majority of data with docetaxel is from the AVADO study, which used a dose of 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel. No data exists that combines Bev with docetaxel at the current U.S. standard dose of 75 mg/m2 in HER2- MBC, or at any dose in the HER2+ setting. We report here the results of the feasibility, safety, and efficacy data of the combination of 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel and bevacizumab in HER2- MBC, and the first reported results of docetaxel, Bev, and trastuzumab in HER2+ MBC. Methods: Phase II, nonrandomized, parallel arm study, stratified by HER2 status, conducted in a large community practice network. Eligibility: Histologically-proven breast adenocarcinoma, stage IV disease with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST criteria, ECOG PS 0-1, no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, no evidence or history of brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Stratum 1 (HER2-) treatment: Bev (15mg/kg) followed by docetaxel (75 mg/m2) q 3 weeks. Stratum 2 (HER2+) treatment included in addition trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose on day 2 of cycle 1, and 6 mg/kg on day 1 of all subsequent cycles). All subjects received G-CSF as primary prophylaxis. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. Docetaxel could be discontinued after 8 cycles if a complete response (CR) was obtained with continuation of Bev (and trastuzumab in her-2+ pts) until disease progression. Primary endpoint: Progress-free survival (PFS) in each stratum. Secondary endpoints: overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival, safety. Results: The trial accrued 73 patients (Stratum 1/2, 52/21) pts from August 2006 to March 2009. Seventy two pts (Stratum 1/2 52/20) were treated. As of April 5, 2010, two pts (both stratum 1) remained on treatment. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event in each stratum was fatigue (Stratum 1/2 11.5%/10%). Incidence of grade 3 hypertension (Stratum 1/2) was 3.8%/5.0%. No treatment-related deaths, colonic perforations or clinical CHF events occurred. The median number of cycles of docetaxel delivered was 8 in both strata. The median number of cycles of Bev delivered was 8 in stratum 1 and 12.5 in stratum 2. The median number of cycles of trastuzumab delivered in stratum 2 was 13. The ORRs were 57.7% (5.8% CR, 51.9% PR) in stratum 1, and 81.0% (28.6% CR, 52.4% PR) in stratum 2. The CBRs were 67.3% (95% C.I., 52.9%-79.7%) in stratum 1, and 81.0% (95% C.I., 58.1%-94.6%) in stratum 2. The median (95% CI) PFS was 8.5 (5.33-10.77) months in stratum 1 and 13.43 (12.10-N.A.) months in stratum 2. Conclusion: In first-line MBC, docetaxel of 75 mg/m2 plus Bev administered Q3W in HER2- and of docetaxel and trastuzumab plus Bev in HER2+ disease is feasible and safe in the community practice setting, with high response rates and promising PFS compared to historical controls not treated with Bev. The tolerability of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 with Bev may be better than higher dose docetaxel. These results support the use of these regimens in the clinical practice setting.",

      "Content": "Larry Weisenthal, MD, PhD The last issue of The ASCO Post reports encouraging results with platinum-based treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (September 15, 2013). We predicted these findings 4 years ago in a presentation at the 2009 Breast Symposium.1 We compared the activity of a series of agents (platinum, taxane, alkylating agent, and anthracycline) tested in cell cultures of fresh biopsy specimens of triple-negative breast cancer, in comparison with the activity in non\u2013triple-negative breast cancer, previously untreated ovarian cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and late-relapse ovarian cancer. We reported the following conclusions: 1. Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer is dramatically more sensitive to cisplatin than is ER-positive breast cancer. 2. HER2-negative breast cancer is slightly more sensitive than is HER2-positive disease. 3. ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer is more sensitive than is ER-negative/HER2-positive disease. 4. Poorly differentiated breast and ovarian tumors are more sensitive than are moderate and well-differentiated tumors. 5. Non\u2013triple-negative breast cancer subsets are more resistant to cisplatin than are cases of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. 6. Triple-negative breast cancer is equally sensitive to cisplatin as is previously untreated ovarian cancer, and cisplatin is the most active of the four tested drugs in triple-negative breast cancer. It is gratifying to see the clinical validation for our prediction based on cell culture testing. With regard to the \u201cexciting new assays coming down the pike to help us identify which patients may respond to platinum agents,\u201d there is a very impressive peer review literature confirming the predictive value of fresh tumor cell culture assays with cell death endpoints to reliably predict for the clinical benefit of platinum agents in human neoplasms. These latter tests are already available from licensed clinical laboratories; however, in the absence of results from individualized cell culture testing, the markers that best identify breast cancer patients for platinum therapy are ER-negative, HER2-negative, and Bloom-Richardson Grade 9/9 (data shown in abstract.1) Disclosure: Dr. Weisenthal reported no potential conflicts of interest.

      "Content": "Direct anti-tumor and anti-vascular effects were studied of Tykerb, Nexavar and Avastin in fresh biopsy specimens of breast cancer and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Symposium on September 5, 2008. While the other clinically-available 'nib' drugs have been shown to have anti-vascular activity, anti-vascular activity of Tykerb has not been previously reported. Angiogenesis studies are limited by the clinical relevance of laboratory model systems. They don't do \"real world\" studies under \"real world\" conditions. Patient outcomes need to be reported in real-time, so patients and cancer physicians can learn immediately if and how patients are benefiting from new drug therapies. Cell culture detection of microvascular cell death in clinical specimens of human neoplasms and peripheral blood can identify the activity of both single drugs and combinations of drugs at the level of individual patients with individual cancers. It works by measuring drug effects (real-time) upon endothelial cells which make up blood vessels. Drugs like Avastin had striking anti-microvascular effects but minimal anti-tumor effects. Tarceva and Gleevec had mixed antitumor and anti-microvascular effects. Anti-microvascular effects of Tarceva and Iressa were equal to those of Sutent and Nexavar. Anti-microvascular additivity was observed between Avastin and other drugs on an individual basis. Conclusions of the study had shown that Tykerb has antivascular activity superior to that of Nexavar. Avastin + Tykerb may be the first clinically-exploitable antivascular drug combination. High dose, intermittent 'bolus' schedules of Tykerb to coincide with Avastin administration may be clinically advantageous, even in HER2-negative tumors. The system utilized for the study was a functional profiling assay, which may be used to individualize antivascular therapy. It can be adapted for simple, inexpensive and sensitive/specific detection of tissue and circulating microvascular cells in a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, for drug development, and individualized cancer treatment. It can accurately sort drugs into categories of above average probability of providing clinical benefit on one hand and below average probability of providing clinical benefit on the other hand, based both on tumor response and patient survival. http://www.weisenthal.org/Weisenthal_ASCO.pdf http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/1...8.01955.x/full",

      "Content": "A study was presented at the 2009 American Society of Clinical Onocology (ASCO) breast cancer symposium in San Francisco about progress in drug selection through the use of cell-based functional profiling. It delt with the so-called \"triple negative\" breast cancer (TNBC), which is estrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (RP-), and Her2 negative (H2-). When breast cancer presents as locally advanced disease, it is customarily treated with neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, followed by definitive surgery. At the time of surgery, the specimen is assessed to determine if all visible tumor has been destroyed by chemotherapy. When this happens, it is said to be a \u0093pathological complete response\u0094 (pCR). Data shows that obtaining a pCR is everything. Get a pCR, and the survival is excellent. Don\u0092t get a pCR and the survival, especially for TNBC patients, is very poor. How can the pCR rate be improved in TNBC? The speaker went through all the database of breast cancer cell culture assays (using cell death endpoints) and tried to see if there were any drugs which appeared to be uniquely active in TNBC vs non-TNBC. There were no major differences between the activity of most drugs in TNBC vs non-TNBC, with one glaring exception: cisplatin, which was dramatically more active in TNBC than in non-TNBC. The speaker went on to present a lot of data further dissecting which specific markers were most associated with TNBC sensitivity to cisplatin. But, essentially, the major markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were estrogen receptor negativity and very poorly differentiated tumors. The minor markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were Her2 negativity and progesterone receptor negativity. The data compared TNBC to other types of tumors. It\u0092s known that renal cell carcinomas are very resistant to cisplatin (less than 10% response rate), and that is reflected by the cell culture (cell death endpoint) data. It\u0092s known that previously-untreated, poorly differentiated ovarian cancers tend to be very sensitive to cisplatin (70% response rate), and that\u0092s also reflected by the cell culture data. When ovarian cancer patients relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have only a 25% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. When ovarian cancer patients relapse greater than 6 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have a 50% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. These clinical findings are also nicely recapitulated by the cell culture assay data. Now, breast cancers which are either estrogen receptor positive and/or more than very poortly differentiated (Bloom Richardson score of 4 to eight) tend to be even more resistant to cisplatin than are previously treated ovarian cancer which relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy. In contrast, Triple Negative Breast Cancers tend to be as sensitive or more sensitive (especially when also Bloom Richardson 9/9) to cisplatin than are previously-untreated, poorly-differentiated ovarian cancers. The data clearly showed the utility of cell culture assays in \u0093targeting\u0094 chemotherapy to patient sub-groups who are most likely to benefit from treatment with given individual drugs. It is hard to see how molecular profiling tests could have produced similar insights. Genomics is far too limited in scope to encompass the vagaries and complexities of human cancer biology when it comes to drug selection. Efforts to administer targeted therapies in randomly selected patients often result in low response rates at significant toxicity and cost. While researchers continue to develop molecular probes to select candidates, the cell culture analysis platform serves as a functional profile capable of examining the nuances of cellular response to drugs. To exploit the full potential of targeted anticancer therapies, physicians will need laboratory tests that match patients to specific drugs.

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Medical and Laboratory Director Rational Therapeutics, Inc. Long Beach, California I recently had an interesting conversation with a physician regarding her patient with an aggressive breast cancer. A portion of tumor had been submitted to our laboratory for analysis and we identified activity for the alkylating agents and the Taxanes, but not for Doxorubicin. After our report was submitted to the treating physician she contacted me to discuss our findings, as well as the results from a genomic/proteomic laboratory that conducted a parallel analysis upon a portion of the patient\u0092s tumor. The physician was kind enough to forward me their report. Their results recommended doxorubicin while ours did not. The treating physician asked for my input. Here, I thought, was a \u0093teachable moment.\u0094 Our discussion turned to the profound difference between analyte-based laboratory tests e.g. genomic and proteomic, and functional platforms like our own (EVA-PCD). Genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic platforms measure the presence or absence of genes, RNA or protein. Gene amplification, deletions or mutations and protein and phosphoprotein expressions are examined. These platforms dichotomize patients into those who do and those who do not express the given analyte, with cutoffs for gene copy number or intensity of staining. These platforms have worked very well in diseases where there is a linear connection between the gene (or protein) and the disease state, e.g. BCR-ABL in CML for which imatinib has proven so effective. These tests have worked reasonably well in EGFR mutated and ALK gene rearranged in lung cancer, but even here response rates and response durations have been less dramatic. However, they have not worked very well at all for the vast majority of cancers that do not carry specific and well-characterized targets. These cancers reflect polygenic phenomena and are not defined by a single gene or protein expression. Functional platforms look at cellular response to injury at the systems level and measure the end result of drug exposure to gauge the likelihood of a clinical response. Our focus on cell biology allows us to determine whether a drug or combination induces programmed cell death. After all, regardless of what gene elements are operational, it is the ultimate eradication of the cancer clone (its loss of viability) that results in clinical response. As we reported in a recent paper in non-small cell lung cancer, patients who revealed the most sensitive ex-vivo profile to erlotinib (Tarceva) lived far longer than the general clinical experience for those patients who were selected for erlotinib by EGFr mutation analysis alone. Some of these patients are alive at 5, even 9 years since diagnosis. We live in a technocracy where process has taken precedence over results. We are enamored with complex scientific technologies sometimes at the expense of simple answers. A metallurgist, familiar with every last detail of the alloys used in a Boeing 747 wouldn\u0092t necessarily be your first choice for pilot. A skilled pathologist, intimately familiar with the most detailed intricacies of human diagnostics would not likely be your preferred surgeon for cardiac bypass. Cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment are two distinctly different disciplines. While we use the ER (estrogen receptor) status in breast cancer to select treatment, few oncologists would select Tamoxifen for their NSCLC patients even though many NSCLC patients express ER in their tissue. ER + NSCLC does not respond to tamoxifen and V600E BRAF mutated (+) colon cancer patients do not respond to vemurafenib, the very drug that works so well in BRAF V600E (+) melanoma. Cancer is contextual and responses are not solely predicated upon the presence or absence of a gene element alone. We must use a broader brush when we paint the likeness of our patients in the laboratory, one that encompasses the vicissitudes of human biology in all of its complexities. Where I took issue with the report, however, was its \u0093evidence-based\u0094 moniker. The evidentiary manuscripts cited to support the drug recommendations, with titles like \u0093Overexpression of COX-2 in celecoxib-resistant breast cancer cell lines\u0094 provided little evidence that a (+) COX-2 finding by IHC on this patient\u0092s biopsy specimen would offer any real hope of response. It seemed that with all of the really interesting science going on here, no one had taken the time to do the hard work to figure out whether any of these observations had a basis in reality. The failure of ERCC1 expression in lung cancer to correlate with response and survival or the Duke University debacle with gene profiling in NSCLC are just the most recent examples of how \u0093lovely theories can be spoiled by a little fact.\u0094 As we and our colleagues in cell profiling have actually taken the time to correlate predictions with clinical outcomes we have shown a 2.04 fold higher objective response rate (p 0.001) and significantly improved 1-year survival (p=0.02). (Apfel, C. et al Proc ASCO, 2013). To the contrary, it is of interest to examine the comparatively scant published literature on genomic and IHC profiling for drug selection under similar circumstances. While one group reported an underwhelming objective response rate of 10 percent in their study, (Von Hoff, J Clin Oncol 2010) a more recent study is even more illuminating. A Spanish group used genomic profiling in 254 colon cancer patients to select candidates for gene-targeted agents (KRAS/BRAF/PI3K/PTEN/MET) and provided therapy for 82. They reported a significantly shorter time to progression for targeted treatments compared with conventional therapies 7.9 vs 16.3 week (P<0.001) and an overall objective response rate of 1.2 percent, yes that\u0092s 1.2% (1/82). Human tumor biology is many things, but simple is not one of them. Reductionist thinking is not providing the insights that our patients desperately need. While we await the arrival of a perfect test for the prediction of response to cancer therapy, perhaps we as physicians and our patients should use a good one, one that works.",

      "Content": "A new study strengthens the evidence that pathological complete response (pCR) is a good surrogate marker of longer-term efficacy in the neoadjuvant drug treatment of breast cancer. pCR, which is defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes after treatment, can be measured within weeks of starting a drug. Thus, it can provide a very early indicator of efficacy. However, here at the 36th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), investigators reported that short-term pCR results also correlate with longer-term event-free survival in the neoadjuvant setting. At a meeting press conference today, Martine Piccart-Gebhart, MD, PhD, illustrated this using data from the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization (NeoALTTO) trial. She explained that the combination of lapatinib (Tykerb, GlaxoSmithKline) and trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) provided significantly better 3-year event-free survival than either agent alone in women with early-stage HER2-postive disease. Notably, this improvement correlated with pCR in the 455-patient trial, said Dr. Piccart-Gebhart, who is chair of the Breast International Group in Brussels. At 3 years, there was a 62% reduction in the risk for an event, such as disease recurrence or a second primary tumor, among the 137 patients who had a pCR compared with the 274 patients who did not (hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; P = .0003). The correlation between pCR and 3-year event-free survival is especially important because NeoALTTO is one of the first randomized trials to prospectively evaluate pCR in breast cancer, said Jennifer Litton, MD, from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She moderated the meeting press conference. Multiple retrospective studies in the neoadjuvant setting have shown that pCR correlates with long-term outcomes, she explained. \"We have been looking at it for decades,\" said Dr. Litton about pCR. Thus, NeoALTTO extends the evidence that pCR is a \"strong surrogate marker,\" she told Medscape Medical News. \"For me, that's the story of NeoALTTO: pCR shows benefit, and it's persisting [at 3 years],\" Dr. Litton summarized. She also explained that regulators have contributed to the emerging status of pCR. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"has now looked at the totality of evidence and realized that pCR is an important surrogate end point.\" This fall, the FDA approved pertuzumab (Perjeta, Genentech) for the neoadjuvant treatment of early HER2-positive breast cancer on the basis of pCR results. In other words, the drug was approved based on short-term efficacy findings using a surrogate marker. The drug, which received accelerated approval, will need to eventually show a longer-term survival benefit to keep its indication in this setting. Approval on the basis of pCR results signaled a new day in drug approval in the United States. \"We have a whole new tool to get drugs to patients faster,\" said Dr. Litton. Industry has also been understandably appreciative of the shift in FDA drug evaluation criteria in this setting. \"If we can shorten the time it takes to determine whether a breast cancer medicine works, that is clearly good news for patients,\" said Dietmar Berger, vice president of clinical hematology/oncology at Genentech, in a press statement earlier this year when the FDA was considering the use of pCR as a marker in breast cancer drug approval in the neoadjuvant setting. The agency has since issued a draft guidance on the use of the measure in trials in this setting. Differing Opinions In NeoALTTO, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Piccart-Gebhart randomized 455 women with HER2-positive primary breast cancer to lapatinib, trastuzumab, or a combination of the 2 for 6 weeks, followed by surgery, chemotherapy, and then 48 more weeks of the original neoadjuvant therapy. At the 2010 SABCS, the investigators revealed that the combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib completely wiped out tumor cells in the breast, and thus achieved pCR, in 51.3% of women \u0097 about twice the rate of response seen with either drug alone. The difference was statistically significant (P =.001). However, at that time, a number of experts said that pCR was not ready to be used as a surrogate marker. pCR was \"not ready for prime time\" as a measure to be used for drug approval because it is not always correlated with improved disease-free and overall survival, said Eric Winer, MD, from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, at the 2010 meeting. Another expert agreed with Dr. Winer at that time. \"Complete pathological response is not a perfect surrogate for long-term survival,\" said Leif Ellisen, MD, PhD, from the Gillette Center for Breast Cancer at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \"It's predicted survival in some trials of breast cancer, but not in all,\" Dr. Ellisen said. \"And the FDA has said that it will not allow pCR to be used as an end point.\" How quickly things have changed.

      "Content": "In most cases, targeted therapy needs to be combined with conventional chemotherapy in order to be effective. Avastin is one case in point. In cell function analysis, Avastin as a single agent is relatively ineffective in virtually all tumor types other than Renal because it is known to be driven by the VEGF pathway. Some scientists are not sure whether Avastin or any other anti-angiogenic agents are working primarily by pruning new blood vessels, increasing the delivery of another anti-cancer therapy, or potentially another mechanism. However, in the last few years, functional assays have revealed synergy with some combination \"targeted\" agents, like Herceptin and Tykerb (I've written on the internet about how Tykerb maybe better than Herceptin, single agent to single agent, because of being a small molecule drug as opposed to a large molecule drug). True synergy is rather uncommon in most adult solid tumors. Most drug combinations in diseases such as cancer are merely additive, where the whole equals the sum of its parts, and not synergistic. In cases where drugs are only additive and not synergistic, nothing is learned by testing the drugs in combination over what is learned by testing them separately. So drugs in combination are only tested in cases where there is the realistic possiblity of seeing true synergy. The best combinations are those in which there is true synergy and in which the toxicities of the drugs in the combination are non-overlapping, so that full doses of each drug may be given safely. The theory behind combination chemotherapy is that you can't give full doses of all drugs when you give them together. They have overlapping toxicity, which means you need to cut the doses when you give them together, so you get down to homeopathic dose levels.",

      "Content": "In 2008, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Avastin to be used in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy for the treatment of patients who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. The approval was based on a phase III study (the E2100 study) of 722 patients with metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned to receive Avastin with paclitaxel chemotherapy or paclitaxel alone. A doubling in progression-free survival was observed in patients who received Avastin in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy compared to patents who recieved paclitaxel alone (1). Progression-free survival is the length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a disease that does not get worse. Essentially, progression-free survival measures how long it takes for a tumor to start growing again. However, this result doesn\u0092t mean that women taking Avastin lived longer. A doubling in progression-free survival simply means that it took twice as long for the tumor to progress. In fact, there was no increase in overall survival. Moreover, those women who received Avastin experienced a higher overall incidence of toxicities as well as more severe toxicities. A second phase III trial, the (Avastin plus Docetaxel) AVADO trial, investigated the benefits of combining Avastin with a different chemotherapy, docetaxel, in over 700 previously untreated patients HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (2). In the primary analysis (data cut-off point: October 2007; median follow-up of 10.2 months), treatment with Avastin significantly increased progression-free survival compared to patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy alone (3). However, more recent analysis of the patient population evaluating overall survival (data cut off point: April 2009; median follow-up of 25 months) failed to define a statistically meaningful benefit (4). A third phase III trial, the RIBBON-1 trial, evaluated chemotherapy (assigned at the discretion of a physician: either a taxane, an anthracycline or capecitabine) with or without Avastin for first-line treatment of stage IV HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (5). Avastin plus capecitabine compared with placebo plus capecitabine, and Avastin plus taxane or anthracycline versus placebo plus a taxane or anthracycline significantly improved progression-free survival but had no effect on overall survival. In both the AVADO and RIBBON-1 trials, women receiving Avastin had an increased risk of death; 0.8% of women in AVADO and 1.2% of women in RIBBON-1 died from side effects thought to be related to Avastin (6). A fourth phase III trial, the RIBBON-2 trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with chemotherapy for second-line treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer also significantly improved progression-free survival but failed to show statistically significant improvement of overall survival (4). Thus, Avastin reproducibly increases progression-free survival but, on average, doesn\u0092t keep women with metastatic breast cancer alive any longer than chemo alone. The problem with Avastin is that doctors don\u0092t know which patients will respond favorably in terms of overall survival. In the majority of patients, Avastin increases progression-free survival but has no effect on overall survival. When the FDA started discussing the possibility of withdrawing the indication for Avastin, critics of the agency accused them of rationing healthcare, claiming that it was Avastin\u0092s high cost (as much as $100,000 a year), not its limited benefit, that the FDA cared about. Although the issue clearly revolves around Avastin\u0092s survival benefit, the FDA should be concerned about costs. Healthcare costs endanger U.S. financial stability. Simply ignoring the skyrocketing costs of healthcare and focusing exclusively on the treatment benefits, however small \u0097 in this case the average survival benefit is zero \u0097 will have a devastating effect on the U.S. economy. Avastin should be placed in a restricted-access program so that patents already on the drug and benefiting from it can maintain access to it. Pharmacogenomics should be used to identify the best candidate patient population and a subsequent study should then be undertaken to determine biomarkers that have clinical utility in measuring the efficacy of Avastin in those patients. Several candidate biomarkers have already been described, including tumor and plasma VEGF, circulating E-selectin, ICAM 1 and VCAM1 (7). We consider this a realistic and rational approach to provide effective, personalized therapy while simultaneously managing healthcare costs. Indeed, patient advocacy organizations called for the use of personalized medicine stratetiges back in August to keep Avastin on the market for those who are most likely to benefit from the disease (8-9): We recognize the benefits of Avastin overall are modest for women with metastatic breast cancer. However, we do know that for some women, Avastin offers a greater benefit, but we do not yet know how to determine which patients will experience greater benefits. We have much more to learn about the drug and how individual patients respond to the drug, such as why some women receive greater benefit while others do not. Moving into the world of personalized medicine, cancer treatments will be more tailored to the characteristics of patients\u0092 individual tumors. Yet, due to the current state of the science, we don\u0092t always know which patients will benefit most before a drug is made commercially available. As with all medicines, we encourage a thoughtful discussion between a woman and her doctor that carefully considers the benefits and the risks. FDA approval is not a requirement for a doctor to prescribe a drug. However, the panel\u0092s decision could limit the so-called \u0093off-label\u0094 use of Avastin for metastatic breast cancer, or ovarian cancer, for which Avastin is currently prescribed off label, if third party payers refuse to cover the cost of treatment.

      "Content": "Some industry-insiders have suggested the Compassionate Use Program could work for Roche, with Avastin. Now that the FDA has rejected Avastin for breast cancer, breast cancer now becomes a non-approved indication and therefore any investigator wishing to do a compassionate use trial would have to do so under a Treatment IND. In 1987, the FDA enacted regulations that provided increased access to experimental drugs for patients with life-threatening or seriously-debilitating diseases when no alternative treatment exists. These guideline, commonly called Treatment IND (Investigational New Drug), provide for rapid review of new therapies even when clinical trial results proving efficacy have not been established. Typically Treatment IND applications are made for drugs that are in Phase III trials; however in rare cases the FDA approves a Treatment IND for a drug that has not yet progressed beyond Phase II. In order to stay compliant with the protocol, the drug developer must continue to collect safety and efficacy data on test subjects in order to better establish a drug's therapeutic benefit to patients. Additionally, it must continue to make a good faith effort to win final approval from the FDA; if the drug developer stops working on the product, the Treatment IND can be rescinded and patients may lose access to the drug. The company would have to write the protocol with prettly strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and thus Roche has to ask the question as to whether it's worth it since they can't sell it for this purpose.",

      "Content": "Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. Although this process is normal in the growth of development of children, it happens rarely in adults. For example, angiogenesis occurs during the healing of a deep cut. Otherwise, angiogenesis in adults is usually part of a disease process such as cancer. Angiogenesis is essential for the growth and metastasis (spread) of cancer. A growing tumor requires nutrients and oxygen, which helps it grow, invade nearby tissue, and metastasize. To reach these nutrients, the tumor builds new blood vessels. In fact, growing tumors can become inactive if they can't find a new supply of nutrients. Angiogenesis starts when cancer cells produce a variety of growth factors and other activators (biologic molecules that begin a process). Growth factors cause endothelial cells (the cells that line blood vessels) to produce chemicals that break down the nearby tissue and the extracellular matrix (the spaces between cells). Then, the endothelial cells divide into more cells and begin building new blood vessels. Other elements, such as stromal cells (cells that form connective tissue), provide structural support for the new blood vessels. Because angiogenesis is necessary in the growth and spread of cancer, each part of the angiogenesis process is a potential target for new cancer therapies. The assumption is that if a drug can stop the tumor from receiving the supply of nutrients, the tumor will \"starve\" and die. The role of VEGF Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important activator of angiogenesis. Like the name indicates, VEGF causes endothelial cells to grow. Research has shown that oncogenes (genes that help cancer cells grow), cytokines (substances produced by the immune system), and hypoxia (a low-oxygen environment, which is common in tissues around solid tumors) can all directly or indirectly activate VEGF, thereby starting angiogenesis. VEGF causes angiogenesis by attaching to special receptors (proteins on the outside of cancer cells that act like doorways), and this action starts a series of chemical reactions inside the cell. Because VEGF is so important to angiogenesis, it is a target of new cancer treatments. For example, the drug bevacizumab (Avastin) blocks a receptor for VEGF. In addition to VEGF, researchers have identified a dozen other activators of angiogenesis, some of which are similar to VEGF. There are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF. There are other proangiogenic factors that can affect whether Avastin works or not, FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL8, etc. You need to attack these other targets as well. The problem with Avastin is the same thing that was a problem with AZT for HIV/AIDS. Early results, then rapid resistance. The solution is \"combination therapy\" to attack all the different targets. We need to attack these other targets as well. If you can achieve this, then you really don't need the other drugs, which really don't get into the tumor so well. But angiogenic attack provides true selective toxicity, something which is sorely lacking with all of the other treatments. There are a number of new classes of drugs that target VEGF, at the protein level (Avastin), at the tyrosine kinase level (Nexavar, Sutent) and at the intracellular metabolic pathway mTOR (Afinitor, Torisel). It's going to take \"combination\" antivascular therapy to make the big difference, but this is definitely coming and it's the most promising thing on the therapeutic horizon. Given the current state of the art, cell-based in vitro drug sensitivity testing (with functional profiling) could be of significant clinical value. One aspect of a functional profiling assay is that microvascular viability can measure dead microvascular cells in tissue, fluid and peripheral blood specimens to identify potential responders to anti-angiogenic drugs (Avastin, Nexavar, Sutent) and to assess direct and potentiating anti-angiogenic effects of tyrosine kinase targeted therapy drugs (Tarceva, Iressa). The AngioRx Assay can be of significant clinical value. Source: Cell Function Analysis",

      "Content": "As our understanding of breast cancer biology continues to advance, this disease has come to be understood as many different diseases. Original categorizations based on histology lead to lobular versus ductal subtypes. Thereafter, recognition of estrogen and progesterone status, and finally HER2 status provided further subcategorizations. Over the past decade, molecular subtypes have characterized this disease into a series of signatures characterized by luminal, basal and other groupings with distinct prognoses. Within the context of these categories, the triple negative breast cancers have emerged as an important target. These patients whose tumors do not mark for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 on immunohistochemical or FISH analyses, appear to carry features that segregate them into a BRCA1-like biology. This is of great interest clinically for it offers the opportunity to treat these patients with drugs found active in the BRCA mutant populations. Among the most active drugs in these patients are the PARP inhibitors. The excellent results with PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutants have been followed by striking response and survival data combining PARP inhibitors with carbo-platinum and gemcitabine. PARP inhibitors by inhibiting DNA damage response can enhance the effects of ionizing radiation, mustard alkylators, topoisomerase inhibitors, platins, and intercalating agents. We have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors in breast and other cancers. In these investigations, our lab to applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. To date, we have observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients, and in some triple negative patients. More interesting, will be the results combining the PARP inhibitors with mustard alkylators, platins, and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. This work is ongoing in triple negative and BRCA positive patients as well as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future.

      "Content": "Replies to comments regarding personalized cancer treatment, as published in the December 15, 2013 \"ASCO Post\" (American Society of Clinical Oncology publication). By Larry Weisenthal, MD December 15, 2013, Volume 4, Issue 20 Dr. Mason states that I implied that Dr. Telli supports the routine application of chemosensitivity assays. I have no knowledge regarding Dr. Telli\u0092s views on this subject, nor did I in any way attempt to represent her views, much less imply that she was supportive of anything relating to chemosensitivity assays. Dr. Mason also raises the issue of conflict of interest. I am an expert in chemosensitivity testing, with 35 years of largely full-time experience with the relevant technologies. Dr. Telli stated that her group was working on predictive markers to identify the best candidates for platinum treatment in breast cancer. I quoted our data presented at the 2009 Breast Cancer Symposium, which prospectively identified the best candidates for such treatment as being patients with triple-negative disease and a Bloom-Richardson score of 9/9. My laboratory provides neither marker studies for triple-negative disease nor Bloom-Richardson scoring. Obvious vs Nonobvious Conflicts Let\u0092s imagine that I were a pathologist, who pointed out to Dr. Telli that there was prior work suggesting that the above routine pathology markers could be useful in identifying candidates for platinum treatment. Would this be a conflict of interest? Dr. Mason seems to be implying that any expert/specialist who provides a service related to his/her comment should declare a conflict of interest. Thus, a radiotherapist commenting on a surgical study should declare a conflict of interest, a chemotherapist commenting on a radiotherapy study should declare a conflict of interest, and so forth. In my case, it was obvious from my letter that I performed chemosensitivity testing, as I quoted my own work in this field! In a similar vein, pathologists, radiotherapists, and chemotherapists generally make note of their own specialties in their comments, as workers in a particular field typically have the most relevant knowledge base, and their conflicts of interest are likewise obvious. One generally makes a formal conflict of interest declaration when one\u0092s conflict is not obvious, eg, most typically in disclosing a relationship to an entity not obviously related to one\u0092s medical practice, such as a relationship with an outside pharmaceutical company. I am going to hazard a guess that Dr. Mason would state that the difference between an oncologist providing chemosensitivity testing and a pathologist providing estrogen receptor testing is that the former testing is considered to be \u0093investigational/not recognized by ASCO,\u0094 whereas the latter is considered to be noninvestigational/recognized. But is this a fair distinction? Double Standard? To date, ASCO has provided two formal reviews of chemosensitivity testing.1,2 In both reviews, the sole criterion being assessed was \u0093efficacy,\u0094 meaning the existing data relating to the question of whether the use of this testing improves clinical outcomes. In both reviews, no attempt was made to assess the considerable data documenting the accuracy of chemosensitivity testing, where test accuracy is the only criterion ever used to \u0093validate\u0094 any predictive laboratory technology, specifically including the triple-negative tests (ie, for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2). This double standard has had the effect of halting virtually all progress in the field of chemosensitivity testing since the late 1980s. Critics have labeled the technology \u0093investigational\u0094 and have then failed to support the investigations they have demanded, as readily evidenced by the complete absence of NIH grant\u0096supported publications in the American literature over the past 2 decades. The technologies are largely in the public domain and labor-intensive, and there has accordingly been no serious private sector money to compete with pharmaceutical company funding for clinical trials. New Development Just this year, however, there has been a new development. A large-scale (777-patient) prospective, randomized trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia was published, supported by the British Leukemia Research Fund.3 I would ask fair reviewers to compare and contrast the quality and results of this trial with what is the self-proclaimed \u0093best\u0094 trial ever performed to \u0093validate\u0094 estrogen receptor testing4 (estrogen receptor negativity being the most powerful contributor to platinum sensitivity in patients with triple-negative disease in our 2009 study).5 Comparing the chemosensitivity test study with the estrogen receptor study, the former had a greater number of patients and stronger predictive correlations, and used real-world test conditions (real-time processing and prospective reporting, as opposed to post hoc batch-processing and retrospective reporting). Additionally, for the first time ever in all studies of predictive markers used for treatment selection in cancer, the chemosensitivity study showed an improved clinical outcome for patients randomly assigned to test-guided treatment selection vs non\u0096test-guided treatment selection. (Patients in the empiric therapy arm had a 2.5-fold greater probability of being dead at 1 year, compared to the patients in the test-directed arm.) Lost Opportunity I view the lack of support and overt hostility to chemosensitivity testing as being the single greatest lost opportunity in clinical cancer research over the past 25 years.

      "Content": "On Tuesday, July 20th, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended in a 12-1 vote that the FDA withdraw its approval of Avastin as a treatment for advanced breast cancer. In 2008, Avastin was given accelerated and conditional approval by the FDA for metastatic breast cancer treatment. Its manufacturer, Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche, was then required to do further studies to confirm the benefit of the drug. The two new studies sponsored by Roche showed Avastin did not meet the standards that BCA has long maintained for any new drug approved for treatment. It is believed that a drug should meet at least one of the following standards: 1) extend the life of the patient, i.e., improve overall survival, and/or 2) improve the patient's quality of life, and/or 3) cost less than therapies already available. Roche agreed with the committee's recommendation, and were saddened that after all this time there's still no good option to offer patients when current treatments have failed. However, actual results in patients count and theory doesn't matter as much as the evidence that it does what we want it to do. It would be more advantegeous to sort out what's the best profile in terms of which patients benefit from this drug. Some scientists are not sure whether Avastin or any other anti-angiogenic agents are working primarily by pruning new blood vessels, increasing the delivery of another anti-cancer therapy, or potentially another mechanism. Clinical oncologists involved with functional tumor cell profiling analysis, can actually examine this. They have a method for testing anti-angiogenic/anti-microvascular agents, such as Avastin and testing for synergy between different anti-microvascular agents on an individual patient, individual tumor basis. Avastin appears to better deliver the effects of other classes of drugs. Avastin facilitates vascular access of cytotoxics to tumors. It will take combination antivascular therapy to make a big difference, but this is definitely coming and it's the most promising thing on the near term therapeutic horizon. As for Avastin's side effects. Evidence in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows that many of the highly expensive targeted drugs like Avastin may be just as effective and produce fewer side effects if taken over shorter periods and in lower doses. Avastin is one example. The dose being used is 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, despite research showing it may work with 3 milligrams per kilogram. Many doctors have been using Avastin \"off-label\" against a variety of cancer types. An estimated 60 percent of anti-cancer drugs are used off-label. It has been very routine and well-accepted practice to prescribe drugs in cancer types and disease stages outside of those in which the drugs originally received FDA approval. Generally, insurance companies have paid for drugs used outside of FDA-approved settings because the treating physician finds their use in those instances to be medically necessary. That's why I would personally want to have Avastin pre-tested against a tumor first to see if it was beneficial. If a pre-test (functional tumor cell profiling) can establish that Avastin would be beneficial, a treating physician could use that to find its use to be medically necessary and pressure insurance companies to pay for the drugs outside of FDA-approved settings.",

      "Content": "Direct anti-tumor and anti-vascular effects were studied of Avastin in fresh biopsy specimens of breast cancer and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Symposium on September 5, 2008. Drugs like Avastin had striking anti-microvascular effects but minimal anti-tumor effects. Anti-microvascular additivity was observed between Avastin and other drugs on an individual basis. Conclusions of the study had shown that Avastin + Tykerb may be the first clinically-exploitable antivascular drug combination. High dose, intermittent 'bolus' schedules of Tykerb to coincide with Avastin administration may be clinically advantageous, even in HER2-negative tumors. The system utilized for the study was a functional profiling assay, which may be used to individualize antivascular therapy. It can be adapted for simple, inexpensive and sensitive/specific detection of tissue and circulating microvascular cells in a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, for drug development, and individualized cancer treatment. It can accurately sort drugs into categories of above average probability of providing clinical benefit on one hand and below average probability of providing clinical benefit on the other hand, based both on tumor response and patient survival.",

      "Content": "A meta-analysis focusing on cardiovascular events in randomized studies of chemotherapy with or without Avastin (bevacizumab) in the metastatic disease setting demonstrated the expected risk of hypertension but also a modest but statistically significant increase in left ventricular dysfunction. Rates of arteriothrombotic events were not statistically different. A Meta Analysis of Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) Treated with Anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Therapy \u0096 Bevacizumab. Nasim S, Sousa BA, Dent RA, Pritchard KI. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada; University of Toronto, ON, Canada Background and objectives: Bevacizumab, used in combination with chemotherapy has demonstrated efficacy in randomized trials in MBC. Hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy have been reported in trials of bevacizumab in breast cancer. The aim of this systematic review and meta analysis is to determine the overall risk of grade 3-4 hypertension (HTN), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and venous (VT) and arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) related to Bevacizumab in patients with MBC. Methods: We selected randomized phase III trials which compared chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in MBC as first or second line therapy. Data extraction was carried out from results published in the literature or from conference proceedings of the selected studies. For the analysis, we used a fixed-effects and random effects models to calculate the pooled event-based relative risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistics were first calculated to assess the heterogeneity among the proportions of the included trials. We collected all grade 3-4 events reported in these trials in relation to cardiovascular events: HTN, LVD, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, VT and ATE. Results: Five trials were included in the meta-analysis: E2100, AVADO, RIBBON-1, RIBBON-2 and Miller et al study (capecitabine alone or plus bevacizumab in previously treated MBC). In total 2126 patients received chemotherapy in combination with bevacizumab and 1444 chemotherapy alone. When there was tendency for heterogeneity, random-effects models were used. Thromboembolic events were pooled together as VT and ATE as information was not clear in some of the reported studies. CHF and cardiomyopathy were considered for LVD events in the Miller study as LVD was not reported. Patients treated with bevacizumab-containing regimens had a RR for HTN of 10.32 (95% CI, 4.23- 24.79; p<.0001), RR for LVD 2.58 (95% CI, 1.06 - 6.32; p=0.04) and RR for VT and ATE of 1.71 (95% CI, 0.81- 3.60; p=0.16) as shown in figure 1. Conclusion: HTN is a recognized side effect of bevacizumab therapy. The risk of LVD is also significantly higher with bevacizumab therapy RR 2.58 as shown in this pooled analysis, but the risk of thrombotic events is not increased. Another Phase II study demonstrated good tolerability and encouraging efficacy when docetaxel 75 mg/m2 was combined with Avastin (bevacizumab) in HER2-negative disease, as well as when Herceptin (trastuzumab) was added to the regimen in patients with HER2-positive tumors. Phase II Multicenter Study of Docetaxel and Bevacizumab (Bev) +/- Trastuzumab as First-Line Treatment of Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC). Schwartzberg LS, Hermann R, Blakely J, Richey SS, Tauer KW, Childs BH. West Clinic, Memphis, TN; Northwest Georgia Oncology Center, Marietta; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ Background: The addition of Bev to the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel has resulted in improved progression-free survival (PFS) in the first line setting of HER2- MBC. The majority of data with docetaxel is from the AVADO study, which used a dose of 100 mg/m2 of docetaxel. No data exists that combines Bev with docetaxel at the current U.S. standard dose of 75 mg/m2 in HER2- MBC, or at any dose in the HER2+ setting. We report here the results of the feasibility, safety, and efficacy data of the combination of 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel and bevacizumab in HER2- MBC, and the first reported results of docetaxel, Bev, and trastuzumab in HER2+ MBC. Methods: Phase II, nonrandomized, parallel arm study, stratified by HER2 status, conducted in a large community practice network. Eligibility: Histologically-proven breast adenocarcinoma, stage IV disease with at least one measurable lesion per RECIST criteria, ECOG PS 0-1, no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, no evidence or history of brain or leptomeningeal metastases. Stratum 1 (HER2-) treatment: Bev (15mg/kg) followed by docetaxel (75 mg/m2) q 3 weeks. Stratum 2 (HER2+) treatment included in addition trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose on day 2 of cycle 1, and 6 mg/kg on day 1 of all subsequent cycles). All subjects received G-CSF as primary prophylaxis. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. Docetaxel could be discontinued after 8 cycles if a complete response (CR) was obtained with continuation of Bev (and trastuzumab in her-2+ pts) until disease progression. Primary endpoint: Progress-free survival (PFS) in each stratum. Secondary endpoints: overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), overall survival, safety. Results: The trial accrued 73 patients (Stratum 1/2, 52/21) pts from August 2006 to March 2009. Seventy two pts (Stratum 1/2 52/20) were treated. As of April 5, 2010, two pts (both stratum 1) remained on treatment. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event in each stratum was fatigue (Stratum 1/2 11.5%/10%). Incidence of grade 3 hypertension (Stratum 1/2) was 3.8%/5.0%. No treatment-related deaths, colonic perforations or clinical CHF events occurred. The median number of cycles of docetaxel delivered was 8 in both strata. The median number of cycles of Bev delivered was 8 in stratum 1 and 12.5 in stratum 2. The median number of cycles of trastuzumab delivered in stratum 2 was 13. The ORRs were 57.7% (5.8% CR, 51.9% PR) in stratum 1, and 81.0% (28.6% CR, 52.4% PR) in stratum 2. The CBRs were 67.3% (95% C.I., 52.9%-79.7%) in stratum 1, and 81.0% (95% C.I., 58.1%-94.6%) in stratum 2. The median (95% CI) PFS was 8.5 (5.33-10.77) months in stratum 1 and 13.43 (12.10-N.A.) months in stratum 2. Conclusion: In first-line MBC, docetaxel of 75 mg/m2 plus Bev administered Q3W in HER2- and of docetaxel and trastuzumab plus Bev in HER2+ disease is feasible and safe in the community practice setting, with high response rates and promising PFS compared to historical controls not treated with Bev. The tolerability of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 with Bev may be better than higher dose docetaxel. These results support the use of these regimens in the clinical practice setting.",

      "Content": "[Dr. Robert A. Nagourney is medical director at Rational Therapeutics and instructor in Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. He posted on his blog about the issue surrounding Avastin.] We previously wrote about bevacizumab (Avastin) and its approval for breast cancer. The early clinical trials revealed evidence of improved time to disease progression. This surrogate measure for survival benefit had, over recent years, gained popularity, as time to disease progression is a measure of the impact of a given treatment upon the patient\u0092s response durability. It was hoped and believed that time to progression would be an early measure of survival. Unfortunately, the survival advantage for the Avastin-based therapies in breast cancer has not met statistical significance. As such, careful review by the oncology drug committee of the FDA lead to a unanimous decision to remove Avastin\u0092s indication in breast cancer. Avastin has not been removed from the market, but instead, cannot be promoted or advertised, nor do insurers necessarily reimburse it. This decision, however, will have a very big impact on Medicare patients and many others who are in managed care programs (HMOs). There are no villains here. Instead, dedicated physicians empowered to scrutinize the best data could not prove beyond any doubt that the drug improved survival. The time to progression data was favorable and the survival data also trended in a favorable direction. But, the final arbiter of clinical approval \u0097 statistically significant survival \u0097 was not met. The physicians who want to provide this for the patients, the company that produces the drug and the patients who believe it offers benefit all have legitimate positions. As Jerome Groopman, MD, once said, in a similar situation with regard to the FDA approval of interleukin 2 (a biological agent with profound activity in a small minority of melanoma and renal cell cancer patients), \u0093I am confronted with a dilemma of biblical proportions, how to help the few at the expense of the many.\u0094 The Avastin saga is but one example of what will occur repeatedly. The one-size-fits-all paradigm is crumbling as individual patients with unique biological features confront the results of the blunt instrument of randomized clinical trials. Our laboratory has been deeply involved in these stories for 20 years. When we first observed synergy for purine analogs (2CDA and fludarabine) with cytoxan, and then recommended and used this doublet in advanced hematologic malignancies (highly successfully, we might add) we were a lone voice in the woods. Eventually, clinical trials conducted at M.D. Anderson and other centers confirmed the activity establishing these treatments as the standards of care for CLL and low-grade lymphoma. The exact same experience occurred in our solid tumor work when we combined cisplatin plus gemcitabine in pancreatic, ovarian, breast, bladder, lung and other cancers. While our first patient (presumably the first patient in the world) received cisplatin plus gemcitabine for drug-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer in 1995 \u0097 providing her an additional five years of life \u0097 it wasn\u0092t until 2006 that the FDA approved the closely related carboplatin plus gemcitabine for this indication. We now confront an even greater hurdle. With our discoveries, using novel combinations of targeted agents, we are years (perhaps decades) ahead of the clinical trial process. We know that patients evaluated in our laboratory with favorable profiles can respond to some of the newest drugs, many of which have already completed Phase I of clinical trials. It is our fervent belief that we could accelerate the drug development process if we could join with the pharmaceutical companies and the FDA to put these hypotheses to a formal test. Again, there are no villains here. Patients want, and should, receive active drugs. Doctors should be allowed to give them. The drug companies want to sell their agents and the FDA wants to see good therapies go forward. The rancor that surrounds these emotionally charged issues will best be resolved when we introduce techniques that match patients to active therapies. We believe that the primary culture platform used in our laboratory, and a small number of dedicated investigators like us, may be the answer to this dilemma. We will redouble our efforts to apply these methods for our patients and encourage our patients to lobby their health care insurers and representatives to sponsor these approaches. To date, we have been unsuccessful in convincing any cooperative group to test the predictive ability of these selection methodologies. In response, I reiterate that I will gladly participate and, to the best of my ability, support at least the laboratory component of any fair test of our primary culture methodologies. We stand at the ready for the challenge.",

      "Content": "Many chemotherapy drugs, in addition to killing tumor cells, also fight angiogenesis. However, the anti-angiogenic effects of dose-dense therapy may be masked and marginalized by the way it is usually administered. The main targets of high-dose chemotherapy are presumed to be proliferating tumor cells. The main targets of low-dose chemotherapy are the endothelial cells of the growing vasculature of a tumor. In other words, chemotherapeutics are used as anti-angiogenic agents. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by two distinct types of proteins, referred to as \"angiogenic growth factors\" and \"angiogenesis inhibitors.\" Medical researchers have identified 19 angiogenic growth factors in the human body and 31 angiogenesis inhibitors. In a healthy body, a perfect balance of factors that promote and prevent angiogenesis is maintained. After cells become cancerous, the regulation of this balance is disturbed, stimulating the production of new blood vessels. Targeted therapies, such as Avastin, were originally designed with the goal of replacing chemotherapy, to reduce the serious morbidities associated with standard high-dose chemotherapy. Although targeted therapies may be somewhat less toxic, most of them have been found to have very modest efficacy, at least when used as single agents in treating patients with advanced disease. They have therefore mainly been used in combination with standard chemotherapy or radiation protocols. It is becoming more apparent to administer drugs to patients with certain types of cancer on a weekly schedule. The advantage of low-dose chemotherapy is the possibility of combining it with anti-angiogenic drugs as well as other types of targeted therapies, such as those that target specific signal-transduction molecules or with antitumor vaccines. Blood vessel cells are less likely than tumor cells to become resistant to chemotherapy, so if cancer cells become drug resistant, these medicines should still be able to shrink tumors by destroying their blood supply. When administering both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis drugs, the endothelial cells (involved iin angiogenesis) are the first in the tumor to undergo cell death (apoptosis). Adding Avastin, which only goes after VEGF-sensitive cancer cells, you need to go after other pro-angiogenic factors which can substitute for VEGF: FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL-8, etc. And with Taxol promoting an increase of IL-8, how effective is it with Avastin? With the low-dose protocol having an anti-angiogenic effect, you really wouldn't need to add a drug like Avastin into the mix. Source: Cell Function Analysis",

INSERM U 981, Institut Gustave Roussy 16. Hopital Saint Louis, INSERM U976 Abstract Purpose: The emergence of skin tumors in patients treated with sorafenib or with more recent BRAF inhibitors is an intriguing and potentially serious event. We performed a clinical, pathological and molecular study of skin lesions occurring in patients receiving sorafenib. Experimental Design:31 skin lesions from patients receiving sorafenib were characterized clinically and pathologically. DNA extracted from the lesions was screened for mutation hotspots of HRAS, NRAS, KiRAS, TP53, EGFR, BRAF, AKT1, PI3KCA, TGFBR1 and PTEN. Biological effect of sorafenib was studied in vivo in normal skin specimen and in vitro on cultured keratinocytes. Results:We observed a continuous spectrum of lesions: from benign to more inflammatory and proliferative lesions, all seemingly initiated in the hair follicles. Eight oncogenic HRAS, TGFBR1 and TP53 mutations were found in 2 benign lesions, 3 keratoacanthomas (KA) and 3 KA-like squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Six of them correspond to the typical UV-signature. Treatment with sorafenib led to an increased keratinocyte proliferation and a tendency towards increased MAPK pathway activation in normal skin. Sorafenib induced BRAF-CRAF dimerization in cultured keratinocytes and activated CRAF with a dose-dependent effect on MAP-kinase pathway activation and on keratinocyte proliferation. Conclusions:Sorafenib induces keratinocyte proliferation in vivo and a time and dose-dependent activation of the MAP-kinase pathway in vitro. It is associated with a spectrum of lesions ranging from benign follicular cystic lesions to KA-like SCC. Additional and potentially preexisting somatic genetic events, like UV-induced mutations, might influence the evolution of benign lesions to more proliferative and malignant tumors.

      "Content": "During the past decade it has been frequently observed that patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen, either in the adjuvant setting or in the metastatic setting, presenting central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the only evidence of disease progression. More studies were therefore interested to evaluate the incidence of CNS metastases in patients with early and advanced breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and to identify predictive factors for CNS relapse. More recent studies reported that breast cancer patients who received a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen had a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen (Breast Cancer Res. 2006;8(4). There are also data indicating an increased risk for brain metastases in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin). A study from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute identified central nervous system metastases in women who receive trastuzumab-based (Herceptin) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Central nervous system disease is defined as one or more brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (carcinomatous meningitis). Central nervous system metastases was identified in 34% of patients at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and 6 months from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease frequently developd brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin (Cancer 2003 Jun 15;97(12):2972-7). Trastuzumab for Breast Cancer Linked to CNS Metastases Women with HER2-positive breast cancer who receive adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech/Roche) have a significant risk for metastases in the central nervous system (CNS) as the site of first recurrence, according to a report published online March 4 in the Annals of Oncology. \"While adjuvant trastuzumab has dramatically lowered the risk of recurrence in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, clinicians should be cognizant of CNS disease as the first site of relapse and monitor survivors closely for worrisome neurologic symptoms,\" lead author Erin M. Olson, MD, from The Ohio State University in Columbus, told Medscape Medical News. It has been suggested that the CNS is a sanctuary site for micrometastatic disease, either because trastuzumab does not penetrate the blood\u0096brain barrier or because of the loss of HER2 overexpression in breast cancer cells migrating to the brain, Dr. Olson said. In previous work, she and her colleagues found an increasing incidence of brain metastases in patients with prolonged exposure to HER2-targeted therapies. This discovery prompted her team to explore the incidence of the CNS as the first site of relapse after exposure to adjuvant trastuzumab. They analyzed 4 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA, and PACS), which involved 9020 patients in total. Of the 4921 patients who received adjuvant trastuzumab, 125 developed CNS metastases as the site of first recurrence, for an overall incidence of 2.56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07% - 3.01%). Of the 4099 patients who did not receive trastuzumab, there were 78 CNS events, for an incidence of 1.94% (95% CI, 1.54% - 2.38%). For patients treated with trastuzumab, the ratio of CNS metastases to total recurrence events was 16.94% (95% CI, 10.85% - 24.07%). For those not treated with trastuzumab, that ratio was 8.33% (95% CI, 6.49% - 10.86%). Additionally, the team found that the overall relative risk of developing CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence with 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, compared with no trastuzumab, was 1.35 [95% CI, 1.02 - 1.78; P =.038]. Dr. Olson noted that there are several limitations to this study. Among them is the fact that data were abstracted from published clinical trial results; as a result, individual patient information was not available, making it impossible to determine the timing and subsequent outcomes of the recurrences. \"Establishment of clinical risk factors associated with the development of CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence after adjuvant trastuzumab is not possible in this analysis,\" she explained. Dr. Olson added that other HER2-targeted therapies, such as pertuzumab and T-DM1 (which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration), might confer a similar risk. \"There is likely to be a similar risk with large antibodies that do not cross the blood\u0096brain barrier, such as pertuzumab and T-DM1, but lapatinib has been shown to have some activity in patients with CNS disease and, therefore, the risk of CNS relapse is unknown,\" she said. Study Confirms Previous Observations Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told Medscape Medical News that this study confirms what has been known for a decade. \"Trastuzumab, being a large molecule, doesn't get into the sanctuary sites, such as the brain, and therefore is unable to affect the development of brain metastases to the same degree as it affects the development of other distant metastases,\" Dr. Hortobagyi explained. He was not involved in the current study. This increased risk for CNS metastases is \"an indication of success,\" he maintained. \"The increased risk of CNS metastases is, therefore, an indication of the success of trastuzumab in prolonging the life of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and giving them more opportunity to develop CNS metastases. In other words, the longer you live after developing breast cancer, the greater the opportunity to develop CNS metastases,\" he said. Dr. Hortobagyi agrees that the use of published aggregate data, and not individual patient reports, is a limitation. \"It has limited granularity. Also, it includes several studies of somewhat different design, different chemotherapy regimens, and different follow-up times. It doesn't provide information about subsequent metastases beyond first metastases, so it is just a larger sample size to confirm earlier observations about this same phenomenon,\" he noted. Some European breast cancer experts also weighed in on this study. Evandro de Azambuja, MD, PhD, from Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium, and Matthias Preusser, MD, from Medical University of Vienna, Austria, told Medscape Medical News by email that the study highlights \"once more\" the issue of developing brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. \"HER2 overexpression is definitely a risk factor for brain metastases, and the vast majority of available systemic treatments are not able to cross the intact blood\u0096brain barrier; therefore, even if the disease is systemically controlled, the risk of brain metastases remains,\" they explained. The inclusion of only published data might not be the real problem. Other limitations include the fact that there were only a small number of published trials available, most had short follow-up periods (generally 4 years vs the most recent 8-year follow-up data), and brain metastases only as the first site were analyzed, Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser noted. They added that it is particularly important to note that the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial group recently published data on CNS relapses in 3401 patients in the observation and 1-year trastuzumab groups [Lancet Oncol. 2013;14:244-248]. \"The incidence of CNS relapse as the first site of relapse was 2% in both arms. The HERA authors also looked at a cohort of 413 patients who had died and for whom a specific questionnaire was returned, They found that 129 patients (57%) in the observation arm and 88 patients (47%) in the 1-year arm experienced CNS relapse prior to death, Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser explained. \"Therefore, reporting CNS as the first site of relapse does not fully capture the effect of CNS relapse on breast cancer outcomes. This highlights the importance of capturing CNS relapses at any time during the study, including the active phase and follow-up, in all clinical trials including HER2-positive breast cancer patients,\" they added. It is not possible to say that trastuzumab increases the risk for brain metastases, \"but rather that trastuzumab controls extracranial disease systemically and does not effectively cross the intact blood\u0096brain barrier, allowing for a longer time before brain metastases develop,\" Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser noted. They emphasized that HER2 overexpression itself seems to be a risk factor for CNS tumor spread, although the exact mechanism has not been established. \"New therapies focusing on the prevention of brain metastases or on increasing the permeability of the blood\u0096brain barrier to allow systemic therapies to reach the brain should be sought,\" they concluded. \"There is an urgent need for high-quality basic and translational research to better understand how and when tumor cells reach the brain and grow into it, and who are the patients at the highest risk of developing brain relapse.\" Dr. Olson, Dr. Hortobagyi, Dr. de Azambuja, and Dr. Preusser have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

      "Content": "Silvana Martino, M.D. The Angeles Clinic Foundation Radiation exposure, even many years previously, is known to increase the risk of many cancers, including breast cancer. Women previously treated for Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma, particularly if radiation was part of their treatment have been recognized as being at higher risk for the subsequent development of breast cancer. An article, published in the June 2012 issue of The Oncologist, adds detail to our understanding of these women. The data used was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute. It encompassed the dates 1973-2007. Included were 9,620 women with a diagnosis of Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma (HL). Among them, 316 subsequent breast cancers occurred. During this same period, 450,413 women without Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma were diagnosed with breast cancer and were used for comparison. Several important observations were made in this comparison. As a group, the women with a prior diagnosis of HL were 2.4 times more likely to develop breast cancer. The risk was highest among patients who were 19 years of age or younger at time of their treatment. The risk decreased progressively as the age of diagnosis of HL increased and approached that of the general population as the women were diagnosed with lymphoma at age 50 or later. This confirms prior observations demonstrating that the female breast is most vulnerable to the damaging effects of radiation during the teenage years when the breasts are developing. The increased risk for breast cancer was noted from 5 years post HL treatment onward. Those whose treatment included radiation had a higher risk of breast cancer than those whose treatment did not include radiation. The difference between these two groups persisted for at least 30 years. Women with breast cancer developing after treatment for HL were younger at diagnosis, were more likely to have breast cancer in the external portions of the breast, were more likely to have tumors that did not express hormone receptors, and were more likely to be diagnosed at a somewhat lower stage. The lower stage at diagnosis is possibly a reflection that these women were being watched and screened more closely. In spite of this, their prognosis is not better, but is somewhat worse. Their breast cancer tends to be more aggressive and they are also more prone to develop a second breast cancer of the opposite breast as well. I found this article to be one of the more informative on this topic in part because of its level of detail. We previously thought that these women were more prone to breast cancer on the inner half of the breast, but as radiation techniques have changed in the treatment of Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma, so has the location of breast cancer. The incidence of Hodgkin\u0092s lymphoma is increasing among both children and young adults. More intensive therapy has resulted in a cure rate of approximately 75%. This reflects clear therapeutic success. However, we need to recognize that young women with this diagnosis, especially if they received radiation, must be watched closely for the subsequent development of bilateral breast cancer.

      "Content": "Antonio C. Wolff, M.D. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore The 10-year incidence of leukemia after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer appears to hover around 0.5%, twice as high as previously reported. A review of more 20,000 patient records included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) database found 51 cases of leukemia that developed within 10 years of treatment. Women who had only chemotherapy were at the greatest risk \u0096 almost six times more likely to develop the disease than the surgery-only control group, Dr. Antonio Wolff said at that annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. \"We know that the observed survival benefit with adjuvant therapy does take into account the potential mortality associated with leukemia,\" said Dr. Wolff of Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore. \"But often we are in the situation where we make the decision to give chemotherapy \u0091just because.\u0092 We need to be very careful here, because some of those patients will potentially derive none of the benefits of chemo, and be at risk of its toxicities.\" Dr. Wolff examined the 1997-2008 data from eight facilities in the NCCN database \u0096 a total of 20,533 women with a first diagnosis of breast cancer. The median follow-up was 5 years, but some data were available for up to 15 years after treatment. About half of the cohort had stage I disease; in most, the cancer was invasive ductal. Slightly more than half had hormone receptor\u0096positive/HER2 negative disease. The only baseline characteristic significantly different between the groups was age. Women who developed leukemia were significantly older at the time of their cancer treatment (60 vs. 54 years; P = .02); 78% of those with leukemia were older than 50 years. Of the 51 cases, 44 were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a median onset time of 3.5 years after treatment. One-third of these occurred in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The median time to onset in the AML cases was 2 years. None of the tumor characteristics were significantly associated with the development of leukemia. There were no significant differences among those who had breast-conserving surgery, mastectomy, or no surgery; or between those who had no radiation therapy, radiation without surgery, radiation after breast-conserving surgery, or radiation after mastectomy, though larger numbers of patients are needed for some of these smaller subset analyses. The overall rate of leukemia per 1,000 patient/years was 0.46; in the surgery-only group, the rate was 0.16 per 1,000 patient-years. \"Of interest is that the rates in each of the treatment groups were similar to the overall rate,\" \u0096 0.43 in the radiation-only group, 0.52 in the chemotherapy-only group, and 0.54 in the combination therapy group. At 5 years, the cumulative incidence of leukemia was 0.05% in the surgery-only group; 0.19% in the radiation-only group; 0.30% in the chemotherapy-only group; and 0.32% in the combination therapy group. But the onset accelerated over the study period, Dr. Wolff noted, with the bulk of cases developing from years 6 to 10. .By the end of the 10-year period, the incidence was 0.2% in the surgery-only group; 0.44% in the radiation-only group; 0.52% in the chemotherapy group; and 0.51% in the combination group. In a risk analysis using surgery as the control, the overall hazard ratio of leukemia was 2.7 in the radiation-only group; 5.68 in the chemotherapy only group; and 5.64 in the combination group. Radiation appeared to confer no significant additional risk when it was combined with chemotherapy, Dr. Wolff added. The findings are strikingly different than previously identified. The largest study of the association was published in 2003, when researchers from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Operations Center reviewed six trials that examined rates of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide therapy (Clin. Breast Cancer 2003;4:273-9). The subgroup that received anthracycline/cyclophosphamide in that review had a cumulative 8-year incidence of 0.24%. In Dr. Wolff\u0092s chemotherapy subgroup, the cumulative 8-year incidence was 0.52%. \"It\u0092s very important to keep in mind that the known leukemia latency period for anthracycline is 1-3 years, but that of alkylating drugs like cyclophosphamide is 4-6 years and there are case reports of it developing after 10 years,\" he said. \"We need to be very careful when we talk about survival at 5 years vs. 10 years in exposed patients, because they could be at risk for a decade and, potentially, even longer.\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651772",

      "Content": "Ed Silverman Pharmalot.com After more than a year of controversy and anticipation, the FDA has decided to formally yank the breast cancer indication for Avastin after deciding the widely used medication is not safe and effective for that purpose. However, the drug - which is sold by Genentech - will remain on the market to treat cancers that affect the colon, lung, kidney and brain. The decision marks a trying stretch for the agency as debate broke out over the wisdom of using progression free survival as a surrogate - instead of quality of life - for conferring approval, while breast cancer patients and their families lobbied hard to maintain the status quo. The episode also highlighted ongoing concerns about the FDA accelerated approval - or fast track - program that first greenlighted Avastin for treating breast cancer. \u0093This was a difficult decision. FDA recognizes how hard it is for patients and their families to cope with metastatic breast cancer and how great a need there is for more effective treatments. But patients must have confidence that the drugs they take are both safe and effective for their intended use,\u0094 FDA commish Margaret Hamburg says in a statement. \u0093After reviewing the available studies it is clear that women who take Avastin for metastatic breast cancer risk potentially life-threatening side effects without proof that the use of Avastin will provide a benefit, in terms of delay in tumor growth, that would justify those risks. Nor is there evidence that use of Avastin will either help them live longer or improve their quality of life.\u0094 The move comes nearly a year after the FDA initially announced plans to revoke the indication, citing study results showing Avastin does not prolong overall survival in breast cancer patients or provide a sufficient benefit in slowing disease progression to outweigh such risks as severe high blood pressure; hemorrhage; swelling of the brain, and heart attack or heart failure. The agency had reviewed two additional studies that Genentech submitted in hopes of maintaining the indication. After the agency gave its initial thumbs down, Genentech appealed, setting up an unusual two-day meeting last summer to review trial data, where the panelists voted 6-to-0 nothing to pull the breast cancer indication. The drugmaker recently offered a compromise that would have modified the Avastin usage and labeling. The decision to revoke the breast cancer indication was seen as an important test for Hamburg, who has emphasized drug safety as a hallmark of her tenure, which began in the lingering aftermath of the corrosive Vioxx scandal. And for the past several months, Avastin has come to symbolize a willingness to brook extensive pressure to allow a drug to remain on the market amid safety issues. \u0093This decision sets an important precedent: accumulated science has trumped politicized argument,\u0094 says Daniel Carpenter, the Allie S. Freed professor of government at Harvard University and author of \u0091Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.\u0092 \u0093The agency faced enormous political pressure from the company and from organized interest groups, and yet rendered a strong decision based upon a searching reading of the available evidence. Whether this move will put to rest some of the issues raised during the Avastin episode is unclear. In particular, critics say more data should be required before accelerated approval is employed. The FDA has also been criticized for not forcing drugmakers to provide required follow-up data more quickly. Last year, Pfizer withdrew a drug used to treat acute myeloid leukemia after a study found a lack of clinical benefit and an unexpected number of deaths, but the study began four years after approval. \u0093In an ironic way, this decision actually allows the FDA to expand the accelerated approval program, as there is now a strong, visible and clear precedent for withdrawing an approval when postmarket experiments for an approved drug produce disconfirming efficacy evidence and perhaps problematic new safety signals,\u0094 Carpenter says. \u0093This is not an anti-innovation decision and could, in fact, assist pharmaceutical innovation in the years ahead\u0085I predict its longer-term impact will be to help rebuild the agency\u0092s reputation for science-based decisionmaking and for independence from emotionally charged lobbying.\u0094 Some patient advocates hailed the FDA move, having argued that the FDA moved too quickly to endorse the breast cancer indication in the first place. \u0093If we are to continue to speed up the rate at which treatments reach patients we must be able to take back approval when the evidence shows that a drug doesn\u0092t work. Although some individual women believe that Avastin worked for them, there are many women who are not here to tell their story about how Avastin didn\u0092t work. We all want better treatment for women with this disease. Unfortunately, Avastin is not that treatment,\u0094 Karuna Jaggar, who is executive director of Breast Cancer Action, writes us. As for Genentech, the drugmaker now stands to lose an estimated $1 billion in sales. \u0093We are disappointed with this outcome,\u0094 the Roche unit says in a statement. \u0093Despite today\u0092s action, we will start a new Phase III study of Avastin in combination with paclitaxel in previously untreated metastatic breast cancer and will evaluate a potential biomarker that may help identify which people might derive a more substantial benefit from Avastin.\u0094 Indeed, Genentech does have an option to resubmit an application to the FDA for a breast cancer indication for Avastin if additional studies prove successful. The drugmaker also has the option of a legal challenge to the agency decision to yank the indication. The decision is certain to have significant implications for patients, doctors and payers. A recent survey found doctors were largely split over whether they would continue to use Avastin to treat breast cancer. Nearly 45 percent would use Avastin in a first-line setting and nearly 52 percent would use the drug in combination with paclitaxel, otherwise known as Taxol, regardless of an FDA decision. Meanwhile, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an organization of major cancer hospitals, reaffirmed last summer that Avastin was \u0093an appropriate therapeutic option for metastatic breast cancer.\u0094 This decision is significant because the NCCN panel of oncologists carries great weight with other specialists and its guidelines are widely used as a reference by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and insurers for making coverage decisions. In fact, CMS earlier this year indicated it would continue to provide coverage, even if treatment amounts to off-label use. But one big insurer recently eliminated coverage. Blue Cross of California last month decided to no longer pay for Avastin to treat breast cancer. Whether other insurers follow suit will become a closely watched sport. For the record, the formal indication that the FDA is now revoking involves Avastin used in combination with the cancer drug paclitaxel (Taxol) for those patients who have not been treated with chemotherapy for their form of metastatic breast cancer known as HER2 negative.",

      "Content": "The FDA\u0092s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) met to debate the value of the FDA's accelerated approval program for cancer drugs. The goal of the accelerated program is to provide novel and promising treatments to patients faster than through the traditional, longer route to FDA approval. Accelerated approval is granted based on a surrogate endpoint study rather than the gold standard of overall survival, bona fide clinical efficacy, or quality of life improvement. Surrogate endpoint trials are generally faster than the traditional efficacy trials that are required for full drug approval because the surrogate endpoints are typically laboratory readouts that are available before direct measure of effectiveness. Subsequent to an accelerated approval, drug makers are required to confirm clinical efficacy and demonstrate drug safety with post-marketing trials called Phase 4 confirmatory trials. If the drug does not live up to its anticipated clinical benefit, the FDA can use an expedited procedure to withdraw the drug from the market. The meeting was prompted by the recent decision to remove the breast cancer indication from Roche's cancer drug, Avastin, from the market. Accelerated approval is based on likely, but not yet proven clinical benefit. Therefore, the right surrogate marker study is crucial, as is the post-marketing effectiveness trial. The panel discussed both the design of trials required for accelerated approval as well as post-marketing studies. The committee debated whether a randomized, two-arm trial rather than a single-arm trial should be required in certain accelerated approval cases. The committee also discussed whether a minimum of two post-marketing trials is necessary and whether accelerated approval should be delayed until the confirmatory trials are actually underway. Ideally, the FDA Office of Oncology would like drug makers\u0092 to have confirmatory trials underway, with set completion dates, at the time of accelerated approval. Two years ago, the breast cancer indication for Avastin was approved under the accelerated program, however the FDA officially announced its recommendation to remove the breast cancer indication from Avastin\u0092s label in December 2010, following an independent advisory committee\u0092s 12-1 vote for indication removal. The greatest benefit that breast cancer patients have seen on Avastin is improvement in progression-free survival by a few months when the drug is combined with chemotherapy. Genentech responded to the FDA in January 2011 with evidence the company says demonstrate why the label should stay in place and has requested an FDA hearing. The company is still awaiting a response. The goal of the ODAC is not to remove the accelerated program but to improve the regulation, design, and conduct of the trials required for accelerated approval and for confirmatory trials. If the FDA is able to put forth more stringent rules about accelerated approval trial design and enforce the timely execution of Phase 4 trials, this should, at least in theory, allow necessary access to promising medication while decreasing the time an ineffective treatment stays on the market.

      "Content": "Dr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society, blogged about his experience at the hearing, on June 28th and 29th, held by the FDA on the question of whether or not Avastin should retain approval for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/DrLens...d-Emotion.aspx When the votes were in, the FDA Advisory Committee voted 6-0 that the risks, being substantial, outweighed the benefits associated with a slight slowing of the pace at which metastatic breast tumors progress. Thus, for the Avastin indication granted accelerated approval in 2008 \u0097 metastatic breast cancer \u0097 Avastin is considered unsafe, according to ODAC.said unanimously that the approval of Avastin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer should be withdrawn. http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/DrLens...-The-Pain.aspx Avastin combined with chemotherapy has improved the survival of some lung cancer patients. Avastin plus folfox has improved survival for some colon cancer patients. Avastin plus chemotherapy improves the survival of some breast cancer patients. The problem is that it doesn\u0092t improve the survival of all cancer patients. Roche has reported that women with breast cancer who were treated with Avastin in combination with chemotherapy followed by the continued use of single-agent Avastin demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival. It\u0092s unclear if Avastin can help increase the overall survival rate in this indication. I remember a clinical oncologist involved with real-time studies under real-world conditions of drugs like Avastin, telling me when the FDA rules on the clinical utility of a drug, they use a broad-brush approach that looks at the global outcomes of all patients, determining whether these glacial trends reflect a true climate change. The problem is that while Bethesda, Maryland may not be noticing significant changes in ocean levels, people who live on the Maldives are having a very different experience. As these scientists ponder the significance of Avastin, some cancer patients are missing out on a treatment that could quite possibly save their lives. One breast cancer patient\u0092s life saving therapy is another\u0092s pulmonary embolism without clinical benefit. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology, we will confront one Avastin after another. The solution to this problem is to investigate the VEGF targeting agents in each individual patient\u0092s tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that vascular targeting will favorably influence each patient\u0092s outcome. In regards to Avastin side effects, any chemotherapeutic has its range of side effects. With Avastin though (and probably most other agents), it was reported in JCO that emerging evidence shows many of the drugs like Avastin may be just as effective and produce fewer side effects if taken over shorter periods and in lower doses. The dose being used for Avastin is 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, despite research showing it may work with 3 milligrams per kilogram. There are selected groups who will benefit from Avastin, if they knew who they were. Genentech/Roch (or whatever flavor of the month they are) researchers have been looking for tests to help predict how patients will respond to Avastin. Some have suggested that they should use the cell-based functional profiling platform (AngioRx Assay) to identify a potential targeted population of cancer patients that it thinks will benefit from Avastin, and then conduct a randomized clinical trial among this group. However, unlike some genetic assays that look whether an individual has a particular mutation or amplification, and therefore tests for \u0093theoretical\u0094 candidates for a particular targeted drug, the functional profiling technique may find Avastin not synergistic (cooperative) and finds some other VEGF-targeted (or multiple VEGF-targeted) drug may work better in an individual cancer patient and then put that individual into the clinical trial. I can understand they may not want some other drug tested on their dime. There are a number of new classes of drugs that target VEGF, at the protein level (Avastin), at the tyrosine kinase level (Nexavar, Sutent) and at the intracellular metabolic pathway mTOR (Afinitor, Torisel). However, responses to any individual mechanism occurs in the miniority of patients. It is unclear why some patients repond to these interventions while others fail. In cell function analysis, it has found unexpectedly good response to conventional cytotoxic drugs following a failure to respond to these targeted agents. This reinforces the need for cancer therapies to be individualized. It remines us that it is the good outcome of the patient not the therapy applied that constitute successful therapy. There is really nothing wrong with Avastin. It\u0092s a wonderful drug that incorporates the brilliant insights originally articulated by Judah Folkman. There are not perfect drugs. There are simply drugs that work for certain patients. But that\u0092s not what pharmaceutical companys like to hear. They like to produce drugs that apply to a broad base of patients. To make the most out of a drug, not just some subsets of patients.",

      "Content": "Some industry-insiders have suggested the Compassionate Use Program could work for Roche, with Avastin. Now that the FDA has rejected Avastin for breast cancer, breast cancer now becomes a non-approved indication and therefore any investigator wishing to do a compassionate use trial would have to do so under a Treatment IND. In 1987, the FDA enacted regulations that provided increased access to experimental drugs for patients with life-threatening or seriously-debilitating diseases when no alternative treatment exists. These guideline, commonly called Treatment IND (Investigational New Drug), provide for rapid review of new therapies even when clinical trial results proving efficacy have not been established. Typically Treatment IND applications are made for drugs that are in Phase III trials; however in rare cases the FDA approves a Treatment IND for a drug that has not yet progressed beyond Phase II. In order to stay compliant with the protocol, the drug developer must continue to collect safety and efficacy data on test subjects in order to better establish a drug's therapeutic benefit to patients. Additionally, it must continue to make a good faith effort to win final approval from the FDA; if the drug developer stops working on the product, the Treatment IND can be rescinded and patients may lose access to the drug. The company would have to write the protocol with prettly strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and thus Roche has to ask the question as to whether it's worth it since they can't sell it for this purpose.",

      "Content": "Ed Silverman Pharmalot.com After more than a year of controversy and anticipation, the FDA has decided to formally yank the breast cancer indication for Avastin after deciding the widely used medication is not safe and effective for that purpose. However, the drug - which is sold by Genentech - will remain on the market to treat cancers that affect the colon, lung, kidney and brain. The decision marks a trying stretch for the agency as debate broke out over the wisdom of using progression free survival as a surrogate - instead of quality of life - for conferring approval, while breast cancer patients and their families lobbied hard to maintain the status quo. The episode also highlighted ongoing concerns about the FDA accelerated approval - or fast track - program that first greenlighted Avastin for treating breast cancer. \u0093This was a difficult decision. FDA recognizes how hard it is for patients and their families to cope with metastatic breast cancer and how great a need there is for more effective treatments. But patients must have confidence that the drugs they take are both safe and effective for their intended use,\u0094 FDA commish Margaret Hamburg says in a statement. \u0093After reviewing the available studies it is clear that women who take Avastin for metastatic breast cancer risk potentially life-threatening side effects without proof that the use of Avastin will provide a benefit, in terms of delay in tumor growth, that would justify those risks. Nor is there evidence that use of Avastin will either help them live longer or improve their quality of life.\u0094 The move comes nearly a year after the FDA initially announced plans to revoke the indication, citing study results showing Avastin does not prolong overall survival in breast cancer patients or provide a sufficient benefit in slowing disease progression to outweigh such risks as severe high blood pressure; hemorrhage; swelling of the brain, and heart attack or heart failure. The agency had reviewed two additional studies that Genentech submitted in hopes of maintaining the indication. After the agency gave its initial thumbs down, Genentech appealed, setting up an unusual two-day meeting last summer to review trial data, where the panelists voted 6-to-0 nothing to pull the breast cancer indication. The drugmaker recently offered a compromise that would have modified the Avastin usage and labeling. The decision to revoke the breast cancer indication was seen as an important test for Hamburg, who has emphasized drug safety as a hallmark of her tenure, which began in the lingering aftermath of the corrosive Vioxx scandal. And for the past several months, Avastin has come to symbolize a willingness to brook extensive pressure to allow a drug to remain on the market amid safety issues. \u0093This decision sets an important precedent: accumulated science has trumped politicized argument,\u0094 says Daniel Carpenter, the Allie S. Freed professor of government at Harvard University and author of \u0091Reputation and Power: Organizational Image and Pharmaceutical Regulation at the FDA.\u0092 \u0093The agency faced enormous political pressure from the company and from organized interest groups, and yet rendered a strong decision based upon a searching reading of the available evidence. Whether this move will put to rest some of the issues raised during the Avastin episode is unclear. In particular, critics say more data should be required before accelerated approval is employed. The FDA has also been criticized for not forcing drugmakers to provide required follow-up data more quickly. Last year, Pfizer withdrew a drug used to treat acute myeloid leukemia after a study found a lack of clinical benefit and an unexpected number of deaths, but the study began four years after approval. \u0093In an ironic way, this decision actually allows the FDA to expand the accelerated approval program, as there is now a strong, visible and clear precedent for withdrawing an approval when postmarket experiments for an approved drug produce disconfirming efficacy evidence and perhaps problematic new safety signals,\u0094 Carpenter says. \u0093This is not an anti-innovation decision and could, in fact, assist pharmaceutical innovation in the years ahead\u0085I predict its longer-term impact will be to help rebuild the agency\u0092s reputation for science-based decisionmaking and for independence from emotionally charged lobbying.\u0094 Some patient advocates hailed the FDA move, having argued that the FDA moved too quickly to endorse the breast cancer indication in the first place. \u0093If we are to continue to speed up the rate at which treatments reach patients we must be able to take back approval when the evidence shows that a drug doesn\u0092t work. Although some individual women believe that Avastin worked for them, there are many women who are not here to tell their story about how Avastin didn\u0092t work. We all want better treatment for women with this disease. Unfortunately, Avastin is not that treatment,\u0094 Karuna Jaggar, who is executive director of Breast Cancer Action, writes us. As for Genentech, the drugmaker now stands to lose an estimated $1 billion in sales. \u0093We are disappointed with this outcome,\u0094 the Roche unit says in a statement. \u0093Despite today\u0092s action, we will start a new Phase III study of Avastin in combination with paclitaxel in previously untreated metastatic breast cancer and will evaluate a potential biomarker that may help identify which people might derive a more substantial benefit from Avastin.\u0094 Indeed, Genentech does have an option to resubmit an application to the FDA for a breast cancer indication for Avastin if additional studies prove successful. The drugmaker also has the option of a legal challenge to the agency decision to yank the indication. The decision is certain to have significant implications for patients, doctors and payers. A recent survey found doctors were largely split over whether they would continue to use Avastin to treat breast cancer. Nearly 45 percent would use Avastin in a first-line setting and nearly 52 percent would use the drug in combination with paclitaxel, otherwise known as Taxol, regardless of an FDA decision. Meanwhile, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an organization of major cancer hospitals, reaffirmed last summer that Avastin was \u0093an appropriate therapeutic option for metastatic breast cancer.\u0094 This decision is significant because the NCCN panel of oncologists carries great weight with other specialists and its guidelines are widely used as a reference by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and insurers for making coverage decisions. In fact, CMS earlier this year indicated it would continue to provide coverage, even if treatment amounts to off-label use. But one big insurer recently eliminated coverage. Blue Cross of California last month decided to no longer pay for Avastin to treat breast cancer. Whether other insurers follow suit will become a closely watched sport. For the record, the formal indication that the FDA is now revoking involves Avastin used in combination with the cancer drug paclitaxel (Taxol) for those patients who have not been treated with chemotherapy for their form of metastatic breast cancer known as HER2 negative.",

      "Content": "There have been attempts to develop molecular-based tests to examine a broader range of chemotherapeutic drugs. New technologies for measuring the expression (biological activity) of literally hundreds to thousands of genes as part of a single test. There are two main technologies involved: RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and DNA microarray. The Microarray (gene chips) is a device that measures differences in gene sequence, gene expression or protein expression in biological samples. Microarrays may be used to compare gene or protein expression under different conditions, such as cells found in cancer. Hence the headlong rush to develop tests to identify molecular predisposing mechansims whose presence still does not guarantee that a drug will be effective for an individual patient. Nor can they, for any patient or even large group of patients, discriminate the potential for clinical activity among different agents of the same class. Genetic profiles are able to help doctors determine which patients will probably develop cancer, and those who will most likely relapse. However, it cannot be suitable for specific treatments for \"individual\" patients. The NCI has concluded (J Natl Cancer Inst. March 16, 2010), it cannot determine treatment plans for patients. It cannot test sensitivity to any of the targeted therapies. It just tests for \"theoretical\" candidates for targeted therapy. Some molecular tests do utilize living cells, but generally of individual cancer cells in suspension, sometimes derived from tumors and sometimes derived from circulating tumor cells. This was tried with the human clonogenic assay, which had been discredited long ago. Traditionally, in-vitro (in lab) \"cell-lines\" have been studied in 2 dimensions (2D) which has inherent limitations iin applicability to real life 3D in-vivo (in body) states. Recently, other researchers have pointed to the limitations of 2D \"cell-line\" study and chemotherapy to more correctly reflect the human body. All DNA or RNA-type tests are based on \"population\" research (not individuals). They base their predictions on the fact that a higher percentage of people with similar genetic profiles or specific mutations may tend to respond better to certain drugs. This is not really \"personalized\" medicine, but a refinement of statistical data. The cell \"function\" method is not hampered by the problems associated with gene expression tests. That is because they measure the net effect of all processes within the cancer, acting with and against each other in real time, and it tests living cells actually exposed to drugs and drug combinations of interest. Cancer is already in 3D conformation. Cell-based functional profiling cultures \"fresh\" live tumor cells in 3D conformation and profiles the function of cancer cells (is the whole cell being killed regardless of the targeted mechanism or pathway). It distinguishes between susceptibility of cancer cells to different drugs in the same class and the susceptibility to combinations. In other words, which combinations are best and in what sequence would they be most effective. The key to understanding the genome is understanding how cells work. The ultimate driver is a \"functional\" assay (is the cell being killed regardless of the mechanism) as opposed to a \"target\" assay (does the cell express a particular target that the drug is supposed to be attacking). While a \"target\" assay tells you whether or not to give \"one\" drug, a \"functional\" assay can find other compounds and combinations and can recommend them from the one assay. The core of the functional assay is the cell, composed of hundreds of complex molecules that regulate the pathways necessary for vital cellular functions. If a \"targeted\" drug could perturb any one of these pathways, it is important to examine the effects of the drug within the context of the cell. Both genomics and proteomics can identify potential new therapeutic targets, but these targets require the determination of cellular endpoints. Cell-based functional assays are being used for screening compounds for efficacy and biosafety. The ability to track the behavior of cancer cells permits data gathering on functional behavior not available in any other kind of assay. The reason for at least a \"tru-cut\" biopsied tumor specimen is that \"real life\" 3D analysis makes functional profiling indicative of what will happen in the body. It tests fresh \"live\" cells in their 3 dimensional (3D), floating clusters (iin their natural state). Upgrading clinical therapy by using drug sensitivity assays measuring cell-death of 3 dimenionsl microclusters of live \"fresh\" tumor cells can improve the conventional situation by allowing more drugs to be considered. We are forced to confront the realization that genotype does not equal phenotype. The particular sequence of DNA that an organism possess (genotype) does not determine what bodily or behaviorial form (phenotype) the organism will finally display. Among other things, environmental influences can cause the suppression of some gene functions and the activation of others. Out knowledge of genomic complexity tells us that genes and parts of genes interact with other genes, as do their protein products, and the whole system is constantly being affected by internal and external environmental factors. The gene may not be central to the phenotype at all, or at least it shares the spotlight with other influences. Environmental tissue and cytoplasmic factors clearly dominate the phenotypic expression processes, which may in turn, be affected by a variety of unpredictable protein-interaction events. This view is not shared by all molecular biologists, who disagree about the precise roles of genes and other factors, but it signals many scientists discomfort with a strictly deterministic view of the role of genes in an organism's functioning. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology (and not population studies), we will confront one targeted drug after another. The solution to this problem has been to investigate the targeting agents in each individual patient's tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that the targeting will favorably influence each patient's outcome. Functional profiling results to date in patients with a multitude type of cancers suggest this to be a highly productive direction.

      "Content": "Precision Therapeutics Announces New Tumor Profiling Product To Augment Utility Of ChemoFx And Further Personalize Cancer Treatment Precision Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the launch of a new product line, BioSpeciFx, will help further the personalization of cancer treatments. BioSpeciFx is composed of carefully selected sets of well validated and clinically useful biomarker tests that identify critical molecular targets within a patient's cell. By using the information generated by BioSpeciFx in combination with Precision's sophisticated drug response marker ChemoFx, physicians may gain a more complete understanding of a patient's tumor. When combined, both products offer a complementary sum of information which will enable physicians to look at both the relevant molecular targets as well as the synergistic activity of drug combinations on the entire cell. BioSpeciFx provides proteomic and genomic information, while ChemoFx takes into account all of the functional characteristics of a tumor including those not captured by biomarker testing, providing both sensitivity and resistance information. \"The Comprehensive Tumor Profile developed by Precision presents the most complete offering available to cancer patients today, because it integrates both genomic and proteomic information with the functional profiling of ChemoFx,\" says Sean McDonald, CEO of Precision Therapeutics. \"We are very excited to provide physicians with a closer look at each patient's tumor as we continue to develop products aimed at personalizing treatments for cancer patients.\" Source: Precision Therapeutics Precision Therapeutics is using ChemoFx as a complement to BioSpeciFx. They run ChemoFx on a population of tumors (i.e. breast cancer). They identify the responsive, intermediately responsive, and non-responsive patients. Then they take the molecular markers and find out what these patients have in common with respect to 150 different genes. Then they work on eliminating the genes that are irrelevant. What they get is a multi-gene predictor. It can't work without ChemoFx working. They claim their MGP for breast cancer is accurate 85% of the time according to MD Anderson and US Oncology. Each drug has it's own signature, but couldn't happen if ChemoFx wasn't accurate. ChemoFx is the backbone of MGP. The oncologist can pick and choose which markers he/she wants to see.",

      "Content": "Feasibility assessment of pharmacogenomic predictors developed from breast cancer cell lines to predict breast cancer patient pathological response in neoadjuvant chemotherapy Nan Song, Shara Rice, Dave Gingrich, Dakun Wang, Chunqiao Tian, Zhenyu Ding, Stacey Brower, Paul Ervin, Shuguang Huang, Mike Gabrin, Kui Shen Precision Therapeutics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA Background: Studies of developing pharmacogenomic predictors from cancer cell lines to predict cancer patient clinical response and outcome to chemotherapy have yielded both positive and negative results. The variability in these results may arise from the noise inherent of microarray technology as well as the small sample size of in cell line studies. Therefore, it is greatly needed to evaluate the feasibility of using cell lines to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of patient pathological response. Material and Methods: Thirty breast cancer cell lines were exposed to 10 concentrations of paclitaxel-5-fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (TFAC) to measure in vitro chemosensitivity. Two independent and publicly available microarray datasets (Hoeflich and Neve) on these breast cancer cell lines together with the chemosensitivity results were used to identify pharmacogenomic predictors from each dataset. Two independent clinical trials (Hess and Popovici) with publically available data, having 130 and 100 patients respectively, were used as test sets to validate the accuracy of the pharmacogenomic predictors. All patients received TFAC as neoadjuvant therapy and the gene expression profiles of patients were assessed before receiving chemotherapy treatment. The patient\u0092s pathological complete response (pCR) was determined after treatment to evaluate the chemotherapy efficacy. The pharmacogenomic predictors developed from each of the cell line studies were evaluated for their ability to predict patient pCR in each of the clinical trials using the supervised principle component regression method. Results: The pharmacogenomic predictors identified from the Hoeflich and Neve cell line data (training sets) predicted pCR of the patients in the two clinical trials (test sets) with 64%-68% accuracy, 70%-87% sensitivity, and 60%-67% specificity when 100 genes were selected as pharmacogenomic predictors. Conclusions: The four independent prediction results generated in this study demonstrate the feasibility of using breast cancer cell lines to identify pharmacogenomic predictors of response to chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer patients. Future studies will examine the use of drug responses from primary cultures of patient tumors to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of breast cancer patient responses to chemotherapy treatment.

      "Content": "By Dr. Robert Nagourney Nothing really. It\u0092s a wonderful drug that incorporates the brilliant insights originally articulated by Judah Folkman, MD, at Harvard University. Dr. Folkman reasoned that: Cancers require oxygen and nutrients These would need to be delivered by a blood supply Tumors would avidly seek their own blood supply via humoral factors. His groundbreaking work ultimately lead to the discovery of VEGF, as well as the FDA approval of Avastin, the monoclonal antibody that binds and inactivates circulating VEGF in patients. The problem isn\u0092t with Avastin, it\u0092s with the practice of oncology \u0096 the clinical trial process and the muddied waters that surround clinical utility of any drug, new or old. There are no perfect drugs. There are simply drugs that work for certain patients. VEGF down-regulation is an attractive and highly appropriate therapy for a subset of cancer patients with many different diagnoses whose tumors use the VEGF pathway to their advantage. Avastin combined with carboplatin and taxol has improved the survival of lung cancer patients. Avastin plus folfox has improved survival for colon cancer patients. Avastin plus chemotherapy improves the survival of some breast cancer patients. The problem is that it doesn\u0092t improve the survival of all breast cancer patients. When the FDA rules on the clinical utility of a drug, they use a broad-brush approach that looks at the global outcomes of all patients, determining whether these glacial trends reflect a true climate change. The problem is that while Bethesda, Maryland may not be noticing significant changes in ocean levels, people who live on the Maldives are having a very different experience. As these scientists ponder the significance of Avastin, some breast cancer patients are missing out on a treatment that could quite possibly save their lives. One breast cancer patient\u0092s life saving therapy is another\u0092s pulmonary embolism without clinical benefit. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology, we will confront one Avastin after another. Our solution to this problem has been to investigate the VEGF targeting agents in each individual patient\u0092s tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that vascular targeting will favorably influence each patient\u0092s outcome. Our results to date in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer and even rare tumors (like medullary carcinoma of the thyroid) suggest this to be a highly productive direction for future development.

      "Content": "Precision Therapeutics Announces New Study On Multi-Gene Predictors At 2010 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium In a new study in which Precision Therapeutics' Multi-Gene Predictors (MGPs) were independently validated by investigators at US Oncology and MD Anderson, Precision highlights the potential role of the ChemoFx in vitro chemosensitivity test and multi-gene predictors in determining a patient's likelihood of response to multi-drug chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer. The study, titled, Multi-Gene Predictors Developed from Breast Cancer Cell Lines to Predict Response to Chemotherapy: A Validation Study on US Oncology Study 02-103, was presented at the 2010 December San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). In a study conducted between Precision, US Oncology, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, multigene predictors (MGPs) of response to multidrug chemotherapy regimens were developed by correlating in vitro chemoresponse (ChemoFx) microarray gene expression data from 39 different breast cancer cell lines. The predictive values of the MGPs were subsequently assessed via blinded validation by investigators at US Oncology and MD Anderson using patient clinical outcomes (n=66). The conclusion of this study was that cell line-derived MGPs of multi-drug chemotherapy regimens showed promising performance, particularly among patient with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. \"This data is critical to the advancement of research in personalized medicine and for improvements in cancer therapy,\" says Dr. Holly Gallion, Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Precision. \"Because so few patients respond to any given round of chemotherapy, histology alone cannot tell us which patients will respond. When used with ChemoFx, MGPs may have the capacity to accurately identify responders before treatment, thereby helping to minimize the selection of ineffective therapies for cancer patients, and this is one of the main goals in seeking to improve personalized cancer treatment.\" Source: Precision Therapeutics",

Fraser Symmans\u0086, Nan Song*, Shara D. Rice*, Michael J. Gabrin*, Joyce A. O\u0092Shaughnessy\u0087, and Frankie A. Holmes\u0087 * Precision Therapeutics, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA \u0086 MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA \u0087 US Oncology Research, Inc., Houston, TX, USA PURPOSE: Multi-gene predictors (MGPs) of response to multidrug chemotherapy regimens were developed using an in vitro chemoresponse assay in which cell lines were exposed to chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to assess the predictive value of these MGPs using clinical breast cancer patient gene expression data from a clinical trial. METHOD: US Oncology 02-103 was a phase II trial in which women with stage II/III breast cancer were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel/capecitabine (TX). Most HER-2 positive patients also received trastuzumab. MGPs of FEC, TX and TFEC (docetaxel/fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) sensitivity were developed using in vitro assay results from breast cancer cell lines exposed to these drug combinations and publicly-available gene expression data for the same cell lines. MGPs were not developed for trastuzumab treatment. Area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the three MGPs\u0092 to predict patient pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients who did or did not receive trastuzumab were evaluated separately. Validation was performed blindly and the predictors were applied without knowledge of patient clinical outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients had genomic data available and were included in this analysis. The predictive performance of the FEC, TX and TFEC MGPs were AUCs of 0.72, 0.69, and 0.73, respectively, in the patients who received FEC-TX chemotherapy without trastuzumab (n=61). Within this group, higher AUCs were observed in ER-negative patients compared to ER-positive patients (0.69, 0.72, 0.74 vs. 0.64, 0.54, 0.62, respectively). The prediction accuracies were low (AUCs = 0.43, 0.56 and 0.43) for patients who received trastuzumab together with chemotherapy (n=25) as expected, indicating that the MGPs may have the potential to be regimen-specific. CONCLUSION: Cell line-derived MGPs of multidrug chemotherapy regimens showed promising performance in this blinded validation study, particularly among patients with ERnegative breast cancers. Further clinical data are needed to confirm this finding.",

      "Content": "Genentech's clinical experience with antiangiogenesis therapy from clinical trials have prompted their investigators to evaluate tumor rebound following antiangiogenic therapy. So it maybe any antiangiogenic therapy, not just Avastin. Observations were made in a Phase II study (J Clin Oncol 2008;26: 1810-1816) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) treated with a TKI. Investigators observed in several patients with superficial cutaneous or nodal lesions that appeared to respond clinically during periods of treatment, but then grew during a two week period off treatment. Prior to this observation, investigators of a randomized Phase III trial of Avastin with paclitaxel in patients with MBC discussed the lack of an OS benefit in light of a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS (N Engl J Med 207;357:2666-2676). The authors noted the possibility of accelerated tumor regrowth (tumor rebound) compared with chemotherapy alone. It was speculated whether increases in VEGF levels upon discontinuation of Avastin might have resulted in more aggressive disease. What clinical scientists involved with cell culture assays seem to have found that serum from Avastin treated patients actually support endothelial cell growth in cell culture better than serum from control patients, without Avastin treatment. When you get rid of VEGF with Avastin, the body cranks out other types of blood vessel growth (survival) factors. A study by Japanese researchers suggests a better antiangiogenic way to block tumor growth and prevent rebound (Journal of Experimental Medicine, May 11, 2009). They found (in mice) that blocking a different molecule (M-CSF) suppressed tumor growth even after treatment was stopped. Three weeks of anti-VEGF treatment suppressed tumor growth, but the tumors bounced back when the drug treatment was curtailed. Tumor growth on a similar regiment of an M-CSF inhibitor remained suppressed in the absence of the drug. Blocking VEGF can prevent dangerous vessels from growing such as those that feed tumors, but it also stops beneficial vessels from growing, such as those that help injured tissues heal. But it seems that blocking M-CSF only impeds bad vessel growth. Most likely, the anti-M-CSF treatment had a lasting effect because it resulted in damage to the scaffolding that surrounds cancerous vessels, robbing the tumors of the structural support they need to grow. Meanwhile, the scaffold of mice treated with anti-VEGF remained intact. M-CSF levels soar in patients with osteosarcoma (a malignant bone cancer), breast cancer and prostate cancer, making these cancers potentially the most responsive to M-CSF-blocking drugs Whether or not other types of cancer rely more on M-CSF than on VEGF for their blood supply remains unknown. Imatinib Mesylate (Gleevec) is an anti-M-CSF agent. Source: The Rockeffeller University It would be interesting to see if Gleevec (M-CSF inhibitor) + Avastin would damage the scaffolding that surrounds cancerous vessels, robbing the tumors of the structual support they need to grow. If the serum from Avastin + Gleevec does not support endothelial cell growth in cell culture? Cell culture assays have already shown that Tykerb enhances the antivascular activity of Avastin.",

      "Content": "Dr. Len Lichtenfeld of the American Cancer Society, blogged about his experience at the hearing, on June 28th and 29th, held by the FDA on the question of whether or not Avastin should retain approval for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/DrLens...d-Emotion.aspx When the votes were in, the FDA Advisory Committee voted 6-0 that the risks, being substantial, outweighed the benefits associated with a slight slowing of the pace at which metastatic breast tumors progress. Thus, for the Avastin indication granted accelerated approval in 2008 \u0097 metastatic breast cancer \u0097 Avastin is considered unsafe, according to ODAC.said unanimously that the approval of Avastin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer should be withdrawn. http://www.cancer.org/AboutUs/DrLens...-The-Pain.aspx Avastin combined with chemotherapy has improved the survival of some lung cancer patients. Avastin plus folfox has improved survival for some colon cancer patients. Avastin plus chemotherapy improves the survival of some breast cancer patients. The problem is that it doesn\u0092t improve the survival of all cancer patients. Roche has reported that women with breast cancer who were treated with Avastin in combination with chemotherapy followed by the continued use of single-agent Avastin demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival. It\u0092s unclear if Avastin can help increase the overall survival rate in this indication. I remember a clinical oncologist involved with real-time studies under real-world conditions of drugs like Avastin, telling me when the FDA rules on the clinical utility of a drug, they use a broad-brush approach that looks at the global outcomes of all patients, determining whether these glacial trends reflect a true climate change. The problem is that while Bethesda, Maryland may not be noticing significant changes in ocean levels, people who live on the Maldives are having a very different experience. As these scientists ponder the significance of Avastin, some cancer patients are missing out on a treatment that could quite possibly save their lives. One breast cancer patient\u0092s life saving therapy is another\u0092s pulmonary embolism without clinical benefit. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology, we will confront one Avastin after another. The solution to this problem is to investigate the VEGF targeting agents in each individual patient\u0092s tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that vascular targeting will favorably influence each patient\u0092s outcome. In regards to Avastin side effects, any chemotherapeutic has its range of side effects. With Avastin though (and probably most other agents), it was reported in JCO that emerging evidence shows many of the drugs like Avastin may be just as effective and produce fewer side effects if taken over shorter periods and in lower doses. The dose being used for Avastin is 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, despite research showing it may work with 3 milligrams per kilogram. There are selected groups who will benefit from Avastin, if they knew who they were. Genentech/Roch (or whatever flavor of the month they are) researchers have been looking for tests to help predict how patients will respond to Avastin. Some have suggested that they should use the cell-based functional profiling platform (AngioRx Assay) to identify a potential targeted population of cancer patients that it thinks will benefit from Avastin, and then conduct a randomized clinical trial among this group. However, unlike some genetic assays that look whether an individual has a particular mutation or amplification, and therefore tests for \u0093theoretical\u0094 candidates for a particular targeted drug, the functional profiling technique may find Avastin not synergistic (cooperative) and finds some other VEGF-targeted (or multiple VEGF-targeted) drug may work better in an individual cancer patient and then put that individual into the clinical trial. I can understand they may not want some other drug tested on their dime. There are a number of new classes of drugs that target VEGF, at the protein level (Avastin), at the tyrosine kinase level (Nexavar, Sutent) and at the intracellular metabolic pathway mTOR (Afinitor, Torisel). However, responses to any individual mechanism occurs in the miniority of patients. It is unclear why some patients repond to these interventions while others fail. In cell function analysis, it has found unexpectedly good response to conventional cytotoxic drugs following a failure to respond to these targeted agents. This reinforces the need for cancer therapies to be individualized. It remines us that it is the good outcome of the patient not the therapy applied that constitute successful therapy. There is really nothing wrong with Avastin. It\u0092s a wonderful drug that incorporates the brilliant insights originally articulated by Judah Folkman. There are not perfect drugs. There are simply drugs that work for certain patients. But that\u0092s not what pharmaceutical companys like to hear. They like to produce drugs that apply to a broad base of patients. To make the most out of a drug, not just some subsets of patients.",

      "Content": "Many chemotherapy drugs, in addition to killing tumor cells, also fight angiogenesis. However, the anti-angiogenic effects of dose-dense therapy may be masked and marginalized by the way it is usually administered. The main targets of high-dose chemotherapy are presumed to be proliferating tumor cells. The main targets of low-dose chemotherapy are the endothelial cells of the growing vasculature of a tumor. In other words, chemotherapeutics are used as anti-angiogenic agents. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by two distinct types of proteins, referred to as \"angiogenic growth factors\" and \"angiogenesis inhibitors.\" Medical researchers have identified 19 angiogenic growth factors in the human body and 31 angiogenesis inhibitors. In a healthy body, a perfect balance of factors that promote and prevent angiogenesis is maintained. After cells become cancerous, the regulation of this balance is disturbed, stimulating the production of new blood vessels. Targeted therapies, such as Avastin, were originally designed with the goal of replacing chemotherapy, to reduce the serious morbidities associated with standard high-dose chemotherapy. Although targeted therapies may be somewhat less toxic, most of them have been found to have very modest efficacy, at least when used as single agents in treating patients with advanced disease. They have therefore mainly been used in combination with standard chemotherapy or radiation protocols. It is becoming more apparent to administer drugs to patients with certain types of cancer on a weekly schedule. The advantage of low-dose chemotherapy is the possibility of combining it with anti-angiogenic drugs as well as other types of targeted therapies, such as those that target specific signal-transduction molecules or with antitumor vaccines. Blood vessel cells are less likely than tumor cells to become resistant to chemotherapy, so if cancer cells become drug resistant, these medicines should still be able to shrink tumors by destroying their blood supply. When administering both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis drugs, the endothelial cells (involved iin angiogenesis) are the first in the tumor to undergo cell death (apoptosis). Adding Avastin, which only goes after VEGF-sensitive cancer cells, you need to go after other pro-angiogenic factors which can substitute for VEGF: FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL-8, etc. And with Taxol promoting an increase of IL-8, how effective is it with Avastin? With the low-dose protocol having an anti-angiogenic effect, you really wouldn't need to add a drug like Avastin into the mix. Source: Cell Function Analysis",

      "Content": "There have been attempts to develop molecular-based tests to examine a broader range of chemotherapeutic drugs. New technologies for measuring the expression (biological activity) of literally hundreds to thousands of genes as part of a single test. There are two main technologies involved: RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and DNA microarray. The Microarray (gene chips) is a device that measures differences in gene sequence, gene expression or protein expression in biological samples. Microarrays may be used to compare gene or protein expression under different conditions, such as cells found in cancer. Hence the headlong rush to develop tests to identify molecular predisposing mechansims whose presence still does not guarantee that a drug will be effective for an individual patient. Nor can they, for any patient or even large group of patients, discriminate the potential for clinical activity among different agents of the same class. Genetic profiles are able to help doctors determine which patients will probably develop cancer, and those who will most likely relapse. However, it cannot be suitable for specific treatments for \"individual\" patients. The NCI has concluded (J Natl Cancer Inst. March 16, 2010), it cannot determine treatment plans for patients. It cannot test sensitivity to any of the targeted therapies. It just tests for \"theoretical\" candidates for targeted therapy. Some molecular tests do utilize living cells, but generally of individual cancer cells in suspension, sometimes derived from tumors and sometimes derived from circulating tumor cells. This was tried with the human clonogenic assay, which had been discredited long ago. Traditionally, in-vitro (in lab) \"cell-lines\" have been studied in 2 dimensions (2D) which has inherent limitations iin applicability to real life 3D in-vivo (in body) states. Recently, other researchers have pointed to the limitations of 2D \"cell-line\" study and chemotherapy to more correctly reflect the human body. All DNA or RNA-type tests are based on \"population\" research (not individuals). They base their predictions on the fact that a higher percentage of people with similar genetic profiles or specific mutations may tend to respond better to certain drugs. This is not really \"personalized\" medicine, but a refinement of statistical data. The cell \"function\" method is not hampered by the problems associated with gene expression tests. That is because they measure the net effect of all processes within the cancer, acting with and against each other in real time, and it tests living cells actually exposed to drugs and drug combinations of interest. Cancer is already in 3D conformation. Cell-based functional profiling cultures \"fresh\" live tumor cells in 3D conformation and profiles the function of cancer cells (is the whole cell being killed regardless of the targeted mechanism or pathway). It distinguishes between susceptibility of cancer cells to different drugs in the same class and the susceptibility to combinations. In other words, which combinations are best and in what sequence would they be most effective. The key to understanding the genome is understanding how cells work. The ultimate driver is a \"functional\" assay (is the cell being killed regardless of the mechanism) as opposed to a \"target\" assay (does the cell express a particular target that the drug is supposed to be attacking). While a \"target\" assay tells you whether or not to give \"one\" drug, a \"functional\" assay can find other compounds and combinations and can recommend them from the one assay. The core of the functional assay is the cell, composed of hundreds of complex molecules that regulate the pathways necessary for vital cellular functions. If a \"targeted\" drug could perturb any one of these pathways, it is important to examine the effects of the drug within the context of the cell. Both genomics and proteomics can identify potential new therapeutic targets, but these targets require the determination of cellular endpoints. Cell-based functional assays are being used for screening compounds for efficacy and biosafety. The ability to track the behavior of cancer cells permits data gathering on functional behavior not available in any other kind of assay. The reason for at least a \"tru-cut\" biopsied tumor specimen is that \"real life\" 3D analysis makes functional profiling indicative of what will happen in the body. It tests fresh \"live\" cells in their 3 dimensional (3D), floating clusters (iin their natural state). Upgrading clinical therapy by using drug sensitivity assays measuring cell-death of 3 dimenionsl microclusters of live \"fresh\" tumor cells can improve the conventional situation by allowing more drugs to be considered. We are forced to confront the realization that genotype does not equal phenotype. The particular sequence of DNA that an organism possess (genotype) does not determine what bodily or behaviorial form (phenotype) the organism will finally display. Among other things, environmental influences can cause the suppression of some gene functions and the activation of others. Out knowledge of genomic complexity tells us that genes and parts of genes interact with other genes, as do their protein products, and the whole system is constantly being affected by internal and external environmental factors. The gene may not be central to the phenotype at all, or at least it shares the spotlight with other influences. Environmental tissue and cytoplasmic factors clearly dominate the phenotypic expression processes, which may in turn, be affected by a variety of unpredictable protein-interaction events. This view is not shared by all molecular biologists, who disagree about the precise roles of genes and other factors, but it signals many scientists discomfort with a strictly deterministic view of the role of genes in an organism's functioning. Until such time as cancer patients are selected for therapies predicated upon their own unique biology (and not population studies), we will confront one targeted drug after another. The solution to this problem has been to investigate the targeting agents in each individual patient's tissue culture, alone and in combination with other drugs, to gauge the likelihood that the targeting will favorably influence each patient's outcome. Functional profiling results to date in patients with a multitude type of cancers suggest this to be a highly productive direction.

      "Content": "In 2008, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Avastin to be used in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy for the treatment of patients who have not received chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. The approval was based on a phase III study (the E2100 study) of 722 patients with metastatic breast cancer randomly assigned to receive Avastin with paclitaxel chemotherapy or paclitaxel alone. A doubling in progression-free survival was observed in patients who received Avastin in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy compared to patents who recieved paclitaxel alone (1). Progression-free survival is the length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a disease that does not get worse. Essentially, progression-free survival measures how long it takes for a tumor to start growing again. However, this result doesn\u0092t mean that women taking Avastin lived longer. A doubling in progression-free survival simply means that it took twice as long for the tumor to progress. In fact, there was no increase in overall survival. Moreover, those women who received Avastin experienced a higher overall incidence of toxicities as well as more severe toxicities. A second phase III trial, the (Avastin plus Docetaxel) AVADO trial, investigated the benefits of combining Avastin with a different chemotherapy, docetaxel, in over 700 previously untreated patients HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (2). In the primary analysis (data cut-off point: October 2007; median follow-up of 10.2 months), treatment with Avastin significantly increased progression-free survival compared to patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy alone (3). However, more recent analysis of the patient population evaluating overall survival (data cut off point: April 2009; median follow-up of 25 months) failed to define a statistically meaningful benefit (4). A third phase III trial, the RIBBON-1 trial, evaluated chemotherapy (assigned at the discretion of a physician: either a taxane, an anthracycline or capecitabine) with or without Avastin for first-line treatment of stage IV HER2-negative locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (5). Avastin plus capecitabine compared with placebo plus capecitabine, and Avastin plus taxane or anthracycline versus placebo plus a taxane or anthracycline significantly improved progression-free survival but had no effect on overall survival. In both the AVADO and RIBBON-1 trials, women receiving Avastin had an increased risk of death; 0.8% of women in AVADO and 1.2% of women in RIBBON-1 died from side effects thought to be related to Avastin (6). A fourth phase III trial, the RIBBON-2 trial, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with chemotherapy for second-line treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer also significantly improved progression-free survival but failed to show statistically significant improvement of overall survival (4). Thus, Avastin reproducibly increases progression-free survival but, on average, doesn\u0092t keep women with metastatic breast cancer alive any longer than chemo alone. The problem with Avastin is that doctors don\u0092t know which patients will respond favorably in terms of overall survival. In the majority of patients, Avastin increases progression-free survival but has no effect on overall survival. When the FDA started discussing the possibility of withdrawing the indication for Avastin, critics of the agency accused them of rationing healthcare, claiming that it was Avastin\u0092s high cost (as much as $100,000 a year), not its limited benefit, that the FDA cared about. Although the issue clearly revolves around Avastin\u0092s survival benefit, the FDA should be concerned about costs. Healthcare costs endanger U.S. financial stability. Simply ignoring the skyrocketing costs of healthcare and focusing exclusively on the treatment benefits, however small \u0097 in this case the average survival benefit is zero \u0097 will have a devastating effect on the U.S. economy. Avastin should be placed in a restricted-access program so that patents already on the drug and benefiting from it can maintain access to it. Pharmacogenomics should be used to identify the best candidate patient population and a subsequent study should then be undertaken to determine biomarkers that have clinical utility in measuring the efficacy of Avastin in those patients. Several candidate biomarkers have already been described, including tumor and plasma VEGF, circulating E-selectin, ICAM 1 and VCAM1 (7). We consider this a realistic and rational approach to provide effective, personalized therapy while simultaneously managing healthcare costs. Indeed, patient advocacy organizations called for the use of personalized medicine stratetiges back in August to keep Avastin on the market for those who are most likely to benefit from the disease (8-9): We recognize the benefits of Avastin overall are modest for women with metastatic breast cancer. However, we do know that for some women, Avastin offers a greater benefit, but we do not yet know how to determine which patients will experience greater benefits. We have much more to learn about the drug and how individual patients respond to the drug, such as why some women receive greater benefit while others do not. Moving into the world of personalized medicine, cancer treatments will be more tailored to the characteristics of patients\u0092 individual tumors. Yet, due to the current state of the science, we don\u0092t always know which patients will benefit most before a drug is made commercially available. As with all medicines, we encourage a thoughtful discussion between a woman and her doctor that carefully considers the benefits and the risks. FDA approval is not a requirement for a doctor to prescribe a drug. However, the panel\u0092s decision could limit the so-called \u0093off-label\u0094 use of Avastin for metastatic breast cancer, or ovarian cancer, for which Avastin is currently prescribed off label, if third party payers refuse to cover the cost of treatment.

      "Content": "Three-dimensional (3D) analysis increases the accuracy of cell culture assays. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Washington University in St. Louis have recently found out, our body is 3D, not 2D in form, undoubtedly, this novel step better replicates that of the human body. Traditionally, in-vitro (in lab) cell-lines have been studied in two-dimensions (2D) which had inherent limitations in applicability to real-life 3D in-vivo (in body) states. Recently, other researchers have pointed to the limitations of 2D cell-line study and chemotherapy to more correctly reflect the human body. All of the work in the past twenty years in the cell culture field has been carried out largely on three-dimensional clusters of cells (not monolayers). Work is done exclusively with three-dimensional, floating, tumor spheroids. Functonal profiling has been utilized for \"drug selection\" and not \"drug discovery,\" although it does provide a novel, real-time view of how tumors act within their natural microenvironment. This information can accelerate drug development process and improve clinical therapy. Real-world studies are not being performed under real-world conditions. No one is publishing real-world studies, except private laboratories performing cell-based analysis, which can only do real-world studies, because their studies require fresh, viable specimen, which must be accessioned and tested in real-time under real-world conditions. http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/192565.php",

      "Content": "[Dr. Robert A. Nagourney is medical director at Rational Therapeutics and instructor in Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. He posted on his blog about the issue surrounding Avastin.] We previously wrote about bevacizumab (Avastin) and its approval for breast cancer. The early clinical trials revealed evidence of improved time to disease progression. This surrogate measure for survival benefit had, over recent years, gained popularity, as time to disease progression is a measure of the impact of a given treatment upon the patient\u0092s response durability. It was hoped and believed that time to progression would be an early measure of survival. Unfortunately, the survival advantage for the Avastin-based therapies in breast cancer has not met statistical significance. As such, careful review by the oncology drug committee of the FDA lead to a unanimous decision to remove Avastin\u0092s indication in breast cancer. Avastin has not been removed from the market, but instead, cannot be promoted or advertised, nor do insurers necessarily reimburse it. This decision, however, will have a very big impact on Medicare patients and many others who are in managed care programs (HMOs). There are no villains here. Instead, dedicated physicians empowered to scrutinize the best data could not prove beyond any doubt that the drug improved survival. The time to progression data was favorable and the survival data also trended in a favorable direction. But, the final arbiter of clinical approval \u0097 statistically significant survival \u0097 was not met. The physicians who want to provide this for the patients, the company that produces the drug and the patients who believe it offers benefit all have legitimate positions. As Jerome Groopman, MD, once said, in a similar situation with regard to the FDA approval of interleukin 2 (a biological agent with profound activity in a small minority of melanoma and renal cell cancer patients), \u0093I am confronted with a dilemma of biblical proportions, how to help the few at the expense of the many.\u0094 The Avastin saga is but one example of what will occur repeatedly. The one-size-fits-all paradigm is crumbling as individual patients with unique biological features confront the results of the blunt instrument of randomized clinical trials. Our laboratory has been deeply involved in these stories for 20 years. When we first observed synergy for purine analogs (2CDA and fludarabine) with cytoxan, and then recommended and used this doublet in advanced hematologic malignancies (highly successfully, we might add) we were a lone voice in the woods. Eventually, clinical trials conducted at M.D. Anderson and other centers confirmed the activity establishing these treatments as the standards of care for CLL and low-grade lymphoma. The exact same experience occurred in our solid tumor work when we combined cisplatin plus gemcitabine in pancreatic, ovarian, breast, bladder, lung and other cancers. While our first patient (presumably the first patient in the world) received cisplatin plus gemcitabine for drug-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer in 1995 \u0097 providing her an additional five years of life \u0097 it wasn\u0092t until 2006 that the FDA approved the closely related carboplatin plus gemcitabine for this indication. We now confront an even greater hurdle. With our discoveries, using novel combinations of targeted agents, we are years (perhaps decades) ahead of the clinical trial process. We know that patients evaluated in our laboratory with favorable profiles can respond to some of the newest drugs, many of which have already completed Phase I of clinical trials. It is our fervent belief that we could accelerate the drug development process if we could join with the pharmaceutical companies and the FDA to put these hypotheses to a formal test. Again, there are no villains here. Patients want, and should, receive active drugs. Doctors should be allowed to give them. The drug companies want to sell their agents and the FDA wants to see good therapies go forward. The rancor that surrounds these emotionally charged issues will best be resolved when we introduce techniques that match patients to active therapies. We believe that the primary culture platform used in our laboratory, and a small number of dedicated investigators like us, may be the answer to this dilemma. We will redouble our efforts to apply these methods for our patients and encourage our patients to lobby their health care insurers and representatives to sponsor these approaches. To date, we have been unsuccessful in convincing any cooperative group to test the predictive ability of these selection methodologies. In response, I reiterate that I will gladly participate and, to the best of my ability, support at least the laboratory component of any fair test of our primary culture methodologies. We stand at the ready for the challenge.",

      "Content": "According to Merriall Goozner (who occasionaly writes for the Journal of the National Cancer Institute), two clinical trials showed no improvement in mortality among women with metastatic breast cancer. Those trials didn\u0092t even replicate the delay in progression of disease that had been shown in the original trial that led to accelerated approval in 2007. Now comes the firestorm from patient advocacy groups, who will use anecdotal stories to claim the drug works for some women. Here\u0092s the truth of those matters: Anecdotes are not science. Those who insist their use of the drug is the reason why they are remaining alive longer than average will still have access to the drug since most insurance companies and Medicare will continue to follow the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. NCCN\u0092s guideline writing committee, a third of whom have financial ties to Roche/Genentech, has said it will not withdraw Avastin\u0092s use in metastatic patients. A few years ago, CMS passed a rule that said it would reimburse any use of a cancer drug, even if the FDA had not approved it for that use, if it was included in the NCCN guidelines and accompanying formulary. http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/UCM279485 One breast cancer patient\u0092s life saving therapy is another\u0092s pulmonary embolism without clinical benefit.

Skin Tumors Induced by Sorafenib; Paradoxical RAS-RAF Pathway Activation and Oncogenic Mutations of HRAS, TP53 and TGFBR1 Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Nov 17;[Epub Ahead of Print], JP Arnault, C Mateus, B Escudier, G Tomasic, J Wechsler, E Hollville, J-C Soria, D Malka, A Sarasin, M Larcher, J Andree, N Kamsu-Kom, L Boussemart, L Lacroix, A Spatz, A Eggermont, S Druilenec, S Vagner, A Eychene, N Dumaz, C Robert The RAF inhibitor sorafenib, used to treat patients with metastatic renal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, paradoxically activates the MAP-kinase pathway in keratinocytes, leading to cell proliferation associated with the development of skin lesions. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE The RAF inhibitor sorafenib, used to treat patients with metastatic renal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, paradoxically activates the MAP-kinase pathway in keratinocytes, leading to cell proliferation associated with the development of skin lesions. EXPERT COMMENTARY Lee Schwartzberg, MD, Editor-in-Chief Novel targeted therapies, once assumed to have few off-target effects, are now known to have novel toxicities. The oncology community must learn to manage these as we have developed strategies to handle the major toxicities of cytotoxic chemotherapy. This paper in Clinical Cancer Research demonstrates that mechanisms of toxicity from tyrosine kinase inhibitors like sorafenib may work differently on normal tissues compared to malignant ones, causing cell proliferation and even tumors in association with other stimuli. Such translational research is crucial if we are to develop next generation targeted therapies with improved therapeutic indices. The reversible pan-RAF inhibitor sorafenib, as well as two selective BRAF inhibitors, have been associated with the emergence of skin tumors. Sorafenib is used to treat metastatic renal carcinoma and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Some 6% to 7% of patients on sorafenib develop borderline cutaneous keratoacanthomas (KA) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) during treatment. It seems paradoxical that such skin lesions would occur while patients were receiving an antiproliferative agent. Arnault et al performed a detailed clinical, pathological, and molecular study of sorafenib-related skin tumors to better understand their mechanisms of induction. They examined 31 skin lesions, diagnosed as follicular cystic skin lesions, perforating folliculitis, KA, or SCC; the lesions were derived from 17 patients treated with sorafenib from 2005 to 2010. All 17 patients developed small cystic follicular lesions 3 to 5 months after starting sorafenib. A total of 11 patients had at least one lesion characteristic of KA or of KA-like SCC; 3 of these patients had multiple skin lesions occurring 1 to 9 months after sorafenib was initiated. Pathological examination of 22 of the lesions showed a range of diagnoses, including noninflammatory cystic hair follicles, cystic folliculitis and perforating folliculitis, KA, and KA-like SCC. Of the patients, 1 had the entire spectrum of lesions, all of which disappeared within 4 months after sorafenib was stopped. Eight oncogenic mutations were found in the lesions studied, both benign and malignant: three HRAS mutations, three TP53, and two TGFBR1. Ki67 staining of normal skin samples from patients treated with sorafenib or placebo showed significantly more Ki67-positive keratinocytes and more proliferating cells in the patients treated with sorafenib compared with those taking placebo. When HaCat keratinocytes were treated in vitro with increasing amounts of sorafenib, BRAF\u0096CRAF heterodimerization was induced in a dose-dependent manner; no heterodimers were detected in DMSO-treated cells. Treatment with sorafenib stimulated CRAF activity, also in a dose-dependent manner, which paralleled BRAF\u0096CRAF dimerization and confirmed that dimerization activates CRAF in keratinocytes. To study the effect of this CRAF activation on the MAP-kinase pathway, ERK phosphorylation was measured in response to sorafenib at three different doses. ERK was transiently activated at all three doses, but the effect was more pronounced at the lower doses. In addition, proliferation of HaCat cells was increased with the lowest sorafenib dose and inhibited with the two higher doses. Based on the results, the authors propose the following model: BRAF wild-type skin keratinocytes exposed to low sorafenib levels (as might be found in the skin) activate the MAP-kinase pathway via BRAF\u0096CRAF dimerization; this activates CRAF, which, in turn, leads to keratinocyte proliferation. Additional events, including possibly UV-induced oncogenic mutations, might influence the progression of benign lesions to more proliferative and malignant tumors. Of note, six of the mutations found in the samples are known to be potentially UV-induced, and the six lesions harboring these mutations were located on sun-exposed areas. Conversely, the two lesions with mutations lacking a UV signature were found on skin areas not exposed to the sun. Thus, the authors recommend that patients receiving sorafenib or other RAF inhibitors should protect their skin from sun exposure. http://www.oncologystat.com/journals...nd_TGFBR1.html",

      "Content": "An article appearing in the Journal of Internal Medicine reported that until the Microvascular Viability Assay (MVA) test, there have been the lack of a relevant and practical system for testing anti-microvascular drugs against human tumors in which to discover synergistic anti-microvascular drug combinations. According to Dr. Larry Weisenthal, MD, PhD., developer of the test, it works by measuring drug effects upon endothelial cells which make up blood vessels. The MVA test is both relevant and practical for use in discovering synergistic drug combinations and identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from which drug combinations. Dr. Weisenthal says he would like to see the test become available to patients worldwide through service agreements with larger laboratory companies or with a biotechnology company which might develop a testing kit for sale to hospitals and laboratories. He also would like to license the test to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development. It has been suggested perhaps Genentech/Roche should use assays like MVA to identify a potential target population of breast cancer patients that it thinks will benefit from the drug Avastin and then conduct a randomized clinical trial among this group.

E-mail: [email protected] Abstract Background: Central nervous system (CNS) disease as the site of first relapse after exposure to adjuvant trastuzumab has been reported. We carried out comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the risk of CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant trastuzumab. Methods: Eligible studies include randomized trials of adjuvant trastuzumab administered for 1 year to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who reported CNS metastases as first site of disease recurrence. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using fixed-effects inverse variance and random-effects models. Results: A total of 9020 patients were included. The incidence of CNS metastases as first site of disease recurrence in HER2-positive patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab was 2.56% (95% CI 2.07% to 3.01%) compared with 1.94% (95% CI 1.54% to 2.38%) in HER2-positive patients who did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab. The RR of the CNS as first site of relapse in trastuzumab-treated patients was 1.35 [95% CI 1.02\u00961.78, P = 0.038] compared with control arms without trastuzumab therapy. The ratio of CNS metastases to total number of recurrence events was 16.94% (95% CI 10.85% to 24.07%) and 8.33% (95% CI 6.49% to 10.86%) for the trastuzumab-treated and control groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found based on trastuzumab schedule or median follow-up time. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Conclusions: Adjuvant trastuzumab is associated with a significant increased risk of CNS metastases as the site of first recurrence in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

Patients and Methods: We considered all 9,620 women with HL recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results dataset in 1973\u00962007. We calculated age-period standardized incidence ratios of BC. We compared patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, risk of second BC, and prognosis between patients with BC after HL (n = 316) and patients with other BCs occurring during the same period (n = 450,413) using logistic regression and Cox models adjusted for confounders. Results: HL patients had a 2.4-fold higher risk for developing BC (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2\u00962.7) than the general population. Age at HL diagnosis and radiation therapy influenced this risk. Compared with first primary BCs, BCs after HL were diagnosed at a younger age, at an earlier stage, were less frequently hormone receptor positive, were located more frequently in external quadrants, and were less frequently treated using radiotherapy. These patients had a higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.85; 95% CI, 1.79\u00964.53) for developing a second BC and had a higher BC mortality risk (adjusted HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.05\u00961.76). The higher mortality risk was only partly explained by the higher occurrence rate of a second BC. Conclusion: HL survivors have a higher risk for developing BC, their BCs are more aggressive, they have a higher risk for a second BC occurrence, and they have a poorer prognosis. Guidelines of care should be adapted to decrease the impact of BC in these high-risk patients.

      "Content": "Treating breast cancer with a combination of chemotherapy and Avastin is not clinically meaningful, according a document published by the FDA. The FDA said the level of improvement in women treated with chemotherapy and Avastin was not significantly better than in women who received chemotherapy alone. In addition, women who took Avastin experienced more serious side effects, such as bleeding. Avastin received \"accelerated approval\" in 2008 for the treatment of breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel (Taxol). Accelerated approval is granted to drugs based on initial positive studies and drugmakers must submit additional data for full approval. The drug's manufacturer submitted two follow-up studies for full approval of Avastin. The FDA said the follow-up research failed to confirm the magnitude of the benefits observed in the initial study used for accelerated approval. Investigators of a randomized, phase III trial of Avastin with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer discussed the lack of an overall survival benefit in light of a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression free survival. The authors noted the possibility of accelerated tumor regrowth (tumor rebound) compared with chemotherapy alone. It was speculated whether increased in VEGF levels upon discontinuation of Avatin might have resulted in more aggressive disease (Miller K, Wang M, Gralow J, et al. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab versus paclitaxel alone for metastatic breast cancer. N Engl J Med 2007;357:2666-2676). Serum from Avastin treated patients actually support endothelial cell growth in cell culture better than serum from control patients, without Avastin treatment. When you get rid of VEGF with Avastin, the body cranks out other types of blood vessel growth/survival factors. It will take combination antivascular therapy to make a big difference, but this is definitely coming and it's the most promising thing on the near term therapeutic horizon. However, there are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF and independent of angiogenesis. Tumors can acquire a blood supply by three different mechanisms: angiogenesis; co-option of existing blood vessels; and vasculogenic mimicry. All must be inhibited to consistently starve tumors of oxygen. Instead of growing new blood vessels, tumor cells can just grow along existing blood vessels. This process, called co-option, cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. Some types of cancers form channels that carry blood, but are not actual blood vessels. Drugs that target new blood vessel formation also cannot stop this process, called vasculogeneic mimicry. Actual results in patients count and theory doesn't matter as much as the evidence that it does what we want it to do. It would be more advantegeous to sort out what's the best profile in terms of which patients benefit from this drug. Some scientists are not sure whether Avastin or any other anti-angiogenic agents are working primarily by pruning new blood vessels, increasing the delivery of another anti-cancer therapy, or potentially another mechanism. Clinical oncologists involved with functional tumor cell profiling analysis, can actually examine this. They have a method for testing anti-angiogenic/anti-microvascular agents, such as Avastin and testing for synergy between different anti-microvascular agents on an individual patient, individual tumor basis. Avastin appears to better deliver the effects of other classes of drugs. Avastin facilitates vascular access of cytotoxics to tumors. It will take combination antivascular therapy to make a big difference, but this is definitely coming and it's the most promising thing on the near term therapeutic horizon. As for Avastin's side effects. Evidence in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows that many of the highly expensive targeted drugs like Avastin may be just as effective and produce fewer side effects if taken over shorter periods and in lower doses. Avastin is one example. The dose being used is 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, despite research showing it may work with 3 milligrams per kilogram. In any case the issue with all these targeted drugs is we need better biomarkers to pick which patients are more likely to benefit from them to get the most for our buck. The new targeted drugs mostly need to be combined with active chemotherapy to provide any benefit and the need for predictive tests for individualized therapy selection has increased. Given the technical and conceptual advantages of cell-based functional profiling assays, together with their performance and modest efficacy of therapy prediction based on analysis of genome expression, there is reason for renewed interest in them for optimized use of medical treatment of malignant disease. Cell culture assays are a \"functional\" biomarker. A functional biomarker providing information about the biomarker uptake rate in tumor cells or on tumor cell surfaces through fluorescence intensity changes. In vitro apoptosis for choosing drugs is not different than a marker like estrogen receptor or CD20 or a gene expression pattern. They are all markers. One is a structural marker, the other is a functional marker. There is no conceptual difference regarding the sort of study and data which is required to \"validate\" any of them. Over the past few years, gene expression profiling has been suggested as the best way of determing ex vivo drug sensitivity. However due to most patients being treated with combination chemotherapy, this methodology cannot even be calibrated without the use of \"functional profiling\" cell culture assays, which can integrate all the gene expression into one convenient test result.

ISSN 1527-2729 Antivascular activity of lapatinib and bevacizumab in primary microcluster cultures of breast cancer and other human neoplasms ASCO 2008 Breast Cancer Symposium Abstract No: 166 Note: The problem with Avastin is the same thing that was a problem with AZT for HIV/AIDS. Early results, then rapid resistance. The solution is \"combination therapy\" to attack all the different targets. Tumor vasculature needs VEGF to survive. Avastin removes VEGF, killing blood vessels. But other pro-angiogenic factors can substitute for VEGF: FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL-8 etc. We need to attack these other targets as well. If you can achieve this, then you really don't need the other drugs, which really don't get into the tumor so well. But angiogenic attack provides true selective toxicity, something which is sorely lacking with all of the other treatments. Again, it's going to take \"combination\" antivascular therapy to make the big difference. It's already here and the most promising thing on the therapeutic horizon",

      "Content": "Precision Therapeutics Announces New Study On Multi-Gene Predictors At 2010 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium In a new study in which Precision Therapeutics' Multi-Gene Predictors (MGPs) were independently validated by investigators at US Oncology and MD Anderson, Precision highlights the potential role of the ChemoFx in vitro chemosensitivity test and multi-gene predictors in determining a patient's likelihood of response to multi-drug chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer. The study, titled, Multi-Gene Predictors Developed from Breast Cancer Cell Lines to Predict Response to Chemotherapy: A Validation Study on US Oncology Study 02-103, was presented at the 2010 December San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). In a study conducted between Precision, US Oncology, and MD Anderson Cancer Center, multigene predictors (MGPs) of response to multidrug chemotherapy regimens were developed by correlating in vitro chemoresponse (ChemoFx) microarray gene expression data from 39 different breast cancer cell lines. The predictive values of the MGPs were subsequently assessed via blinded validation by investigators at US Oncology and MD Anderson using patient clinical outcomes (n=66). The conclusion of this study was that cell line-derived MGPs of multi-drug chemotherapy regimens showed promising performance, particularly among patient with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers. \"This data is critical to the advancement of research in personalized medicine and for improvements in cancer therapy,\" says Dr. Holly Gallion, Vice President of Clinical Affairs at Precision. \"Because so few patients respond to any given round of chemotherapy, histology alone cannot tell us which patients will respond. When used with ChemoFx, MGPs may have the capacity to accurately identify responders before treatment, thereby helping to minimize the selection of ineffective therapies for cancer patients, and this is one of the main goals in seeking to improve personalized cancer treatment.\" Source: Precision Therapeutics",

      "Content": "As Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical and laboratory director at Rational Therapeutics, and instructor of Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine describes it, recent press coverage from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) touched upon the development of multi-gene predictors for clinical response in breast cancer. One report from that meeting described correlations between a laboratory assay model in use at the University of Pittsburgh and microarray analyses. However, the suggestion that this laboratory technique - described by its proponents as a chemosensitivity assay - could accurately identify gene profiles that would predict response seems at odds with the current literature. Although the press coverage concluded that this technique showed \u0093promising performance\u0094 it was largely exploratory and defined by the authors as a \u0093validation study.\u0094 What is interesting is that a team of highly reputable investigators from M.D. Anderson recently reported a very negative study using a similar approach of identifying target genes in cell lines and then correlating them with patient outcomes. In the paper, published in the June 2010 issue of Breast Cancer Research and Treatment (Liedtke, C. et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jun; 121(2):301-9) the authors reported \u0093cell line derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.\u0094 Indeed, differential gene expression seemed only to correlate with paclitaxel. The authors found that false discovery rates were high for all other drugs tested. Thus, the report from the SABCS will need to be carefully examined to determine whether truly relevant clinically predictive information can be provided by this particular laboratory platform.",

Holmes\u0087 * Precision Therapeutics, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA \u0086 MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA \u0087 US Oncology Research, Inc., Houston, TX, USA PURPOSE: Multi-gene predictors (MGPs) of response to multidrug chemotherapy regimens were developed using an in vitro chemoresponse assay in which cell lines were exposed to chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to assess the predictive value of these MGPs using clinical breast cancer patient gene expression data from a clinical trial. METHOD: US Oncology 02-103 was a phase II trial in which women with stage II/III breast cancer were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by four cycles of docetaxel/capecitabine (TX). Most HER-2 positive patients also received trastuzumab. MGPs of FEC, TX and TFEC (docetaxel/fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide) sensitivity were developed using in vitro assay results from breast cancer cell lines exposed to these drug combinations and publicly-available gene expression data for the same cell lines. MGPs were not developed for trastuzumab treatment. Area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the performance of the three MGPs\u0092 to predict patient pathologic complete response (pCR). Patients who did or did not receive trastuzumab were evaluated separately. Validation was performed blindly and the predictors were applied without knowledge of patient clinical outcome. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients had genomic data available and were included in this analysis. The predictive performance of the FEC, TX and TFEC MGPs were AUCs of 0.72, 0.69, and 0.73, respectively, in the patients who received FEC-TX chemotherapy without trastuzumab (n=61). Within this group, higher AUCs were observed in ER-negative patients compared to ER-positive patients (0.69, 0.72, 0.74 vs. 0.64, 0.54, 0.62, respectively). The prediction accuracies were low (AUCs = 0.43, 0.56 and 0.43) for patients who received trastuzumab together with chemotherapy (n=25) as expected, indicating that the MGPs may have the potential to be regimen-specific. CONCLUSION: Cell line-derived MGPs of multidrug chemotherapy regimens showed promising performance in this blinded validation study, particularly among patients with ERnegative breast cancers. Further clinical data are needed to confirm this finding.",

      "Content": "As Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical and laboratory director at Rational Therapeutics, and instructor of Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine describes it, recent press coverage from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) touched upon the development of multi-gene predictors for clinical response in breast cancer. One report from that meeting described correlations between a laboratory assay model in use at the University of Pittsburgh and microarray analyses. However, the suggestion that this laboratory technique - described by its proponents as a chemosensitivity assay - could accurately identify gene profiles that would predict response seems at odds with the current literature. Although the press coverage concluded that this technique showed \u0093promising performance\u0094 it was largely exploratory and defined by the authors as a \u0093validation study.\u0094 What is interesting is that a team of highly reputable investigators from M.D. Anderson recently reported a very negative study using a similar approach of identifying target genes in cell lines and then correlating them with patient outcomes. In the paper, published in the June 2010 issue of Breast Cancer Research and Treatment (Liedtke, C. et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2010 Jun; 121(2):301-9) the authors reported \u0093cell line derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.\u0094 Indeed, differential gene expression seemed only to correlate with paclitaxel. The authors found that false discovery rates were high for all other drugs tested. Thus, the report from the SABCS will need to be carefully examined to determine whether truly relevant clinically predictive information can be provided by this particular laboratory platform.",

      "Content": "Multigene predictors of patient response to chemotherapy derived from breast cancer cell lines combining knowledge-based and data-driven methods Nan Song, Shara Rice, Dave Gingrich, Dakun Wang, Chunqiao Tian, Zhenyu Ding, Stacey Brower, Paul Ervin, Shuguang Huang, Mike Gabrin, Kui Shen Precision Therapeutics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA Background: Responses of breast cancer patients to chemotherapy treatments vary considerably, and population treatment response rates remain low. To improve patient outcomes, genomic profiles have been used to identify patients who would benefit from specific treatments. Several studies have used cancer cell lines to develop pharmacogenomic predictors by identifying genes associated with drug response. However, pharmacogenomic predictors derived by this data-driven approach may not readily elucidate the underlying mechanisms associated with drug responses, because the identified predictors by computational methods may not directly associate with drug responses considering the complex genetic regulatory network. To overcome this issue, we proposed a strategy to integrate data-driven methods with biological knowledge- based approaches to identify genomic predictors. We then applied this approach to breast cancer cell lines to identify genomic predictors of paclitaxel-5-ﬂuorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (TFAC) from breast cancer cell lines, the identified predictors are then evaluated by their ability to predict the clinical outcome of the breast cancer patients who are treated by TFAC. Material: Thirty immortalized breast cancer cell lines were exposed to various concentrations of TFAC using a chemosensitivity assay. Area under the dose-response curves was calculated to measure chemoresponses. Gene expression profiles of the 30 cell lines, the expression profiles as well as the pathologic complete response (pCR) information of 133 breast cancer patients treated by TFAC were publicly available. Methods: We performed pathway enrichment analysis in breast cancer cell lines to assess the association between drug response and curated gene sets predefined by molecular signature database. Pathways with p-value less than 0.01 were considered enriched. The genes from the enriched pathways whose expression values were highly correlated with drug sensitivity were selected as the pharmacogenomic predictors. To validate these predictors, the performances of their prediction for patients\u0092 pCR were evaluated using principle component regression method. Results: Using pathway enrichment analysis, 17 pathways were identified to be related to TFAC drug response. These pathways are related to different biological functions, including breast cancer ER status and BRCA type, immune response, differentiation, and drug response. Using supervised principal component regression, 59 genes involved in at least one of these 17 pathways were selected as genomic predictors. The prediction accuracy of patient pCR was 0.70, sensitivity was 0.71, and specificity was 0.70. Conclusion: By combining knowledge-based and data-driven methods, we have identified 59 genes from breast cancer cell lines as pharmacogenomic predictors of drug response to TFAC. These results support the viability of using breast cancer cell lines to predict breast cancer patient response to chemotherapy. Further functional study of these pharmacogenomic predictors will extend our understanding of individual drug response and facilitate personalized treatment.",

      "Content": "Feasibility assessment of pharmacogenomic predictors developed from breast cancer cell lines to predict breast cancer patient pathological response in neoadjuvant chemotherapy Nan Song, Shara Rice, Dave Gingrich, Dakun Wang, Chunqiao Tian, Zhenyu Ding, Stacey Brower, Paul Ervin, Shuguang Huang, Mike Gabrin, Kui Shen Precision Therapeutics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA Background: Studies of developing pharmacogenomic predictors from cancer cell lines to predict cancer patient clinical response and outcome to chemotherapy have yielded both positive and negative results. The variability in these results may arise from the noise inherent of microarray technology as well as the small sample size of in cell line studies. Therefore, it is greatly needed to evaluate the feasibility of using cell lines to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of patient pathological response. Material and Methods: Thirty breast cancer cell lines were exposed to 10 concentrations of paclitaxel-5-fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (TFAC) to measure in vitro chemosensitivity. Two independent and publicly available microarray datasets (Hoeflich and Neve) on these breast cancer cell lines together with the chemosensitivity results were used to identify pharmacogenomic predictors from each dataset. Two independent clinical trials (Hess and Popovici) with publically available data, having 130 and 100 patients respectively, were used as test sets to validate the accuracy of the pharmacogenomic predictors. All patients received TFAC as neoadjuvant therapy and the gene expression profiles of patients were assessed before receiving chemotherapy treatment. The patient\u0092s pathological complete response (pCR) was determined after treatment to evaluate the chemotherapy efficacy. The pharmacogenomic predictors developed from each of the cell line studies were evaluated for their ability to predict patient pCR in each of the clinical trials using the supervised principle component regression method. Results: The pharmacogenomic predictors identified from the Hoeflich and Neve cell line data (training sets) predicted pCR of the patients in the two clinical trials (test sets) with 64%-68% accuracy, 70%-87% sensitivity, and 60%-67% specificity when 100 genes were selected as pharmacogenomic predictors. Conclusions: The four independent prediction results generated in this study demonstrate the feasibility of using breast cancer cell lines to identify pharmacogenomic predictors of response to chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer patients. Future studies will examine the use of drug responses from primary cultures of patient tumors to develop pharmacogenomic predictors of breast cancer patient responses to chemotherapy treatment.

      "Content": "New analyses of data from 2 large trials have found no association between the CYP2D6 genotype and the effectiveness of tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer recurrence, in contrast to several previous positive studies. The new findings come from retrospective analyses of 2 huge trials \u0097 the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial comparing tamoxifen and anastrozole, and the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial comparing tamoxifen and letrozole. They were presented at the 33rd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS): Abstracts S1-7 and S1-8. Presented December 9, 2010. The fact that both studies were negative led experts to recommend that CYP2D6 testing not be used routinely to decide whether or not to prescribe tamoxifen. Even the strongest proponent of this approach, Matthew Goetz, MD, from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who led the original studies showing an association, concedes. Although criticizing some aspects of the new analyses in a discussion after the presentation, he concluded that physicians should not routinely test for CYP2D6 status before deciding whether to prescribe tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, an approach that he had been advocating until now. \"We should stop offering these tests outside of clinical trials,\" Edith Perez, MD, from the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, told Medscape Medical News. The rationale behind CYP2D6 testing is that women who have an inherited deficiency of this gene are poor metabolizers of tamoxifen, and have lower levels of the active metabolite endoxifen. In previous positive studies, including those by Dr. Goetz and colleagues, these poor metabolizers have shown less benefit from tamoxifen and higher rates of breast cancer recurrence. This has always been a controversial area. To date, there have been 14 separate studies that have shown this association; however, 15 other studies have not found this effect, Dr. Goetz told the meeting. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/734021?src=ptalk",

      "Content": "Medical research has focused a great deal on developing DNA (genomic) tests to identify various gene expressions, markers and mutations relevant to a person\u0092s cancer. The hope is that genetic information will enable researchers to better predict how an individual will respond to various treatment options. However, when it comes to predicting the best treatment for the individual, unlocking the complexities of a person\u0092s DNA is not the answer, it is simply a starting point. In fact, a March 16, 2010 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the value of various gene tests and concluded none of the studies showed a clear usefulness. Genomic tests provide lots of information about a patient\u0092s genes. However, as the Journal article points out, there are so many sequences in our DNA which influence disease, that attempting to unravel such complexity just produces more and more information without a particularly useful benefit. While genes may provide a recipe, they do not determine the end results and cannot predict how an individual will respond to a specific treatment. Like the various influences on a flower seed that cause one blossom to turn out differently from another, there are biological processes in the body that affect the development of cancer in each patient and determine how that patient\u0092s cancer cells will uniquely react to treatment. Despite its allure, the \u0093genetic\" path is not all that personalized. Treatment based on genetic testing is still a guessing game. Only a treatment regimen based on a \u0093functional profile\u0094 \u0096 a real-time test of chemotherapy on the actual cancer tissue \u0096 can predict with accuracy an individual\u0092s response to chemotherapy.",

      "Content": "A study was presented at the 2009 American Society of Clinical Onocology (ASCO) breast cancer symposium in San Francisco about progress in drug selection through the use of cell-based functional profiling. It delt with the so-called \"triple negative\" breast cancer (TNBC), which is estrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (RP-), and Her2 negative (H2-). When breast cancer presents as locally advanced disease, it is customarily treated with neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, followed by definitive surgery. At the time of surgery, the specimen is assessed to determine if all visible tumor has been destroyed by chemotherapy. When this happens, it is said to be a \u0093pathological complete response\u0094 (pCR). Data shows that obtaining a pCR is everything. Get a pCR, and the survival is excellent. Don\u0092t get a pCR and the survival, especially for TNBC patients, is very poor. How can the pCR rate be improved in TNBC? The speaker went through all the database of breast cancer cell culture assays (using cell death endpoints) and tried to see if there were any drugs which appeared to be uniquely active in TNBC vs non-TNBC. There were no major differences between the activity of most drugs in TNBC vs non-TNBC, with one glaring exception: cisplatin, which was dramatically more active in TNBC than in non-TNBC. The speaker went on to present a lot of data further dissecting which specific markers were most associated with TNBC sensitivity to cisplatin. The data will shortly appear on the ASCO website. When they post slide presentations from the 2009 Breast Cancer Symposium, I'll post it here. But, essentially, the major markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were estrogen receptor negativity and very poorly differentiated tumors. The minor markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were Her2 negativity and progesterone receptor negativity. The data compared TNBC to other types of tumors. It\u0092s known that renal cell carcinomas are very resistant to cisplatin (less than 10% response rate), and that is reflected by the cell culture (cell death endpoint) data. It\u0092s known that previously-untreated, poorly differentiated ovarian cancers tend to be very sensitive to cisplatin (70% response rate), and that\u0092s also reflected by the cell culture data. When ovarian cancer patients relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have only a 25% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. When ovarian cancer patients relapse greater than 6 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have a 50% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. These clinical findings are also nicely recapitulated by the cell culture assay data. Now, breast cancers which are either estrogen receptor positive and/or more than very poortly differentiated (Bloom Richardson score of 4 to eight) tend to be even more resistant to cisplatin than are previously treated ovarian cancer which relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy. In contrast, Triple Negative Breast Cancers tend to be as sensitive or more sensitive (especially when also Bloom Richardson 9/9) to cisplatin than are previously-untreated, poorly-differentiated ovarian cancers. The data clearly showed the utility of cell culture assays in \u0093targeting\u0094 chemotherapy to patient sub-groups who are most likely to benefit from treatment with given individual drugs. It is hard to see how molecular profiling tests could have produced similar insights. Genomics is far too limited in scope to encompass the vagaries and complexities of human cancer biology when it comes to drug selection. Efforts to administer targeted therapies in randomly selected patients often result in low response rates at significant toxicity and cost. While researchers continue to develop molecular probes to select candidates, the cell culture analysis platform serves as a functional profile capable of examining the nuances of cellular response to drugs. To exploit the full potential of targeted anticancer therapies, physicians will need laboratory tests that match patients to specific drugs. Cell culture assays are able to accurately predict how an individual patient's cancer cells will respond to an array of drug combinations. It is able to quantify synergistic drug combinations and individually tailor treatment.

      "Content": "The Sunday, April 3, 2011, experimental and molecular therapeutics poster session at the AACR 102nd annual meeting included Dr. Robert Nagourney's Rational Therapeutics presentation on signal transduction inhibitors. Using MEK/ERK and PI3K-MTOR inhibitors he explored the activities, synergies and possible clinical utilities of these novel compounds. The findings were instructive. First, it saw a good signal for both compounds utilizing the Ex-vivo Analysis of Programmed Cell Death (EVA-PCD) platform (functional profiling). Second, it saw disease-specific activity for both compounds. For the MEK/ERK inhibitor, melanoma appeared to be a favored clinical target. This is highly consistent with expectations. After all, many melanomas carry mutations in the BRAF gene, and BRAF signals downstream to MEK/ERK. By blocking MEK/ERK, it appeared that his lab blocked a pathway fundamental to melanoma progression. Indeed, MEK/ERK inhibitors are currently under investigation for melanoma. For PI3K inhibitors, the highest activity was observed in uterine cancers. This has interest, because uterine carcinomas are often associated with a mutation in the PTEN gene. PTEN is a phosphatase tumor suppressor that functions to block activation of the PI3K pathway. Thus, mutations in the tumor suppressor unleash PI3K signaling, driving tumors to grow and metastasize. Blocking PI3K provided a strong signal, indicating that this approach may be very active in tumors associated with these oncogenic events. The third point of interest in the report was, perhaps, its most important. Specifically, that the lab can explore those diseases where MEK-ERK, PI3K and mTOR signaling are less established targets. Cancers of the lung, ovary, colon or breast all manifested profiles of interest. When they combined both pathway inhibitors in a process called horizontal inhibition, renal cell carcinoma popped up as the best target. These results, though exploratory, suggest a superior approach for drug development, allowing the lab to identify important leads much faster than the clinical trial process.

      "Content": "Direct anti-tumor and anti-vascular effects were studied of Tykerb, Nexavar and Avastin in fresh biopsy specimens of breast cancer and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Symposium on September 5, 2008. While the other clinically-available 'nib' drugs have been shown to have anti-vascular activity, anti-vascular activity of Tykerb has not been previously reported. Angiogenesis studies are limited by the clinical relevance of laboratory model systems. They don't do \"real world\" studies under \"real world\" conditions. Patient outcomes need to be reported in real-time, so patients and cancer physicians can learn immediately if and how patients are benefiting from new drug therapies. Cell culture detection of microvascular cell death in clinical specimens of human neoplasms and peripheral blood can identify the activity of both single drugs and combinations of drugs at the level of individual patients with individual cancers. It works by measuring drug effects (real-time) upon endothelial cells which make up blood vessels. Drugs like Avastin had striking anti-microvascular effects but minimal anti-tumor effects. Tarceva and Gleevec had mixed antitumor and anti-microvascular effects. Anti-microvascular effects of Tarceva and Iressa were equal to those of Sutent and Nexavar. Anti-microvascular additivity was observed between Avastin and other drugs on an individual basis. Conclusions of the study had shown that Tykerb has antivascular activity superior to that of Nexavar. Avastin + Tykerb may be the first clinically-exploitable antivascular drug combination. High dose, intermittent 'bolus' schedules of Tykerb to coincide with Avastin administration may be clinically advantageous, even in HER2-negative tumors. The system utilized for the study was a functional profiling assay, which may be used to individualize antivascular therapy. It can be adapted for simple, inexpensive and sensitive/specific detection of tissue and circulating microvascular cells in a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, for drug development, and individualized cancer treatment. It can accurately sort drugs into categories of above average probability of providing clinical benefit on one hand and below average probability of providing clinical benefit on the other hand, based both on tumor response and patient survival.

      "Content": "As our understanding of breast cancer biology continues to advance, this disease has come to be understood as many different diseases. Original categorizations based on histology lead to lobular versus ductal subtypes. Thereafter, recognition of estrogen and progesterone status, and finally HER2 status provided further subcategorizations. Over the past decade, molecular subtypes have characterized this disease into a series of signatures characterized by luminal, basal and other groupings with distinct prognoses. Within the context of these categories, the triple negative breast cancers have emerged as an important target. These patients whose tumors do not mark for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 on immunohistochemical or FISH analyses, appear to carry features that segregate them into a BRCA1-like biology. This is of great interest clinically for it offers the opportunity to treat these patients with drugs found active in the BRCA mutant populations. Among the most active drugs in these patients are the PARP inhibitors. The excellent results with PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutants have been followed by striking response and survival data combining PARP inhibitors with carbo-platinum and gemcitabine. PARP inhibitors by inhibiting DNA damage response can enhance the effects of ionizing radiation, mustard alkylators, topoisomerase inhibitors, platins, and intercalating agents. We have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors in breast and other cancers. In these investigations, our lab to applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. To date, we have observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients, and in some triple negative patients. More interesting, will be the results combining the PARP inhibitors with mustard alkylators, platins, and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. This work is ongoing in triple negative and BRCA positive patients as well as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future.

      "Content": "Some cell-based assay labs have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors, alone and in combination, in actual human tumor primary culture micro-speheroids (microclusters), in breast, ovarian and other cancers. In these investigations, the lab applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. As seen with PARP inhibitors, mutations work with other proteins. Genes do not operate alone within the cell but in an intricate network of interactions. To date, one lab has observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. Work is ongoing with these BRCA1 positive patients as wells as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future. The PARP inhibitors are turning out to be very useful. On April 3rd, Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical director at Rational Therapeutics and instructor in Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, will have a Poster Session at the 102nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Orlando, Florida on the most recent findings on novel compounds that target two parallel pathways in cancer cells. Dr. Nagourney will report the results of functional analysis with the mTOR/P13K and MEK/ERK inhibitors, BEZ235 and AZD6244, alone and in combination in human tumor primary culture micro-spheroids (microclusters): Exploration of horizontal pathway targeting. While the profiles of each drug alone are of interest, the profiles of the drugs in combination are better still. The phenomenon of cross-talk defines an escape mechanism whereby cancer cells blocked from one passage, find a second. When clinical therapists have the capacity to block more than one pathway, the cancer cell is trapped and often dies. This is what has been observed with these duel inhibitor combinations. What is interesting is the fact that the activities cut across tumor types. Melanomas, colon cancers and lung cancers seem to have similar propensities to drive along these paths. Once again, we find that cancer biology is non-linear. Moreover, cancers share pathways across tumor types, pathways that might not intuitively seem related. This is the beauty of cell-based functional profiling platform. It allows the exploration of drugs and combinations that most oncologists wouldn\u2019t think of. It is these counterintuitive explorations that will likely lead to meaningful advances. Functional profiling measures biological signals rather than DNA indicators, which plays an important role in cancer drug selection and is demonstrably greater and more compelling data currently generated from DNA analyses. The results of their investigation support the clinical relevance of targeting the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways and more importantly, suggest \"dual\" pathway inhibition (horizontal) to be a productive strategy for further clinical development. Disease specific profiles and sequence dependence are being explored and will be reported. Most solid tumors reveal complex interactions between signal pathways that cross talk at points of commonality. To examine the clinical potential of BEZ235 and AZD6244 - inhibitors of PI3K and MEK/ERK pathways - they applied cell function analysis of programmed cell death to tumor micro-spheroids (microclusters) isolated from 24 patients. Drugs were tested alone and in combination. According to researcher, Professor Alan Ashworth, director of the Breaktrhough Breast Cancer Research Centre in London, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in a repair pathway for double-strand DNA breaks that occur very close to each other. An elaborate mechanism called homologous recombination fixes some of these double-strand breaks, and BRCA2 and BRCA1 are critical for homologous recombination. PARP is a very active enzyme involved in the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA or modified bases. It binds to DNA damage and adds multiple sugar molecules to the DNA that act as a beacon to recruit other components of DNA repair. Emerging work on assays (PARP levels correlating with response to PARP inhibitors) have shown pretty good response with PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. There has been some results combining the PARP inhbitors with mustard alkylators, platins and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. These molecules have also been the subject of investigation using functional analysis in the laboratory of Dr. Nagourney. As will be reported in the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Nagourney found activity for Olaparnib and Inaparib, in patients with BRCA mutation and in some triple negative breast cancer patients. This is a fertile area of investigation and a highly informative application of human tumor microspheroid analyses. Source: Robert A.

      "Content": "When you get rid of VEGF with Avastin, the body cranks out other types of blood vessel growth/survival factors. A research article in The Journal of Clinical Investigation explains tumor vascular regrowth following withdrawal of an anti-VEGF agent. Rapid vascular regrowth in tumors after reversal of VEGF inhibition. http://www.jci.org/articles/view/24612 What may limit the effectiveness of Avastin is that there are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF and independent of angiogenesis. Tumors can acquire a blood supply by three different mechanisms: angiogenesis; co-option of existing blood vessels; and vasculogenic mimicry. All must be inhibited to consistently starve tumors of oxygen. Instead of growing new blood vessels, tumor cells can just grow along existing blood vessels. This process, called co-option, cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. Some types of cancers form channels that carry blood, but are not actual blood vessels. Drugs that target new blood vessel formation also cannot stop this process, called vasculogeneic mimicry. The realization is that starving tumors by shutting off their blood flow requires that all three mechanisms be addressed. Also, there are other proangiogenic factors that can affect whether Avastin works or not, FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL8, etc. You need to attack these other targets as well. That is why we need combination anti-angioRX. If you can achieve this, then you don't really need the other drugs, which don't get into the tumor so well. Angiogenic attack provides true selective toxicity, something which is sorely lacking with all of the other treatments. It could be vastly more important to measure the net effect of all processes (systems) instead of just individual molecular targets (like VEGF). The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not just one or a few targets or pathways. There are many pathways to the altered cellular (forest) function, hence all the different \"trees\" which correlate in different situations. Improvement can be made by measuring what happens at the end (the effects on the forest), rather than the status of the indiviudal trees. VEGF-targeted drugs are poorly-predicted by measuring the preferred target VEGFR. They can be well-predicted by measuring the effect of the drug on the function of live cells. Many of these fine drugs (and Avastin is a miracle drug for the few) cry out for validated clinical biomarkers as pharmacodynamic endpoints and with the ability to measure multiple parameters in cellular screens to help set dosage and select people likely to respond. Many molecular diagnostics approved often have been mostly or totally ineffective at identifying clinical responders to various therapies. If you find one or more implicated proteins in a patient's tumor cells, how do you know if they are functional (is the encoded protein actually produced)? If the protein is produced, is it functional? If the protein is functional, how is it interacting with other functional proteins in the cell? All cells exist in a state of dynamic tension in which several internal and external forces work with and against each other. Just detecting an amplified or deleted gene won't tell you anything about protein interactions. Are you sure that you've identified every single protein that might influence sensitivity or resistance to a certain class of drug? Assuming you resolve all of the preceeding issues, you'll never be able to distinguish between susceptibility of the cell to different drugs in the same class. Nor can you tell anything about susceptibility to drug combinations. And what about external facts such as drug uptake into the cell? You're not going to accomplish this using genetic tests. Improving cancer patient diagnosis and treatment through a combination of cellular and gene-based testing will offer predictive insight into the nature of an individual's particular cancer and enable oncologists to prescribe treatment more in keeping with the heterogeneity of the disease. The biologies are very different and the response to given drugs is very different. The major obstacle in controlling cancer drug prices is the widespread inappropriate use of anti-cancer drugs. As the increasing numbers and types of anti-cancer drugs are developed, oncologists become more and more likely to misuse them in their practice. There is seldom a \"standard\" therapy which has been proven to be superior to any other therapy. What may work for one, may not work for another.

      "Content": "Researchers have been focusing on the development of sensitive assays that allow the specific detection of single tumor cells or small amounts of cell-free tumor DNA in the peripheral blood of cancer patients (Annual Review of Medicine Vol. 63: 199-215). Quantification of circulating DNA by real-time PCR may be a good and simple tool for detection of cancer with a potential to clinical applicability together with other current methods used for monitoring the disease (DNA Cell Biol. 2008 Aug;27[8]:415-21). Doctors hope to use this to assess how a patient's tumor responds to treatment. Circulating tumor DNA might give doctors an earlier warning that a drug isn't working. The test might allow patients to stop taking a harsh drug that's not working, sparing them months of side effects. Doctors could then prescribe an alternative drug, although there's no evidence yet that switching drugs sooner would help people live longer. Is this six of one and a half dozen of the other? The test is \"prognostic\" and not \"predictive.\" The biggest point made by Dr. Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is that cancer patients shouldn't expect their doctors to test their tumor's circulating DNA anytime soon. Genomics provides a new type of very specific biomarker for monitoring tumors in response to therapy. The mutations that each tumor accumulates are an individual genomic 'barcode' that can then be used to monitor tumor burden and response to treatment. The researchers use targeted or whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic genomic alterations and design a personalized assay to quantify circulating tumor DNA in serially collected plasma specimens. The also measure CA 15-3 levels and numbers of circulating tumor cells at identical time points. Circulating tumor DNA was successfully detected in 29 of 30 women (97%) with metastatic breast cancer receiving systemic therapy in whom somatic genomic alterations were identified. In comparison, CA 15-3 was detected in 21 or 27 women (78%) and circulating tumor cells were detected in 26 of 30 women (87%). Circulating tumor DNA has a greater dynamic range, which correlates with changes in tumor burden. The test also can provide the earliest measure of treatment response in 10 of 30 women tested. Most laboratories equipped to do molecular testing can do this test using circulating tumor DNA, however, these are usually only located in major tertiary care centers. The editorialists pointed out that all patients with breast cancer have mutations in their tumor DNA, but without very intensive sequencing strategies, a specific probe or probes for each patient may remain elusive or very costly, and a standard 'panel' is unlikely to work for all patients. The number of patients in whom an objective response to treatment was seen in circulating tumor DNA was limited, so the effort to compare the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA with circulating tumor cells and measures of CA 15-3 is more encouraging than definitive.",

      "Content": "At the 2009 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) breast cancer symposium, in San Francisco, the Keynote Address by Martine Piccart-Gebhart (Breast International Group - BIG and of the Jules Bordet Institute) was very relevant to Individualized Tumor Response Testing. She made the point that only 8% of new drugs entering Phase I trials ever make it to marketing and that this percentage is even lower for cancer drugs, and Chas Bountra of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) raises the sobering fact that 90% of Phase II compounds fail, because current drugtesting is inefficient, with many drugs failing late in development, with these expensive failures owing, in large measure, to ineffective drugs and poor patient selection (i.e, lack of prognostic and predictive markers for response to therapy). She went on to note that little progress has been made in identifying which therapeutic strategies are likely to be effective for individual patients. The speaker concluded that identifying markers that can predict response to a particular drug remains a great challenge. Any attempts to bring various tumor markers into the clinical setting have been unsuccessful owing to subjectivity of gene expression, as well as lack of specificity of the marker in predicting outcome or response to treatment. Why was nothing being presented at this meeting which reports any progress at all in drug selection through the use of molecular profiling? When microarrays and high throughput RT-PCR assays emerged some years back, you'd think that there would be quite a bit of progress by now. Sad to say, there has not. Is Molecular Profiling Ready for Use in Clinical Decision Making? http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.o.../full/12/3/301 In a TheScientist.com article, \"Crowdsourcing Drug Discovery,\" it was commented that for the last 50 years, randomized controlled trials have been the unquestioned gold standard, when in fact they have become a fiercely defended relic of our ignorance in 1962 when Congress empowered the FDA to begin regulating efficacy. At that time, it was a \"best we could do\" solution - but now? They take too long, cost too much, are fraught with unsolveable ethical problems that patients and many physicians dislike, and cannot ask the patient-specific molecular questions we now know need to be asked and answered. Yet, most clinical trialists and the FDA cling to these crude, simplistic tools like an irrational safety blanket. If we can't reach agreement that clinical methodologies must adapt to new knowledge of the biology of disease, and that the way drug development is regulated must rapidly adapt in much the same way, then our ability to accelerate advances in medicine will remain stagnant. A key point in this article is that the new system should be patient-centric. It has to be something patients will not only tolerate, or enter under duress, but rather a system that makes sense to them personally - even when they are not yet facing a serious or terminal condition. If real patients are left out of the process of change, we will likely end up in the wrong place again. http://www.f1000scientist.com/article/display/57646/ In a September 18, 2010 NYT article, \"New Drugs Stir Debate on Basic Rules of Clinical Trials,\" it expressed the debate among oncologists about whether a controlled trial that measures a drug\u2019s impact on extending life is still the best method for evaluating hundreds of genetically targeted cancer drugs being developed. Critics of the trials argue that the new science behind the drugs has eclipsed the old rules \u2014 and ethics \u2014 of testing them. They say that in some cases, drugs under development, may be so much more effective than their predecessors that putting half the potential beneficiaries into a control group, and delaying access to the drug to thousands of other patients, causes needless suffering. There hasn't been known anyone who hasn't shuddered at the concept that we can't let patients on the control arm cross over because we need them to die earlier to prove a point. The new wave of drugs in development might require individual evaluation. \"We\u2019ll try this for six weeks; if it\u2019s working, great, if not, we\u2019ll shift you right away to the other trial,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey A. Sosman of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to be able to live with the randomization.\u201d http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/he...9trial.html?hp",

      "Content": "Published online 21 November 2010 | Nature | doi:10.1038/news.2010.623 http://www.nature.com/news/2010/1011....2010.623.html About the most key statement in the article (when it comes to treatment) is, \"most people agree that a single pathway is not going to do it.\" When you get rid of VEGF with Avastin, the body cranks out other types of blood vessel growth/survival factors. The problem with Avastin is the same thing that was a problem with AZT for HIV/AIDS. Early results, then rapid resistance. Solution was combination therapy to attack different targets. With cancer, it's going to take combination antivascular therapy to make a difference. Tumor vasculature needs VEGF to survive. Avastin removes VEGF, killing blood vessels. But other proangiogenic factors can substitute: FGF, PDGF, ephrin A1, angioprotein 1, IL-8 etc. We need to attack these other targets, as well. If you can achieve this, then you may not even need the other drugs, which don't get into the tumor so well. But angiogenic attack provides true selective toxicity, something which is sorely lacking with all of the other treatments. Perhaps Avastin \"sensitive\" tumors secrete relatively low levels of VEGF. Tumors which secrete relatively low levels of VEGF might be more susceptible to an agent which works by blocking VEGF. As the article mentions \"vascular mimicry,\" something I've written about on the board previously, there are multiple ways by which tumors can evolve that are independent of VEGF and independent of angiogenesis. Tumors can acquire a blood supply by angiogenesis, co-option of existing blood vessels and vasculogenic mimicry. All must be inhibited to consistently starve tumors of oxygen. While vasculogenic mimicry - some types of cancers form channels that carry blood, but are not actual blood vessels - with co-option, instead of growing new blood vessels, tumor cells can just grow along existing blood vessels. This process cannot be stopped with drugs that inhibit new blood vessel formation. The consistent and specific cure or control of cancer will require developing and using a set of drugs, given in combination, targeted to patterns of normal cellular machinery related to proliferation and invasiveness. A sufficient number of independent methods of cell killing must be employed so that it is too improbable for a cancer cell to evolve that can escape death or inactivation. It must examine every cell in the body and must do so for a prolonged period of time. Given the current state of the art, cell-based in vitro drug sensitivity testing (with functional profiling) could be of significant clinical value. One aspect of a functional profiling assay is that microvascular viability can measure dead microvascular cells in tissue, fluid and peripheral blood specimens to identify potential responders to anti-angiogenic drugs (Avastin, Nexavar, Sutent) and to assess direct and potentiating anti-angiogenic effects of tyrosine kinase targeted therapy drugs (Tarceva, Iressa).",

      "Content": "Why isn't there any progress in drug selection through the use of molecular profiling? Molecular profiling is far too limited in scope to encompass the vagaries and complexities of human cancer biology when it comes to drug selection. Efforts to administer targeted therapies in randomly selected patients often result in low response rates at significant toxicity and cost. The endpoints of molecular profiling are gene expression. The endpoints of tumor cell functional profiling are expression of cell death (both tumor cell death and tumor associated endothelial [capillary] cell death). In chemotherapy selection, molecular profiling examines a single process within the cell or a relatively small number of processes. The aim is to tell if there is a theoretical predisposition to drug response. Functional profiling examines not only for the presence of the molecular profile but also for their functionality, for their interaction with other genes, proteins, and processes occurring within the cell, and for their response to anti-cancer drugs. The goal of molecular testing is to look for patterns of normal and abnormal gene expression which could suggest that certain proteins might or might not be produced within a cell. However, just because a gene is present, it does not mean that an associated protein has been produced. Protein testing goes one step further by testing to see if the relevant protein actually has been produced. However, even Protein testing cannot tell us if a protein is functional or how it will interact with other proteins in the presence of anti-cancer drugs. Gene and protein testing involve the use of dead, formaldehyde preserved cells that are never exposed to chemotherapy drugs. Gene and protein tests cannot tells us anything about uptake of a certain drug into the cell or if the drug will be excluded before it can act or what changes will take place within the cell if the drug successfully enters the cell. Gene and protein tests cannot discriminate among the activities of different drugs within the same class. Instead, gene and protein tests assume that all drugs within a class will produce precisely the same effect, even though from clinical experience, this is not the case. Nor can gene and protein tests tell us anything about drug combinations. Functional tumor cell profiling tests living cancer cells. It assesses the net result of all cellular processes, including interactions, occurring in real time when cancer cells actually are exposed to specific anti-cancer drugs. It can discriminate differing anti-tumor effects of different drugs within the same class. It can also identify synergies in drug combinations. Gene and protein tests are better suited for ruling out \"inactive\" drugs than for identifying \"active\" drugs. When considering a cancer drug which is believed to act only upon cancer cells that have a specific genetic defect, it is useful to know if a patient's cancer cells do or do not have precisely that defect. Although presence of a targeted defect does not necessarily mean that a drug will be effective, absence of the targeted defect may rule out use of the drug. Of course, this assumes that the mechanism of drug activity is known beyond any doubt, which is not always the case. Although gene and protein testing currently are limited in their reliability as clinical tools, the tests can be important in research settings such as in helping to identify rational targets for development of new anti-cancer drugs. Many of these drugs cry out for validated clinical biomarkers to help set dosage and select people likely to respond. And optimal and reproducible gene expression testing continues to evade the diagnositcs of the disease. Numerous other genes, tumor, and patient factors contribute to the risk of the cancer coming back and the effectiveness of chemotherapy for solid tumors. It could be vastly more beneficial to measure the net effect of all processes (systems) instead of just individual molecular targets. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins, and other cellular constituents that produce functions. One needs to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not just one or a few targets (pathways/mechanisms). There are many pathways/mechanisms to the altered cellular (forest) function, hence all the different \"trees\" which correlate in different situations. Improvement can be made by measuring what happens at the end (the effects on the forest), rather than the status of the indivudal trees. As you can see, just selecting the right test to perform in the right situation is a very important step on the road to personalizing cancer therapy.

      "Content": "The UK\u0092s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has rejected the use of Roche\u0092s Avastin for treating breast cancer on the grounds that the med offers \u0093limited and uncertain benefit\u0094 for patients compared with existing treatments. Roche had calcuated the total average cost of treating a patient with Avastin plus chemotherapy is more than $52,000. \u0093Unfortunately, we did not receive any evidence from the manufacturer to show that (Avastin) can significantly lengthen a patient\u0092s life or, importantly, offer a better quality of life than existing treatments. Although the data seemed to show that the drug may slow the growth and spread of the cancer, the size of this effect varied between studies. Furthermore, it was extremely unclear that the benefits in terms of slowing tumour growth translated into benefits on overall survival, which is what really matters for patients,\u0094 NICE chief executive Andrew Dillon says in a statement. Nonetheless, the decision casts an ominous shadow over an upcoming decision by the FDA. Last July, you may recall, an FDA advisory committee dealt Roche a blow by voting 12 to 1 to recommend the agency withdraw approval for the multibillion-dollar cancer drug for treating breast cancer. The FDA approved Avastin two years ago to fight breast cancer, but two studies - which were undertaken as a condition of approval - found patients given Avastin and chemotherpay didn\u0092t survive longer than those given chemo alone. Avastin patients also suffered more serious side effects. The Avastin decision has stirred controversy over the yardsticks used to approve Avastin for breast cancer treatment and the FDA\u0092s accelerated approval program. For instance, one advocacy group, Breast Cancer Action, maintains the FDA placed too much emphasis on surrogate markers, specifically, progression-free survival. Meanwhile, some cancer patients worry the agency will yank the med, which in some cases has been proven helfpul.

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Rational Therapeutics As our understanding of breast cancer biology continues to advance, this disease has come to be understood as many different diseases. Original categorizations based on histology lead to lobular versus ductal subtypes. Thereafter, recognition of estrogen and progesterone status, and finally HER2 status provided further subcategorizations. Over the past decade, molecular subtypes have characterized this disease into a series of signatures characterized by luminal, basal and other groupings with distinct prognoses. Within the context of these categories, the triple negative breast cancers have emerged as an important target. These patients whose tumors do not mark for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 on immunohistochemical or FISH analyses, appear to carry features that segregate them into a BRCA1-like biology. This is of great interest clinically for it offers the opportunity to treat these patients with drugs found active in the BRCA mutant populations. Among the most active drugs in these patients are the PARP inhibitors. The excellent results with PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutants have been followed by striking response and survival data combining PARP inhibitors with carbo-platinum and gemcitabine. PARP inhibitors by inhibiting DNA damage response can enhance the effects of ionizing radiation, mustard alkylators, topoisomerase inhibitors, platins, and intercalating agents. We have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors in breast and other cancers. In these investigations, our lab to applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. To date, we have observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients, and in some triple negative patients. More interesting, will be the results combining the PARP inhibitors with mustard alkylators, platins, and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. This work is ongoing in triple negative and BRCA positive patients as well as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future. PARP Inhibitiors in Breast Cancer Some cell-based assay labs have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors, alone and in combination, in actual human tumor primary culture micro-speheroids (microclusters), in breast, ovarian and other cancers. In these investigations, the lab applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. As seen with PARP inhibitors, mutations work with other proteins. Genes do not operate alone within the cell but in an intricate network of interactions. To date, one lab has observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. Work is ongoing with these BRCA1 positive patients as wells as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future. The PARP inhibitors are turning out to be very useful. On April 3rd, Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical director at Rational Therapeutics and instructor in Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, will have a Poster Session at the 102nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Orlando, Florida on the most recent findings on novel compounds that target two parallel pathways in cancer cells. Dr. Nagourney will report the results of functional analysis with the mTOR/P13K and MEK/ERK inhibitors, BEZ235 and AZD6244, alone and in combination in human tumor primary culture micro-spheroids (microclusters): Exploration of horizontal pathway targeting. While the profiles of each drug alone are of interest, the profiles of the drugs in combination are better still. The phenomenon of cross-talk defines an escape mechanism whereby cancer cells blocked from one passage, find a second. When clinical therapists have the capacity to block more than one pathway, the cancer cell is trapped and often dies. This is what has been observed with these duel inhibitor combinations. What is interesting is the fact that the activities cut across tumor types. Melanomas, colon cancers and lung cancers seem to have similar propensities to drive along these paths. Once again, we find that cancer biology is non-linear. Moreover, cancers share pathways across tumor types, pathways that might not intuitively seem related. This is the beauty of cell-based functional profiling platform. It allows the exploration of drugs and combinations that most oncologists wouldn\u0092t think of. It is these counterintuitive explorations that will likely lead to meaningful advances. Functional profiling measures biological signals rather than DNA indicators, which plays an important role in cancer drug selection and is demonstrably greater and more compelling data currently generated from DNA analyses. The results of their investigation support the clinical relevance of targeting the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways and more importantly, suggest \"dual\" pathway inhibition (horizontal) to be a productive strategy for further clinical development. Disease specific profiles and sequence dependence are being explored and will be reported. Most solid tumors reveal complex interactions between signal pathways that cross talk at points of commonality. To examine the clinical potential of BEZ235 and AZD6244 - inhibitors of PI3K and MEK/ERK pathways - they applied cell function analysis of programmed cell death to tumor micro-spheroids (microclusters) isolated from 24 patients. Drugs were tested alone and in combination. According to researcher, Professor Alan Ashworth, director of the Breaktrhough Breast Cancer Research Centre in London, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in a repair pathway for double-strand DNA breaks that occur very close to each other. An elaborate mechanism called homologous recombination fixes some of these double-strand breaks, and BRCA2 and BRCA1 are critical for homologous recombination. PARP is a very active enzyme involved in the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA or modified bases. It binds to DNA damage and adds multiple sugar molecules to the DNA that act as a beacon to recruit other components of DNA repair. Emerging work on assays (PARP levels correlating with response to PARP inhibitors) have shown pretty good response with PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. There has been some results combining the PARP inhbitors with mustard alkylators, platins and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. These molecules have also been the subject of investigation using functional analysis in the laboratory of Dr. Nagourney. As will be reported in the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Nagourney found activity for Olaparnib and Iniparib, in patients with BRCA mutation and in some triple negative breast cancer patients. This is a fertile area of investigation and a highly informative application of human tumor microspheroid analyses. Source: Robert A.

      "Content": "Although ten years of genetic profiling has had an enormous impact on the understanding of breast cancer, progress on individualizing therapy has been rather limited, researchers from the UK and USA reported in The Lancet this week. Specifically, the authors refer to the prognostic and predictive factors associated with personalized medicine, even though genetic profiling offers enormous potential for better prediction of outcomes and optimizing individual patients' treatments. At this moment there are no commercially available molecular tests that can predict benefit from a specific therapeutic agent, despite of many prognostic and predictive signatures having been developed. Scientists are still unable to accurately determine prognosis or chemotherapy success in some disease subsets, such as ER-negative and triple negative disease. Jorge Reis-Filho from The Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, UK and Lajos Pusztai from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, USA, set out to determine what progress, if any, had been made over the last ten years regarding microarray analysis (expression profiling) of breast cancers. Treatment decisions have usually been based on several clinical factors, such as tumor size and its location, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or distant sites in the body. The researchers explain: \"With these approaches, about 60% of all patients with early-stage breast cancer still receive adjuvant chemotherapy, of which only a small proportion, 2-15% of patients, will ultimately derive benefit, while all remain at risk of toxic side-effects.\" In addition to information provided by clinicopathological features, the introduction of first generation prognostic gene signatures has offered clinically useful prognostics. At present, several genomic tests are being used in women with ER-positive disease to help determine the likelihood of cancer recurrence, and which patients' outcome has been sufficiently successful in order to deem chemotherapy unnecessary. However, the researchers comment: \"Increasingly clear is that the prognostic information offered by these [first generation prognostic] signatures in addition to the information provided by semi-quantitaive analysis of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 is limited...and the continued importance of standardized histo-pathological analysis of tumors should be emphasized.\" Using gene signatures to predict which patients may benefit from specific therapies has been less successful, and even though scientists have developed many predictive signatures, some have been based on unreliable data; their usefulness in patients continues to be controversial. This could be due to the fact that resistance to chemotherapy is a complex mechanism, as it can be caused by changes in just one or a small number of genes? The likelihood of diverse and often subtle changes resulting in resistance to chemotherapy being reliably identified by standard gene expression profiling is extremely small. In a concluding statement the researchers say: \"The theoretical knowledge and logistical lessons learned from gene expression profiling studies, however, will prove useful for research aiming to develop the next generation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers.\" References: Prof Jorge S Reis-Filho FRCPath and Prof Lajos Pusztai MD \"Gene expression profiling in breast cancer: classification, prognostication, and prediction\" The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9805, Pages 1812 - 1823, 19 November 2011. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61539-0 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/la...539-0/abstract",

      "Content": "The interest in and the knowledge of gene expression profiling in cancer medicine has heighten since the completion of the human genome project. However, researchers have cautioned the science of gene expression profiling, in which scientists examine the genetic signature of a cell. Medical research has focused on developing DNA (genomic) tests to identify various gene expressions, markers and mutations relevant to a person's cancer. The hope was that genetic information would enable researchers to better predict how an individual will respond to various treatment options. However, when it comes to \"predicting\" the best treatment for the individual, unlocking the complexities of a person's DNA is not the answer, it is simply a starting point. In fact, a March 16, 2010 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the value of various gene tests and concluded none of the studies showed a clear usefulness. Genomic tests provide lots of information about a patient's genes. But there are so many sequences in our DNA which influence disease, that attempting to unravel such complexity just produces more and more information without a particularly useful benefit. While genes may provide a recipe, they do not determine the end results and cannot predict how an individual will respond to a specific treatment. Like the various influences on a flower seed that cause one blossom to turn out differently from another, there are biological processes in the body that affect the development of cancer in each patient and determine how that patient's cancer cells will uniquely react to treatment. Despite its allure, the \"genetic\" path is not all that personalized. Treatment based on genetic testing is still a guessing game (trial-and-error). But a treatment regimen based on a \"functional profile\" - a real-time test of chemotherapy on the actual cancer tissue - can predict with accuracy an individual's response to chemotherapy.",

      "Content": "The first prospective trial of the 70-gene-signature MammaPrint (Agendia) breast cancer test shows that it can help determine which breast cancer patients can forgo adjuvant systemic treatment. The results of the Microarray Prognostics in Breast Cancer (RASTER) study were published online January 31 in the International Journal of Cancer. Of the women deemed to be low risk by the MammaPrint test, 85% chose not to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, and 97% were disease-free after 5 years. Of the women deemed to be high risk, 91% underwent chemotherapy were disease-free at 5 years. It might be prudent to incorporate MammaPrint results with the traditional clinical parameters, but only in patients older than 45 years for whom the value of adjuvant chemotherapy is unclear, said lead author Sabine C. Linn, MD, PhD, from the Department of Medical Oncology at the Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital in Amsterdam. The RASTER study is the first to prospectively evaluate the performance of MammaPrint. Decisions about adjuvant therapy were made on the basis of the 2004 Dutch Institute of Healthcare Improvement (CBO) guidelines, MammaPrint results, and preferences of clinicians and their patients. Five-year distant-recurrence-free-interval probabilities estimated with MammaPrint and another clinical common tool, Adjuvant! Online (AOL) \u0097 used to assess the risk of developing recurrent disease and/or dying within 10 years \u0097 were compared. Points to Ponder This study is an important step forward, according to Christopher Benz, MD, who is director of the cancer and developmental therapeutics program at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California. He was not involved in the study. \"The study has largely accomplished its primary aims of demonstrating the feasibility of implementing a multigene signature test in a community-based setting and showing that its implementation can have a significant impact on medical decision-making,\" he told Medscape Medical News. In more than 25% of the study population, MammaPrint gave a risk estimate (low risk) that was discordant with the AOL risk estimate (high risk). However, the researchers assumed that clinicians equate a high-risk estimate from AOL with a less than 90% chance of recurrence in 10 years, \"a definition that is not necessarily used in common practice,\" Dr. Benz explained. On the basis of that definition, 124 of 427 patients in this study were classified as high risk by AOL but low risk by MammaPrint, he continued. Despite this discordance, more than 75% of Dutch clinicians chose not to recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. \"As apparent validation of the MammaPrint prediction, the authors show that over 98% of these patients were still disease-free 5 years later,\" Dr. Benz noted. Although this makes gene-signature tests like MammaPrint appealing to oncologists \"it is hazardous to draw conclusions from breast cancer recurrence rates after only 5 years of follow-up,\" he said. In the RASTER study, all breast cancers were node-negative and 80% were estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive. \"The natural history of such breast tumors is that most clinical relapses do not occur until 5 or even 10 years after diagnosis \u0097 with or without the use of adjuvant therapy,\" he added. MammaPrint vs Oncotype MammaPrint and Oncotype DX (Genomic Health) are the 2 major gene-profiling tests for breast cancer currently available, and there are notable differences between the 2. Oncotype DX measures the expression of 21 genes with polymerase chain reaction, and can use fixed tissue. MammaPrint applies microarray technology to a 70-gene signature, but requires fresh samples. In addition, MammaPrint can be used in patients with any ER status, whereas Oncotype DX can only be used in ER-positive patients. \"MammaPrint is also useful in HER2-positive disease, but Oncotype is not,\" said Dr. Linn. \"There is currently uncertainty about the magnitude of additional information generated by Oncotype DX, since a British group showed that Oncotype is similar to immunohistochemical testing for ER, PGR, HER2, and Ki67,\" she explained. But like MammaPrint, Oncotype DX is often discordant with the AOL risk estimator. \"Its recurrence score specifically addresses whether an ER-positive breast cancer patient will likely benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant hormonal therapy, whereas the MammaPrint gene signature does not,\" he said. American clinicians \"are eagerly awaiting the results of the randomized MINDACT trial, which will definitively address the accuracy of this 70-gene signature, relative to AOL, and regardless of tumor ER status,\" in predicting which breast cancer patients can safely avoid adjuvant chemotherapy, Dr. Benz explained. Study Details The primary goal of RASTER was to evaluate MammaPrint in a community-based setting and to study its clinical impact on decision making for adjuvant therapy. The definitions of high risk and low risk used by Dr. Linn and colleagues were in accordance with CBO guidelines. Patients of low clinical risk were older than 35 years with a grade 1 tumor of 30 mm or smaller, a grade 2 tumor of 20 mm or smaller, or a grade 3 tumor of 10 mm or smaller; or they were younger than 36 years with a grade 1 tumor of 10 mm or smaller. All other patients were considered to be at high risk. Adjuvant endocrine treatment in the CBO guidelines is only advised in clinically high-risk patients with hormone-receptor-positive tumors in combination with chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 61.6 months. In the MammaPrint group, 15% (33 of 219) of the low-risk patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, as did 81% (69 of 208 ) of the high-risk ones. The 5-year distant-recurrence-free-interval probabilities in the low-risk and high-risk MammaPrint groups were 97.0% and 91.7%, respectively. The probabilities in the low-risk (n = 132) and high-risk (n = 295) AOL groups were 96.7% and 93.4%, respectively. The researchers observed that the MammaPrint and AOL risk estimations were discordant in 38% of the cases (161 of 427 patients). Most of these (29%) were low-risk MammaPrint and high-risk AOL; 9% were high-risk MammaPrint and low-risk AOL. Of the patients who were categorized as low risk on both MammaPrint and AOL, 93% did not receive any adjuvant therapy (not chemotherapy or endocrine therapy). In addition, 56% of patients who were low-risk MammaPrint and high-risk AOL did not receive any adjuvant therapy. The RASTER study was financially supported the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board.

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. The term \u0093triple negative breast cancer\u0094 (TNBC) is applied to a subtype of breast cancers that do not express the estrogen or progesterone receptors. Nor do they overexpress the HER2 gene. This disease constitutes 15 \u0096 20 percent of all breast cancers and has a predisposition for younger women, particularly those of black and Hispanic origin. This disease may becoming more common; although, this could reflect the greater awareness and recognition of this disease as a distinct biological entity. On molecular profiling, TNBC has distinct features on heat maps. The usual hormone response elements are deficient, while a number of proliferation markers are upregulated. Not surprisingly, this disease does not respond to the usual forms of therapy like Tamoxifen and the other selective estrogen response modifiers known as SERMs. Nonetheless, TNBC can be quite sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Indeed, the responsiveness to chemotherapy can provide these patients with complete remissions. Unfortunately, the disease can recur. Complete remission maintained over the first three to five years is associated with a favorable prognosis, with recurrence rates diminishing over time and late recurrences more often seen in estrogen receptor-positive cancers. Triple negative breast cancer is not one, but many diseases. Among the subtypes are those that respond to metabolic inhibitors such as the PI3K and mTOR directed drugs. Another subset may respond to drugs that target epidermal growth factor. There are basal-types that may be somewhat more refractory to therapy, while a subset may have biology related to the BRCA mutants, characterized by DNA repair deficiencies and exquisite sensitivity to Cisplatin-based therapies. Finally, a last group is associated with androgen signaling and may respond to drugs that target the androgen receptor. Some years ago, we used the EVA-PCD platform to study refractory patients with breast cancer and identified exquisite sensitivity to the combination of Cisplatin plus Gemcitabine in this patient group. We published our observations in the Journal of Clinical Oncology and the combination of Cisplatin or Carboplatin plus Gemcitabine has become an established part of the armamentarium in these patients. http://www.rationaltherapeutics.com/...tin-Breast.pdf The I-SPY-2 trial has now used genomic analyses confirming our observations for the role of platins in TNBC. This is part reflects the DNA repair deficiency subtype associated with the BRCA-like biology. More recently, we have examined TNBC patients for their sensitivity to novel therapeutic interventions. Among them, the PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, as well as the glucose metabolism pathway inhibitors like Metformin. Additional classes of drugs that are revealing activity are the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, some of which are moving forward through clinical trials. One feature of triple negative breast cancer is avid uptake on PET scan. This reflects, in part, the proliferation rate of these tumors, but may also reflect metabolic changes associated with altered glucose metabolism. In this regard, the use of drugs that change mitochondrial function may be particularly active. Metformin, a member of the biguanide family influences mitochondrial metabolism at the level of AMP kinase. The activity of Metformin and related classes of drugs in triple negative breast cancer is a fertile area of investigation that we and others are pursuing. When we examine the good response of many triple negative breast cancers to appropriately selected therapies, the potential for durable complete remissions and the distinctly different biology that TNBC represents, the question arises whether TNBC is actually a worse diagnosis, or simply a different entity that requires different thinking. We have been very impressed by the good outcome of some of our triple negative breast cancer patients and believe this a very fertile area for additional investigation",

      "Content": "These kinase inhibitors can work across various types of cancer, but often only extend life by around three to six months. However, researchers believe they can unlock the true potential of these drugs by changing the way they are used, after uncovering a hidden way that they work. Those researchers had planned to conduct clinical trials using kinase inhibitors at higher doses, but with rest periods to take advantage of the new mechanism, and believe the new method has the potential to keep cancers at bay for much longer. Some private laboratory oncologists have found that high-dose kinase inhibitors can be effective for central nervous system (CNS) disease, so long as resistance has not developed. It may have something to do with entry into the cell; efflux out of the cells; inactivation, or whatever. They have often recommend higher dose, pulse/intermittent therapy, in combination with other agents. Palbociclib is being looked at right now, because of its advancement in clinical trials, but I'm sure they will be ready for Bemaciclib when it becomes available.",

      "Content": "The recently analyzed evolutionary history of the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) found these proteins in eukaryotes, a wide range of organisms - animals, plants, molds, fungi, algae and protozoa - whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes. While PARP proteins can be found with any of these groups, they have been most extensively studied in mammals. In these organisms, PARPs have key functions in DNA repair, genome integrity and epigenetic regulation. More recently it has been found that proteins within the PARP family have a broader range of functions that initially predicted. Researchers used computers to identify 236 PARP proteins from 77 species across five of the six groups, and performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of the identified PARP regions. PARPs are found in all eukaryotic groups for which sequence is available, but some individual lineages within groups have independently lost these genes. The PARP family can be subdivided into six branches or clades. Two of these clades were likely found in the last common eukaryotic ancestor. In addition, they have identified PARPs in organisms in which they have not previously been described. Three main conclusions were drawn from the study: First, the broad distribution and pattern of representation of PARP genes indicated to the researchers that the ancestor of all existing eukaryotes encoded proteins of this type. Second, the ancestral PARP proteins had different functions and activities. One of these proteins likely functioned in DNA damage response. Third, the diversity of the PARP family is larger than previously documented, suggesting as more eukaryotic genomes become available, this gene family will grow in both number and type. Source: The study, \"Evolutionary history of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene family in eukaryotes,\" was authored by Rebecca S. Lamb, PhD, an assistant professor of Molecular Genetics and Ohio State University colleagues Matteo Citarelli and Sachin Teotia and appeared in an issue of the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. The work was supported by a grant from the Ohio Plant Biotechnology Consortium and by funds from the Ohio State University. Can the PARP Inhibitors be tested with the Functional Profiling Platform? Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear enzyme associated with response to DNA damage. Following single strand DNA breaks, the enzyme attaches a backbone of ADP and ribose that serves to initiate DNA repair. Certain classes of chemotherapeutics, specifically alkylating agents, can induce injury that results in extensive poly ADP ribosylation resulting in the exhaustion of intercellular pools of NAD and ATP ultimately leading to cell death. Although PARP inhibitors have recently entered the clinical cancer literature mostly relating to the treatment of BRCA+ and triple negative patients, neither PARP nor PARP inhibitors are new to the cancer researcher community, according to Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical director at Rational Therapeutics, one of the pioneers of the functional profiling technique. His group first became interested following a 1988 study by Distelhorst from Case Western Reserve (Distelhorst CW, Blood 1988 Oct;72(4):1305-09) that described a mechanism of cell death that correlated with their work in childhood leukemia. Previously, investigators at Scripps Clinic had described PARP\u0092s role in response to 2CDA (Seto, S., et al. J Clin. Invest. 1985 Feb;75(2):377-83). His group has studied small molecule inhibitors of PARP for many years, and more recently, they have expanded these investigations to include BSI201 (iniparib) and AZD2281 (olaparib). Both of which are undergoing clinical investigations. Nagourney will be reporting their findings with these PARP inhibitors at the 2011 ASCO meeting (Nagourney, R., et al Proceedings Amer Soc Clin Oncol. 2011). PARP inhibitors are easily studied and provide interesting signals in the tissue studied. They have seen activity in BRCA+ patients and some triple negative breast cancers. They have also identified synergy with other classes of drugs. The compounds are a welcome addition to the cancer therapy armamentarium and continue to be actively studied in the cell-based functional profiling platform. Of interest is the recent failure of the iniparib plus Carboplatin & gemcitabine Phase III trial to meet progression-free and overall survival goals in triple negative breast cancer patients (Zacks Investment Research on January 31, 2011). This failure may reflect the need to apply predictive methodologies to select candidates for these drugs, similar to Nagourney's successful work with other classes of compounds.",

      "Content": "Functional analysis of PARP inhibitors AZD 2281 and BSI-201 in human tumor primary cultures: A comparison of activity and examination of synergy with cytotoxic drugs. Sub-category: DNA Repair and Apoptosis Category: Developmental Therapeutics - Experimental Therapeutics Meeting: 2011 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstract No: e13599 Citation: J Clin Oncol 29: 2011 (suppl; abstr e13599) Author(s): R. A. Nagourney, K. R. Kenyon, F. R. Francisco, P. J. Bernard, S. S. Evans; Rational Therapeutics, Long Beach, CA Abstract: Background: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) are activated in response to cellular injury. DNA damage from radiation and cytotoxic drugs results in the up-regulation of PARP 1/2, leading to base excision repair. PARP inhibition enhances chemotherapy and induces cell death by synthetic lethality in patients with deficient homologous repair (BRCA1/2 and ATM). PARP inhibitors in development include benzamides, phthalazinones and benzimidazoles. Our work with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) led to the study of BSI-201 and AZD 2281, in human tumor micro-spheroids, isolated from surgical specimens and cytologically (+) fluids. Methods: Delayed loss of membrane integrity, morphologic and metabolic measures of drug-induced programmed cell death (EVA/PCD) were applied in 45 human tumor specimens exposed to PARP inhibitors, alone and in combination with cytotoxics. Lethal concentrations (LC50) were interpolated from 5-point dose response curves. Synergy was assessed by median effect. Drug activity comparisons were performed by modified Z-score. Results: PARP inhibitors are active in human tumor micro-spheroids. Activities for AZD 2281 and BSI-201 are superior to 3AB favoring BRCA1/2 and triple-negative (TN) breast over wild type and ER/PR (+); (AZD avg LC50 12 vs. 60 ug/mL; BSI avg LC50 19 vs. 30 ug/mL). AZD2281 and BSI-201 reveal synergy with CDDP, CDDP and gemcitabine, and alkylators. Of interest, BSI-201 and AZD-2281 activity did not correlate in parallel analyses (Pearson Moment, r = 0.07, P > 0.5). A comparison of BSI-201 and AZD 2281 activity with CDDP or taxol, suggested correlation with CCDP but not with taxol. Conclusions: 1) PARP inhibitors are active in human tumors favoring BRCA1/2 and TN breast. 2) Favorable interactions with DNA damaging agents are observed. 3) Activity profiles correlate more strongly with CDDP than taxol. 4) Direct comparisons suggest somewhat different activity profiles for BSI-201 vs. AZD-2281. 5) Individual activity/synergy profiles may provide opportunities for patient selection in the development of novel PARP combinations. Analyses in BRCA 1/2 and TN breast cancers are ongoing. Supported by The Vanguard Cancer Foundation and The Nagourney Institute.",

      "Content": "Cary Presant, M.D. Wilshire Oncology Medical Group The decision of chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone in patients with breast cancer, stage 1 or 2A is an important decision which we commonly make in our oncology practices. The advent of the Oncotype DX test, along with other similar tests such as MammaPrint and Mammostrat, have given us tools whose application is selectively very important. Recently, the adoption of gene expression profile testing has been reviewed by M. Hassett and coworkers (Journal of Clinical Oncology 30:2218-2226, 2012). In over 7,000 women, 20% received gene expression profile testing. Of those who had the test, 50% received chemotherapy. The use of gene expression profiling became more common between 2006 and 2008 (increasing from 14.7% to 27.5%). Unfortunately, they did not have more up to date data in the past 4 years. Needless to say, if an oncologist sees a clinical indication to use chemotherapy, addition of a gene expression profile test would be unnecessary. Similarly, if a patient were unwilling to consider chemotherapy, such a test would again be unnecessary. However, for women wanting the most appropriate, personalized, individualized therapy, the use of a gene expression profile test would be very important. Surprisingly, in the Hassett analysis, small, node negative cancers were associated with a higher odds of chemotherapy use. Surprisingly, node positive and large node negative cancers were associated with a lower chance of chemotherapy use following testing. Today, the use of this testing is extremely widespread in my community. At each tumor board, patients with stage 1 or 2 breast cancer are nearly universally recommended for such testing. The NCCN clinical practice guidelines suggests using this test to help make the clinical decision regarding the addition of chemotherapy. However, the intermediate risk group identified in the Oncotype DX testing is still the subject of an ongoing randomized phase III clinical trial. So the application of the test may not be associated with a clear cut answer as to whether or not chemotherapy is useful. Indeed, the frequency of intermediate test results seems to be increasing (Abstracts ASCO 2012). It is important to realize that until such a trial to determine the predictive utility of an intermediate result is completed, the study may be inconclusive. Furthermore, none of the gene expression profile tests have been subjected to a phase III prospective randomized trial (so far only retrospective data has been used). In my practice, discussing the uncertainty of this testing and applying one of the tests selectively is an important component of breast cancer adjuvant care. Therefore, such patients require several comprehensive visits to both evaluate the appropriateness of possible chemotherapy, and to evaluate the results of testing. The advance that these tests provide in care of cancer patients must be associated with continued awareness of the results of ongoing randomized prospective trials. The application of similar tests to colorectal cancer, lung cancer and other tumors remains a challenge for clinical trials as well as for the adoption into clinical practice.",

      "Content": "The latest British study on Intratumor Heterogeneity and Branched Evolution Revealed by Multiregion Sequencing may hinder personalized medicine strategies that depend on results from single tumor biopsy samples. A reply to a Dr. Robert Nagourney blog posting about this study, brought up the Oncotype DX assay. The woman's breast tumor was early stage 1/grade 1 NO ER/PR positive Her2 negative and her Oncotype DX showed 8% recurrence rate. After reading her pathology report, three years ago, she raised the question as to why the whole tumor was not looked at after the lumpectomy to make sure the diangosis was the same throughout the tumor. She was told it would be to lengthy, costly and she had nothing to worry about. She was told that they only test a slice of the tumor and throw the rest away. She was taken back by the oncologist's comment. Indeed, so would I. After she read an article on the British study, is she to assume she may have been right? Or was the pathologist correct in telling her with his assessment of her tumor coupled with the Oncotype DX that things looked good for her and she was not on the Titanic. She was very depressed for someone who was three years out and wondering whether or not the treatment she received was really what she needed. Indeed, intratumor heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of the tumor genomic landscape portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to personalized medicine and genetic biomarker development. Intratumor heterogeneity, associated with heterogeneous protein function, may foster tumor adaptation and therapeutic failure. The study is significant because it suggests relying on one sample could overlook important genetic biomarkers that help make tailored treatments effective, explaining perhaps why personalized cancer therapy has been less successful than expected. It's a theoretical but overrated problem. The same problem applies to ER, Her2, EGFR mutations, KRAS, OncotypeDx. Even worse for trying to do studies on individual cells, e.g. as from circulating tumor cells. Less of a problem for cell function analysis, since they are sampling a much bigger mass of cells and are homogenizing the mass (actually homogenizing the distribution of microclusters). It's analogous to the Gallup poll. You are projecting the behavior of a national electorate, based on a sample of 1,500 voters, who may or may not be representative of the whole. Rasmussen and Gallup have the same sized sample, but select different people for their polling (\"likely voters\" vs \"all voters\"), so their projections often disagree. It is one of the reasons why (1) \"resistance\" predictions tend to be more accurate than \"sensitive\" predictions (of the cancer is resistant anywhere, it pretty much doesn't matter), if you use the \"resistant\" drug, the patient will have progressive disease and (2) the tests are more analogous to using the barometric pressure to predict for rain than they are analogous to a serum sodium level; i.e. the predictions are useful (assay \"sensitive\" drugs being seven times more likely to work than assay \"resistant\" drugs), but they aren't perfect (i.e. 100%), no diagnostic test in medicine is.

      "Content": "Whole Organism Testing The most direct way to see if a chemotherapy drug will work is to administer it to the patient and see what happens. This is how most drugs are administered. Each patient, in effect, becomes his/her own experiment. If the drug(s) does not work, the patient needlessly suffers harmful side-effects, valuable treatment time is wasted, costs are incurred and the surviving tumor cells may become more resistant to all chemotherapy drugs, including drugs which the patient has not received. This is what is called clinically-acquired multi-drug resistance. Since patients cannot endure exposure to all of the available chemotherapy drugs, many potentially effective drugs will go untested. Also, since chemotherapy drugs commonly are administered in combination, there is no way to know which drug or drugs in a particular combination may have been more effective and which were less effective or not effective at all.

      "Content": "Antonio C. Wolff, M.D. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore Gene expression profile testing to guide decisions regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer should not be used to override the results of standard pathologic measures, Dr. Antonio C. Wolff asserted at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Two gene expression profile tests commonly used in breast cancer are the Oncotype DX and MammaPrint assays. The excitement surrounding this whole field is such that Dr. Wolff suspects many clinicians see the molecular assays as being superior to standard clinicopathologic data in their predictive information. This actually hasn\u2019t been shown to be the case to date, he stressed. \"One of the big messages I bring today is that one method is not necessarily better than the other. The standard pathologic tests and the molecular assays may be complementary in the information they provide,\" said Dr. Wolff, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore. He added that while guideline-based use of these first-generation molecular assays as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the European St. Gallen\u2019s Expert Consensus group is appropriate, it\u2019s important to recognize that these tests have their shortcomings. For one, they leave a lot of patients in the gray intermediate-risk zone. Also, the tests aren\u2019t applicable to the 25%-35% of breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor\u2013negative tumors. But a host of new technologies are in the pipeline, he observed. A recent study of 7,375 breast cancer patients with hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer diagnosed in 2006-2008 was enlightening with regard to how clinicians are using gene expression profile testing. The study, an analysis of NCCN prospective registry data conducted by investigators at Boston\u2019s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, showed a progressive increase in the use of the Oncotype DX test. The test was employed in 14.7% of the patients diagnosed in 2006, nearly doubling to 27.5% of those diagnosed in 2008. Meanwhile, use of chemotherapy decreased from 53.9% to 47%. Gene expression profile testing was associated with an overall 30% reduction in the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy. What Dr. Wolff found particularly interesting was that testing of small, node-negative cancers was associated with an 11.1-fold increased likelihood of chemotherapy, while testing of lymph node\u2013positive or large node-negative cancers was associated with an 89% reduction in chemotherapy (J. Clin. Oncol. 2012;30:2218-26). African American women were 30% less likely to undergo testing. Women with no more than a high school education were 37% less likely to be tested than were those with more schooling. Dr. Wolff suspects these disparities are a reflection of better-educated women asking more questions of their physician about their planned treatment course, and the physician in response seeking more laboratory data to help in making treatment decisions. Dr. Wolff said that while clinicians await studies to determine whether molecular and standard clinicopathologic information can be combined to improve prediction, one of the most important things they can do is to pay close attention to preanalytic issues. \"It\u2019s critical to get tissue from patient to pathologist within 1 hour to avoid cold ischemia and necrosis and deterioration of the specimen that will not only adversely affect the quality of standard measures, but also of the new measures. This is a big deal!\" he emphasized. Dr. Wolff reported that he serves as an investigator for Genentech. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?t...0%3A%202218-26 http://www.cancernetwork.com/confere.../10165/2117513",

      "Content": "Is Gene Array Testing To Be Considered Routine Now? Breast. 2011 Oct 1;20(3), S Paik Abstract Background: There are five multi-gene expression based prognostic tests for breast cancer offered as reference lab tests - Mammaprint, MapQuant Dx, OncotypeDx, PAM50 Breast Cancer Intrinsic Subtype Classifier, and Theros Breast Cancer Index. Each claims to provide additional prognostic information beyond conventional prognostic markers and to aid in determining who should receive systemic therapy. Evidence for their clinical utility was reviewed to determine whether any of them should be considered as routine clinical test. Methods: Peer reviewed publications, meeting abstracts, and information provided by company web sites have been reviewed to compile information regarding their clinical utility according to the following criteria; (1) Analytical validity and regulatory approval of the reference lab test. (2) Level of evidence for clinical utility. (3) Whether published evidences support prognostic and/or predictive claim. Results: While published evidences for clinical claims for OncotypeDx and Mammaprint used reference lab tests, and the supporting evidences for other tests come from academic assays before being converted to reference lab tests, results from two large randomized clinical trials testing the clinical utility of OncotypeDx and Mammaprint are still several years away and until that time none of the markers would reach level I evidence by Marker Utility Grading System. However Oncotype Dx has reached a level IB evidence according to Simon modification to Marker Utility Grading System. Therefore OncotypeDx may be considered for routine clinical use as an adjunct to clinical and pathological information and has been incorporated into clinical guidelines in USA. While Mammaprint, MapQuantDx, and PAM50 have been repeatedly demonstrated to provide robust prognostic information, evidence for its worth as a predictive marker for chemotherapy benefit is yet to come from randomize clinical trials and therefore its utility is limited to prognostication. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray based gene expression studies demonstrated that gene expression assays provide similar information and the most important information they provide is the proliferation activity. In untreated population, the prognostic impact of proliferation genes is limited to ER+HER2− subset since HER2+ or ER−HER2− subsets are associated with high proliferation activity. Therefore the clinical utility of these gene expression based tests is mainly for ER+HER2− subset. Since they are usually treated with adjuvant anti-estrogen therapies, for their clinical utility, demonstration of the interaction between the gene expression markers and chemotherapy in anti-estrogen treated cohort in a randomized clinical trial would be required. While OncoytpeDx is the only test supported by studies in a randomized clinical trial for adjuvant chemotherapy, other gene expression based tests are expected to provide similar information. Gene expression profiling assays as more reproducible and precise surrogates for tumor grade (MapQauntDx and Theros Breast Cancer Index) are very promising assays. However, absence of definitive predefined cut-off for defining the subset that benefit from chemotherapy validated in cohorts from randomized trials limit their clinical application. http://www.thebreastonline.com/artic...301-0/abstract",

      "Content": "Circulating cell-free DNA carrying tumor-specific alterations (circulating tumor DNA) is more effective at monitoring metastatic breast cancer than current biomarkers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and circulating tumor cells, according to a proof-of-concept study. The study, led by Sarah-Jane Dawson, PhD, from the University of Cambridge and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, in the United Kingdom, was published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Metastatic breast cancer is incurable but treatable with serial administration of endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic therapies,\" Carlos Caldas, MD, also from the University of Cambridge and one of the study authors, told Medscape Medical News. Monitoring treatment response is essential and can be carried out with biomarkers such as cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and circulating tumor cells, using the CellSearch (Veridex) test, but we are seeking better biomarkers, Dr. Caldas said. \"Effectively, genomics provides a new type of very specific biomarker for monitoring tumors in response to therapy. In other words, the mutations that each tumor accumulates are an individual genomic 'barcode' that we can then use to monitor tumor burden and response to treatment,\" he explained. The researchers used targeted or whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic genomic alterations, and designed personalized assays to quantify circulating tumor DNA in serially collected plasma specimens. They also measured CA 15-3 levels and numbers of circulating tumor cells at identical time points. They found that circulating tumor DNA was superior to the other 2 blood tests. Circulating tumor DNA was successfully detected in 29 of the 30 women (97%) with metastatic breast cancer receiving systemic therapy in whom somatic genomic alterations were identified. In comparison, CA 15-3 was detected in 21 of 27 women (78%) and circulating tumor cells were detected in 26 of 30 women (87%). In addition to its superior sensitivity in detecting metastatic breast cancer, circulating tumor DNA had a greater dynamic range, which correlated with changes in tumor burden. The test also provided the earliest measure of treatment response in 10 of the 30 women tested, Dr. Caldas said. He added that most laboratories equipped to do molecular testing can do this test using circulating tumor DNA; however, these are usually only located in major tertiary care centers. \"I think this...will be a landmark report, and circulating tumor DNA is going to be one of the highlights in medicine in 2013. The test will definitely be used in clinical research immediately, although generic use in cancer patients will have wait until diagnostic companies release tests for use,\" Dr. Caldas said. In a press release issued by Cancer Research UK, which funded the study in part, chief clinician Peter Johnson, MD, was quoted as saying: \"These results hold the promise of a system that could allow us to modify someone's treatment as their cancer changes, and they suggest an exciting way to quickly get hold of the personal details of a cancer, to target it for the most effective therapy.\" \"One of the things that will help our scientists design better cancer treatments is a way of measuring early on which ones are working and which are not. If we can find the molecular footprints of cancers during treatment and see how they change, we hope we will be able to track them down and remove them much more efficiently,\" he added. Approach Has \"Remarkable Potential\" In an accompanying editorial, Marc Lippman, MD, from the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Florida, and C. Kent Osborne, MD, from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, agree that this test has definite possibilities. There is remarkable potential for this approach, they write, but they also list some concerns. \"All patients with breast cancer have mutations in their tumor DNA, but without very intensive sequencing strategies, a specific probe or probes for each patient may remain elusive or very costly,\" and a standard 'panel' is unlikely to work for all patients,\" Drs. Lippman and Osborne write. Also, the number of patients in whom an objective response to treatment was seen in circulating tumor DNA was limited, so the \"laudable effort\" to compare the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA with circulating tumor cells and measures of CA 15-3 \"was more encouraging than definitive.\" The editorialists conclude that this study provides proof of the concept that circulating tumor DNA is \"a sensitive biomarker of tumor burden,\" and add that studies showing that it can be used to improve the care of patients with metastatic breast or even other cancers \"in a cost-effective manner\" are needed. The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, the National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, and by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council R.G. Menzies Early Career Fellowship to Dr. Dawson. Dr. Caldas, Dr. Lippman, and Dr. Osborne have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. N Engl J Med.

      "Content": "Although ten years of genetic profiling has had an enormous impact on the understanding of breast cancer, progress on individualizing therapy has been rather limited, researchers from the UK and USA reported in The Lancet this week. Specifically, the authors refer to the prognostic and predictive factors associated with personalized medicine, even though genetic profiling offers enormous potential for better prediction of outcomes and optimizing individual patients' treatments. At this moment there are no commercially available molecular tests that can predict benefit from a specific therapeutic agent, despite of many prognostic and predictive signatures having been developed. Scientists are still unable to accurately determine prognosis or chemotherapy success in some disease subsets, such as ER-negative and triple negative disease. Jorge Reis-Filho from The Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, UK and Lajos Pusztai from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, USA, set out to determine what progress, if any, had been made over the last ten years regarding microarray analysis (expression profiling) of breast cancers. Treatment decisions have usually been based on several clinical factors, such as tumor size and its location, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and whether the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or distant sites in the body. The researchers explain: \"With these approaches, about 60% of all patients with early-stage breast cancer still receive adjuvant chemotherapy, of which only a small proportion, 2-15% of patients, will ultimately derive benefit, while all remain at risk of toxic side-effects.\" In addition to information provided by clinicopathological features, the introduction of first generation prognostic gene signatures has offered clinically useful prognostics. At present, several genomic tests are being used in women with ER-positive disease to help determine the likelihood of cancer recurrence, and which patients' outcome has been sufficiently successful in order to deem chemotherapy unnecessary. However, the researchers comment: \"Increasingly clear is that the prognostic information offered by these [first generation prognostic] signatures in addition to the information provided by semi-quantitaive analysis of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 is limited...and the continued importance of standardized histo-pathological analysis of tumors should be emphasized.\" Using gene signatures to predict which patients may benefit from specific therapies has been less successful, and even though scientists have developed many predictive signatures, some have been based on unreliable data; their usefulness in patients continues to be controversial. This could be due to the fact that resistance to chemotherapy is a complex mechanism, as it can be caused by changes in just one or a small number of genes? The likelihood of diverse and often subtle changes resulting in resistance to chemotherapy being reliably identified by standard gene expression profiling is extremely small. In a concluding statement the researchers say: \"The theoretical knowledge and logistical lessons learned from gene expression profiling studies, however, will prove useful for research aiming to develop the next generation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers.\" References: Prof Jorge S Reis-Filho FRCPath and Prof Lajos Pusztai MD \"Gene expression profiling in breast cancer: classification, prognostication, and prediction\" The Lancet, Volume 378, Issue 9805, Pages 1812 - 1823, 19 November 2011. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61539-0 http://www.thelancet.com/journals/la...539-0/abstract",

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. A study conducted by Canadian investigators and reported in the September 1, 2013 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology examined the impact of Metformin use on mortality in men with diabetes and prostate cancer (Margel D. Urbach DR., Lipscombe LL, Metformin Use and All-Cause and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality Among Men with Diabetes, Journal of Clinical Oncology, volume 31, #25, pgs 3069-3075, 2013). The investigators examined 3837 patient with a median age of 75 years. They conducted a retrospective analysis examining the Ontario Province heath care records. The intent was to examine duration of exposure to Metformin as a diabetes management in patients with prostate cancer to assess the impact on all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality. The results are impressive and instructive. There was a significant decrease in the risk of prostate cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, which related to the dose and duration of exposure to Metformin. The adjusted hazard ratio for the study of 0.76 indicates that there is a 24% reduction in mortality for prostate cancer-specific events with the use of Metformin. This study was not perfect, as it was retrospective, there was no randomization and it was impossible to control for all other variables such as exercise, smoking history and clinical parameters of prostate cancer. Nonetheless, there is a clear and important trend toward reduced prostate cancer and even overall mortality. This is but one of a series of clinical studies that have examined the impact of Metformin upon not only prostate cancer but also breast cancer. Much of this work was originally pioneered by Dr. Michael Pollack from McGill University in Montreal. Metformin and the closely related Phenformin are members of the class of drugs known as biguanides. While the exact mode of action of the biguanides is not fully understood, they are known to disrupt mitochondrial respiration at complex I. This upregulates an enzyme known as adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) thereby altering energy metabolism within the cell and down regulating mTOR. In diabetics, this drives down blood glucose to control the disease. However, in cancer patients, a profound effect is observed that suppresses synthetic pathways necessary for energy metabolism, cellular survival and cellular proliferation. These effects appear responsible for the impact upon prostate cancer. Interestingly, these drugs are more effective in controlling already transformed cells and less effective in the prevention of cancer. This is consistent with the observation that malignantly transformed cells change their state of metabolism. This article is interesting on many levels. The first and most obvious is that this relatively inexpensive and well-tolerated drug can have an impact on prostate cancer. Secondly, these effects appear to cross the lines of different cancer types, such that breast cancer and other forms of cancer might also be successfully treated. The third note of interest shows that even patients without diabetes can tolerate Metformin, suggesting this as an adjunct to many different treatments. Finally and most importantly this represents the new and important recognition that cancer is not a genomic disorder, but a metabolic disorder. Cancer may utilize normal genetic elements to its own advantage. AMP kinase, LKB1 and mTOR are not unique to cancer, but instead, are found in every cell. These normal proteins are simply altered in their function in malignantly transformed cells. Metformin is one of what will soon be a large number of metabolomic agents entering the clinical arena as cancer research moves from the nucleus to the mitochondrion. http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/31/25/3069.abstract",

      "Content": "In an early trial, an experimental breast cancer drug stopped disease growth and shrank tumors by more than 30 percent in some patients. The pill, bemaciclib, was safe and well-tolerated by women with breast cancer that had spread, or metastasized, to other parts of the body, according to the results of this phase 1 trial. \"This is a novel oral treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said lead researcher Dr. Amita Patnaik, the associate director of clinical research at South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics in San Antonio. If these results are replicated in future trials, it's conceivable that the pill might extend survival for women with terminal breast cancer, experts suggested. The drug was particularly effective for the most common type of breast cancer, called hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In this type of cancer, cancer cells grow in response to signals from the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone. The study included more than 130 women. Overall, Patnaik said half of them had cancer growth controlled and 25 percent had shrinkage of their tumors. Unlike standard cancer drugs, this is a twice-daily pill that allows women to go on with their daily lives. In contrast, other cancer drugs are given intravenously at a hospital or doctor's office. Another difference, Patnaik said, is that bemaciclib is a targeted therapy, a newer type of drug that is better able to identify and attack specific cells. \"Our results show that it can be given safely over a long period of time, and patients are able to go on with their routine activities and have a good quality of life,\" she said. Side effects of the drug include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. For study participants, most of these problems were mild or moderate, Patnaik said. The trial results were presentated on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego. The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co., the maker of bemaciclib. \"It is important to remember that this is a first-time evaluation of the drug and these results will have to be confirmed in later studies,\" Patnaik cautioned. More trials are being planned, she said. Dr. Neelima Denduluri, a medical oncologist at Virginia Cancer Specialists in Arlington, pointed out that metastatic breast cancer is generally incurable. \"Goals of therapy include maintaining quality of life while administering effective therapy,\" said Denduluri, who was not involved in the study. She said she hopes bemaciclib and other new drugs will make a difference in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, doctors often use anti-estrogen therapies. However, tumor cells stop responding to these drugs, so alternatives are often needed, Denduluri said. \"Bemaciclib's trial results are very exciting and confirm that developing this class of drugs is very promising for patients with advanced breast cancer,\" Denduluri added. For the study, Patnaik's team tested the drug on 132 women with breast cancer. Forty-seven of them with metastatic cancer had tried as many as seven other drugs before bemaciclib. The women took bemaciclib pills twice daily for 28 days. Thirty-six of the 47 patients with metastatic breast cancer had hormone receptor-positive disease, the researchers noted. Nine of the 47 patients had a partial response, and 24 of the 47 patients saw the growth of their cancer stopped. Among the metastatic breast cancer group, 11 patients had their cancer progress despite treatment, the researchers said. Among women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 81 percent had a complete response, partial response or stable disease, and their cancer didn't progress for an average of nine months, the study found. For study participants overall, progression-free survival was nearly 6 months. The trial lasted 28 days, but women who benefited from the drug could continue on it in 28 day cycles as long as they continued to benefit. Eighteen of the hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients are still being treated with bemaciclib, said Patnaik. Dr. Myra Barginear, an oncologist at North Shore-LIJ Cancer Institute in Lake Success, N.Y., is also excited about the potential of this drug and others like it. \"As a breast cancer doctor, I am thrilled to potentially have a new agent for my patients with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. This is the most common type of breast cancer -- representing approximately 80 percent of all cases,\" she said. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Source: HealthDayNews",

      "Content": "The FDA just approved the new treatment for about 20% of breast cancer patients who have a particular form of the disease that overproduces the protein HER-2. The drug now called Kadcyla, combines the Herceptin with a powerful chemotherapy toxin and a third chemical linking the medicines together. The chemical keeps the drugs intact until they bind to a cancer cell, where the medication is released. The cost of the drug is about $9,800 a month or $94,000 for a typical course of treatment. It is about twice the price of Herceptin itself and similar to the price of some other new cancer drugs. The label of Kadcyla has a warning saying the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity and death. It can also cause serious birth defects or fetal death for women of childbearing age. http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsro.../ucm340704.htm The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, Genentech), also known as T-DM1, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is indicated for patients who were previously treated with the anti-HER2 therapy trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and a taxane chemotherapy. This product offers a new twist on an older product; it is an antibody\u0096drug conjugate in which the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab is chemically linked to the cytotoxin mertansine (DM1). The antibody homes in on HER2 breast cancer cells, delivering the chemotherapy directly to the tumor, which reduces the risk for toxicity. T-DM1 \"delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression, and prolong survival,\" said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products at the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press statement. \"It is the fourth approved drug that targets the HER2 protein.\" In the pivotal phase 3 EMILIA study, patients receiving T-DM1 survived nearly 6 months longer than patients receiving the standard therapy of lapatinib (Tykerb) plus capecitabine (Xeloda) (median overall survival, 30.9 vs 25.1 months). Also, there were fewer grade 3 or higher (severe) adverse events with TDM-1 than with standard therapy (43.1% vs. 59.2%), according to the company. The approval represents a \"momentous\" day in breast cancer, said Kathy Miller, MD, from Indiana University in Indianapolis, in her Miller on Oncology Medscape blog. \"Our HER2-positive patients with metastatic disease have another very powerful therapy that offers the real hope for prolonged disease control with less toxicity,\" she said. \"This is the classic light-beer scenario; it's less filling and tastes great,\" she summarized, adding that T-DM1 was more effective in EMILIA than standard therapy on every outcome: overall response rate, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. However, another expert sees T-DM1 in a less dramatic light. Steve Vogl, MD, a private practitioner and former academic who practices in the Bronx, New York, called T-DM1 a \"nice\" drug when he discussed the product in an online essay last year. T-DM1 causes \"no alopecia, little neutropenia, and only moderate thrombocytopenia. It requires only a short infusion every 3 weeks, lacks cumulative toxicity, and has a response rate as first-line chemotherapy that is about the same as that of docetaxel and trastuzumab, with apparently longer remissions,\" he wrote. However, Dr. Vogl called the EMILIA control regimen (lapatinib and capecitabine) \"distinctly suboptimal\" and not a standard of care, even though it is an FDA-approved treatment option in this setting. \"TDM-1 does not meet [the] goals of a major advance,\" wrote Dr. Vogl, who explained that such an advance must cure some patients, increase the rate of clinical complete remission, or produce a high rate of very long partial response. TDM-1 does not provide a \"major change in prognosis\" for women with metastatic disease who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment, he wrote, adding that it is likely to be \"very expensive.\" Study Data and Boxed Warning The international open-label EMILIA study involved 991 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy. The study met the coprimary efficacy end points of overall survival and progression-free survival (assessed by an independent review committee). Median progression-free survival was longer with TDM-1 than with lapatinib plus capecitabine (9.6 vs 6.4 months). In addition, patients treated with TDM-1 lived significantly longer without their disease getting worse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; reduction in risk of disease worsening or death, 35%; P < .0001). The risk of dying was 32% lower with TDM-1 than with lapatinib and capecitabine (HR, 0.68; P = .0006). For patients receiving TDM-1, the most common adverse events (occurring in more than 2% of participants) of grade 3 or higher were low platelet count (14.5%), increased levels of enzymes released by the liver and other organs (8%), low red blood cell count (4.1%), low levels of potassium in the blood (2.7%), nerve problems (2.2%), and tiredness (2.5%). T-DM1 was reviewed under the FDA's priority review program, which provides for an expedited 6-month review of drugs that might provide safe and effective therapy when no satisfactory alternative exists, or that offer significant improvement over comparable products on the market. T-DM1 is being approved with a boxed warning that alerts patients and healthcare professionals that the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity, and death. The drug can also cause severe life-threatening birth defects, so pregnancy status should be verified prior to starting T-DM1 treatment. Dr. Vogl has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

      "Content": "I've heard from breast cancer patients who were bumped from the T-DM1 clinical trial because of disease progression, which meant that their cancer was growing despite the drug. Bumped off the trial because of disease progression? Wonder how many more patients there were like this? Response rates (how much a tumor decreased in size) can be inflated when excluding patients during clinical trials (evaluable patients). Patients not considered \"evaluable\" are often those who do not get the benefit of an entire treatment plan. The response rate is calculated after removing patients, who die or have been excluded, from the calculation. This inflates the response rate. But clinical oncologists want to publish their papers. They need to report on the outcomes of their experiments, but if they had to wait for survival data, it could take years until all the data was aggregated. That wouldn't bode well for them to participate in pharma-sponsored trials in the future. Response rates give clinical oncologists the opportunity to take a more optimistic look at therapies that have limited success. They can describe results as being complete remission, partial remission or simply clinical improvement. If they treat all patients for three weeks, they can fairly evaluate the efficacy of a compound, which takes that lone (on average) before it can be regarded as effective. If they disregard all patients who die or were excluded after onset of therapy, and include only those treated three weeks or more, they can improve their data. To justify their existence, they have to publish papers. That's what they do.",

      "Content": "Dako, an Agilent Technologies Company and worldwide provider of cancer diagnostics, announced today it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the addition of Kadcyla in the labeling of two Dako companion diagnostic assays. Kadcyla (ado-trastuzumab emtansine) is Genentech's new medicine for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have received prior treatment with Genentech's cancer medicine Herceptin (trastuzumab) and a taxane chemotherapy. The two assays are Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx. Today's announcement is the result of a collaboration between Dako and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The collaboration was initiated in early 2012, and later the same year Dako submitted applications to the FDA requesting approval of the two Dako assays as companion diagnostics for Genentech's drug candidate for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Genentech's Kadcyla, an antibody-drug conjugate, and Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx have received simultaneous approvals from the FDA. Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx will serve as diagnostic tools to identify cancer patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who may be eligible for Kadcyla treatment. \"At Dako, we focus on advancing cancer diagnostics, because patients' lives depend on it,\" said Lars Holmkvist, CEO of Dako and senior vice president, Agilent. \"Partnering with companies who are also relentless in their commitment to fighting cancer is an important element in achieving this goal. Today's FDA approval is the result of excellent collaboration between Dako and Genentech.\" Dako's ongoing strategy is to combine its strength in developing companion diagnostics with its proven ability to partner with pharmaceutical companies to increase the number of companion diagnostic assays and ultimately improve personalized medicine.

      "Content": "The area of pharmacogenomics was ripe for proprietary tests invented alongside a drug and owned by the drug developer and/or a partner in the diagnostic field. HercepTest uses immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for the detection of HER2 protein over-expression in breast cancer. It measures the level of proteins in cancer cells providing clues about which therapies are \"likely\" to have clinical benefit. HER2 IQFISH pharmDX is a direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, It uses breast carcinoma specimens (FFPE) stained with HER2 IQFISH pharmDX. FISH is used to examine gene copy number variation in the tumor. These tests serve as a companion diagnostic tool to identify cancer patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who \"may\" be eligible for Kadcyla treatment. Because the results of the IHC test can sometimes be ambiguous, many doctors suggest the FISH test for a second opinion. Tumors that are 3+ positive by IHC and those that test positive by FISH are most likely to benefit from HER2-inhibitors. Tumors that test 1+ by IHC are considered HER2/neu negative and those that test 2+ are considered equivical, in which case FISH testing is done to make the determination. Tumors that test negative for HER2/neu by FISH are \"unlikely\" to benefit from HER2-inhibitors. Either test examines \"dead\" tissue that is preserved in paraffin or formalin. According to a professor of translational genomics at the Scripps Research Institute, specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE). FFPE ruins sequencing capabilities, denatures everything, and ruins the samples. How is that going to be predictive to the behavior of \"living\" cells in spontaneously formed colonies or microspheres? Can it describe the complex behavior of living cancer cells in response to the injury they receive from different forms of chemotherapy? There is a big difference between \"living\" and \"dead\" tissue. All the gene amplificaton studies can tell us is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to this mechanism of attack. They don't tell you if one drug inhibitor is better or wrose than another drug inhibitor which may target this. No gene-based test can discriminate differing levels of anti-tumor activity occurring among different targeted therapy drugs. Nor can an available gene-based test identify situations in which it is advantageous to combine a targeted drug with other types of conventional cancer drugs. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems\u0092 response to drug treatments, not just one target or pathway.",

      "Content": "Treatment with palbociclib combined with letrozole resulted in significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with letrozole alone in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, according to a phase 2 trial presented at the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting in San Diego, CA, on April 6, 2014. Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. The study design comprised 2 parts. In part 1, researchers recruited 66 postmenopausal patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer and, in part 2, they recruited 99 postmenopausal patients with the same diagnosis who had been found to have CCND1 amplification and/or loss of p16, which are markers of sensitivity to palbociclib. Patients continued to receive medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study, and their tumors were assessed every 2 months.1 PFS in patients treated with palbociclib plus letrozole was almost double that of patients treated with letrozole alone: 20.2 versus 10.2 months (P=0.0004). There was a 51% reduction in the risk of disease progression in patients who received palbociclib.1 \u0093This study grew out of a strong initial preclinical observation made a few years ago that hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells are dependent on CDK-4/CDK-6 for their growth, and that these cancers are sensitive to inhibition of CDK-4/CDK-6,\u0094 said lead researcher Richard S. Finn, MD, associate professor of medicine at the University of California in Los Angeles. The risk for disease progression did not decrease further in patients who were recruited in part 2 of the study, whose tumors had the molecular targets specific for the drug: risk decreased by 70% for those in part 1, compared with 49% for those in part 2. \u0093The challenge with any targeted drug is identifying patients who are dependent on the target,\u0094 said Dr. Finn. \u0093Having an intact Rb pathway seems to be the most critical factor for this drug to be effective, because most hormone-positive tumors are dependent on this pathway.\u0094 Overall survival was 37.5 months in patients treated with palbociclib and letrozole and 33.3 months in patients treated with letrozole alone, a difference that was not significant.1 \u0093A small lead-in phase 1 study conducted prior to this phase 2 trial showed that palbociclib and the antiestrogen drug letrozole could be given safely as a combination, with manageable side effects,\u0094 said Dr. Finn. The most common adverse events associated with palbociclib treatment were neutropenia, leukopenia, fatigue, and anemia. \u0093It is important that we not only improve the efficacy of the compound, but also that we do not add an undue burden in toxicity, and we are happy that the drug was well tolerated overall.\u0094 Two important reasons for the success of this trial, Dr. Finn explained, were that hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative patients are more likely than other patients to benefit from palbociclib and that the compound is highly specific in its ability to block CDK-4 and CDK-6, leading to less toxicity. Palbociclib is being tested in phase 3 trials in combination with letrozole (PALOMA-2) and fulvestrant (PALOMA-3) for late-stage, metastatic breast cancers, and in combination with standard endocrine therapy (PENELOPE-B) for certain early-stage breast cancers.

      "Content": "Cyclin-dependent kinases as therapeutic targets: Examination of palbociclib (PD 0332991) and flavopiridol in human tumor primary culture microspheroids. Author(s): Robert Alan Nagourney, Eknath A. Deo, Nilesh L. Vora, Milan Rohit Sheth, Paula J Bernard, Federico R Francisco, Steven S Evans; Rational Therapeutics, Long Beach, CA; Malcolm Todd Cancer Institute, Long Beach, CA; Todd Cancer Institiute, Long Beach, CA; UC Irvine Medical Center, Long Beach, CA Abstract: Background: The cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) are a family of enzymes that mediate cell cycle progression. CDK dysregulation is a common event in human carcinogenesis, making CDK inhibition an attractive target for therapy. Palbociclib (PD) is a selective CDK 4/6 inhibitor, while flavopiridol (FL) is non-specific. CDK inhibitors are now in clinical trials. Methods: To examine the activity and compare the profiles of PD & FL, we used Ex Vivo Analyses of Programmed Cell Death (EVA/PCD) in human tumor primary cultures isolated from surgical specimens. After disaggregation, microspheroids, isolated by precise density centrifugation were exposed to PD or FL for 72 hours and drug induced cell death then measured by delayed-loss-of-membrane integrity and/or ATP content (luciferase).Dose response curves were interpolated to LC50 values. Twenty nine PD, 68 FL and 20-both specimens were studied. Results: PD & FL reveal activity in a broad array of tumors including upper GI, NSCLC, Breast, Ovary & Hematologic. No activity was observed for FL or PD in Head & Neck. Similar profiles were observed except in prostate where FL was more active than PD. Correlations by Pearson Moment revealed an R = 0.58 P<0.01 (2-tailed T). Conclusions: Findings confirm activity for the CDK inhibitors and suggest disease specific profiles. With culture conditions established, further analyses are now comparing PD with other classes of drugs, to examine combinations, synergy & sequence dependence, as will be reported.

      "Content": "Progression-free survival (PFS) is the length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a disease that does not get worse. Time to progression (TTP) is a measure of time after a disease is diagnosed (or treated) until the disease starts to get worse. In the Annals of Oncology, it states that clinical investigators seem to be frequently using PFS and TTP interchangeably in cancer. Such use of terms may lead to confusion when results of different trials are compared. Clinical trials virtually always have progression-free survival as a primary endpoint. Without imaging studies, one can't get accurate time to progression data. So tests are performed for the benefit of drug companies seeking new drug approval, for clinical investigators seeking contracts and publications, and for clinicians seeking an easy way to make clinical decisions. The final arbiter of clinical approval is overall survival. Progression-free survival does not address the patient's quality of life during what little additional months of some serious side effects that can be experienced. And drug response is not even a reliable predictor of overall survival. Overall survival is based on death from any cause like side effects of treatment and effects on survival after relapse.",

      "Content": "Metastasectomy and Surgical Resection of the Primary Tumor in Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer Time for a Second Look? Ann Surg Oncol. 2010 September; 17(9): 2419\u00962426. Epub 2010 Mar 16. A substantial body of evidence exists to suggest that there may be benefit to the surgical resection of limited metastatic disease in patients with stage IV breast cancer. In addition to improvement in survival, an improvement in quality of life because of discontinuation of chemotherapy and decreased tumor burden are also potential benefits. However, much of the data are limited to single-institution series with variable adjuvant or neoadjuvant approaches and are subject to selection bias by treating physicians. Similarly, the question of resection of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic breast cancer has ignited a debate that can only be conclusively settled by a carefully designed randomized trial, as has been proposed by others as well. Even with attempts to control for confounding factors by multivariate analysis as well as by matched pair analysis, the question remains as to whether an improvement in survival in these patients may well be the result of selection criteria rather than any inherent benefit. The results of such a trial not only would hold significance for breast cancer, but also might provide for insight into understanding cancer biology and the development of new treatment paradigms for other cancer types. Patients with metastatic or stage IV breast cancer have limited therapeutic options, and the mainstay of treatment remains systemic chemotherapy. Traditionally, the role of surgery has been confined to strict palliation. Improvements in the efficacy of chemotherapeutic regimens, coupled with the use of hormonal and targeted therapy, have resulted in an expansion of surgical resection beyond simple palliation. Several single-institution studies have reported improved survival and even long-term cures after surgical resection for oligometastatic stage IV breast cancer. Similarly, provocative new data suggest that removal of the primary tumor in some patients may confer a survival advantage. The aim of this review is to summarize studies in the medical literature pertaining to the use of surgical resection in patients with stage IV breast cancer. There is enough evidence to challenge conventional thinking about the role of surgery in stage IV breast cancer and to consider a new multimodality treatment paradigm to optimize patient outcomes. It is time to conduct a carefully designed randomized trial to see whether surgery in stage IV breast cancer does indeed warrant a second look. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930757/",

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Rational Therapeutics The discovery of cisplatinum and the subsequent development of its derivatives (carboplatin and oxaliplatin) represent an interesting saga in modern oncology. When Rosenberg observed in 1960s that platinum electrodes in salt water baths inhibited the growth of bacteria and fungi it lead to the isolation of cis-dichloro diamine platinum (cisplatin). Its application in testicular cancer provided a dramatic leap forward for this heretofore-lethal disease. Subsequent applications in ovary and lung cancers lead to some of the most effective therapies in modern oncology. Although the exact mechanisms of action continue to be investigated, the platination of guanine residues in DNA constitutes the principle mechanism of cytotoxicity. The use of the human tumor laboratory model has provided us the luxury of exploring the platinum drugs in a wide variety of diseases. Among our published discoveries has been the relative equivalence of the platinum derivatives, as well as their profound synergy with agents like Gemzar (gemcitabine). It is of significant interest that this broadly effective class of compounds \u0097 extensively applied in the treatment of lung, colorectal, ovarian and breast cancers, as well as others \u0097 remains less active in the hematologic neoplasms. This is in striking counter distinction to nearly all other classes of chemotherapeutics. Among our most gratifying observations, from the early 1990s, was the clear and profound activity of the platinum derivatives in breast cancers. We feel that our discoveries, outlined in an editorial published in 2000 (The Once and Future Role of Platinum Agents in Advanced Breast Cancer), in no small part have influenced the broad application of platinum in modern breast cancer management. It was not genius or divine intervention that lead us to these important discoveries, but, quite simply, the use of a validated human tumor model that accurately probed tumor types, leading us to these findings. It is virtually impossible for an unbiased observer to review these contributions and not recognize that the human tumor model has been the conduit by which these discoveries were made. The proper study of human cancer is human cancer. Our results speak for themselves when it comes to ovarian, breast and hematologic neoplasms, treatments for which can be traced directly to our laboratories. http://robertanagourney.files.wordpr...uture-role.pdf",

      "Content": "Targeted therapy halts the growth of certain cancers by zeroing in on a signaling molecule critical to the survival of those cancer cells. The drugs are effective in about 10-15% of patients. The drugs work specifically in patients whose cancers contain mutations in a gene that encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or some other pathway. The EGFR stands at the origin of a major signaling pathway involved in the growth of breast cancer. Two of the four receptors in this pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1) and epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2, also referred to as HER2/neu or ErbB2), are promising targets for new treatments. In about 20% of patients with breast cancer, the tumor overexpresses HER2. Herceptin, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of HER2, is effective as adjuvant therapy and as treatment for metastatic disease in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Tykerb, an orally administered small-molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domains of HER1 and HER2, has antitumor activity when used as a single agent in patients with HER2-positive inflammatory breast cancer or HER2-positive breast cancer with central nervous system (CNS) metastases that are refractory to Herceptin. This finding is important because HER2-positive tumors frequently spread to the CNS, where the tumor is sheltered from Herceptin and most chemotherapeutic agents. Other targeted therapies also show great promise in the treatment of breast cancer. Avastin is a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Tumors can be effectively controlled by targeting the network of blood vessels that feed them. Tumor growth is dependent on angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is dependent on VEGF. Avastin directly binds to VEGF to directly inhibit angiogenesis. Within 24 hours of VEGF inhibition, endothelial cells have been shown to shrivel, retract, fragment and die by apoptosis. In addition to VEGF, researchers have identified a dozen other activators of angiogenesis, some of which are similar to VEGF. Although these targeted therapies are initially effective in certain subsets of patients, the drugs eventually stop working, and the tumors begin to grow again. This is called acquired or secondary resistance. This is different from primary resistance, which means that the drugs never work at all. The change of a single base in DNA that encodes the mutant protein has been shown to cause drug resistance. Initially, tumors have the kinds of mutations in the EGFR or VEGF gene that were previously associated with responsiveness to these drugs. But, sometime tumors grow despite continued therapy because an additional mutation in the gene, strongly implies that the second mutation was the cause of drug resistance. Biochemical studies have shown that this second mutation, which was the same as before, could confer resistance to the EGFR or VEGF mutants normally sensitive to these drugs. It is especially interesting to note that the mutation is strictly analogous to a mutation that can make it tumor resistant. For example, mutations in a gene called KRAS, which encodes a signaling protein activated by EGFR, are found in 15 to 30 percent of certain cancers. The presence of a mutated KRAS gene in a biopsy sample is associated with primary resistance to drugs. Tumor cells from patients who develop secondary resistance to a drug like Tarceva after an initial response on therapy did not have mutations in KRAS. Rather, these tumor cells had new mutations in EGFR. This further indicates that secondary resistance is very different from primary resistance. All the EGFR/VEGF mutation or amplification studies can tell us is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to this mechanism of attack. They don't tell you if one drug is better or worse than some other drug which may target this. There are differences. The drug has to get inside the cells in order to target anything. EGFR/VEGF-targeted drugs are poorly-predicted by measuring the ostansible targets, but can be well-predicted by measuring the effect of the drug on the \"function\" of live cells.

      "Content": "Platinum-based drugs are effective against cancer because at their centre is a platinum atom joined to two ammonion molecules and two chloride ions. The compound is negatively charged, but when it enters the cancer cell it becomes positively charged because the chloride ions are replaced by water molecules. The water molecules are easily displaced, allowing the platinum-based compound to attach to DNA in the cancer cell: it forms cross-links in the DNA that block the cell's ability to read the code, which is essential for cell function. If enough of the DNA is unreadable, the cell dies. Platinum-based chemotherapy drugs are among the most powerful and widely used against cancer. However, they have toxic side effects, and tumors can become resistant to them. When faced with a platinum drug, some cancer cells are able to establish defenses and develop resistance to the drug. The cells contain sulfur compounds such as glutathione that attack the platinum and destroy it before it can reach and bind to DNA. Massachusetts Institute of Technology",

      "Content": "Although the theory behind targeted therapy is appealing, the reality is more complex. For example, cancer cells often have many mutations in many different pathways, so even if one route is shut down by a targeted treatment, the cancer cell may be able to use other routes. In other words, cancer cells have 'backup systems' that allow them to survive. The result is that the drug does not shrink the tumor as expected. One approach to this problem is to functionally target multiple pathways in a cancer cell. Another challenge is to identify which of the targeted treatments will be effective (enzyme inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies). Targeted therapy is still trial-and-error treatment. The functional profiling platform can explore multiple signaling pathways from the same test. It doesn't have to test for each and every signaling pathways there are. There are many pathways to altered cellular function. Testing for these pathways, those which identify DNA, or RNA sequences or expression of individual genes or proteins often examine only one component of a much larger, interactive process. In testing for all \"known\" mutations, if you miss just one, it may be the one that gets through. And it's not just only targeted drugs that may be effective as first-line treatment on your individual cancer cells. Cancers share pathways across tumor types. There really is no lung cancer chemos, or breast cancer chemos, or ovarian cancer chemos. There are chemos that are sensitive (effective) or there are chemos that are resistant (ineffective) to each and every \"individual\" cancer patient, not populations. There are chemos that share across tumor types. The functional profiling platform has the unique capacity to identify all of the operative mechanisms of response and resistance by gauging the result of drug exposure at its most important level: cell death. Finding what targeted therapies would work for what cancers is very difficult. A lot of trial-and-error goes along trying to find out. However, finding the right targeted therapies for the right \"individual\" cancer cells can be improved by cell-based assays, using functional profiling. Identifying DNA expression of individual proteins (that measure of RNA content, like Her2, EGFR, KRAS or ALK) often examine only one component of a much larger, interactive process. Gene (molecular) profiling measures the expression only in the \"resting\" state, prior to drug exposure. There is no single gene whose expression accurately predicts clinical outcome. Efforts to administer targeted therapies in randomly selected patients often will result in low response rates at significant toxicity and cost. All DNA or RNA-type tests are based on \"population\" research (not individuals). They base their predictions on the fact that a higher percentage of people with similar genetic profiles or specific mutations may tend to respond better to certain drugs. This is not really \"personalized\" medicine, but a refinement of statistical data. Functional profiling measures proteins before and after drug exposure. It measures what happens at the end (the effects on the forest), rather than the status of the individual trees. Molecular profiling is far too limited in scope to encompass the vagaries and complexities of human cancer biology when it comes to drug selection. The endpoints of molecular profiling are gene expression. The endpoints of functional profiling are expression of cell death (both tumor cell death and tumor associated endothelial [capillary] cell death). In testing for all \"known\" mutations, if you miss just one, it may be the one that gets through. And it's not just only targeted drugs that may be effective as first-line treatment on your \"individual\" cancer cells. Cancers share pathways across tumor types. Targeted treatments take advantage of the biologic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells by \"targeting\" faulty genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and development of cancer. Many times these drugs are combined with chemotherapy, biologic therapy (immunotherapy), or other targeted treatments. Clinicians have learned that the same enzymes and pathways are involved in many types of cancer. However, understanding targeted treatments begins with understanding the cancer \"cell.\" In order for cells to grow, divide, or die, they send and receive chemical messages. These messages are transmitted along specific pathways that involve various genes and proteins in the cell. Cancer cells often have many mutations in many different pathways, so even if one route is shut down by a targeted treatment, the cancer cell may be able to use other routes. Targeted therapies are typically not very effective when used singularly or even in combination with conventional chemotherapies. The targets of many of these drugs are so narrow that cancer cells are likely to eventually find ways to bypass them. Physicians may have to combine several targeted treatments to try an achieve cures or durable responses for more complicated tumors like those that occur in the breast, colon and lung. These targeted therapies produce limited results because they can help a relatively small subgroup of cancer patients. But when they work, they produce very good responses. With targeted therapy, the trick is figuring out which patients will respond. Tests to pinpoint those patients cannot be accomplished with genetic testing. All the gene amplification studies, via genetic testing, tell us is whether or not the cancer cells are potentially susceptible to a mechanism/pathway of attack. They don't tell you if one drug is better or worse than another drug which may target a certain mechanism/pathway. Cell-based functional analysis can accomplish this. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not just one target or pathway, or even a few targets/pathways.

      "Content": "Dr. Mario Lacouture from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center Center in New York and his colleagues from the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, have suggested in a new study that painful rashes and other skin-related side effects of newer targeted cancer drugs may jack up treatment costs. The average cost of treating each cancer patient who came into a dermatology clinic with skin, hair and nail complaints was almost $2,000, the researchers reported. That included expenses related to doctors' appointments, dermatology medications and lab tests. And some patients with skin problems may have to delay or alter their treatment regimen if side effects are too severe. According to Dr. Lacouture, dermatologic side effects including skin irritation and dry skin are the two topmost concerns that patients have that they did not expect during therapy. Patients are prepared to get hair loss, they are prepared to get some nausea and diarrhea, but they aren't expecting to get is all these skin issues. Lacouture and his colleagues tracked costs related to skin reactions in 132 patients being treated with targeted cancer-fighting drugs at their dermatology clinic between 2005 and 2008. The majority of those patients had colon or lung cancer and the most common drug treatments included Erbitux (cetuximab) and Tarceva (erlotinib). Patients came in with a range of dermatology-related complaints, including painful acne, lesions and blisters on the hands and feet and nail infections. Those conditions cost anywhere from $21 to almost $11,000 to treat, depending on the patient. The average total cost of medications, clinic visits, treatment procedures and lab tests such as blood work and wound culturing for each patient was $1,920. Dermatology drugs accounted for the greatest chunk of that, costing an average of about $840 per patient, according to findings published in the Archives of Dermatology. Lacouture said that more than half of patients may have skin, hair and nail reactions to newer drugs that treat some of the most fatal types of cancer. That's because along with their cancer-fighting action, the drugs also attack proteins on the skin. If skin reactions are severe, especially with certain cancer drugs including Nexavar (sorafenib) for kidney cancer, doctors may have to adjust dosages or take patients off those drugs for a period of time. While most of the extra costs would be covered by patients' insurance, skin problems also mean more time and transportation for appointments and co-payments. It adds to the out-of-pocket costs for the patient and to the already ballooning cost of cancer. Those costs should be taken into consideration when evaluating new cancer drugs. The most important thing for patients is to be aware of how common these problems are and know that the sooner they are diagnosed and treated for side effects, the less likely it will interfere with cancer treatment and the quality of life.

      "Content": "Palbociclib doubled the average amount of progression-free survival (PFS) time among patients with advanced breast cancer. But in the first detailed glimpse of its impact on overall survival (OS) - a key feature to the future prospects of this flagship program - the therapy has failed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in extending patients' lives after an initial assessment. Palbociclib is on of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer enjoyed a median PFS rate of 20.2 months when taking a combination of palbociclib and the antiestrogen drug Femara (letrozole), compared to 10.2 months for letrozole alone, according to researchers presenting the latest data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)meeting in San Diego. The OS rate, though, was 37.5 months for the combo versus 33.3 months for the solo therapy. That was an improvement, but not a big enough one to qualify as significant enough to meet the secondary endpoint. Investigators were quick to note that there haven't been enough patient deaths in the study to firm up the OS numbers, happy at this stage to point to a trend in the drug's favor. But investors were left feeling somewhat deflated over the shortfall on OS, especially after seeing signs of a dramatic improvement in PFS earlier on. At the interim point, patients taking palbociclib saw a delay in disease progression of 26.1 months, compared to only 7.5 months in the control arm. Financial analysts had expected the PFS rate over the letrozole arm to balance out a bit in the follow-up. And they expect the results are sufficient for a regulatory application soon, which is what investors have been gambling on. Pfizer (the drug's manufacturer), though, hasn't come right out and said whether they're going for an early approval. Palbociclib is a CDK-4/6 inhibitor. And it's not alone. Last December, Novartis pushed its rival program for LEE011 into Phase III, setting up a showdown over a market that could deliver billions in potential revenue. Both therapies target a pair of cyclin dependent kinases that play a role in cancer. Eli Lilly also has a contender in the pipeline, LY2835219. But the pharma giant is well behind the leaders in this race, and Lilly suffers from a reputation for carefully regimented development programs that often lag well behind those of rivals. Lilly's investigators reported at AACR that of the 47 patients with metastatic breast cancer in the study, 9, or 19%, had a partial response while 24, 51%, had stable disease. \"Disease progressed despite treatment in 11 patients,\" according to a release from Lilly. \"All of the nine patients who had a partial response, and 20 of the 24 patients who had stable disease, had HR-positive disease, which meant that the partial response and stable disease rates for patients with HR-positive disease were 25 percent and 55 percent, respectively.\" Schoenebaum takes a positive view on Lilly's come-from-behind position in the race for an approval. \"Overall, these data seem to indicate that (Lilly's) drug is clearly active,\" he wrote. \"Whether it's actually MORE active than Pfizer's palbociclib remains an open question as you must be very careful when comparing across different trials with small patient numbers. As a reminder, Lilly has argued that their drug might work better because it can be dosed continuously (vs palbociclib's 3 weeks on; 1 week off regimen) due to less severe neutropenia. Lilly plans on announcing next steps later in the first half of 2014 - we believe it's possible that a phase 3 could begin by year 2014's end or in early 2015. There is very little, if anything, in Lilly consensus estimates for this drug - so in theory, at least, it represents all upside.\" The view from Pfizer's investigators remained upbeat, despite the setback on OS rates. \"This is an exciting data set that shows a major clinical benefit for patients who have hormone receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer,\" said UCLA Professor Dennis Slamon. \"The potential impact of this study could be huge. We are doing further Phase III work with the drug, but the current data are as exciting as the initial studies we were involved in when testing Herceptin for HER2-positive breast cancers.\" Source: FierceBiotech",

      "Content": "What Georgetown does with \"their\" new breakthrough is to establish a cell line (immortalizes it). They may or may not have a better way of establishing cell lines. Problem is, cells lines don't recapitulate drug response patterns which exist in the body. For drug selection, it is better to directly remove tumor microclusters straight from the body and immediately test them, before they change. What has been done for twenty years in some \"private\" cell-based assay labs is cells are taken fresh \"live\" in their three dimensional, floating clusters, cultured in conical polypropylene microwells for 96 hours to increase the proportion of tumor cells, relative to normal cells. Polypropylene is a slippery material which prevents the attachment of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and encourages the tumor cells to remain in the form of three dimensional (3D), floating clusters. Our body is 3D, not 2D in form, undoubtedly, making this novel step better replicate that of the human body. When allowed to grow in vitro, \"living\" cancer cells develop into these tiny microspheroid clusters that form a complex biosystem in which each malignant cell reacts upon its fellow colonists in subtle but important ways. Analysis of microspheroids (microclusters) with cell-death assays, provides a snapshot of cancer's behavior within the human body and provides a more accurate representation of how cancer cells are likely to respond to treatment in the clinic. There is no manipulation of isolated cancer cells to make them grow, which was an important point of distinction with earlier cell-growth assays. It's been done for years this way (at least in the US). It's just that the cancer establishment needs to get on board.",

      "Content": "Patients with recurrent breast cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists. Chemosensitivity testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. Chemosensitivity testing is an attempt to do something similar for cancer; fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body. Assay-testing is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. Assay-testing for apoptosis will determine whether a drug kills the tumor. Chemosensitivity testing (assay-testing) can take the guesswork out of cancer treatment. Patients with refractory cancer and have very limited time left to live, six months can feel like an eternity when they may have to start a whole new course of treatment if the original treatment proves ineffective. One approach to individualizing patient therapy is chemosensitivity testing. Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. Often, results are obtained before the patient begins treatment. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens. All available chemosensitivity assays are able to report drug \"resistance\" information. Resistance implies that when a patient's cancer cells are exposed to a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, the cancer cells will continue to live and grow. Some chemosensitivity assays also are able to report drug \"sensitivity\" information. Sensitivity implies that when a patient's cancer cells are treated with a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, that agent will kill the cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation. The goal of all chemosensitivity tests is to determine the response of a patient's cancer cells to proposed chemotherapy agents. Knowing which chemotherapy agents the patient's cancer cells are resistant to is important. Then, these options can be eliminated, thereby avoiding the toxicity of ineffective agents. In addition, some chemosensitivity assays predict tumor cell sensitivity, or which agent would be most effective. Choosing the most effective agent can help patients to avoid the physical, emotional, and financial costs of failed therapy and experience an increased quality of life. Fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. Chemosensitivity testing does have predictive value, especially in predicting what \"won't\" work. Patients who have been through several chemotherapy regimens and are running out of options might want to consider chemosensitivity testing. It might help you find the best option or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Today, chemosensitivity testing has progressed to the point where it is 85% - 90% effective. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. Chemosensitivity testing might help you find the best option, or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Another situation where chemosensitivity testing might make particularly good sense is in rare cancers where there may not be enough experience or previous ideas of which drugs might be most effective. Finally, there has been a veritable deluge of new approvals of cytotoxic drugs in recent years as the tortuous FDA process has been speeded and liberalized. In many cases a new drug has been approved on the basis of a single very very narrow indication. But these drugs may have many useful applications - and it's going to take years to find out. Chemosensitivity testing offers a way of seeing if any of these new drugs might apply to your specific cancer. There have been over 40 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature showing correlations between cell-death assay test results and the results of clinical chemotherapy in more than 2,000 patients. In every single study, patients treated with drugs active in the assays had a higher response rate than the entire group of patients as a whole. In every single study, patients treated with drugs inactive in the assays had lower response rates than the entire group of patients. In every single study, patients treated with active drugs were much more likely to respond than patients treated with inactive drugs, with assay-active drugs being 7 to 9 times more likely to work than assay-inactive drugs. A large number of peer-review publications also reported that patients treated with assay-tested \"active\" drugs enjoyed significantly longer survival of cancer than patients with assay-tested \"negative\" drugs. How May a Patient Arrange to Have Their Tumor or Leukemia Tested? Both fluid and solid tumor (200mg or 10mm in size) specimens may be sent out via Federal Express or another overnight courier service for testing at one of more than a dozen labs around the country. Note that the choice of a lab is not a geographical consideration, but a technical consideration. All of the labs that are listed are experienced and capable of providing very useful information. However, the labs vary considerably with regard to technologies, approach to testing, what they try to achieve with the testing, and cost. These private laboratories have been offering these assays as a non-investigational, paid service to cancer patients, the average cost being about $2,000, in a situation where 20 different drugs and combinations are tested, at two drug concentrations in three different assay systems. By investing a little time on the phone speaking with the lab directors, you should have enough knowledge to present the concept to the patient's own physician. At that point, the best thing is to ask the physician, as a courtesy to the patient, to speak on the phone with the director of the laboratory in which you are interested, so that everyone (patient, physician, and laboratory director) understand what is being considered, what is the rationale, and what are the data which support what is being considered. Here is an extensive listing for some of the reputable laboratories providing cell culture testing. These labs will provide you and your physician with in depth information and research on the testing they provide: The first laboratory provides a \"cell growth\" assay. The assay is excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance). The assay is not as good at identifying drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity) or to identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs. Used for drug de-selection and not for drug selection. Exiqon (formally Oncotech, Inc.) http://www.exiqon.com/dx All the below laboratories provide a \"cell death\" assay. At one time, the goal of cancer treatment was to inhibit unregulated cell \"growth.\" In the last twenty years, the goal is to induce cell \"death\" in order to successfully conquer concer. The much older \"cell-growth\" assays measure a drug's ability to inhibit cell \"growth\" and only succeeds in eliminating drugs that would \"not\" work for a patient (drug resistance). The more modern \"cell-death\" assays measure the ability of chemotherapy drugs to induce cell \"death\" (apoptosis) in a tumor biopsy from a patient (drug sensitivity). The assays are excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work. Anticancer, Inc., San Diego, CA. http://www.anticancer.com/ Cancer Therapeutics, Inc., Thomasville, GA. http://www.cancer-therapeutics.com/ DiaTech Oncology, Brentwood, TN. http://diatech-oncology.com/ Genomic Health, Inc. Redwood City, CA. http://www.genomichealth.com/OncotypeDX/Index.aspx Genoptix, Inc., San Diego, CA http://www.genoptix.com/ Precision Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, PA. http://www.precisiontherapeutics.com/ The two laboratories below, in addition to providing a \"cell death\" assay, provide a functional profiling assay which is the only testing that involves direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint. This allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record, which improves quality, serves as control, and assesses dose response in vitro (includes newly-emergent drug combinations). These two assay labs have about the most extensive information about the technology with knowledge spanning decades, utilize functional tumor cell profiling. Besides identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance) and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity), these assays can identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs.

      "Content": "Patients with recurrent breast cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists. Chemosensitivity testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. Chemosensitivity testing is an attempt to do something similar for cancer; fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body. Assay-testing is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. Assay-testing for apoptosis will determine whether a drug kills the tumor. Chemosensitivity testing (assay-testing) can take the guesswork out of cancer treatment. Patients with refractory cancer and have very limited time left to live, six months can feel like an eternity when they may have to start a whole new course of treatment if the original treatment proves ineffective. One approach to individualizing patient therapy is chemosensitivity testing. Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. Often, results are obtained before the patient begins treatment. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens. All available chemosensitivity assays are able to report drug \"resistance\" information. Resistance implies that when a patient's cancer cells are exposed to a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, the cancer cells will continue to live and grow. Some chemosensitivity assays also are able to report drug \"sensitivity\" information. Sensitivity implies that when a patient's cancer cells are treated with a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, that agent will kill the cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation. The goal of all chemosensitivity tests is to determine the response of a patient's cancer cells to proposed chemotherapy agents. Knowing which chemotherapy agents the patient's cancer cells are resistant to is important. Then, these options can be eliminated, thereby avoiding the toxicity of ineffective agents.

      "Content": "This testing (cell-death endpoints) was available since the early 90's. In fact, a Dr. William Grace, a practicing oncologist and director of cancer research and chief of medical oncology at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center (New York City) has been utilizing assay-testing since 1995. He believes it is unethical not to use chemosensitivity testing in his practice. It is a real credit to oncologists who utilize assay-testing in their management of their cancer patients, despite the fact that their use constrained their freedom to choose and doubtlessly reduced their incomes. Because of recent re-awareness of this testing, even Yale School of Medicine is studying a technology called the Yale apoptosis assay in combination with another technology called the ChemoFX assay, which could double the response rate to existing drugs.

      "Content": "Some researchers believe the reason for better survival for patients who could undergo complete resection without any tumor left behind is that these tumors are biologically less aggressive and would do better regardless of the type of treatment they receive, and that the removal of lymph nodes at the time of surgery may additionally contribute to a better outcome. Surgery is an integral part of the multimodality treatment of many cancers. The line of reasoning frequently used to explain the value of surgery included five points. First, surgery is thought to remove resistant clones of tumor cells and thus decrease the likelihood of the early onset of drug resistance. Second, the removal of large masses likely to be associated with poorly vascularized areas of tumor improves the probability of delivering adequate drug doses to the remaining cancer cells. Third, the higher growth fraction in better vascularized small masses enhanced the effect of chemotherapy. Fourth, smaller masses required fewer cycles of chemotherapy and thus decreased the likelihood of drug resistance. Fifth, removal of bulky disease enhances the immune system. Patients who present with a large mass are suffering because of that mass and they need that tumor out to relieve symptoms and to save life due to symptoms. It's important to deal with the bulk. Sources: Mayo Clinic American Board of Surgeons Society of Surgical Oncology Surgery is the \"gold standard\" against which other treatments are measured. There is no better way to eliminate a cancer than total removal.",

Abstract Context Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival. Objective To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected. Interventions All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point. Results Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.

      "Content": "Patients with recurrent breast cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists. Chemosensitivity testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. Chemosensitivity testing is an attempt to do something similar for cancer; fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body. Assay-testing is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. Assay-testing for apoptosis will determine whether a drug kills the tumor. Chemosensitivity testing (assay-testing) can take the guesswork out of cancer treatment. Patients with refractory cancer and have very limited time left to live, six months can feel like an eternity when they may have to start a whole new course of treatment if the original treatment proves ineffective. One approach to individualizing patient therapy is chemosensitivity testing. Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. Often, results are obtained before the patient begins treatment. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens. All available chemosensitivity assays are able to report drug \"resistance\" information. Resistance implies that when a patient's cancer cells are exposed to a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, the cancer cells will continue to live and grow. Some chemosensitivity assays also are able to report drug \"sensitivity\" information. Sensitivity implies that when a patient's cancer cells are treated with a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, that agent will kill the cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation. The goal of all chemosensitivity tests is to determine the response of a patient's cancer cells to proposed chemotherapy agents. Knowing which chemotherapy agents the patient's cancer cells are resistant to is important. Then, these options can be eliminated, thereby avoiding the toxicity of ineffective agents. In addition, some chemosensitivity assays predict tumor cell sensitivity, or which agent would be most effective. Choosing the most effective agent can help patients to avoid the physical, emotional, and financial costs of failed therapy and experience an increased quality of life. Fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. Chemosensitivity testing does have predictive value, especially in predicting what \"won't\" work. Patients who have been through several chemotherapy regimens and are running out of options might want to consider chemosensitivity testing. It might help you find the best option or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Today, chemosensitivity testing has progressed to the point where it is 85% - 90% effective. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. Chemosensitivity testing might help you find the best option, or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Another situation where chemosensitivity testing might make particularly good sense is in rare cancers where there may not be enough experience or previous ideas of which drugs might be most effective. Finally, there has been a veritable deluge of new approvals of cytotoxic drugs in recent years as the tortuous FDA process has been speeded and liberalized. In many cases a new drug has been approved on the basis of a single very very narrow indication. But these drugs may have many useful applications - and it's going to take years to find out. Chemosensitivity testing offers a way of seeing if any of these new drugs might apply to your specific cancer. There have been over 40 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature showing correlations between cell-death assay test results and the results of clinical chemotherapy in more than 2,000 patients. In every single study, patients treated with drugs active in the assays had a higher response rate than the entire group of patients as a whole. In every single study, patients treated with drugs inactive in the assays had lower response rates than the entire group of patients. In every single study, patients treated with active drugs were much more likely to respond than patients treated with inactive drugs, with assay-active drugs being 7 to 9 times more likely to work than assay-inactive drugs. A large number of peer-review publications also reported that patients treated with assay-tested \"active\" drugs enjoyed significantly longer survival of cancer than patients with assay-tested \"negative\" drugs. How May a Patient Arrange to Have Their Tumor or Leukemia Tested? Both fluid and solid tumor (200mg or 10mm in size) specimens may be sent out via Federal Express or another overnight courier service for testing at one of more than a dozen labs around the country. Note that the choice of a lab is not a geographical consideration, but a technical consideration. All of the labs that are listed are experienced and capable of providing very useful information. However, the labs vary considerably with regard to technologies, approach to testing, what they try to achieve with the testing, and cost. These private laboratories have been offering these assays as a non-investigational, paid service to cancer patients, the average cost being about $2,000, in a situation where 20 different drugs and combinations are tested, at two drug concentrations in three different assay systems. By investing a little time on the phone speaking with the lab directors, you should have enough knowledge to present the concept to the patient's own physician. At that point, the best thing is to ask the physician, as a courtesy to the patient, to speak on the phone with the director of the laboratory in which you are interested, so that everyone (patient, physician, and laboratory director) understand what is being considered, what is the rationale, and what are the data which support what is being considered. Here is an extensive listing for some of the reputable laboratories providing cell culture testing. These labs will provide you and your physician with in depth information and research on the testing they provide: The first laboratory provides a \"cell growth\" assay. The assay is excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance). The assay is not as good at identifying drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity) or to identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs. Used for drug de-selection and not for drug selection. Exiqon (formally Oncotech, Inc.) http://www.exiqon.com/dx All the below laboratories provide a \"cell death\" assay. At one time, the goal of cancer treatment was to inhibit unregulated cell \"growth.\" In the last twenty years, the goal is to induce cell \"death\" in order to successfully conquer concer. The much older \"cell-growth\" assays measure a drug's ability to inhibit cell \"growth\" and only succeeds in eliminating drugs that would \"not\" work for a patient (drug resistance). The more modern \"cell-death\" assays measure the ability of chemotherapy drugs to induce cell \"death\" (apoptosis) in a tumor biopsy from a patient (drug sensitivity). The assays are excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work. Anticancer, Inc., San Diego, CA. http://www.anticancer.com/ Cancer Therapeutics, Inc., Thomasville, GA. http://www.cancer-therapeutics.com/ DiaTech Oncology, Brentwood, TN. http://diatech-oncology.com/ Genomic Health, Inc. Redwood City, CA. http://www.genomichealth.com/OncotypeDX/Index.aspx Genoptix, Inc., San Diego, CA http://www.genoptix.com/ Precision Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, PA. http://www.precisiontherapeutics.com/ The two laboratories below, in addition to providing a \"cell death\" assay, provide a functional profiling assay which is the only testing that involves direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint. This allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record, which improves quality, serves as control, and assesses dose response in vitro (includes newly-emergent drug combinations). These two assay labs have about the most extensive information about the technology with knowledge spanning decades, utilize functional tumor cell profiling. Besides identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance) and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity), these assays can identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs.

      "Content": "The best information is that it is known as the Human Tumor Assay Journal, which links to \"15\" websites for laboratories providing this testing. The Journal is a publication of Larry Weisenthal, M.D., Ph.D., who is owner of Weisenthal Cancer Group. I've been an advocate for a number of cancer subjects over the last five years. HBO Therapy for radiation-induced necrosis, abolition of the Chemotherapy Drug Concession as well as encouraging the technology of Individualized Therapy. A group of leading chemotherapy experts have been working to promote research and clinical application of cancer therapies tailored for each individual patient. Their approach is in stark contrast to standard or empiric therapy, in which chemotherapy for a specific patient is based on results from prior clinical studies. They advocate use of scientifically-proven class of chemosensitivity and resistance assays (CSRAs) that measure drug-induced cancer cell-death (apoptosis). I believe that patients should be afforded access to such technology as an alternative to the off-the-shelf \"best guess\" therapy typically administered. The Chemotherapy Drug Concession was a shameless way to preserve a system which presented an impossible conflict of interest for both cancer centers and treating oncologists. It was a system in which there was a financial incentive to choose certain forms of chemotherapy over certain others and to administer \"infusion\" chemotherapy as opposed to providing other forms of patient care. Not the least of the problems is that this inherently corrupt system provided a strong disincentive to \"individualize\" or tailor therapy, based on laboratory testing, because such individualized treatment removes the oncologist's \"freedom to choose\" from between a large number of different possible drug regimens, with wildly differing profit margins. What was needed to be done was to remove the profit incentive from the choice of cancer treatments. Patients should receive what is best for them and not what is best for their oncologists. The new Medicare Reimbursement bill has started oncology onto that road. If more people researched how and why their loved-one died after being treated by orthodox cancer therapies, then I believe there would be a movement to have more effective and less toxic treatments available, which oral-dose \"targeted\" chemotherapy has been doing. Oral chemotherapy does not need to be injected into the body. It can be taken at home. Many oral chemotherapies can be more effective than infusional chemotherapy. Many forms of oral chemotherapy cause fewer side effects than I.V. therapy. New \"targeted,\" relatively non-toxic oral chemotherapy is based on a variety of biological mechanisms that essentially stop cancer from spreading. These therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer. They interefere with specific molecules involved in the process by which normal cells become cancer cells, and tumor growth. They are a new feature of quality cancer care and will replace, enhance or even make more effective therapies that are largely based on intravenous administration (infusion therapy). Compared to infusional therapy, oral chemotherapy can make receiving cancer treatment more convenient for patients by allowing flexibility in taking medication without disrupting work or other activities. They can often result in less time spent in office-based oncology practices because of the absence of intravenous administration and its related side-effects. You are already taking drugs to kill cancer cells, why do you need to take drugs to reduce or eliminate the side effects of those drugs? Targeted cancer therapies will give oncologists a better way to tailor cancer treatment. Treatments may be individualized based on the unique set of molecular targets produced by the patient's tumor, and these treatment advances will require \"individualizing\" treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. Chemosensitivity testing can improve patient survival in chemotherapy for cancer.",

      "Content": "The genomic profile is so complicated, with one thing affecting another, that it isn't sufficient and not currently useful in selecting drugs. Because metabolic changes are complex and hard to predict, metabolic profiling will be essential for selecting best treatment. In drug selection, molecular (genomic) testing examines a single process within the cell or a relatively small number of processes. The aim is to tell if there is a theoretical predisposition to drug response. It attempts to link surrogate gene expression to a theoretical potential for drug activity. It relies upon a handful of gene patterns which are thought to imply a potential for drug susceptibility. In other words, molecular testing tells us whether or not the cancer cells are potentially susceptible to a mechanism/pathway of attack. It doesn't tell you if one targeted drug (or combination of targeted drugs) is better or worse than another targeted drug (or combination) which may target a certain or a small number of mechanisms/pathways. Functional profile testing doesn't dismiss DNA testing, it uses all the information, both genomic and functional, to design the best targeted treatment for each individual, not populations. It tests for a lot more than just a few mutations. Functional profiling consists of a combination of a (cell morphology) morphologic endpoint and one or more (cell metabolism) metabolic endpoints. It studies cells in small clusters or micro-spheroids (micro-clusters). The combination of measuring morphologic and metabolic effects at the whole cell level. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. One needs to analyze the systems' response to targeted drug treatments, not just a few targets (pathways). Source: Cell Function Analysis",

      "Content": "What Georgetown does with \"their\" new breakthrough is to establish a cell line (immortalizes it). They may or may not have a better way of establishing cell lines. Problem is, cells lines don't recapitulate drug response patterns which exist in the body. For drug selection, it is better to directly remove tumor microclusters straight from the body and immediately test them, before they change. A cell line is a product of immortal cells that are used for biological research. Cell lines can perpetuate division indefinitely. Regular cells can only divide approximately 50 times. Cell lines are useful for experimentation in labs as they are always available to researchers as a product and do not require harvesting (acquiring of tissue from a host) every time cells are needed in the lab. They can clone cells from a cell line (HeLa cells). NCI had a huge lab working on microarrays to look for patterns of mRNA and protein expression which are predictive of chemotherapy response. They spent 2 years trying to find patterns which correlated using the NCI's various established ovarian cell lines. They thought they had something, but when they started to apply them to fresh tumor specimens, none of the results in the cell lines was applicable to the fresh tumors. Everything they'd worked out in the cell lines was not worth anything and they had to start over from square one. This may be something similar to what researchers at Johns Hopkins and Washington University at St. Louis had found out. Our body is 3D (three-dimensional), not 2D (two-dimensional) in form. They, and other researchers, have pointed to the limitations of 2D \"cell-line\" study and chemotherapy to more correctly reflect the human body. Traditionally, in-vitro (in lab) cell lines have been studied in 2D, which had inherent limitations in applicability to real life 3D in-vivo (in body) states. This should really help out research in looking for and developing new therapeutics. But when it comes to actually using those therapeutics, you need fresh \"live\" cells, not passaged cell lines. Just as a cancer genome refers to the complete set of genes, the metabolome refers to the complete set of metabolites in a given tumor. You may need to have the metabolome as well as the genome. There are many reasons why cancer cures remain out of reach, but several changes could be implemented immediately to increase our rate of success. One of them is the need to redouble our efforts in the study of basic metabolism and the growing field of metabolomics (the metabolome). Metabolomics is a newly emerging field of \"omics\" research concerned with the comprehensive characterization of the small molecule metabolites in biological systems. It can provide an overview of the metabolic status and global biochemical events associated with a cellular or biological system. An increasing focus in metabolomics research is now evident in academia, industry and government, with more than 500 papers a year being published on this subject. Indeed, metabolomics is now part of the vision of the NIH road map initiative (E. Zerhouni (2003) Science 302, 63-64&72). Many other government bodies are also supporting metabolomics activities internationally. Studying the metabolome (along with other \"omes\") will highlight changes in networks and pathways and provide insights into physiological and pathological states. The concept of Systems Biology and the prospect of integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data is exciting and the integration of these fields continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Developments in informatics, flux analysis and biochemical modeling are adding new dimensions to the field of metabolomics. To be able to walk from genetic or environmental perturbations to a phenotype to a specific biochemical event is exciting. Metabolomics has the promise to enable detection of disease states and their progression, monitor response to therapy, stratify patients based on biochemical profiles, and highlight targets for drug design. The metabolomics field builds on a wealth of biochemical information that was established over many years. The Metabolomics Society",

Because of recent re-awareness of this testing, even Yale School of Medicine is studying a technology called the Yale apoptosis assay in combination with another technology called the ChemoFX assay, which could double the response rate to existing drugs.

      "Content": "Patients with recurrent breast cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists. Chemosensitivity testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. Chemosensitivity testing is an attempt to do something similar for cancer; fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body. Assay-testing is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. Assay-testing for apoptosis will determine whether a drug kills the tumor. Chemosensitivity testing (assay-testing) can take the guesswork out of cancer treatment. Patients with refractory cancer and have very limited time left to live, six months can feel like an eternity when they may have to start a whole new course of treatment if the original treatment proves ineffective. One approach to individualizing patient therapy is chemosensitivity testing. Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. Often, results are obtained before the patient begins treatment. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens. All available chemosensitivity assays are able to report drug \"resistance\" information. Resistance implies that when a patient's cancer cells are exposed to a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, the cancer cells will continue to live and grow. Some chemosensitivity assays also are able to report drug \"sensitivity\" information. Sensitivity implies that when a patient's cancer cells are treated with a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, that agent will kill the cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation. The goal of all chemosensitivity tests is to determine the response of a patient's cancer cells to proposed chemotherapy agents. Knowing which chemotherapy agents the patient's cancer cells are resistant to is important. Then, these options can be eliminated, thereby avoiding the toxicity of ineffective agents. In addition, some chemosensitivity assays predict tumor cell sensitivity, or which agent would be most effective. Choosing the most effective agent can help patients to avoid the physical, emotional, and financial costs of failed therapy and experience an increased quality of life. Fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. Chemosensitivity testing does have predictive value, especially in predicting what \"won't\" work. Patients who have been through several chemotherapy regimens and are running out of options might want to consider chemosensitivity testing. It might help you find the best option or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Today, chemosensitivity testing has progressed to the point where it is 85% - 90% effective. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. Chemosensitivity testing might help you find the best option, or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Another situation where chemosensitivity testing might make particularly good sense is in rare cancers where there may not be enough experience or previous ideas of which drugs might be most effective. Finally, there has been a veritable deluge of new approvals of cytotoxic drugs in recent years as the tortuous FDA process has been speeded and liberalized. In many cases a new drug has been approved on the basis of a single very very narrow indication. But these drugs may have many useful applications - and it's going to take years to find out. Chemosensitivity testing offers a way of seeing if any of these new drugs might apply to your specific cancer. There have been over 40 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature showing correlations between cell-death assay test results and the results of clinical chemotherapy in more than 2,000 patients. In every single study, patients treated with drugs active in the assays had a higher response rate than the entire group of patients as a whole. In every single study, patients treated with drugs inactive in the assays had lower response rates than the entire group of patients. In every single study, patients treated with active drugs were much more likely to respond than patients treated with inactive drugs, with assay-active drugs being 7 to 9 times more likely to work than assay-inactive drugs. A large number of peer-review publications also reported that patients treated with assay-tested \"active\" drugs enjoyed significantly longer survival of cancer than patients with assay-tested \"negative\" drugs. How May a Patient Arrange to Have Their Tumor or Leukemia Tested? Both fluid and solid tumor (200mg or 10mm in size) specimens may be sent out via Federal Express or another overnight courier service for testing at one of more than a dozen labs around the country. Note that the choice of a lab is not a geographical consideration, but a technical consideration. All of the labs that are listed are experienced and capable of providing very useful information. However, the labs vary considerably with regard to technologies, approach to testing, what they try to achieve with the testing, and cost. These private laboratories have been offering these assays as a non-investigational, paid service to cancer patients, the average cost being about $2,000, in a situation where 20 different drugs and combinations are tested, at two drug concentrations in three different assay systems. By investing a little time on the phone speaking with the lab directors, you should have enough knowledge to present the concept to the patient's own physician. At that point, the best thing is to ask the physician, as a courtesy to the patient, to speak on the phone with the director of the laboratory in which you are interested, so that everyone (patient, physician, and laboratory director) understand what is being considered, what is the rationale, and what are the data which support what is being considered. Here is an extensive listing for some of the reputable laboratories providing cell culture testing. These labs will provide you and your physician with in depth information and research on the testing they provide: The first laboratory provides a \"cell growth\" assay. The assay is excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance). The assay is not as good at identifying drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity) or to identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs. Used for drug de-selection and not for drug selection. Exiqon (formally Oncotech, Inc.) http://www.exiqon.com/dx All the below laboratories provide a \"cell death\" assay. At one time, the goal of cancer treatment was to inhibit unregulated cell \"growth.\" In the last twenty years, the goal is to induce cell \"death\" in order to successfully conquer concer. The much older \"cell-growth\" assays measure a drug's ability to inhibit cell \"growth\" and only succeeds in eliminating drugs that would \"not\" work for a patient (drug resistance). The more modern \"cell-death\" assays measure the ability of chemotherapy drugs to induce cell \"death\" (apoptosis) in a tumor biopsy from a patient (drug sensitivity). The assays are excellent at identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work. Anticancer, Inc., San Diego, CA. http://www.anticancer.com/ Cancer Therapeutics, Inc., Thomasville, GA. http://www.cancer-therapeutics.com/ DiaTech Oncology, Brentwood, TN. http://diatech-oncology.com/ Genomic Health, Inc. Redwood City, CA. http://www.genomichealth.com/OncotypeDX/Index.aspx Genoptix, Inc., San Diego, CA http://www.genoptix.com/ Precision Therapeutics, Pittsburgh, PA. http://www.precisiontherapeutics.com/ The two laboratories below, in addition to providing a \"cell death\" assay, provide a functional profiling assay which is the only testing that involves direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint. This allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record, which improves quality, serves as control, and assesses dose response in vitro (includes newly-emergent drug combinations). These two assay labs have about the most extensive information about the technology with knowledge spanning decades, utilize functional tumor cell profiling. Besides identifying drugs most likely \"not\" to work (drug resistance) and identify drugs which are \"more likely\" to work (drug sensitivity), these assays can identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs.

      "Content": "One way to tackle a tumor is to take aim at the metabolic reactions that fuel their growth. But a report in the February Cell Metabolism, a Cell Press Publication, shows that one metabolism-targeted cancer therapy will not fit all. That means that metabolic profiling will be essential for defining each cancer and choosing the best treatment accordingly, the researchers say. The evidence comes from studies in mice showing that tumors' metabolic profiles vary based on the genes underlying a particular cancer and on the tissue of origin. \"Cancer research is dominated now by genomics and the hope that genetic fingerprints will allow us to guide therapy,\" said J. Michael Bishop of the University of California, San Francisco. \"The issue is whether that is sufficient. We argue that it isn't because metabolic changes are complex and hard to predict. You may need to have the metabolome as well as the genome.\" Just as a cancer genome refers to the complete set of genes, the metabolome refers to the complete set of metabolites in a given tumor. The altered metabolism of tumors has been considered a target for anticancer therapy. For instance, tumors and cancer cell lines consume more glucose than normal cells do, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. There has often been the impression that such changes in metabolism are characteristic of cancers in general, but cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The team led by Bishop and Mariia Yuneva wondered how metabolism might vary with the underlying genetic causes of cancer. They found in mice that liver cancers driven by different cancer-causing genes (Myc versus Met) show differences in the metabolism of two major nutrients: glucose and glutamine. What's more, the metabolism of Myc-induced lung tumors is different from Myc-induced liver tumors. \"Our work shows that different tumors can have very different metabolisms,\" Yuneva said. \"You can't generalize.\" Bishop and Yuneva say their findings also highlight glutamine metabolism as a potential new target for therapy in some tumors, noting that the focus has been primarily on glucose metabolism. Interestingly, the data shows that a version of a glutaminase enzyme normally found in kidney cells turns up in cancerous liver cells. That means there might be a way to attack the metabolism of the cancer without damaging normal liver tissue. \"We shouldn't lose sight of the rather immediate therapeutic potential,\" Bishop said. The researchers will continue to inventory metabolic variation in mouse models. Ultimately, they say it will be important to catalogue the metabolic variation in the much more complex, human setting.

      "Content": "Researchers say they may have made a science research breakthrough in the fight against cancer by discovering how to keep tumor cells alive in the lab. Up until recently, scientists haven\u0092t been able to keep cells alive in a way where they look and act like they would in the body. Doctors previously had to freeze or set in wax biopsied tissue to make a diagnosis. Georgetown University\u0092s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center in Washington, D.C. was behind the discovery. Funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense fellowship funding and an internal grant from Georgetown's Lombardi Cancer Center Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute, researchers have filed two patent applications for the new technology. Doctors hope that this advance might allow them to test numerous cancer-killing drugs on a patient\u0092s own tumor cells in the lab before choosing a therapy that will work well. According to Richard Schlegel, who serves as chairman of the Department of Pathology at Georgetown, the ability to grow true cancer cells could change the way basic science works, too. Cancer cells often accumulate genetic changes in labs, and they no longer resemble the original tumor. The pioneering new method borrows from a simple method used by stem cell researchers, according to the American Journal of Pathology. The technique combines fibroblast feeder cells and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, which keep the cells alive and allow them to reproduce, respectively. Digital Journal reports that when both products were used to treat the cancer cells, they and the normal cells reverted to a \u0093stem-like state,\u0094 according to Schlegel. This made it possible for researchers to compare both types of living cells, which wasn't an option before the science research breakthrough. Needless to say, this discovery could have wonderful consequences for patients being treated for cancer. The personalized lab work that will take place before treatment could mean a better chance at being cured.

Nagourney, MD, PhD, responds to news from Georgetown University about the use of cancer cell testing in a laboratory environment. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fhpa...eature=related",

      "Content": "Patients with recurrent cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. Apoptosis assay (assay-testing) is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. This kind of testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics.",

      "Content": "Dr. Robert Nagourney Medical and Laboratory Director Rational Therapeutics, Inc. Long Beach, California In many ways the era of targeted therapy began with the recognition that breast cancers expressed estrogen receptors, the original work identified the presence of estrogen receptors by radioimmunoassay. Tumors positive for ER tended to be less aggressive and appear to favor bone sites when they metastasized. Subsequently, drugs capable of blocking the effects of estrogen at the estrogen receptor were developed. Tamoxifen competes with estrogen at the level of the receptor. This drug became a mainstay with ER positive tumors and continues to be used today, decades after it was first synthesized. Recognizing that some patients develop resistance to Tamoxifen, additional classes of drugs were developed that reduced the circulating levels of estrogen by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase, this enzyme found in adipose tissue, converts steroid precursors to estrogen. Despite the benefits of these classes of drugs known as SERMS (selective receptor modulators), many patients break through hormonal therapies and require cytotoxic chemotherapy. With the identification of HER-2 amplification, a new subclass of breast cancers driven by a mutation in the growth factor family provided yet a new avenue of therapy \u2013 trastuzumab (Herceptin). For HER-2 positive breast cancers Herceptin has dramatically changed the landscape. Providing synergy with chemotherapy this monoclonal antibody has also been applied in the adjuvant setting offering survival advantage in those patients with the targeted mutation. Reports from the San Antonio breast symposium held in Texas last December, provide two new findings. The first is a clinical trial testing the efficacy of pertuzumab. This novel monoclonal antibody functions by preventing dimerization of HER-2 (The target of Herceptin) with the other members of the human epidermal growth factor family HER-1, HER-3 and HER-4. In so doing, the cross talk between receptors is abrogated and downstream signaling in squelched. The second important finding regards the use of everolimus. This small molecule derivative of rapamycin blocks cellular signaling through the mTOR pathway. Combining everolimus with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane, improved time to progression. While these two classes of drugs are different, the most interesting aspect of both reports reflects the downstream pathways that they target. Pertuzumab inhibits signaling at the PI3K pathway, upstream from mTOR. Everolimus blocks mTOR itself, thus both drugs are influencing cell signaling that channel through metabolic pathways PI3K is the membrane signal from insulin, while mTOR is an intermediate in the same pathway. Thus, these are in truest sense of the word, breakthroughs in metabolomics. Much like genomics aims to unravel the structure of the genome, metabolomics focuses on understanding the many small molecule metabolites that result from a cell\u2019s metabolic processes. There are an estimated 5,000 - 20,000 endogenous human metabolites, and analysing their production gives an accurate picture of the physiology of a cell at a given moment in time. Whereas the cell\u2019s genotype can predict its physiology to a limited extent, metabolomics also takes phenotype \u2013 and therefore environmental conditions \u2013 into account, allowing a more precise measure of actual cell physiology. For research, the study of metabolomics provides the means to measure the effects of a variety of stimuli on individual cells, tissues, and bodily fluids. By studying how their metabolic profiles change with the introduction of chemicals or the expression of known genes, for example, researchers can more effectively study the immediate impact of disease, nutrition, pharmaceutical treatment, and genetic modifications while using a systems biology approach.",

The finding helped to explain the fact that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival (Oncol News Int'l, Vol 14, #5, May '05). Two years before this, Dr. Christos Kosmas, published a study \"Carcinomatous Meningits: Taxane-Induced\" which found what is called \"dissemination after taxane-based (taxol) chemotherapy. the study concluded that Carcinomatous Meningitis (a CNS metastasis) after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased when compared retrospectivley to non-taxane-treated patients (American Journal Clinical Oncology 2002;63:6-15).
