    "Content": "I have a 60yo female friend who is in remission with stage iv breast cancer and is having an affair with a man who is in a serious relationship with another woman. She is trying to convince me and herself that she knows nothing will come out of this and yet she is excited when he texts her and sees her. He cheated on his wife when she was ill and now is cheating on a woman that he says he is serious with. I'm not sure how to deal with this when she does not stop talking about him. She says it's not her problem if the other woman doesn't question him seeing other women?? She says no one understands what it's like to be diagnosed with cancer and she is going to live her life, seeing someone that wants to see her and having sex with him at least twice a week. I've tried mentioning morals and ethics but I am not in her shoes. I think he's a scum bag but she is so delighted with this attention. Should I just let her carry on and if he does leave her just be there to comfort her? Any information or suggestions would be appreciated.",
