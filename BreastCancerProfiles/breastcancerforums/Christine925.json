    "Content": "Hi Jen, Sorry to hear that. For choosing a wigs, I suggest you to buy full lace wigs or front lace wigs if she need to wear long time/ whole day, it's expensive but comfortable than synthetic wigs and it looks real. There is many different kind of hair style, straight, curls, long, short, depends what she likes. Maybe buy two to change in different outlook? Christine We are always here for you - Canbrillo",
