      "Content": "Hi all I have a question that I hope someone can help me out with. My wife had surgery 3 month ago. A lumpectomy and level 3 lymph node removal. 12 of 12 nodes were positive. She is a stage IIIC and the margins are not clear. She is presenty going through chemo and will still need a mastectomy followed by radiation. She is doing quite well so far except for one problem. Since her surgery she has been unable to void on her own. She has to catherize herself every 3 hours. We have been to a urologist where they ran some test and couldn't find anything wrong. They told us it could take up to six months before bladder returns to normal. We think someone screwed up during surgery and they aren't telling us the truth since the urologist is at the same hospital that the surgery was. Has anyone else out there had this problem and if they did how long before bladder returns to normal.",
