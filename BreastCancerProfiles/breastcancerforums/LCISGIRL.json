      "Content": "I was diagnosed with extensive LCIS and microinvasion 6 years ago. I had bilateral mastectomy, no further treatment. I have since developed severe sarcoidosis, and have read that there is an increased probability of lymphoma or metastatic disease occurring eventually. Do you have any information on this? Also, do you believe in prophylactic removal of ovaries and uterus to prevent cancer following LCIS? Thank you. lcis girl",

      "Content": "I haven't checked out any other sites. I did speak with an oncologist who says that sometimes sarcoidosis coexists with lymphoma, and that it is difficult to know what to do. It's usually a wait and see attitude, which doesn't sit well with me.",
