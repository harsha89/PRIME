      "Content": "I wanted to add a few other symptoms ive been having though not sure if its related. I was diagnosed with possible endometriosis because of left sided abdominal pain. IN the past week and a half this pain has gotten worse and spreads thru to left back area. Also have had problems with urination. It seems like out of nowhere ill have an urgent need to urinate, without warning before hand, and will leak some urine on way to bathroom. The left side pain gets worse when this immediate urge to urinate comes on. My left side hurts constantly now but is worse at times. Not sure if related but thought Id ask if it may be.",

      "Content": "I found a lump in my breast 4 days ago. I made appt. at PCP for next week. I do not have a lump in other breast in the same area as left breast, though right breast has lumps but are slightly moveable and more soft than left lump. I also have some shriveling-like appearance around left nipple and a slight indention under left breast thatrs visable when i raise my arms. Left breast is larger visably ang nipple is a lot higher in left breast. I notice lumps in left breast that feel similiar to the one im worried about also in left breast along side of breast next to where arm hangs and on inside edge of breast close to ribs. I do not notice this on right side. I can manipulate breast to express fluid which is tellow on left side clearish on right. I guess my question is is it possible to have more than one lump with cancer? Or are these possibly enlarged lymph nodes as im not sure where lymphs are located. Any replies will be greatly appreciated, Ill be worried until my dr's appointment.",
