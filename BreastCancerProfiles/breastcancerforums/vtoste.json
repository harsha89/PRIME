    "Content": "Hello everyone... I have a friend that just had a surgery last week, and dr said that they removed all the cancer from her breast. She was doing great and in a great mood. Today she had to go to the dr for a after surgery checkup and the dr told her that she has to go under the nife again. They told her that when they had the 1st surgery they removed some other tissue and they tested after and came back as cancer cells. Even the dr was surprised by this. I was very upset by this, cause why couldn't they figure this out when they had her on the table. Don't they have all the instruments right there to test and do the right thing on one time?? Problably i sound stupid saying this, i have no knowledge. But i'm just worried for my friend that as to go true another surgery in one week. Thank you for your response in advance. A consern friend.",
