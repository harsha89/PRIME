      "Content": "I call very same clinic in Zion, IL about midnight three days ago. I got call back in 24 hours very nice call and very good conversation. Then, I was told all good and promising things.... After all, my insurance covers only 70% (clinic out of network). The facility is NOT working with BCBSH PPO MI. They want $125,000 (one hundred twenty five thousand) up front payment and additional same amount in reserve. I know, my health cost more, but I simple don't have this kind of money. So, ACS lost interest on me. No more calls. I call back, but they can't work with me. End of story. If somebody use energy test kit, please share experience. Lialia",
