    "Content": "Hello Ahogan, My mother was diagnosed with STAGE 4 breast cancer in October 2011... A few days before my birthday. They told us she had approximately 6 weeks to live. I died immediately INSIDE and didn't want to lift my head. But, We began to pray and believe God for her. They removed her breast. No chemo, no radiation or anything. She kicked cancers BUTT!!! THERE IS HOPE IN CHRIST. KNOW HE CAN MAKE EVERYTHING ALRIGHT!!!",
