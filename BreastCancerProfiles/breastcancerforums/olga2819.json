    "Content": "Hello all. Thank you for a good advice! I signed in as a new member here in the site, as I was detected to have a breast tumor. Since I live in Moscow and wanted to be treated in Germany, swiss or Austria, I asked for some advice in some forums. Now I want to share my experience with possible other woman that also need such an Information. I was operated last week in the University clinic in Innsbruck, Austria. All was arranged by a very very empathic and professional company named MOD EDIT As this is an English speaking site..link deleted as per forum policy located in the wonderful area of Innsbruck, Tirol (Alps region in Austria). They arranged all treatments, escorted me from arrival in Innsbruck and at all pre operation examinations (MRI of the Brest, a new biopsy an so on) and were with me while all talks to the doctors before and after the surgery, translations everything for me to russian and since they are doctors, I believe that the translation was even more professional than if it was done only by a \"normal\" translator. Now I am after the operation and want to thank for this great and so helpful !!! internet site. Thank you, thank you, thank you Olga",
