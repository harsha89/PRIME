    "Content": "Hi, I just had surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes under my arm. They removed 17, 4 were positive for adrenocarcenoma. Had previously done a PET Scan which showed 3 under my arm and the original site in my left breast. I did a round of chemo before the surgery. The radiologist at the time of the surgery could not find the breast lump and so the breast was left alone for now. I see the oncologist on Monday, and I have a huge list of questions, but wonder if I have forgotten anything I should ask him. I want to know about radiation treatment, but at this point, I want a prognosis with a risk assessment for recurrence. I start a new round of chemo on Tuesday (taxotere & herceptin). At the moment I am concerned that they can no longer find the lump that was in my breast and am thinking it should be removed anyway given the metastisis. Any suggestions about questions to ask? Thanks telly",
