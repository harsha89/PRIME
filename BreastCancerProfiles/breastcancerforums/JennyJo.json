      "Content": "Hi Kristin, My mom had breastcancer and it spread to liver and the skelleton and she passed away 10 months ago. I know exactly the ride you're going through and if you need to talk or have any questions pls let me know. If they give her the treatment Xeloda remember to put ALOT of fat hand and foot cream on hand and feet since the most common effect is EXTREMELY dry skin. I'm here if you want to talk. Kindest regards Jenny",
