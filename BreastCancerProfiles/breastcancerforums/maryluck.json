    "Content": "I am concerned that most patients are not aware of the jaw bone loss side effect. I have done some research on not only Zometa, but Aredia and Fosamax side effects. These types of drugs(bisphosphonates) have been linked to losing jaw bone. This side effect is called by many names, \"Bis-phossy jaw\",, \"Dead Jaw\", \"Jaw Necrosis, Osteonecrosis of the jaw\" Cases have been reported since 2000 and yet it took the drug company in late 2004 to admit that there is a link. The FDA has taken Novartis(Zometa and Aredia) to task about the delay and the methods used to inform the public. Novartis says they have 875 reported cases to them about people losing their jaw. Researchers believe that this 875 number represents only about 1 to 10 % of the people who have this jaw condition from taking these drugs. Now the warning is to have all your dental work before you take these drugs or don't have dental work at all while on the drugs,and even then it can be risky Here are many links that I found. http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/...e-deaths_x.htm http://www.cancerpage.com/news/article.asp?id=8122 http://online.wsj.com/public/resourc...7172293526.htm http://sev.prnewswire.com/health-car...5052005-1.html http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2...ite_5-5-05.pdf http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2004/ZometaHCP.pdf http://www.fdaadvisorycommittee.com/...05_ZometaR.htm You can also go to Yahoo , MSN, or Google and search for \"Zometa Side Effects\" Hope this helps.",
