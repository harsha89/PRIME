    "Content": "For some months I experienced awful axilla itching and some breast itching. I began to get sore and went to see my doc. She noticed a reddened area around my areola. I was sent to a surgeon who said nothing and sent me for an MRI to which end the machine could not accomodate my large breasts. Now my breast is swollen at least a full cup size and the reddened area feels thick and tender. I am having a surgical biopsy on Monday. I am 51 and had a complete hysterectomy when I was 30. I have not taken hormone replacement due to blood clot problems. PLEASE tell me what else this might be? I hear about mastitis, but have not been able to find anything about post menopausal mastitis. I now hurt from my inner elbow to my neck. This is all happening to fast and I need to understand. Deborah",
