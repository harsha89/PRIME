      "Content": "I also have had a problem with tooth decay after my chemo. My oncologist said this would happen, chemo does a number on your teeth and gums. I'm trying to find a way to prevent future problems. I've had 3 molars removed in the last 2 years. Now my other molars are hurting and I'm afraid I will lose them. Any home remedies out there to strengthen the teeth or prevent cavities. I no longer have health insurance so getting root canals or bridges are out of the question at this point. I can't seem to find anything on the internet, but I'll keep trying!",
