I can't remember what forum under but search forums for oestrogen. Whoever started the thread didn't realize she put an \"o\" at the beginning. I did get some information there. Oh, go to my profile and see all the posts I've made. You should find the thread there. Good luck to you. I'm going for my second onc appt. this Thurs. where I need to talk more about chemo and then I'll decide what to do. I am against chemo because of the other medical problems I have and chemo is only going to make them worse, if there is a worse. Andee",

      "Content": "Nancy, All my doctors are pushing chemo. They knew at the beginning that I was against chemo. You're not prying. 7 years ago, I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, an incurable bladder disease that won't kill me, it justs make my life miserable all the time and I spend more time in the bathrom then anywhere else. A couple of months later, I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathies and muscle weakness in my arms, hands, legs, feet and back which has made me almost bed ridden. My onc recommended chemo of MLF (Methotrexate, Leucovorin and 5-FU). This chemo regimen is twice a month for six months. I can't have Cytoxan or anything similar because it would cause my bladder to bleed and make my interstitial cystitis worse than it is already. I am also afraid of more extreme neuropathies and muscle weakness than I already have. My urologist and oncologist said we'll deal with it, but I am allergic to so many drugs that they both know that will be difficult to do. I do know what my chances are if I don't do chemo. I already had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy and the 3 nodes were clean and the tumor margins were clean. I just had a Bone Scan and CAT Scans and they were clean. I'm starting Mammosite Radiation (Brachytherapy) starting the end of next week. Then I'll decide whether I have chemo or not. Most women fight this as hard as they can. I feel I have to do what I feel is good for me. Congratulations on being 2-1/2 years NED. Andee",

      "Content": "Would like to know if anyone actually had Mammosite radiation with balloon catheter. I am scheduled to have the catheter inserted next Tuesday, 10/26 and would like to know how it felt right after. Pain, etc. I am also having a port put in on the other side at the same time, even though I am still not too sure about having chemo, I wanted it all done at one time instead of having to go back to have the port put in at a different time. I'm a glutton for punishment. Four weeks after lumpectomy and SNB and I am still in a lot of pain from that and now I'm going to have two more incisions. Anyway, really would like to know about the mammosite. Andee",
