I see you are on a lot of different pills for different things. I don't take anything right now because I am so afraid of the potential side effects from drugs that have not been on the market long enough to know what bad effect they may have. I heard on the news all the time about new things coming out about drugs we all thought we good. It seems to be about the money.. these drug companies a rich, rich, rich. It also bothered me that chemo studies are often funded by drug companies which further scares me with regard to trusting the results. We will all just hang in there and keep trying. Keep me posted on your status. Blessings of continued bc free results. Ann",

      "Content": "Welcome home Shelly ! I had to take sleeping pills for a couple of weeks, and then stopped so I wouldn't get dependent on them. You need your rest during the night so see what your doctor suggests. I am not a big pill taker, but since I got bc I have had to take a fews things to help me through the journey. I am so glad you don't have much pain. The surgery has now done 75% of the work by removing the tumor and lymph glands. I hope they wait on chemo until after Christmas too. I can't imagine that a few days will make that much difference and it seems like you will need to heal and get your strength back. Before you fall asleep at night do deep breathing a mediate for about 5 minutes. This helps me relax and my sleep is much better. Love, Hollis",

      "Content": "Are you up for company? It would be great to see you at the office, getting around, but I want you to rest. You have big stuff coming up. You had at least 75 phone calls at the office. Everyone was checking on you and praying for your surgery to go well. Our prayers were answered. I am getting good information on the site, and thank you for getting me on it. I have tried to put my condition out of mind, but I do have some big decisions to make. I am leaning more toward the chemo. I am trying to build up now and will probably start in late February. You will have been in to yours several months. Love, Hollis",

      "Content": "Welcome home Shelly ! I had to take sleeping pills for a couple of weeks, and then stopped so I wouldn't get dependent on them. You need your rest during the night so see what your doctor suggests. I am not a big pill taker, but since I got bc I have had to take a fews things to help me through the journey. I am so glad you don't have much pain. The surgery has now done 75% of the work by removing the tumor and lymph glands. I hope they wait on chemo until after Christmas too. I can't imagine that a few days will make that much difference and it seems like you will need to heal and get your strength back. Before you fall asleep at night do deep breathing a mediate for about 5 minutes. This helps me relax and my sleep is much better. Love, Hollis",
