      "Content": "After speaking with 2 surgical oncologists, I was advised by both that a mastectomy of the cancerous breast is the only option given the size of my tumor. After a lot of discussion, thought, and fear of ever dealing with breast cancer again, I have decided that a double mastectomy is the safest choice. At 32 my chances of having breast cancer again is about 60%. With a double mastectomy it's about 5%. It's still unreal sometimes, but I have my surgery scheduled for May 1st. My mother thinks I made this decision too quickly. Did I? Am I allowing my fear to dictate this decision, or am I being smart for making sure that I will live a healthy, cancer free life?",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm day 2 post op and feeling good. Both \"girls\" are gone and I have zero regrets. I have prepared for this and I know that the decision was the right one. They took 3 lymph nodes and so far no cancer in any of them, however, the final results will come in sometime next week after a full detailed pathology. Survivor12, I can't begin to imagine having gone through so much at your age. You are an amazing, strong woman! I definitely understand your decision to opt for a double mastectomy if the cancer does come back. I really hope it won't though. Bookwriter, best of luck to you with this journey. I agree 100%, getting 2 matching ones is better than having one look a little different. I've seen pictures of both options, and though the PS does a great job matching the two, there is still a little difference visually. When are you having your surgery?",

      "Content": "Bookwriter, I will keep you in my thoughts. I'm confident that you know in your heart what the right decision is. Honestly, the pain really isn't that bad at all. A week and a half after surgery I'm barelynfeeling any pain. The one thing I'm having a bit of a hard time with is the loss of sensation in them. I can't really touch them just yet. I read that this was common and in time it will get easier and also the sensation will return. So be prepared for the 'weirdness'. Please update us and let us know how you're doing post op. lots of hugs!!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with BC earlier this week and needless to say I am terrified. I'm a mother of a 7 year old and all I keep thinking about is not being alive to watch her grow up. I am meeting with surgical oncologists next week. I'm trying to stay positive, but it's very hard sometimes. Not knowing exactly what stage I'm in makes this so much scarier. My mother is a BC survivor, she was diagnosed at 47, about 6 years ago. If anyone can offer any words of encouragement, advice, really anything, I would greatly appreciate it.",

      "Content": "Hi cyndi I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. After the embolism, I'm sure the last thing you want to deal with is cancer. The fact that it was diagnosed so early is a great sign. You seem like a very strong woman and I know you will get through this as well. Having a child somehow makes us want to fight even harder, doesn't it? I will keep you in my thoughts and please keep me posted on how things are going",
