      "Content": "Hi my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer 4 years ago at the age of 25, had a mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Because the cancer was hormone receptive, they put her on tamoxifen to stop oestrogen production. The cancer was detected again in December 2004, this time it had moved into her bone, specifically the pelvic region. She underwent another series of radiation of the pelvic area, and 6 months of iv chemo, as well as chemo pills (Xeloda) which she is still on. She has stopped the tamoxifen, but is now on a 3 monthly injection of zoladex, to stop oestrogen production. The problem we have run into is that we can't really have penetrative sex anymore. With the chemo, radiation and hormone therapy, there is no natural lubrication, and her oncologist is against any kind of vaginal oestrogen cream (which her gynaecologist recommended). We've tried other lubricants and nothing works - sex is too painful for her. Has anyone else experienced the same kind of problem and found any solutions?",
