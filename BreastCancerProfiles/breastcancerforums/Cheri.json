      "Content": "Thank you both for your quick answers. We, sorry she saw a gynaecologist on Friday morning and we have an appointment for an ultrasound and mammo on Monday morning. The doctor seemed to think that it might be a cyst because of her age, but the fact that both the mammo and ultrasound are so soon says something different to me. Perhaps it is because the lunp is so large. Anyway Thank yoou again. Cheri",
