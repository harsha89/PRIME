      "Content": "After seeing several doctors, I have decided to do the same thing. I have cancer in the left breast, but based on the results of a blood test they did, and my family history, I'm having them take both. I have heard so many women, take one and end up with it in the other. I don't want to go thru this twice, I'd rather do it right the first time and get it over with. Plus, I'm planning reconstruction, and my thoughts are that a new matching set would look better than having one fake one, and one saggy one (although, they told me they would lift the real one to make it match(. Don't let anyone make you second guess your decision, WE are going the right thing!!",

I had breast cancer in May, and had a DOUBLE mastectomy. Since I have no ovaries, and now no breasts (still in reconstruction stage), I don't understand WHY they won't allow me to go back on this medication. I feel GOOD on premarin, now I'm suffering from SEVERE hot flashes, which seriously makes me feel sick. My breast cancer was estrogen positive, but if I don't have any breasts, how can I get breast cancer again? Why would it be a risk for me to the taken estrogen now? I have asked this question to my \"wonderful: doctor, and the reply I was given is...: because you can;t\". Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..Anyone?",

The plastic surgeon followed my surgery, and placed stretchers into my chest, so that's the first stage for reconstruction. It's strange to see my natural double d's gone, I'm flat as a board right now, but I know in a few months, I will be able to have my second surgery of having the implants placed in. I don't know if I'll need chemo YET, don't get back my reports of whether or not it was in the lymph nodes until Thursday, believe me I'm holding my breath. I can tell you that I have gotten WONDERFUL support from posting on this board, very strong, awesome, survivor woman here, that will help you thru. Keep posting, we are all in this together!!",

Although, breast pain doesn't have to mean its cancer (it can be many things), pain means something is going on, its not normal to have pain. I can tell you that I did have breast pain for 4 years before they found my breast cancer, I complained every year and had a mammo, and nothing was found, until this year. In my case, I had tenderness and pain in the nipple and areola area, and was diagnosed with breast cancer of the milk ducts which had spread and become invasive into the breast. Breast pain can also come from hormones, many woman have different times of the month where their breasts seem tender, and this is considered normal. You mention your armpit area, which makes me think lymph nodes, that could signal something like Epstein Barr (A simple blood test), and not a cancer situation. In any case, any pain you have, should be checked out by a doctor. Make a appt.",
