      "Content": "About shingles: Do you know what they actually are? They are the pox viruses that you got when you were a little kid. Some of those viruses hid inside your neurons (nerve cells) so that as a little kid, those guys were not seen by your immune system. You get shingles when your immune system becomes compromised, and those pox viruses come out of hiding and infect your skin. They hid inside the nerve cells, and so they hijack the nerves to reach your skin. But don't worry, radiation/chemo is supposed to affect your immune system slightly. So, occassional shingles episodes after radiation/chemo is really normal. You can probably get creams from your doctor/pharmacist to relieve the pain.",
