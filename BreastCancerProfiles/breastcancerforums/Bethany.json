      "Content": "Hello Heartlandjo, I had radiotherapy for breast cancer for six weeks. For me [and it is different for all of us] it was very straightforward with little discomfort except very minor nausea and dry skin. My methodology for getting through it unscathed was to deal with the emotional aspects of sitting in the waiting room beside people who obviously would not be here for very long! So my solution was to not look at them or survey their faces [hard for me!] but to put my head in a very intense book to keep my mind off thinking about those worse off than I. I also joked with the technicians and asked them about anything rather than think of what was happening. This sounds like denial and it was- and used positively to get me through. We will all be thinking of you and wish you an easy treatment time. Keep smiling",

      "Content": "I have been on Aromasin for 9 months. The good news is that it has diminished BC tumours on my lungs from 1.8cm to almost nothing in that time. However, I 'hit the wall' with fatigue about 3pm when I take it at breakfast. The obvious thing to do is take it later in the day, so I do that, but lunch is difficult when at work. My question- If I take Aromasin after a dinner with wine, does the alcohol counteract the inhibitors/ blocker effect? [No, I wouldn't wash it down with the wine!] [hic!]",

      "Content": "Hello Justine, I've had two PET scans. The last one was a month before I was diagnosed with metastasic disease [secondary breast cancer] on my lungs. The PET scan report did not specifically pin point the tumours. I'm not wanting to worry you but at least your friend's 'cancer' is not a whopping big tumour but perhaps [if they're there] small ones which don't show up clearly in a PET scan. Breast cancer research has come a long way quickly- my tumours have diminished in 9 months while I've been on Aromasin, an estrogen blocker. All the best Justine My history BC 1997 at 48 years No nodes involved but menopausal Ductal Carcinoma in situ ER+ Radiation only 2006- Mets to lungs",
