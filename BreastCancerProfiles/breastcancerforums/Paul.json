      "Content": "I feel sorry to hear about your mom's recurring breast cancer. I don't know what the reason for this may be; however, probably your mom should take some extra therapies, vitamin supplies, special diet, etc. - this is all very important, but doctors sometimes overlook it and they rely on surgery and medications. Of course, this all should be carefully administered, I recommend that you talk to some good alternative cancer therapy doctor, I am sure they can give you a piece of advice and suggest some treatments, like hyperbaric oxygen therapy or some supplements specially designated to prevent cancer recurrence. I would personally recommend http://www.wehealcancer.org/ - I know that their medical director Dr. Ronald Douglas Wichman M.D. has been recently emphasising the treatment of breast cancer in their clinic. Hope this will help and I wish you all the best! Paul",

      "Content": "Yes, I agree, complementary therapy, right diet, carefully selected doses of vitamins, and alternative treatments are very helpful in the prevention of recurrence of cancer, as well as in recovering after chemotherapy and/or radiation. I think that contacting some good doctor aware of these methods and asking for advice might be a good idea, I would personally recommend http://www.wehealcancer.org/ As for your mother, you can also contact them, the doctors at that clinic are specialized in treating advanced stages of cancer, and they combine both traditional and alternative methods to offer the best possible treatment, they might recommend some treatment for her. In any case, you can always ask their opinion, I hope you will not regret. I wish you good health and never give up! Life is too beautiful to waste it! Paul",

Of course, they also have some written stuff at their website, see http://www.wehealcancer.org/patients.html - for instance: A letter from Colleen Jordan or A letter from Monty Kaiser.",
