      "Content": "I feel sorry to hear about your mom's recurring breast cancer. I don't know what the reason for this may be; however, probably your mom should take some extra therapies, vitamin supplies, special diet, etc. - this is all very important, but doctors sometimes overlook it and they rely on surgery and medications. Of course, this all should be carefully administered, I recommend that you talk to some good alternative cancer therapy doctor, I am sure they can give you a piece of advice and suggest some treatments, like hyperbaric oxygen therapy or some supplements specially designated to prevent cancer recurrence. I would personally recommend http://www.wehealcancer.org/ - I know that their medical director Dr. Ronald Douglas Wichman M.D. has been recently emphasising the treatment of breast cancer in their clinic. Hope this will help and I wish you all the best! Paul",
