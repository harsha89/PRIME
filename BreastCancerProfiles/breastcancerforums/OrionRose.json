    "Content": "This is what they think my mother has, she was diagnosed at the end of last week. She goes in for an MRI on Thursday to find out the extent, but at the same time for this type of cancer they said they won't really be able to tell that much anyway. We thought this was going to be simpler because it seemed small and new, but due to the type of cancer now they're not sure. My apologies if this is discussed elsewhere. I know forums and the taboo of repeat threads. I just don't want to go sorting through a bunch of different cancer threads looking for information. It's hard enough to post this. What I'm looking for is alternate methods of treatment. Any and every. The doctor said that they're going to take out her first two lymph nodes on that side as a safety precaution regardless of what they find in the MRI. There were mentions of \"arm swelling\" as a possible side effect but I'm wondering what else might lie in store. I'm sorry for the vagueness here. We don't know much at this point and rather then stabbing at the aether I'd much rather the research come to me. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps. I don't like looking into this. But I'd much rather myself do it than my mother. She has enough on her mind right now.",
