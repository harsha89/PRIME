      "Content": "Hi all I'm new to the forums. I found out my father had liver cancer a year ago and we found out recently that my mother in law has grade 3 stage 1 breast cancer. Needless to say it's been a rough year for us. My mother in law will be starting chemo in January and is very anxious about it especially with losing her hair. We are looking for wigs now and have no idea where to start looking. Any experience or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks Jen",
