      "Content": "I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma 2 months ago. I had a lumpectomy and the cancer had already spread to the lymph nodes in my underarm. I'm currently undergoing chemotherapy. I've been very depressed today because my hair started falling. I want to vent, to ask questions, to get answers. I'm hoping I came to the right place. I'm scared !!!!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lucy I was diagnosed with early breast cancer (stage I). Can anyone recommend a good hospital in the LA area ? I will have surgery. Lucy Lucy, you were diagnosed just in time. Stage 1 is early and very treatable. No need to worry. I have stage 3 and I have all the possibilities of surviving too after a long treatment. You'll do well. Bless you Ladyblue",
