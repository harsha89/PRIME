    "Content": "Hi The reason I am posting is this morning my best friend of 22 years visited me after a doctors appointment, to deliver the news that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and also has a suspicious looking cyst on her liver which requires further investigation. At this early stage we know little more about the scale or degree of cancer in the breast, but the cells are scattered and the medical staff have indicated that the breast will need to be removed. My friend is 42, she has been vegetarian for 25 years, she meditates, exercises, and undertakes a path of 'spiritual development'. I am wondering if anyone has any experience with holistic treatments such as intravenous immune therapy, ozone treatment, infrared detoxification therapy? Or contacts in Perth, Western Australia, I am currently doing some research but I think a recommendation is always the best avenue for something so important. I would really appreciate any guidance or advice for my dear friend. Thank you, sjd.",
