They found it in a mammogram, it is small, so everyone assured me that a biopsy was not necessary, HA, had to make them biopsy it, and of course it came back cancer. You know when you just know. Anyhow, they did genetic blood testing, and shipped it off, so now we wait....

The results will help me decide if we do a lumpectomy or more invasive surgery. I can tell you that the biopsy process has come a long way, this one didnt really hurt. The one 11 years ago, I felt like i was harpooned......the pain was really bad. Just thankful it is small and that we caught it so early, i go every year for my mamo, and also my oncologist, so every six months someone is seeing me. I will keep you posted, thanks again for the welcome....Norma",
