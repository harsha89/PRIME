      "Content": "Im new here. I am Miranda, 35 years old and diagnosed with BC a few days ago. The larger palpable lump is tube shaped at about 11:00 on my left breast. It is about 4 inches long, and there is a small nodule at the top as well as another palpable lump about nickel size just to the left of it near my nipple. Mammo showed calcifications in all areas palpable. Biopsy was done in the nickel size area and of the small nodule at the top of the tube shaped 'lump'. Invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS were shown in both areas. Dr does say that it is a slow growing cancer. Grade 1/3 (not sure exactly what that means). Mastectomy recommended for 3-5 weeks from now. Awaiting info re other diagnostics to be done (MRI, chest Xray, labs, etc) Drs conferring about it tomorrow. So my worry is that the area is so BIG. It seems most lumps are very small, some not even paplpable, and mine is huge. I worry about mets most of all since I have no idea how long its been growing. I only stopped breastfeeding my youngest child last December, so any abnormalities could have been chalked up to milk. Does size haave a bearing on prognosis? If so, always? Any answers welcome. Thanks!",

      "Content": "I would be frustrated too, also scared. I would go see a different breast Doc, if I were you, for a second opinion. I would think with your history they would look closer, biopsy, etc. I do not have much wisdom as I am newly diagnosed. But I wish you luck.",
