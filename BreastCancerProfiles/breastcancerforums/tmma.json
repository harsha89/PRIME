      "Content": "Hello Everyone. I am new here and I am so grateful to have found this forum. I am living in Texas, and my Mum lives in the UK. 15 years ago she was diagnosed with breast cancer that had not spread and was given a mastectomy followed by 5 years on Tamoxifen. 3 months ago she developed severe bone pain in her legs and pelvis and found out she had bone cancer in her leg, pelvis and skull. They have told her it is likely the breast cancer spread, although they have not found any lumps either at the mastectomy site or the right breast. Anyway, her condition has worsened quickly, and despite being on painkillers and a \"hormone blocking drug\" and radiotherapy-there appears to be no improvement. I call her and my sister multiple times a day- she is so depressed and cannot still get out of bed ( she has been in bed now for 3 months). I am beside myself and preparing to go over there ( to the UK) for a visit ( and to find out what exactly is going on-as no one I talk to on the phone has ANY answers at all). I am tearing myself up here and feel so helpless....I know when I go to the UK, I do have to return here-my family ( husband and 7 year old) need me too-but the position I am in, I need some indication as to what is happening there. My family there are NOT asking any questions of the specialists ( I understand why, I really do, we are all frightened and upset)-but in this position here-I am out here not knowing which way to turn and worrying myself sick about her. I know this post probably makes NO sense whatsoever...and I apologize to you all for that-it feels good to actually get this out, and I do appreciate any feedback. As far as my mother's condition, the only information I have is what I have written up there. I am worried sick about her-the nurse that comes out to visit her thought she would be at least out of bed for short lengths of time by now, and the fact that she is not worries me alot. I should add that I, myself have multiple sclerosis, and I am doing my best not to put myself in hospital with an MS flare-up through this, as then I am of no help to anyone. I keep looking on the internet, as that is my only source of information and I don't know what to think. I am on the phone with my Mum all the time trying and trying to keep her positive and believing- but she is very depressed and it's getting so hard to keep her believing....I understand she is angry, and I am there for her to get at least some of the anger out. I feel so inadequate, but from here right now that's all I can do...And not knowing what exactly the treatment plan is, or what exactly the specialists have said or not is honestly driving me crazy. I am not trying to make this about me, I am really not...just confused, upset and frightened...and I feel safe expressing this here. Thanks for reading, and sorry for my jumbled up rambling. tmma.",

      "Content": "Thank you all! I do have some updates- -I am leaving in 2 weeks-( it would be sooner, but my own neurologist/ MRI scan for my MS cannot be moved any sooner than next week, and I want to get that done before I leave). -My Mum has started on some \" ?biophosphates[sp]?\" once a month to \"build her bones\" and has received a large dose of radiotherapy. -She definatly \"perked up\" when I told her I was on my way- and it was so good to hear her sounding more like herself again... That was until yesterday she was rushed to the ER with a DVT!! She is stable and on warfarin...They discharged her and now she is back in bed at home again...Right when she was starting to get out of it.....She is still angry and depressed, even more so now and tired, she is not eating either. My heart is breaking as I want and need to be there, I cannot wait to get over there-I really can't. Thanks for reading another jumbled up post of mine-I'll update as soon as I get the chance.",
