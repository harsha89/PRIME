The adrimiacin (sp) took most of my hair..don't shave anymore which is the best-but I do still have hair on my head..enough to put in a tiny ponytail..it comes to my shoulders almost when it is down..very thin and you can see my scalp, especially in the back and sides, but I do have some hair I am 39 and that was my biggest fear of all!! I am making it thru the chemo, hasn't been bad on me, I was thinking I would be sick all of the time, but I am not!! I do have some nausea, so I'll take my pill..of course more tired than usual..my feet were sore and tender one day from fourth chemo, which was only the one day so far. I am having a double mast. w reconstruction in dec, then removing my ovaries after, since I am postivie for the brca1 gene. There is a spot on my pelvic bone that has not been biopsied yet, that will be after chemo, since I decided I couldn't or wouldn't do the biopsy at the time..I am the biggest whimp when it comes to needles, but made it this far!! My biggest fears were needles and losing my hair..but am making it thru!! I hope this helps other women-there is some hope!! xo",

This isn't what you want to hear though. You want to hear the survivor stories, that is what helped me..read about stage4 survivors, there are many women who are still alive and well after being diagnosed with stage4, and I personally know a few myself. So read the positive stories, this will help you and your mom. Miracles happen everyday, and people can survive with stage4!! Remember that!! xo",
