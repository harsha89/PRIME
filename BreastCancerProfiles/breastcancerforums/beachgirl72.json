      "Content": "I was diagnosed in Aug of this yr with invasive ductal carcinoma, triple negative, with the brca1 gene positive..so it is hereditary as I though, lost my mom and grandma to breast cancer. I was stage 2a, tumor 4.7 cm, now after doing the four chemos, there is no size on it, going away. I did not lose all of my hair!!! It is very thin, but I do have some..it is in a ponytail on my head now!!! like I said, very little.. ALSO, the chemo has not made me sick!!! I had a little bone pain from the shot for my immune after my chemo, but not bad! Just wanted to let others know.. xo",

      "Content": "Thank you so much!! So glad that you are in remission!! I wanted to share my story about the hair with others. The adrimiacin (sp) took most of my hair..don't shave anymore which is the best-but I do still have hair on my head..enough to put in a tiny ponytail..it comes to my shoulders almost when it is down..very thin and you can see my scalp, especially in the back and sides, but I do have some hair I am 39 and that was my biggest fear of all!! I am making it thru the chemo, hasn't been bad on me, I was thinking I would be sick all of the time, but I am not!! I do have some nausea, so I'll take my pill..of course more tired than usual..my feet were sore and tender one day from fourth chemo, which was only the one day so far. I am having a double mast. w reconstruction in dec, then removing my ovaries after, since I am postivie for the brca1 gene. There is a spot on my pelvic bone that has not been biopsied yet, that will be after chemo, since I decided I couldn't or wouldn't do the biopsy at the time..I am the biggest whimp when it comes to needles, but made it this far!! My biggest fears were needles and losing my hair..but am making it thru!! I hope this helps other women-there is some hope!! xo",

      "Content": "Kristin, I am so sorry to hear about your mom. I lost my mom and grandma to breast cancer. They gave my mom less than 6 months, which ended up over 2 years!! This isn't what you want to hear though. You want to hear the survivor stories, that is what helped me..read about stage4 survivors, there are many women who are still alive and well after being diagnosed with stage4, and I personally know a few myself. So read the positive stories, this will help you and your mom. Miracles happen everyday, and people can survive with stage4!! Remember that!! xo",

      "Content": "have you got your results? the same thing happened to me. they ruled out cyst, mine also had a tail like coming out. mine did turn out to be cancer. they did not catch it on my first mammo, so you are lucky they did catch whatever it may be. i am half way thru my chemo without any major problems, and did not lose all of my hair..i am 39, that was my biggest fear. hopefully your results came out ok and you do not have to go thru this. hoping the best for you-we are young and never think this can happen to us-keep up with your mammograms!! xo",
