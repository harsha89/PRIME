    "Content": "I was misdiagnosed about 1.5 years ago with Paget's disease of the breast. It started with a small red pimple like lesion on areola. No itching, no rash, no involvement of nipple. Given antibiotics for 2 weeks and persisted. Returned to physician for biopsy, the pathology diagnosis was Paget's. My physician ordered a repeat mammogram which had been negative 3 months before. this subsequent mammo was negative. then my physician ordered an MRI which was also negative. However, in paget's an underlying intraductal carcinoma(cancer) may be present but MRI may still be negative. So based on the pathology diagnosis of paget's my surgeon recommended nipple resection and possibly later mastectomy if cancer present. I am a trained medical professional with extensive experience and decided to ask for a second opinion with a National Cancer Institute where I had worked. They returned a diagnosis of toker cells.(benign). My surgeon was reluctant and requested another consultation with the best Breast Pathology Department in NY. they also rendered a diagnosis of benign toker cells. this was horrific experience to go through lasting about 3 months until I was correctly diagnosed. I also underwent close followup with ultrasounds for a year. I am happy to report I am fine and no cancer present to this day. My recommendation to anyone receiving a diagnosis of Paget's disease of the breast(very rare rare form of breast cancer) if your clinical picture is not adding up and there is some question please seek second opinion of an expert in the field before undergoing the knife.",
