      "Content": "It's too bad that you have this skeptical view of clinical trials. They have their flaws, but I feel your points are not fair. 1. It's typically mandated by institutional review boards (IRBs) to not continue giving patients the study medication when there is disease progression, since it would be unethical to mandate that patients continue receiving what is believed to be an ineffective therapy for them and expose them to unnecessary toxicity. Their results are almost always included and reported in the trial, which often group patients based on initial \"intention to treat.\" CONSORT diagrams otherwise describe what happened to patients who were initially evaluated for the study but did not get included in the final analysis. Patients who were enrolled, received the drug, and had progressive disease would be included in the final analysis and statistics, such as for median overall survival and progression-free survival. 2. Of course it'd be great to have overall survival as the primary endpoint for all clinical trials. However, this is not realistic in many cases, particularly diseases such as breast and prostate cancer, for which there are many additional lines of therapy that confound overall survival, and for which it would unfeasible or extremely difficult to have an adequately powered number of participants to have a statistically significant result. More achievable endpoints such as progression-free survival and response rate have their flaws, but make it so that some conclusions can be drawn, instead of every trial being negative or not being able to meet some enormous accrual target projected to meet the needed statistical power. Patients who are not evaluable often include ones, for example, who cannot be located/are lost to follow-up. 3. There are few patients that get taken off of study after just three weeks. Many trials don't even have the first evaluation of response that early. There have been some trials in other fields which only include patients who have, for example, taken the medication for at least 4 weeks or for oral medications, were documented to have taken at least, say 90% of the doses. The criticism of that approach is that could make the data look too good. Excluding people who didn't adhere or make it through the beginning risks overestimating the potential benefit since the analysis isn't being done based on the original intention to treat.",

      "Content": "I think it's normal to have these thoughts. Life never will be the same. However, I think almost all people ultimately choose to get treated because breast cancer is often a curable disease, and people can live long quality-filled lives after treatment. The alternative would be that the breast cancer grows, ultimately causes complications/side effects, and then is much more difficult to treat. Everything is your choice though; nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do. There is sometimes additional information discovered with surgery, so though it sounds like the doctor's pretty sure chemo will be needed, there may still be a possibility that it isn't. If you really don't want chemo and your tumor is ER/PR positive, you'd have the option of choosing to only get hormone treatment and no chemo, which wouldn't give as good of a chance of a cure as with chemo, but would be better than doing nothing after surgery. Mastectomy generally has similar success rates as a smaller lumpectomy + radiation, so the choice is entirely yours for what cosmetic outcome you want and whether you want to deal with radiation afterward.",
