    "Content": "Hello everyone. Im Courtney a 29 year old mother of 3 and a wife of a air force TSgt for 11 years! Two weeks ago I found a lump in my breast and quickly had a doc appt. She reffered me to ultrasound a week later. Which was done 3 days ago. Tonight I got a confusing update from the results. The nurse said it showed a \"suspicious nodule\" I've searched the internet and am still confused... I understand that no one here can give me any answers, but im just looking for some support and insight. Thank you in advance!",
