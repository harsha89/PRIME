      "Content": "Thank you so much for your prompt reply. I am indeed trying to detox my body. Have completely changed my diet, to veggies, some organic, plenty of salads and fruit. Specially strawberries and grapes. I did update my diet change to my oncologist, but her answer was \"If you fancy a roast chicken have it\" Any help will be appreciated. Thanks again",
