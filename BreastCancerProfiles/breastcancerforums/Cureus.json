      "Content": "Hi. I think you should take the calcification seriously. I had a mamo in 2006 that showed calcifications, (Micro-calcifications, macro-calcifications).-- However I wasn't told about the calicifications in 2006, I was told I had 1 cyst. The reason I know now is that when I found out I had cancer I had to get the reports, I read them and was very upset that I had calcifications and wasn't told about it. Since they told me that everything was normal and the dr. said I had a cyst I didn't worry about it. I forgot to get another mamo in 2007. In 2008 in my mamo they found cancer in my left breast. I had a MRI and they found three more. I am very luck I went in 2008.",

      "Content": "I went for a MRI recently and they could not do it becasue of the metal in my expandures. So I had a mira looma performed on me. The results came back and when I was in the doctor office looking at the x-ray of the torso part. I saw 2 spots that looked like it was just below the ribcage. The doctor said that my mira looma came out good. So I didn't ask any question about it because I was a little scared. I called back later and they said that it was reported normal. What I want to know is. What was those spots? Will it turn into something later? I was looking on the internet for anything about Mira looma, but I can't find anything.",

      "Content": "I had it done at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas Nevada (USA) I don't think it is a scan because notheing was scanning over me. They were taking the x-ray through a square-like x-ray plate. It is like having a mammo. You place your breast on it and the pictures are taken from the plate, (rather from a x-ray like the mammo does.) and sent to a computer. There is a software that interprets the images. Perhaps Mira looma is spelled wrong--that is how it was spelled on my referral. But I still couldn't find anything about it when I spelled it different ways. I know I shouldn't worry about it since I was told that it ws reported normal. But I had a mammo that had calcifications on it and it was reported normal. I have an oppointment in June with my Oncologist and I will ask her about it. Hopefully I will ask. I also wanted to know if someone knew if the x-ray in a mira looma is the same concept as a mammo x-ray (Sorry I am so confused to explain this, as to I am not medically experienced) Because My oncologist told me that mammo x-ray don't show things as well for me like an MRI does. (Which explains why my firt MRI shows the other 3 cancers that my mammo didn't. Should I ask my oncologist for an MRI on my torso part?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DaisysGus I am hoping someone can help me understand. I had a fibroadenoma removed from my right breast 3 years ago. Everything was fine. I now have lumps in both breasts and I am in constant pain. Even my nipples hurt! They have done core needle biopsies and mammos every 6 months, but the part that worries me most is the fact the lumps keep growing, and they found microcalcifications. I go back in June for another round of mammos and biopsies. Should I consider having a masectomy to relieve the problems? My family has a strong history of cervical, lung, and other cancers. Any advice would be appreciated. My advise according to my experince. The pain could be cyst, an ultrasound identifies this 100%. Cyst are painful and you can get new ones. These can be aspirated. These are macrocalcifications. Have an MRI done, bilateral. Mammos do not show some tumors. A biopsy of the microcalicification, I recommend going through with this. This way you will know the hormonal levels of it. If I knew than what I know now. I would of had the mesectomy done. Why take the chance and keep watching it until you find cancer?",
