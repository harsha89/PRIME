    "Content": "Hey Yall! Ive completed my five years on tamox. and have just stopped taking it. Can anyone tell me what to expect now as far as side effects are concerned? Will i be able to lose weight faster, will my hair get thicker? I Hope so. Anyone who has been through it please let me know. I seem a bit more emotional than usual, but im wondering if thats just from the drama of finally reaching five years. I cried when the dr. said see you in a year, didnt know whether to be scared to death or really happy.... talk to you soon lusianagal[/quote]",
