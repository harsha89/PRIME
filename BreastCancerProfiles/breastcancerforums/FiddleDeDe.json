      "Content": "Janice, Are you still around? How did it go with your students? I teach fourth grade. Since I am undergoing chemo and have missed quite a bit of time and my hair will fall out, I told my students. We were studying a unit on medicine in Language Arts at the time. I read them excerpts from a children's book on cancer so they would understand what it was. I explained the doctors found some cancer cells in my body and that they were going to give me medicine or chemotherapy to make me better. I explained that I might miss some time from work in order to see the doctor but that was because I was working very hard at getting better. One student did ask if I was going to die. I answered honestly that I didn't believe so but that we all do die at some point in our lives, and no one can no for sure what will happen tomorrow. They seemed to accept this and I didn't have to lie to them. I lost a parent at a young age and I wish people had been more honest with me.",

He took quite a few pictures using different filters and lighting. I decided to try and feel extra sexy by wearing a lacy dress, high heels and full make-up. We played music and joked, while our friend photographed it all. I feel very empowered by being able to choose when and how I lost my hair. Can't wait till the pictures are developed.",

      "Content": "I had a bitch of a time with mine. The good news is that it did not get infected. The surgical nurse I spoke with a week after it was put in suggested that because the surgeon found a vein and then lost it for awhile, he may have had to do some extra poking around, causing extra bruising. This is what I was instructed to do. When they say use the arm as normal, they REALLY mean it. If it's too stiff or sore, get a moist electric heating pad from a medical supply store. Rest your upper arm off the arm of a couch or something so that the elbow lower arm are not resting on anything. Keep the moist heat on for 10 -20 minutes while you stretch the arm. Adding a hammer or 1 - 2 pound weight to the arm can help stretch it. Bend it every few minutes then resume the stretch. I know this is safe from physical therapy for the other arm that was broken last spring. Even if the arm hurts use it to carry groceries and other things. The more you baby the arm, the stiffer it will get. Also do NOT follow the advice of one of my NPs: taking ibuprofen for the swelling. My stomach was mess for days after that. Tylenol and the heating pad are the way to go in this case. Good luck",

I know the old survival rates are outdated due to better chemotherapy. I am kind of curious about this but no one has talked to me about that. All my doctors have been treating me with kid gloves because I was diagnosed while pregnant and recently miscarriaged.",
