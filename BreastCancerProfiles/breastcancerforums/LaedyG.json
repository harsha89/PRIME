      "Content": "We found out that my mother's cancer is called triple negative. She was put on Ixempra and had 3 treatments. She started having severe pain when she ate so the doctor checked to see via a pet scan how things were going. Unfortunately the Ixempra was not doing anything. She had more liver, lung wall, lymph node involvement and there is some questionable spots on her spine. Although they do think that those spots might be due to the Nuelasta. The Ixempra made her so very sick. Thank goodness she doesn't have to take it anymore. She is so tired and and weak. Mom is such a spit fire. Absolutely full of life just back in July. I am so scared. Anyway, she went to MD Anderson in Houston to see if there was anything they could do. They wanted to try an experimental drug on her until they checked her liver function and said that the liver was in too bad of shape to put her in the trial. Instead they put her on Xeloda. But the regimen is different than what is normally done (two weeks on, one week off). She is going to be on a 1 week on and 1 week off, because her liver is in such bad shape. Does anyone have any information on what this does in terms of sickness? She's a tough old bird, but that Ixempra really kicked her in the dirt. I am just hoping that the Xeloda is easier on her. I have almost come to terms that my time with her might be short. I say almost because I just don't know...it has been such a roller coaster that I am just scared most of the time now. Anyway, if anyone has taken this or is taking this Xeloda, will you let me know how it is on you? Oh!, and does it really effect your taste buds?",

      "Content": "My mother who is 61 years old just found out today that her breast cancer has metasticized to her lung wall, liver and the mediastinal lymph nodes. I have been scouring the internet to find any bit of information and what I have been finding does not look good. She is a healthy woman with an active life. She is a smoker and has been for all of my life and I am 40. My question is this, and please don't give me the sunshine version, what is she looking at? I live a state away and am trying to decide if I should move closer. She lives with my father, who dotes on her and my aunt who is a very good care taker. I have a family as well, with older children and one 15 year old. But she's my mama and the thought of not having her in the near future causes a real physical pain in my chest. If my time is has changed from \"if\" to \"when\" then I don't want to miss a second.",

      "Content": "Just wanted to say thank you for the responses to my thread. When I posted that, I was in a full on panic. I have since calmed a bit. I am sure I will repost at some point, but we are in a holding pattern while they do a molecular (?) study on the biopsies to see what kind of chemo works the best. She is supposed to hear something today. Again, thank you. It is greatly appreciated. LaedyG",

      "Content": "On December 27th, 2012 my mother moved on outta here. She fought very hard but at the end, she was so very tired and miserable. And for a while I was angry that she was taken so soon. But I have finally gotten to where I feel like she had completed her job and was invited to move on to her reward. In the aftermath, amongst all the grieving and loss, my dad and I have developed a relationship that I had always wanted. She would be so happy about that.",
