    "Content": "Hi All, I'm fairly new to this and I'm trying to figure out what to expect in the coming weeks / months as this is the first family member I've known who has dealt with cancer. My mother had surgery a few weeks ago to remove lymph nodes from around her breast. After a scan today, it turns out she has cancerous tumors in both breasts. Future results will show if the cancer has spread elsewhere. I know this forum won't give me answers but I'm finding it hard to function with fear of the unknown. She showed no symptoms up to this point and took our whole family by surprise. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Best, Robbie Preston",
