    "Content": "When I was 10 years old, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and survived. Now, 11 years later, the cancer returned. This time, I'm told it's breast cancer but it's in other parts of her body. I'm not sure how true that is, because my father sugarcoats stuff for me. I'm very hurt and worried. She's going through all of these tests and I'm honestly so scared. How can I get through this?",
