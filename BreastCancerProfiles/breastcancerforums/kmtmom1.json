    "Content": "I found a lump in my left breast 2 weeks ago. I am 29. Mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at 39. No gene. I went in for an u/s and mammo which showed only dense breast tissue. I had a breast MRI which showed an area of concern. 1.6cm close to the chest wall in the area I am feeling. It is said on the report to be asymmetrical and non mass like low level enhancement. Dr said the area had an increased blood flow. Does this sound like cancer? Not getting much info from the Dr. She just said we need to wait for the MRI guided biopsy, which is scheduled for Monday. Any advice or comments are greatly appreciated. Thank you",
