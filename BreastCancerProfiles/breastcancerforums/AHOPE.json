For 2 weeks ago I had a mammography and 3 hrs. later I was sent to another hospital for biopsies. What a pain and they already have told me I have breast cancer. I am scared, sad, cannot sleep and stil hopeing its only a nighmare and nothing real. But no. The countdown to surgery is start it. I have been told that surgery will last 4 hrs and there is unknown if I wake up with some breast or nothing. I need youe help to fight it. I am so scared. Wish you all long life and away from worries Ahope",

I am so scared and sad and empty of logical thinking. All what I do is crying. I will be thinking at you on Monday. You seem so strong to me. Good luck to you and God bless you Adriana",
