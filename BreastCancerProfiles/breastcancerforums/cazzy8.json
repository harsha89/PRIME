      "Content": "Hiya, i wrote on here a few months ago when mum was first told her diagnosis....but lots happened since then so thought i would update!! Mum had breast cancer 9yrs ago....and had RT for 4 weeks and a lumpectomy. Tamox for 5yrs and then discharged. All was going well till Jan 2009 after months of tests she was diagnosed 8th dec 2009 with terminal breast cancer. In liver,lungs and neck area, was given chemo so she had 5 or the 6 cycles but has had enough of being zapped of energy to have the last. Many trips to the oncoloygist later she has been told that the mets have decreased and that so far so good but he health isnt showing the same results. She is very weak, and breathless and down in her humour. The last visit from GP said he thought she was now in the decline. Yet the report from CT isnt saying the same. So at last visit to oncoloy i lost the plot a little, he then examined mum and he listened to her heart with a questioned face :-/ So we left with no more answers really but a list of scans for May, i think he must have slept on his conscience and then 2days later a call came from the oncologist and wanted mum to have a CT scan the next day. So we went along for full body CT which went well, then 2 days later a call from oncology ward asking mum to go for injections as she had multipul clots in her lungs. So i now give her thses once a day and she will continue to have them for the rest of her life. My concern is that she has the breathlessness due to the clots but the report shows the mets have shrunk and yet she is very tired, not able to do much as in lift washing out of the machine,hoover etc !! The district nurse came out to show me how to do a few injections first time, on leaving she took me outside and said that mum was on palative care now.....but why>? they did talk about hercptine on the last hosp visit as long as the echo gram on her heart shows ok which is on the 6th may. So why do the hosp tell you one thing.....and then your being seen by palative care district nurses, who actually said to mum that they would have to have a chat with mum in a few weeks about her wishes etc...! im soooo confused....help me please someone...to understand love Cazxxx",

      "Content": "Hiya Vee Thank you so much for your support, and good ideas it mean a lot Mum has tried the foods that slide down easy and a few of them she has really liked....custard,readybreak...to name a few. She did have bad spells of regurgitating things but that settled down loads, till this morning and she had a bad spell with that. She will mention to the GP tmro when he visits. I took her out in the car today for a drive just before it got dark as she hadn't even seen the towns xmas lights. She loved it, we were only out about an hour but thee did her good. I'm so pleased for you that you have had no problems since you had the drains. What i didn't put in the last post was its also in her membraine around her heart they said they could drain it but at the moment she isnt well enough. The GP told my brother and i when she was first diagnosed that it was very advanced, although he didn't give us any idea of time he showed his feelings about how we, her family, should be warned for a short illness. Anyway i will keep you upto date and thanks again for helping xxxx",

      "Content": "Hiya all, My mum had breast cancer 8yrs ago, she did not have it in her lymph glands and had 4 weeks radio and tamox for 5yrs. All was well until jan this year, she got a cough that would not go away. In march after lots of antibiotics she got worse. They sent her to a chest doc who did an xray which was clear and he gave her an inhaler to see if this helped. Then in august she returned to chest doc....but still everything looked fine....and even bloods came back clear. All the time her voice was getting really crockie and she was choking from time to time. So in november she went to see an ENT doc who looked up her nose into her throat and he saw that he larynx was paralysed on the right side. She asked him straight out if he thought it was cancer, he said he could not say so yet more waiting. She was sent for scan of her throat which came back inconclusive...so she had to return for another full body scan and a needle asperastion in her neck as it had a large lump. When the radiologist went to do the needle he said he need to go look at the scan..on returning he asked if he could scan mums side...all this didn't bode well we thought. Finally her GP popped to see her and told her the needle showed cancer cells but he had no more info as the people at the hosp were going to have a MDT meeting about her...so yet again waiting game. This is so stressful as each day she was getting worse, really breathless,not eating at all,tired,reflux and many more. So we finally went to the hosp to see the oncologist on the 8th dec and we were told her cancer was terminal, she has it in her lung,liver,soft tissue and throat. She asked them how long but they could not tell her, she said 2months? or 6yrs? they said they hoped 2 but 6yrs was a bit optomistic!! From seeing no one to then going to full on care was very scary as you think are they trying to tell us she has days. She saw district nurse,pallativecare nurse,GP comes to see her every tuesday and friday. They talked her through chemo options and she had her first one last monday, the only effects so far is feeling weaker...but no sickness..she also seen the wig lady last week as they said she would loose her hair very quick. They have put her on heaps of tablets for heaps of different things and some of them are really helping. She has been told to eat what ever she likes although she has a few bites and throws the rest out as it dosnt taste right. She thinks its funny that she can eat cake as she has a cholestrol issue which they have now said isnt an issue bless her. She is really upbeat around us..so i owe her the same respect back...when i get in the car to drive home i cry buckets but never infront or her. She has gone really child like, its almost like the roll has reveresed, she askes me questions all the time, and needs me to help her write things. She has sorted her funeral already and wrote in all her xmas cards that it would be her last Well i feel like i have gone on a bit....so sorry for the essay it's just great to get it down and off my chest. I'm 40 mum is 72 and she has 6 grandchildren ages 18-8 so she is well loved and we are all looking after her. Bye for now Caz xx",
