      "Content": "My husband's mother (age 59) had removal of ducts and \"core\" of breast in April and was recently diagnosed w primarily/DCIS, but pathology found one cell of IDC. She is scheduled for a mastectomy this month. During surgery they will test lymph notes to see if there is invasion there but doctor seems relatively confident at this point it is contained. She has had pain in both breasts, but orginial surgery was prompted by bloody discharge from one breast. Since her ductal removal she is now experiencing pain under her armpit (same side as ductal removal). She isn't sure if she should talk to her surgeon about it or not. Is this something she should be worried about prior to surgery? She is under the impression that once surgery has been conducted cancer has a greater tendency to spread? I'm just looking for some information I might share with her from others who have been there. I would appreciate any response so I can perhaps ease her fears or provide some reassurance. In addition, she is concerned about chemo treatments and side effects impacting her quality of life. I tried telling her that today's treatments are much more tolerable than in years past.",

      "Content": "I feel like I was just here yesterday regarding my husband's step-mother and now I'm here again regarding my husband's mother. My mother-in-law had discharge/bleeding from her nipple. Mammogram showed no masses. Surgeon removed all 22 of her ducts and the \"core\" of her breast but thought after surgery the biopsy would come back negative for cancer. Yesterday he called and seemed surprised to report the results were positive for cancer. She has an appointment later to discuss the details of her results. My question is, does anyone have any experience regarding this type of presentation or what type of cancer it likely is based on the symptoms?",
