      "Content": "Cay, I am so sorry about your delay in diagnosis. How terribly frustrating. I am in the U.S. As it turns out, my diagnosis was incorrect. The way I found that out was that I had been referred to a general surgeon at the hospital where I was diagnosed. It is a top-100 hospital and he is the chief surgeon at the hospital But while he does a lot of breast surgery, he wasn't solely a breast surgeon. Given that this was such an unusual condition I wanted someone whose entire focus was breasts. I took my pathology slides, films and written diagnosis to a teaching hospital that had several superb breast surgeons. The radiologist, pathologist and surgeon at hospital #2 overruled the initial diagnosis. They suspect I probably had milk of calcium (harmless). But they could not know for sure since it had been aspirated and absorbed during the core biopsy. As the biopsy was originally done due to a followup mammogram and sonogram showing microcalcifications that were BIRADS 4 (too suspicious looking to take a \"wait and see\" approach) the milk of calcium theory makes more sense. So, I'm afraid I'm not able to be any help, Cay. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Now that you're diagnosed you're on the way to recovery. Hang in there. Jenifer",
