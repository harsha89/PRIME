      "Content": "Just a few days ago I noticed my left breast was slightly larger than the other and was red just on the outside edge of the areola. There is a lump that you can feel with the softest touch of your finger. The lump is sore, but does not hurt to where a bra. I am worried, I am just 23 years old and have a 5 year old daughter. Noone in my family has ever had breast cancer. Please help me ease my mine.",
