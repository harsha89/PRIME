    "Content": "Hello to all. My mother, who is from Greece, was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer last year. She's been through chemo and radiation and fighting it all quite well. During her last visit to her oncologist, I asked my mother's oncologist about summer vacations and told him about her fears of leaving the city and going away to a Greek island which can't fully accommodate any special needs she may have, he told me about an idea he and some of his colleagues have been pondering on for quite some time. He told me to imagine a hotel which allows visitors who have undergone cancer treatment of any kind and are: a) in remission b) ending sessions of chemo or radiation therapy c) are able to travel and continue their treatment while combining holidays in Greece. The hotel itself would have: 1) Luxurious rooms for patients and their family members 2) Specialists from all over the world who would be in constant contact with visitors' personal oncologists and able to carry out any task required. 3) State-of-the-art equipment so as to allow on-the-spot prognosis of any type and have the patients' own doctors notified immediately of any alteration. 4) Lobbies where visitors from all over the globe can share their experiences (just like they do through these forums) face to face with translators available round the clock. 5) And why not some excursions to Ancient sites or wonderful beaches under the Mediterranean sun. He said it's just an idea now, but if people show interest it could materialise very quickly with International subsidizing and volunteer work. I for one would be the first to apply for the receptionist desk . He asked me to ask around and see how much interest in this idea there is. So I'm setting up this poll:",
