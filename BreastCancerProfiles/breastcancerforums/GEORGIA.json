    "Content": "Hello Sharon: My name is Georgia and Nancy tells me that you are having problems with your Taxol. I took Taxol in 2000, and at that time I was given 12 weeks worth of it. Once every Friday I went for my treatment. I never got sick to my stomach, just very tired. I did however, have rashes that occured on my arms and legs. Not as bad as hives,but it still itched. I used some tree tea cream on the rash, smells awful but it seemed to calm the itch. Taxol also made me lose my hair a second time. It had started to grow back during my rads and keep growing through out my Taxol Treatment until the very last dose. My Doctor gave me a double dose and the next day the hair started to come out. Taxol, for me was easier than my A/C. If you would like to email anytime that would be Ok. (((HUGS))) Georgia dx 9/99 mast. lobular 7cm 9+ a/c rads taxol 12 weeks tamoxifen 4 years Lymphedema",
