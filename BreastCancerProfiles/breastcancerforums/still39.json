      "Content": "I'm new to the forum and hope someone can help me sort out this dilemna I seem to be in. I spent 3 hours the other day having my mammogram and ultrasound. The Radiologist spent a good hour with me as well. She said I have mass on top of mass in both breasts. My doctor called me today to confirm I need to see a breast surgeon a.s.a.p. and I have an appointment Dec. 11. My doctor did say with all the areas that need to be biopsied, I may not have much breast tissue left over. Mastectomies? I don't know. 10 years ago I had biopsies in both breasts with just atypical hyperplasia as the result. But now I'm not sure what to think. Should I be nervous of the outcome being something more than atypia? Am I blowing this out of proportion? How do I keep reminding myself to breathe?",
