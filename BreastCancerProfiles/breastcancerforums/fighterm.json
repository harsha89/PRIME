      "Content": "The result depends on the many factors like if the tumor is immunogenic, in other words, attracts a lot of cytotoxic T cells. Some tumors are invisible to them as tumors are our own cells. But if the tumor cells are very abnormal they might become visible and T cells might infiltrate the tumor and start killing it. However, cancer has a way to deactivate them so the pd1 inhibitors reactivate them back. Most people don't report any side effects, maybe some tiredness, but few people had strong side effects and had to stop. PD1 inhibitors (opdivo and keytruda) are very effective in bladder cancer, kidney cancer, melanoma and lung cancer. The PD-L1 inhibitors are also in trials (from Roche and some others). They prevent inactivation of T cells by inhibiting the substrate of PD1 that is expressed on tumor cells.",

The good thing is that your family member goes to Sloan, they are the NCI designated center and are on top of all breakthroughs. I will give you some good news. The biggest breakthrough in cancer is immunotherapy. I imagine first type of treatment will be chemo/radio and it will give some relief for some time, but if the cancer returns and nothing works, then the best bet is to get into clinical trials for immunotherapy. They are doing miracles for some patients and the more researchers understand how it works, the more people will benefit. Just google immunotherapy and learn about it.
