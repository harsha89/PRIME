      "Content": "Good morning friends. I previously posted and was concerned as to why my doctor moved my appointment to go over PET results. I went on Wednesday and she went over all the results with me. They were; Hypermetabolic right supraclavicular lymph node, as well as, a chain of hypermetabolic lymph nodes within the right paratracheal region indicative of metastatic disease. Mild FDG avidity within the 1 cm right posterior apical pulmonary nodule concerning for malignancy. Sclerotic density within the left pedicle of C7 (series 5, image 105) without associated hypermetabolic activity. Finding is likely indicative of a bone island, however, cannot exclude possible osseous metastasis. Obviously I am pretty concerned. She still says it COULD be infection but the word metastasis seems to be showing up ALOT in the radiologist's report. I had a bronchoscopy yesterday for them to biopsy a couple of lymph nodes. I am awaiting results anxiously. To me, it sounds as if the cancer is likely back. I know no one on here is a doctor but has anyone gotten results that is \"indicative of metastatic disease\" that was something as simple as infection? Also, if it is stage 4 breast cancer now - does that make me eligible for disability? I do not know how I will continue to work if I am going through chemo.",

      "Content": "Hello all...I was diagnosed with breast cancer in February of 2014. I completed chemo and had a bilateral mastectomy and was told I was cured. There was no lymph node involvement so it was assumed that I was one of the lucky ones. Well, in October I was seen in ER for chest pain and they found a lung nodule and some ground glass opacities in my lung. I was then referred to a Pulmonologist and she said she was not too concerned because lung nodules could be anything but, of course because of my history, she scheduled me for a PET scan. She also told me that if it DID light up then she would recommend a pneumonectomy because of the location and my history - she did not want to take chances. Today they called to ask me to come in on Wednesday to discuss the findings. My follow up was already scheduled for the 7th but they want me in now on Wednesday - in 2 days. I was expecting a call saying all clear but this has me pretty concerned. Do doctors usually give the all is well results over the phone? My fear is that it is bad news that they want to tell me face to face. I am a single mother of three children and I really do not want to fight this monster again!!!",
