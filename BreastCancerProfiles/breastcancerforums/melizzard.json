    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I was diagnosed, 6 and 7 years ago (one for each side) with Stage IIIa infiltrating lobular carcinoma, at the age of 39. I was ER/PR+, Her2neu -, 8 of 10 nodes +. I had chemo, stem cell transplant, and rads to both sides of my chest. I was pre-menopausal at diagnosis, but the high-dose chemo (stem cell transplant) killed my ovaries. I've been working with my brother, who is an internet research geek, on a project consolidating internet resources, for specific topics, into one guide ... in other words, doing the searching so the folks interested in specific topics don't have to. We're doing several of these, but the first one was a breast cancer internet guide (for obvious personal reasons! LOL). We finally launched it yesterday afternoon. I would be honored if you would check it out and let me know what you think! You ladies are the real litmus test for it! We have posted to this, and other, breast cancer forums for feedback. For the next two weeks, ending Nov 16, we will be incorporating your suggestions. We'll make the changes, based on your recommendations, and let you know what we have done. http://www.nichehikersguide.com/Brea...astcancer.html Thank you, so much, for helping make this resource into an invaluable tool! Please email your feedback to me at [emailÂ protected] xxoo Melissa",
