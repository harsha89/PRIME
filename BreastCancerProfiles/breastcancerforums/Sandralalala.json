      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. I had a mastectomey end of April, started treatments in in late may. Had 4 a/c chemo treatments which ended in August on the 11th. I've been randomized into a clinical trial. I will be taking exemestane for 5 years. I've also been getting the triptorelin shot. I will be getting that shot until december and then am planning to have ovaries out. Anyone taking exemestane right now. What type of side effects have you been experiencing. Also after chemo how long does it take for your hair to start growing back. Sandralalala[/i]",
