    "Content": "Hi, I have actually posted my first post in the forum introductions section but now I have had a look I think that was the whole cancer forum section not just the breast cancer section which is what I have. Well I say it's what I have but it's DCIS so non invasive but I have still had to have a mastectomy & am awaiting the results. I did have one set of results come back that just told me what I already knew that I had DCIS and it's 100-110mm. At this stage I don't know if I have to have any further treatment, my lymph nodes came back clear which is great but the report did say they were awaiting further results as lympovascular invasion may be present. If this is the case again I don't know what they will offer me treatment wise so even though I have had the operation is still all A bit worrying and I hate waiting for results. Would be interested to speak to anyone that has had the same or similar diagnosis. I have also started a blog which really helps, it may not be of interest to anyone and I'm not great at writing so it's not brilliant but I have been writing as I think things and find it helps a lot to Do this. The address for that is http://lauraloo25.wordpress.com/2013...rt-of-my-blog/ Thanks",
