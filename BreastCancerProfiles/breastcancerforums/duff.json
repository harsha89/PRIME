      "Content": "Hi all, I woke up this morning with a huge rash just underneath the areola of my left breast. It is not quite a rash per se; more like snakeskin or damaged skin that is healing after being badly burned. There are also creases in the skin, not unlike a deflated balloon. A dull, throbbing pain accompanies the rash, although I suspect my hyper-awareness of its' presence may have something to do with the ache. There seems to be clusters of broken veins underneath the area in question. The breast is not swollen and both breasts are secreting something white. The secretion is so light that the only reason I know of it is that my black bra is slightly stained (like a thin dust) when I take it off at night. I really hope someone will take the time out to answer this as I'm quite worried.",
