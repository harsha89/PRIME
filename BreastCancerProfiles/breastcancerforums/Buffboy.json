      "Content": "Hi guys, A friend of mine is currently at Royal North Shore Hospital for suspected metastatic breast cancer (hip, spine, liver). Is this a top-notch treatment facility? Any other recommendations in Sydney area? So far it seems to me that she is in good hands, but wanted to check with the experts (aka you guys)!",

      "Content": "Thanks CM for the reassuring words about North Shore. However, the theory now is that it is NOT the skin cancer (which she has a history of) but rather breast cancer, which has metastasized. So no skin cancer. But I guess Royal North Shore is still a solid facility for breast cancer as well?",
