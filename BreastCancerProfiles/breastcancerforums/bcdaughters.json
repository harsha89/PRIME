      "Content": "I am a Doctoral Candidate at Fordham University and I am completing my dissertation on the experience of being a daughter of a woman with breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of the mother-daughter relationship on how the daughter copes and her emotional health. The results of this study will help to develop interventions to improve the daughter's adjustment to this stressor and her adherence to screening. Participants must: ¨ Be an adult daughter (18 or older) of a woman with breast cancer, and ¨ Have a mother who was diagnosed no more than 1 year ago who is living. Participation will take 30-45 minutes and involves completing several surveys over the internet or by mail. All information will be confidential. A donation of $1 will be donated to a breast cancer organization for every woman who participates. To participate, please contact: Jodi Potere at (201) 248-7361 or [email protected] or cut and paste the link below: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=568662009744 Thank you for your support!

      "Content": "Ruthiema, thanks so much for responding to my post. Sorry I am delayed in writing back, I was out of town. Yes, I would love it if you could pass on the information about my study to your daughter. That is exactly what I was hoping forum participants would do!!! Unfortunately, my study only focuses on daughters (not husbands) because there is less research on daughters at this time and I felt they were a vulnerable population who needed to be investigated. I think my study will be helpful to your daughter as many participants have told me that it has been beneficial to have the opportunity to reflect and express what they are feeling about the experience. I hope your husband (as well as yourself) can find the same sort of outlet (research or support group). I wish you and your family good health!! Thanks again, Jodi",

They may wish to participate however I was diagnosed in 3/17/05, just over 1 year ago. let me know if they could still help. God bless and be well......Jill Sorry for the delayed response. Sure your 18 and 19 y/o daughters can participate anyway. i will likely expand the parameters because I am having a hard time meeting my goal. I am close but not there yet! To everyone else, this study is still active! Thanks for your help! Jodi",
