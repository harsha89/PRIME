      "Content": "Hi Marion, My daughter will be taking her boards in Nov this year up at The Atlantic Veterinary School in Prince Edward Island CA. She has her horse up there on a farm with her. She wants to specialize in Equine. She has been riding since she has been 5. It was a hard year last year when I got diagnosed she wanted to take a year off to come home and be with me because I live alone. I convinced her to continue her life and some close friends helped w/treatments, unlimited phone service and the airlines helped her feel connected also after chemo, b/4 rad. I turned 50 and got depressed I booked trip to Cozumel Mx and we celebrated a new improved way of life there. It was great. We have been talking about Europe since she was in High School. Enjoy your trip. How long are you going for? What part of Europe are you planning on seeing? Share some of your adventures with me when you return my email address is [emailÂ protected]. It is a great feeling to be a done deal and move on. LOL Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Girls, Congrats on completion of chemo that is huge. It was for me I finished Feb.15 and rads a month ago. You feelings are normal I go from feeling on top of the world to tears at times for no reason. Just releasing the fears of this dreaded dis-ease. I look at my treatments as a done deal we cant live in the past or we miss out on today. There is no guarantys for anyone in life. I just finished a great book by David Simon, MD called Return to Wholeness (embracing body,mind, and spirit in the face of Cancer) foreword by my favorite author Deepak Chopra MD. I highly recommend it also has alot of suggestions about going thru treatments. I also release my fears by just being outside walking, gardening, hiking and do daily reiki and weekly yoga. I start back full time to work this week after almost 7 months that will be a challenge. To me the Radiation was a piece of cake compared towards the chemo. I did feel more fatigue but the doctor told me she thought it was cumulative from the chemo. The hospital I went to gave free weekly reiki, ask if they do and try some. LOL Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone,I need some advice on trying to find a natual product for helping with hot flashes. I found this in the health food store. My doctor had never heard of it and said if it didnt have any estrogen based bi-products it would be fine to try, but she knew nothing about it. She suggested effexor if I dont come up with another solution. I will be returning to work in a couple of weeks so I am trying to get this under control. I walk everyday but intent to exercise more once I can get more energy. I was told exercise helps. Just finished my last booster dose of radiation yesterday, what a great feeling to be done treatment. Strange thing now that I have had BC, and my hair is so, so short, so many people have come up to me that are BC survivors. One of my nurses at a place I had moles removed is a 17year survivor, another 14years and last was 2years. That was just last week. We do all need to band together to fight this horrible monster and stop it. Places like this are a good place to start, thanks for your help, God Bless, Hugs Susan",

My doctor had no information good or bad on it. Maybe I will try to exercise more first, Good luck in Talledega , (is that a race ? ) Also, you are such a positive person I am sure the results will be fine, I wonder do we ever get past the worry and uncertainity of this dis-ease. My next checkups are not until August, then have 3 in a roll. Take care and have fun. Susan",

My oncologist did not believe in vitamins or supplements so I started juicing and ate real good . My radiologist suggest a womans one a day. My concern is that I am not taking in enough calcium. I just turned 50 the chemo put me in menopause and I believe that depletes your calcium. I do have a cup of yogurt and milk in cereal or at times I have a glass and eat cheese. Also I do eat healthy but do you get all the vitamins you need from food. My reiki master who is also a holistic nurse, does not believe we do unless you get fresh veggies everyday from garden which at this time of year is not possible. PS. Reiki is wonderful, made a huge difference for me going thru chemo. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

I had alot of fun pounding on that drum , chanting and dancing. You have to try it sometime it was not what I expected. Alot of positive, strong, energy. I know what you mean about the light at the end of the tunnel, I am excited now that my eyelashes are growing back, funny that I didnt miss them when they were gone. It has been 7 weeks since my last chemo my hair seems to be taking its time alot of peach fuzz. does any one know how long it does take to grow back?
