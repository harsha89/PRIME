She wants to specialize in Equine. She has been riding since she has been 5. It was a hard year last year when I got diagnosed she wanted to take a year off to come home and be with me because I live alone. I convinced her to continue her life and some close friends helped w/treatments, unlimited phone service and the airlines helped her feel connected also after chemo, b/4 rad. I turned 50 and got depressed I booked trip to Cozumel Mx and we celebrated a new improved way of life there. It was great. We have been talking about Europe since she was in High School. Enjoy your trip. How long are you going for? What part of Europe are you planning on seeing? Share some of your adventures with me when you return my email address is [emailÂ protected]. It is a great feeling to be a done deal and move on. LOL Susan",

You feelings are normal I go from feeling on top of the world to tears at times for no reason. Just releasing the fears of this dreaded dis-ease. I look at my treatments as a done deal we cant live in the past or we miss out on today. There is no guarantys for anyone in life. I just finished a great book by David Simon, MD called Return to Wholeness (embracing body,mind, and spirit in the face of Cancer) foreword by my favorite author Deepak Chopra MD. I highly recommend it also has alot of suggestions about going thru treatments. I also release my fears by just being outside walking, gardening, hiking and do daily reiki and weekly yoga. I start back full time to work this week after almost 7 months that will be a challenge. To me the Radiation was a piece of cake compared towards the chemo. I did feel more fatigue but the doctor told me she thought it was cumulative from the chemo. The hospital I went to gave free weekly reiki, ask if they do and try some. LOL Susan",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone,I need some advice on trying to find a natual product for helping with hot flashes. I found this in the health food store. My doctor had never heard of it and said if it didnt have any estrogen based bi-products it would be fine to try, but she knew nothing about it. She suggested effexor if I dont come up with another solution. I will be returning to work in a couple of weeks so I am trying to get this under control. I walk everyday but intent to exercise more once I can get more energy. I was told exercise helps. Just finished my last booster dose of radiation yesterday, what a great feeling to be done treatment. Strange thing now that I have had BC, and my hair is so, so short, so many people have come up to me that are BC survivors. One of my nurses at a place I had moles removed is a 17year survivor, another 14years and last was 2years. That was just last week. We do all need to band together to fight this horrible monster and stop it. Places like this are a good place to start, thanks for your help, God Bless, Hugs Susan",

I am trying to look at this as good b/c it is one on my arm that to me looked normal but was a bit raised. Quick question wouldnt the chemo affect that also?

      "Content": "Hi Kristen and AtlaskaAngel, Thanks for the advise at least I now have an idea on what to shoot for. I just felt I needed more than one a day. I do drink milk, eat yogurt and cheese, so I will probably start with 600 w/d, I just came home from a healing drum circle (vibrational energy). I had alot of fun pounding on that drum , chanting and dancing. You have to try it sometime it was not what I expected. Alot of positive, strong, energy. I know what you mean about the light at the end of the tunnel, I am excited now that my eyelashes are growing back, funny that I didnt miss them when they were gone. It has been 7 weeks since my last chemo my hair seems to be taking its time alot of peach fuzz. does any one know how long it does take to grow back? Thanks for the advice and support . love and hugs",

      "Content": "Hi Leo thanks for the reply do you know what the standard amount of cacium is for a 50 year old woman that just finished chemo. I cant seem to get a straight answer from anyone. Also went in to have moles checked to have off last week do not want anything that could lead to cancer on my body.Most are scheduled to come off the end of month but one was questionable and I am again going to a cancer specialist to have ck today. I am trying to look at this as good b/c it is one on my arm that to me looked normal but was a bit raised. Quick question wouldnt the chemo affect that also? Just hard to be seeing the end in site too have to think about this now. Thanks again for the reply.",
