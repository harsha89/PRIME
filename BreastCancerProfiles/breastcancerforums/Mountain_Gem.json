    "Content": "Hi! I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in December. I also have a bunch of DCIS so I did some researching. In fact, in the beginning I misunderstood and thought that was all I had. I recommend this site: LINK REMOVED AS PER FORUM POLICY They have lots of info. articles and a great forum that includes areas for women with DCIS. You can also look it up under \"stage zero breast cancer.\" I did find out that lots of women with DCIS never go on to develop cancer, but if yours is high grade I would really do some major research on this. Good luck! If anyone wants the link then please PM this poster.",
