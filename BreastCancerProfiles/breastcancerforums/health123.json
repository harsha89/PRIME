    "Content": "Thanks for such a nice website. I new to this forum. while searching internet i know about this forum. I want to know, I got blister in my breast just 9 th month back.After few days pus come out from it. I consult doctor he says that is due to fungal infection.He give antibiotics and an anti fungal ointment. when i stopped medicine the blister appears again.when i consult him again he said the tissue of that portion has to be removed and told me for biopsy. Then I consult with another surgeon he said that it is hormonal disease.I feed my son upto 2 years and he is now 3 years old. He also give ointment and told this cant be completely cure. My question is there any possibility of cancer.",
