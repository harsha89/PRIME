      "Content": "Thank you so much Rachel. Your words are reassuring. I will work up the courage to visit a gynecologist soon..You calmed me down a lot and I think that I was being irrational. All the same I understand it's important to have someone like a gyno to ask when problems occur. About my classmate..she died on Friday. It was a brain tumour and they gave up on treatment some months ago. I'm so angry about it. I don't know why. I didn't know her that well, but she was a very good friend of one of mine and we had a lesson together so I do know that she was so nice and funny. I'm really worried about my friend..how she's going to deal with the grief. I feel a little selfish because she wasn't a great friend of mine and so I wonder if it's even my place to be affected. Like when people at school would ask her friends all about it just to know the details. I hate that so much. I don't know if it's even that big a deal, but I always thought it was so insensitive - why be so interested in her now when you never spoke before? I'm rambling and I think because of that it's really just dawning on me whats happened. I keep remembering what she was like and when we would talk or whatever. On saturday night all that was going through my head were swear words and desires to knock something out with my fist or foot. I just want to tell my friend that I love her, but I can't imagine dealing with the death of a best friend. Does she even want people butting in and trying to talk to her? We go to different schools now so I don't know when I'll see her if I don't make the effort. Ok I've said enough..and I'm really sorry for writing so much.",

      "Content": "Hi! I'm posting for the first time - I hope it's Ok that I began a new post. I'm only 16 and I just wanted some information on a couple things. I don't have cancer, but I'd like to be aware...a girl in my class is, um..well, she has 2 weeks. Maybe that's why I'm wondering.. What is your breast supposed to feel like? I noticed that mid-way down on the side nearest the rib-cage mine felt a little harder underneath some tissue (I'm probably using very incorrect terms). It's on both of them so I suppose it must be normal, but more on the right. I also have some discharge. Well I've never seen it liquid. It's a small amount - I discover small yellow-y scab like bits on my nipples occasionally. It's pretty infrequent, but consistently so. I was researching symptoms and read that dappling (or something) was one and I was wondering what this means? Is there a way that your skin would look? I don't really know, but is 16 too young to have breast cancer? Sorry if I'm being silly about this. And I think it's great that there is a place like this. It's very inspirational.",
