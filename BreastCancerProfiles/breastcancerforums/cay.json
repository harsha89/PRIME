    "Content": "Hi Wray, It's too bad that we both have this disease, but it is wonderful to connect with someone who shares the experience. My breast fibromatosis appears to originate in the chest wall and although I had my first visible symptoms in Oct/04, my diagnosis was only confirmed in August/05...a sort of tragicomedy of errors, neglect, and total inexperience on the part members of the medical system here has determined that it is now Nov/05 and I am still waiting for surgical and/or other treatment and have only had an excisional biopsy, with tumor extending to all of the margins of the excised tissue. When I first learned that I had such a rare disease I proceeded to learn everything I could about it, as I have had a rare disease before in our medical system and until I learned a lot about that one and so knew enough to basically leave the system no choice but to focus on my illness, I had no useful help at all and lots of time and money was wasted plus my illness went on far longer than it should have and left me with residual effects that might never have been with more prompt attention. Despite my learning this go 'round, things have still been extraordinarily slow, although it finally looks as if the fog is clearing. What country are you in and how does your medical system work for you? Where are you in the treatment process? Look forward to hearing more about your experience... Cay",
