      "Content": "Hi, it's me again with another question! I talked to my regular family doc about what the oncologist told me about needing a hysterectomy or radiation to my ovaries or taking a pill every three months since I'm not post-menopausal. She was pretty upset that the oncologist just \"overlooked\" that fact and didn't give me any info about it. Then she said, I could probably have an oophorectomy -- which she said means having just my ovaries removed. Has anybody out there done that? She also advised against having radiation on my ovaries to stop estrogen production because she said she's seen some severe problems with that -- such as the bowels attaching to each other. Anybody know anything about that? Also, how do I contact one of the docs on this forum? Advice, suggestions, help.... please! Thanks, Pam Marra",

Doctor prescribed Armidex, but after I did some research on my own, I found that both it and tamoxifen are for post-menopausal women, which I'm not. When I called the doctor about it, he said, \"Oh, I wasn't aware that you weren't through menopause (which I know I did tell him - twice!). So he says \"Well, you need to have a hysterectomy or radiation to your ovaries or we can give you a pill every three months to induce menopause). I find this hard to believe! I'm sure there's a lot of women out there much younger than me who have had breast cancer but didn't have to be \"manually\" forced through menopause!
