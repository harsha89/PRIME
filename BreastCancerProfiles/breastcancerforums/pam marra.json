      "Content": "Hi, it's me again with another question! I talked to my regular family doc about what the oncologist told me about needing a hysterectomy or radiation to my ovaries or taking a pill every three months since I'm not post-menopausal. She was pretty upset that the oncologist just \"overlooked\" that fact and didn't give me any info about it. Then she said, I could probably have an oophorectomy -- which she said means having just my ovaries removed. Has anybody out there done that? She also advised against having radiation on my ovaries to stop estrogen production because she said she's seen some severe problems with that -- such as the bowels attaching to each other. Anybody know anything about that? Also, how do I contact one of the docs on this forum? Advice, suggestions, help.... please! Thanks, Pam Marra",

      "Content": "I'm only 49 and just completed 6 weeks of radiation for a small breast cancer tumor. Doctor prescribed Armidex, but after I did some research on my own, I found that both it and tamoxifen are for post-menopausal women, which I'm not. When I called the doctor about it, he said, \"Oh, I wasn't aware that you weren't through menopause (which I know I did tell him - twice!). So he says \"Well, you need to have a hysterectomy or radiation to your ovaries or we can give you a pill every three months to induce menopause). I find this hard to believe! I'm sure there's a lot of women out there much younger than me who have had breast cancer but didn't have to be \"manually\" forced through menopause! I have placed calls to other cancer organizations to get some answers, but I haven't gotten any response yet. Has anybody encountered this situation? Any advice? Any suggestions on who else to call?

      "Content": "Hey, everyone! Thanks for getting back to me on my question. I have tried all the cancer associations, the Y-Me hotline and other docs, but this is the first time anyone has told me anything that half-way makes sense. I handled the initial diagnosis really well and went through radiation pretty smoothly. But this other stuff has me a little frustrated. It's scary to think had I not done my own research, I wouldn't even have known I shouldn't be on the prescribed med or that I needed to do something about shutting down my ovaries. It makes me wonder what else the doctor didn't tell me that will be a problem down the road. Please keep writing and if you think of any more advice -- I'm all ears. Thanks Pam",
