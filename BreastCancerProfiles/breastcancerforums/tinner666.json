      "Content": "Lopectomy, radical or double redical? We're at the crossroad now. Could do with some opinions from people that have been there. Wife won't participate. Personally, I think go with the double, the reconstructive. Then, we need input on which reconstructive would be best. I guess her decision will rest on me, so I'll get all the flack, no matter which way we go. I wonder if I'm even asking the questions she wants answered, but hasn't bothered asking. Anyway, ANY and ALL input will be apprectiated.",

      "Content": "Just thought I would share this. Hope it helps somebody. After being diagnosed last year, dbl. mast., lots of chemo, she's considered 'free' and ready for plastic surgery and a new outlook. We went to see the surgeon today. He looked at the wife's chart to refresh his memory. Asked a few questions. Got down to the nitty gritty; \"You had a double masectomy?\" \"Yes\" \"You're getting reconstruction?\" \"Yes.\" \"Both breasts?\" \"??????\" I said \" It looks like we have to pick either a left or a right?\" doc \"huh?????????????????\" Wife \" I quess I could just get one in the middle.\" doc \"Huh?????????????\" Me \" Well, since we're looking at alternatives, maybe we could also get a pair on her back so I have something to do when hugging her\" doc \"Huh??????????????\" Real blank look on his face. The nusres were still laughing when we left an hour later.",
