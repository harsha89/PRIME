    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am new to the forum and am trying to get some information for my sister. She HAD breast cancer and has now past the five year mark and coming off medications. Three cheers and pray that will be the end. My question is she is very overweight and obviously that is not a good thing for breast or heart as she has some issues with that too. She also is diabetic. All her numbers are good sugar, cholesterol etc. but the weight is the issue. She eats good food but I know she is a sugar holic and that isn't good for anyone. I spoke with her last night and she told me that she feels almost good about the weight (probably excess of 60-70 lbs) because she sees it as a healthy sign. She told me even if she loses the weight intentionally she will think she has cancer again. This is psychological. I asked her if she talked to her doctor about it and all he said was they could do gastric bypass. I feel that is a flip way of solving a problem. Does anyone know anyone with a similar situation. It is true that losing weight we feel we are unhealthy but she cannot separate the two. Thank you to anyone who can have some sound advice.",
