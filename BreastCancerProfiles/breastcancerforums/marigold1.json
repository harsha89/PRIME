    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm 27 and just spent the last 2 months going through breast cancer diagnostics. I came out with a benign diagnosis which I HOPE I can count on. They did a core biopsy without imaging so they warned about sampling error. That scared me as now I'm wondering if I've been misdiagnosed. Within the first few weeks of finding my lump, I began to have dull pain in my upper back near my spine, mostly at night. I didn't think much of it since I was under stress and sleeping in weird positions. The pain persisted but was not constant or severe. I've started to experience pain in my right shoulder (where the lump is). It's also not constant but has become more frequent than before. It can be pretty sharp too which I find very uncomfortable but I still wouldn't call it severe. Occasionally, I will feel the pain on my left side or my upper back. Today, I feel some pain on my ribs and my upper leg. It's important to note that none of these symptoms existed before finding the breast lump. I've also undergone some serious stress and anxiety. My symptoms have been present off and on for a little under 2 months. I'm scared. Apparently I don't have breast cancer but these pain symptoms are so upsetting. I can't celebrate my good news feeling like this. Is it even good news? Does this sound like bone or lung mets? I'm terrified of seeing a doctor for this and going through more diagnostics. I thought this was over after my breast results. HELP!",
