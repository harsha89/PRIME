      "Content": "Dr. Leo (and Muttsmom), Thanks to both of you for your repies. If you will re-read my original question, I state that I had a partial hysterectomy in 1985, so I haven't had a period since then! I do still have my ovaries, however, so my concern is with hormonal output by my ovaries, since my cancer was hormone-responsive. The problem is precisely that I cannot tell by presence or absence of periods whether or not I'm in menopause; therefore, I'm wondering if it's necessary for me, in my particular situation, to have hormone testing to determine if I'm menopausal, or is my oncologist correct in telling me that I'm most certainly menopausal because of my age and becuase I've been through treatment? Thanks again in advance for your reply, Dr. Leo. Liza",

      "Content": "Dr. Leo, Thank you for this web site. I'm a 54 yr old woman who was dx w/ stage 1, grade 3, ER/PR+, Her2/neu positive (via FISH) IDC in 10/04. I had lumpectomy w/ SNB, then dose-dense chemo (4 A/C and 4 Taxol/Herceptin) and 35 tx of rads, which I finished 8 wks ago. I'm on Herceptin still, for a yr total, and started Arimidex a month ago. I had a hysterectomy (uterus only removed due to adenomyosis) in 1985 and was on Estratest from 1995-10/04. My oncologist tells me that, without a doubt (and without any kind of testing) I'm menopausal now, because of my age and because of chemo, and don't need an oophorectomy. Is he right about that or do I need hormone testing for an absolute determination? (My mom was 52 at menopause). Also, through my research, it looks like Alprostadil might be an effective treatment for FSD for us hormoneless BC survivors...is Alprostadil safe for me and is it available yet or still awaiting FDA approval? If available, is it contraindicated with my meds (Arimidex, Coumadin and Cymbalta for depression)? Thanks for your help, Liza",

      "Content": "Dr. Leo, I previously posted a question on this thread, which you answered. The following is the original post: Thank you for this web site. I'm a 54 yr old woman who was dx w/ stage 1, grade 3, ER/PR+, Her2/neu positive (via FISH) IDC in 10/04. I had lumpectomy w/ SNB, then dose-dense chemo (4 A/C and 4 Taxol/Herceptin) and 35 tx of rads, which I finished 8 wks ago. I'm on Herceptin still, for a yr total, and started Arimidex a month ago.

My oncologist tells me that, without a doubt (and without any kind of testing) I'm menopausal now, because of my age and because of chemo, and don't need an oophorectomy. Is he right about that or do I need hormone testing for an absolute determination? (My mom was 52 at menopause).

If available, is it contraindicated with my meds (Arimidex, Coumadin and Cymbalta for depression)? Thanks for your help, Liza______ Now I have another question. I spoke to my gynecologist's nurse about getting an FSH test and a Serum Estradiol test in order to see if I'm truly menopausal and therefore do not need an oophorectomy. However, I'm taking Arimidex (started in 7/05) and I'm wondering if these tests would tell me anything at all because of the effect on my hormone levels from the Arimidex. Should I get the tests or would they be worthless under the circumstances? Thank you once again, Liza",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, I'm a little further along than you are. I was diagnosed 10/04, had lumpectomy and SNB, chemo (dose-dense A/C and Taxol/Herceptin, 4 rounds each), and 35 rads w/ boost, which I completed almost a month ago. I just started Arimidex (for 5 yrs) and am still on Herceptin (for a yr total). I found my lump on 10/1/04, and had a diag. mammo. on 10/6, at which time the radiologist told me it looked very suspicious. I was compelled to immediately start reading everything I could about breast cancer, figuring that if it turned out to be breast cancer, I could absorb info better before I knew for sure than afterwards during panic. I had the lump removed on 10/22 and found out it was cancer on 10/28 (after which I had a wide excision and my SNB). I'd be glad to talk to you about what we are going through. Also, I've gotten a lot of help from a web site called breastcancer.org. As well as plenty of information, they have discussion boards where you can post on different threads as well as a couple of chat rooms, and there is a lot of support to be found there. Dr. Susan Love also has an excellent web site, as well as the Susan G. Komen web site and Y-Me web site (the latter offers a 24-hour phone hotline so you can speak with someone if you want to). Hugs to you, Liza",
