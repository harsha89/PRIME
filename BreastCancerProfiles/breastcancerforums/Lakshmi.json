    "Content": "I am a 73 year old woman and have recently found a breast lump in the right breast. FNAC report says that the lump has highly atypical cells and fragments suspicious for a carcinoma.Mammogram and ultrasound also have been done. The size of the lump is 1.5 in diameter. A biopsy confirmation has been recommended. In this case is it advisable to get the complete right breast removed through surgery or only the lump should be removed for further investigation?",
