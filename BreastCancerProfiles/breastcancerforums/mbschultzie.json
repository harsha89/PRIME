    "Content": "My mother was on arimidex and seemed to be doing well. at her 12/04 visit they did a cat dcan and blood work and her ca27-29 was elevated and the dr saw a small spot on her liver(she was diagnosed in 2000) she also had 2 spot on a lung but they have been stable. her ca 27-29 jumped from 24 to 45 then again to 56 (1/05). her CAE(?) is stable at 1.8. They switched to once a month faslodex shot and after the second shot she as been experiencing alo of muscle pain to the point that in 3 weeks she has difficulty around the house and is using a walker. She is 82 and up to the change in medication was very active. She her next visit on 3/21 and she refuses to continue that treatment and wonders what are her other choices. We research Femara and aromisin whitch could be used what about going back to tamoxifin since she didn't use it for a full 5 years. ( they change her from that because of Post menapausal bleeding). She has had a double mastectomy and histerectomy. We are also supplmenting with Garden of life RM-10 (mushrooms) Thanks for any help and prayers mary",
