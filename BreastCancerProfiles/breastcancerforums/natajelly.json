    "Content": "hi, my aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer eight years ago, and she has been well until it was discovered recently that she had liver, lymph node and bone mets. The doc told her that she had only 1 week to live and she survived the week.. but her skin's looking quite yellowish. She's 40 this year and she had chemotherapy before, not for now cos the doc said it the chances of success would be slim. Are foods with protein and fat (eg. oat milk 2.02g protein and 3.25g fat per 25g serving) suitable for her? The oat milk was recommended by a chinese TCM physician she's currently seeing. or should she avoid them altogether? Could someone please recommend some foods that she can take? really worried.. thanks alotttt",
