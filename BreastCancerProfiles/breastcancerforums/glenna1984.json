    "Content": "When DCIS hit our family, we became extremely proactive in how to follow the disease and treatment. My wife and I spent over 1,000 hours researching on the internet. The results of our findings are now at http://www.dciscancer.com in the form of a database of articles and studies that link you to the same research we used as well as more current information. As of November 25, 2005 we have links to 112 studies. The database may be accessed by mutliple categories or any freeform search you want. A short blurb about each link is included, as well as a single click to the actual study. Search lists may be exported to spreadsheet or text file. Glenn A webmaster, DCIS CANCER",
