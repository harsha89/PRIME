    "Content": "Hello. I've read about thermography here and there and my naturopath says it's a viable option to a mammography and I'm writing an article for my blog to talk about it. However, I've never had it done personally, so it's hard to know what to believe, as many seem to think it's a pointless exam . I was wondering if anyone has had any first hand experience with this thermography and whether it has been beneficial for them at all. Perhaps I should say I'm not a cancer patient but extremely interested in the subject of women's health. Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
