      "Content": "Hi all. I have been lurking around here since April 18th 08. My the stuff you ladies and gentelmen have been thru. I pray for you all. My question is this. I was diagonised with DCIS in April. HER2+, High-Grade Aggressive breast cancer.I am 41 years old. Had a lumpectomy about 4 cm was removed. I then had 30 rads and 5 boosters. I went to the cancer center for my 1 month checkup and the doctor said it was gone. CURED. no follow up for 6 months , no tamoxifin, no nothing. I didnt have any test run not even an x-ray, no bloodwork, notta, zip, nothing. So what i want to know is \" HOW DOES HE KNOW IM CURED\"??? What should i do? Should i have more test run somewhere? Should i just take him at his word ? im very confused. Thanks in advanced for your replies. Carol",

      "Content": "hi again, thanks for replying. I am 41. i went to the Cancer Care Clinic in Jackson Tn.The Doc told me that the statistics say that i dont need other test. That women with my type usually get cured and it never returns. He says just to follow up with my PCP in about 6 months. He doesnt even recommend the Tamoxfin. Just believes Im cured. Which is what i wanted to here. But i believe he should have at least done sone kind of test to back up his diagnosis of being CURED. My lymph nodes were not checked because the tumor was so small, 2 cm. anyways thats all i have. thanks again. Carol B",
