    "Content": "My mom just got diagnosed with stage 4 breast caner that has spread to her liver. She is of course considered \"treatable but not curable.\" This is so new to us. Our doctor says that we can prolong her life, but eventually the cancer will kill her. We are having a hard time understanding what is going on. Any advice for treatment or general support? For the most part...we all just need someone to talk to.",
