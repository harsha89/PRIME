      "Content": "After 4 cycles (8 weeks) of AC during which I gave myself neupogen shots days 3-8, 3-7, and 3-6, and one cycle of taxol (3 to go on a dose sense regimen), I gave myself only 2 shots. Day 3, I had such intense pain that I made a trip to emergency to find out what hurt so much that it had me crawling on the floor. My wonderful body generated a WBC of 44,000 in response to the combo of the new chemo and the neupogen or the prayers of my friends or both. After the medical tests determined it was not a massive infection, my doctor stopped the neupogen for this cycle. I'd like to hear more about what pain meds work for Taxol bone pain. My doctor may stop the neupogen or increase the dose time to three weeks. It hurt as bad as the electric shock and didn't stop for a week. Jin Shin Jitsyu treatment helped when I could drag myself out of the house. I've been having weekly acupuncture, massage, and warm baths which distract and do gentle yoga, take artemesium immune builder. Drink buckets of water, eat prunes and apricots, take B, zinc, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Don't sleep well when I hurt. Darvecet does not work well. Open to further suggestion, vitamins etc. Blessings, Maylani",
