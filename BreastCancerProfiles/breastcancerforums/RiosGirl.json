      "Content": "Hi, I don't know much about breast cancer but from the looks of it, if there were \"traces\" of disease in a lymph node, it could be why she is receiving chemo. If there was disease found in a lymph node, it would mean that all the cancer was not removed. I'm not sure what \"traces\" really means though - I've never heard that terminology applied to potential lymph node involvement. I believe with most cancers that can be treated (or mostly treated) through surgery need at least a few weeks for recovery. Chemo is hard on the body and reduces the ability to fight infection, so they probably want a good amount of healing done before they would consider exposing a patient to potential infection risks. Good luck to your aunt, I hope her treatment is successful and that it isn't too hard on her.",
