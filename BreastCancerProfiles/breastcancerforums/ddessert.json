I also have BRCA relatives with prostate, colon, ovarian, and bladder cancers. You definitely should get checked by setting up an appointment with a genetic counsellor. The treatments for cancers will be different if you carry this mutation.",

      "Content": "I'm noticing a pattern that the major cancer centers seem to get radiology reports read pretty quickly. In almost every scan, there is something to report, so they always seem to look at the previous scan to check for any growths. I think that the smaller places contract out the radiology readings. The radiologists can get the images remotely and do their reports from anywhere. There's usually a radiologist name on the report and it'd be interesting to see where they are based, locally or not. I've not done that with mine yet.",

      "Content": "I was talking to a counselor at our hospital recently about cancer and baldness and why it bothers some people more. Her observation was that some patients want some control over who knows they're fighting cancer. Being bald tells everyone who sees you that you have cancer, whether you want to tell them or not. It can bring on unwanted attention from complete strangers. I could see how this action by your friends just broadcasts your situation to even more people. If this is the case, they might be able to understand this explanation.",

The results of the breast cancer biopsy may also help. I have a BRCA2 defect and breast, ovarian, prostate, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers are all in my close family. The genetic testing guided my treatment and made it more successful than otherwise. May the knowledge you gain here make your life easier!",

My tumor was adjacent to a nerve bundle to the abdomen and back that cause a lot of pain. Three days after my first chemo treatment, my pain levels decreased below the level of the pain medication I was taking. In my case, it was a positive sign that the chemotherapy was working and I was eventually able to have surgery to remove the tumor.",
