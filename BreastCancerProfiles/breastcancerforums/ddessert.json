In almost every scan, there is something to report, so they always seem to look at the previous scan to check for any growths. I think that the smaller places contract out the radiology readings. The radiologists can get the images remotely and do their reports from anywhere. There's usually a radiologist name on the report and it'd be interesting to see where they are based, locally or not. I've not done that with mine yet.",

      "Content": "I was talking to a counselor at our hospital recently about cancer and baldness and why it bothers some people more. Her observation was that some patients want some control over who knows they're fighting cancer. Being bald tells everyone who sees you that you have cancer, whether you want to tell them or not. It can bring on unwanted attention from complete strangers. I could see how this action by your friends just broadcasts your situation to even more people. If this is the case, they might be able to understand this explanation.",
