    "Content": "Hi my name is Jennifer. I'm 21 years old. About 3 months ago I found a lump on my right breast . I went to my primary doctor and he assured me it was nothing. I'm young and not to worry about it. This month I noticed it got slightly bigger and got worried so I went to see another doctor about a week ago about a second opinion. She felt the lump as well and immediately sent me to get an ultrasound. I got the ultrasound and it showed a mass that looking solid in my right breast. It does not look like a cyst. And they ruled out fibroadenoma They scheduled me to have a biopsy on Monday. I realize the likelihood of someone having breast cancer at my age is slim. At least that's what I'm told and I keep telling myself it's nothing. But I'm really scared. And I guess I needed to write it somewhere. Does a biopsy hurt? They told me I would know within 3-4 days the results. Is that true?",
