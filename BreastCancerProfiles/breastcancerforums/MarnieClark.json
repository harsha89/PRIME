      "Content": "Hi there - Yes, I'm an 8-year breast cancer survivor and I used thermography but only after my breast cancer diagnosis. I loved it. I found it to be an incredibly useful diagnostic tool and in fact I wrote a blog post about it which you can check out here: < link deleted as per policy...please read our policies and comply> The reason I used it after the breast cancer diagnosis was because I liked the idea of seeing potential hot spots that might become a problem later on down the track (I didn't have any, luckily!). It's sad that the cost of this treatment usually isn't covered by insurance - at least in America it isn't, it was by some insurance companies in Australia. I believe we should have better access to this mode of diagnostic imaging.",
