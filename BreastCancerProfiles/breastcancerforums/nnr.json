      "Content": "I know this thread is old but I found it just before my recent bilateral breast core biopsies. And it made me very nervous. So, now that I've had the procedure done in both breasts, I wanted to comment for others who may stumble upon this thread: It didn't hurt. Not at all. And I think the Tech. took at least 5 samples from each breast. So what I learned is the anticipation and fear of something is usually more horrible then the actual thing. Now I'm not saying some people don't feel pain because I'm sure based on the skill of the Tech. and the area of the breast, pain could be felt. But you can also make yourself a nervous wreck and be so scared you faint. I usually stay calm, keep my sense of humor and try to breathe and relax myself. The only thing I felt, and it was fast and barely noticeable, was the pinch of the needle to numb my breast. After that I was good. When I was on my right side, I could watch the left breast on the sonogram screen and I did. I'm not afraid of needles (some people are) so that didn't bother me. I was making jokes about the Tech's aim. So I wanted to simply say: if you have to do it, don't psych yourself out. Plus it was quick. I don't think it took 30 minutes for both breasts. Anyway, now I have to wait for the results - 3 to 5 days - and again I'm breathing and staying calm.",
