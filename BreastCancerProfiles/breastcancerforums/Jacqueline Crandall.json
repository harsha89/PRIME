      "Content": "Originally Posted by Marion Ok. This sounds strange but I've been on Tamoxifen for about 45 days with no side effects but in the last two weeks have noticed that when I exercise, mow the yard, etc that causes me to sweat that I have a stinging sensation on my skin. It's almost like a burning feeling. When I stop sweating the stinging goes away. If I cool down or take a shower it goes away. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've read a side effect of Tamoxifen is itching but that makes me think it means itching all the time. This is not itching but stinging and only when I perspire and then its gone. Has anyone else had this experience? Marion We are doing telephone interviews with women who are on tamoxifen. This interview is confidenitial. All information is used for research only. You would be paid $35.00 for a 45min to 1hr interview. If you are interested please email me. [email protected]",
