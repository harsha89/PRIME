      "Content": "Originally Posted by sumeetshah How long back was the surgery. I mean, I wish to know the time between the surgery and onset of these satellites. And are they restricted to that part or are seen elsewhere too? The first operation (mastectomy) was in Nov 2009, then due to metastasis there was an operation in Nov 2010 and one more in Oct 2011 both on the back with huge tumors. Then after the last operation the staellites started to appear on the stomach, one of them was cut bu the others appeared. The doctors claim that this is nothing to do with the melanoma and prescribe only general chemotherapy. Is there any local chemotherapy to be done for theses satellites??",
