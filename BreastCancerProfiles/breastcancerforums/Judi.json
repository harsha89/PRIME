Your mom is her OWN person... not a stat...not a number. Just because she reads or hears of something happening bad to anyone else doesn't mean it will be that way for her. War stories abound. That's unfortunate because there's a lot of us survivors out here! I was dx'd 6 years ago, at age 56...my whole breast was riddled with cancer right to the nipple. I had an MRM, my nodes removed (7 were positive) and an expander put in for an implant all at once. I went through treatment. Didn't throw up from chemo. Didn't burn horribly from radiation. I am a 6 year survivor now, Stage IIB. My mom was dx'd 4 years ago at age 85 with a HUGE lump. HUGE. She was too frail for chemo and she is a bleeder. So they did only a lumpectomy, no nodes out, and radiation. She did fine with the treatment. No tamoxifen, or anything else because of her frailty. 4 years later, she got another big lump in the same breast. So she had a mastectomy at age 89 because they were concerned that it might ulcerate inside and for her, the bleeding is dangerous. She healed well. Her scans are clear again. I have tips and hints on chemo...I had A/C and taxol. I share them. You tell your mom that you will both get her through this and we will help! Hugs and prayers, Judi",
