    "Content": "Hello! A couple months ago I found a lump in my right breast. It was fairly close to my period so I decided to wait a little bit to see if it would go away. (I had read that you can get lumps due to hormones. Oh and from caffine so I have since stopped drinking the stuff). But the sucker was still there so I made an appoitment with my doctor. She felt the lump also and sent me for a ultrasound. Unfortuantley that day, right after my ultrasound there was a huge tornado in the city and the power went out for a couple days. About a week later I received a letter stating that everything was fine. Until the end of November when I received a letter stating that I needed to come into the office to discuss treatment options. After meeting with my doctor, she checked the lump again (still there!) and said that she was not too worried about it but would like to keep an eye on it. That was in the beginning of december. I have since kept an eye on it, still there.. There's a huge family background of it in my family (all of my grandparents have had it as well as other members of my family but no immediate). Other then the mystery lump, I am very healthy (If you don't count rapid bone loss and a bad ticker). I am wondering if I should seek a second opinion?",
