      "Content": "Great research paper on Ganoderma causes apoptosis on breast cancer cells: http://147.52.72.117/IJO/2004/volume24/number5/1093.pdf Hope this relevant article would help. Also do a search on PubMEd http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/q...arch&DB=pubmed on Ganoderma or reishi and breast cancer. There are also good sources from reishi essence web site. Please be careful on choosing the quality of your ganoderma product. I have acquaintances and relatives that were treated with ganoderma with very positive results. email me if you need to know the source of their ganoderma product. I can inquire from them.",
