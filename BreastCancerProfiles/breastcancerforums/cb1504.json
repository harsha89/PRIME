      "Content": "Personally, I can't wait for the wig part of this whole thing. I've been wanting to wear wigs my whole life. I look on google, find one I like then see if it's less pricey on Amazon. If I have to endure a lengthy illness, the girly, makeover, dress up part of this thing is going to be the fun part. I commented on the color of a woman's hair the other day and was about to as for her hairdresser's contact info when she said it was a wig! She looked fabulous. I'm sure your MIL will look fabulous too and she's lucky to have you to care. Just don't let her go all Cleopatra. cb",

      "Content": "That would be a blessing indeed. I did have thyroid cancer, long ago, 20+ years since I had a total thyroidectomy and radiation treatments. But my hair only thinned. I didn't realize the wigged woman at work was bald from Chemo. Sometimes she just takes it off half way through the day and goes au natural. I have way too much hair for wigs at this point, maybe another day. cb",

      "Content": "Good morning Sweeties, My mammogram came back bad and I'm off this morning for more tests, aka: close ups. All these peripheral exams and stress, on the way to the colon cancer tests next week, are killing me emotionally. It's taking so long to get to the real problem and meanwhile the nagging discomfort in my bikini line area grows. I hate the medical supposedly \"professionals\" that I'm forced to deal with. If was as supposedly professional as they are, I'd lose my job. That said, alright Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up. cb",

      "Content": "and we want to send you for an ultra sound. Well Sweeties, I saw that for myself last week as the mammograms were being done. My sister died of this a year ago February. Personally, I've had these large lovelies for a little over 40 years and they've always seemed to be more trouble than they were worth, in an unwanted attention sort of a way. I really don't seem to care much if they're gone, but am I gonna care later? I seem to be crying, I hope it's from the stress of realizing how ill I am and not from something as superficial as losing my lovely lady shape. Step by step to the end. I just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. cb",
