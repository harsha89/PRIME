    "Content": "my mom just got an annual monagram...and they said that they see some usualness in her left breast. they asked her to get another monagram on the 26th. we think that the cancer (if there is cancer) is in it;s early stage. she says that she can't feel it during self examanations. she;s fairly healthy but she does have high cholestrol. i;m wondering what;s gonna happen from now on. treatments, and maybe surgery?",
