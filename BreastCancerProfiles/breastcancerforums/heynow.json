    "Content": "I am going through a papilloma right now and it was my understanding that while most are benign some can have cancer cells along with them. I hope to find out more information on this today with my visit to a surgeon. I would like to know more about your papilloma experience if you wouldn't mind sharing. I am curious about what they do, recovery, did you have the duct removed, etc. Heynow",
