      "Content": "Cindy -- Kathy LaTour here. I am so glad you have already subscribed to Heal. If you will remember when your renewal comes up next spring and send me an e-mail, I will comp your second year since you have already subscribed. And Nancy, thank you so much for validating us to the readers. CURE, the magazine for the newly diagnosed, has been named the best health magazine for our circulation twice by Folio but we are a very small team and have not had resources to do the publicity we need to. That is going to change with Heal since we have to charge a small sub fee for it, but just wait. You will love it. This is the magazine that will talk to all of us about all the issues that appear on these blogs. It has been for me a wish come true -- to turn my experince into my passion and then into my job. If you haven't seen Heal yet, please go to Healtoday.com. We have only had two issues and all the copy is online so you can see what great topics are covered. The magazine is also for chronic cancer patients. I am really excited about San Antonio. This is the first time we have done anything like this and we are all trained journalists so we are getting excited about giving our readers on the spot info. This is why we are giving away a year of Heal for people to opt in. I am going to be covering advocacy in San Antonio, which, ironically, I attended in 1993 when my book came out. There were very few advocates back then and my friends and I -- all survivors-- got a few looks like we had invaded the enemy camp. I am so glad things have changed. Spread the word. We are all climbing the same mountain. Kathy",

      "Content": "I'm Kathy LaTour, a 21-year breast cancer survivor and editor-at-large for CURE and Heal, award-winning magazines that take you through the cancer experience. I wanted to share with the breast cancer community what we're doing in December at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, one of the largest breast cancer meetings in the world where the latest in research is reported annually. This year, the CURE and Heal staffs will be there, reporting and blogging on the breaking news and advocacy issues. To get our daily reports and webcasts, sign up at . If you sign up before Nov. 1 we'll give you a free year's subscription to Heal: Living Well After Cancer, the magazine for all cancer survivors. We're excited about bringing you the news that may bring us one step closer to a cure. We hope you'll join us. Kathy",
