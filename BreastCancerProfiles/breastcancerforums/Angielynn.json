      "Content": "I'm confused and would appreciate clarification. I had a stereotactic biopsy. There were two areas they were to biopsy. The first was an area of microcalcifications. That went fine thank God, and the results were \"no malignancy\". The other sample they were to take was a retroareolar/central breast nodule that could be seen on the CC view. They said it may be localized within the 12 o'clock position but it was obscured by overlying fibroglandular tissue. The second look ultrasound failed to demonstrate the presence of a cyst. They assumed the area was solid. When it came time for the biopsy of that area they could not detect it on the mammogram, so no sample was taken. I went back for a 3 month follow-up mammogram The doctor wrote the following: \"Vague nodule is identified at the site fo previous nodularity. No suspicious persistent nodularity is seen on today's study although the nodule still is seen on the medial breast. This is likely a nodular parenchymal pattern. Patient should return in 3/08 for bilateral mammogram and ultrasound.\" That's 8 months away and corresponds with my annual exam. The Bi-rads category was 2: Benign findings. My questions are: 1. what is this nodular area and what does all this mean? 2. Am I at higher risk for cancer because of it? 3. Why did she order an ultrasound in addition to the mammogram? 4. What is different that indicates I don't need the biopsy now? Thanks so much for your help!",

      "Content": "I just spoke with the Dr. who reviewed the mammogram results and wrote the report. She says that when this type of thing doesn't show up on the stereotactic mammogram during the procedure, it's because it usually indicates that this is really benign glandular tissue which blends in with surrounding tissue. She explained that the stereotactic looks at the breast from multiple angles in a 3 dimensional way and if it's a true mass it will stay visible. Does this sound right?",

      "Content": "Thank you Brainman! I appreciate so much that you're there to answer questions. This is such an intense thing. What a blessing to have access to people with info and who care!!!! So what she is saying there does make sense to you as far as it being benign glandular tissue? She did offer me an MRI if I would like one - more to calm me if I wanted it because I sounded nervous. What do you think? (I'm pretty claustrophobic so I'd rather not have to face that but I'd do it if it were going to be helpful).",
