      "Content": "Hi Jayne, I'm not a doctor, but I'd be shocked if those same tests you just had 2 months ago showed anything. Had it been a year or even 6 months, if yours was aggressive, then maybe but.......... PET Scans are so sensitive and natorious for false positives and yours coming out clean 2 months ago. I just don't see it. I have heard of many who have had markers go up and it not be a reoccurence. Which ones does she do? Mine did CA27-29 for about a year to see what was \"normal\" for me. He didn't even do the 1st one until Oct. 03 and I was dx 2/02. I do know that the, I think it's the CA125 or the CEA can change for the strangest reasons. A friend of mine has which ever one of those I'm thinking about and hers went up and up and they did every test and she was fine. Ended up that she quit smoking and it started coming down and was normal again in about 6 months. Don't get me wrong, YOU are more important then anything, but I'd check with your insurance. Most will not pay for a PET unless there is a specific reason for it. With you having one just 2 months ago and it being normal, they may not pay and those things are expensive. Did they biopsy the liver growths to know they were benign? My guess that's what it is. One of the ladies from another board I use to go on had her markers go up and up and, matter of fact 2 of them and it had to do with the liver, but NOT cancer. I wish I could be of more help. I know you're scared. My check up is Monday and I'm scared. This disease seems to keep us scared to some point and other times more so. Please keep us posted. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

      "Content": "Cindy, You must have the highest tollerance for pain I've ever heard of. I'd been popping those pain pills without a 2nd thought. I sat here and hurt for you when you talked about getting sick and your stomach feeling like it as opening up.......... Just shoot me.......lol You are one hell of a trooper, but I guess that's why you're not in my Whimp of America fan club...... LOL I had a horrible experience when I attempted to have reconstruction. What is the difference in a LD Flap and a DIEP or however you spelled it. Are they both from the back around the shoulder blades or from the stomach? If I decide to try again, it will be about the time something freezes over unless they come up with an easier way. Mine would be bilateral reconstruction. I'm still amazed. My dad had triple bypass and you could see the look of pain on his face when he coughed......yeah, the broke his sternum to do the surgery, but he said it was \"just a little uncomfortable\"......... The two of you amazing!!!!!!!!!!",

I've lot about 6 of the 30+ I put on, but it seems to stall out there. I guess it's time to use the treadmill instead of it just taking up space... lol I about feel out of my seat when he said my triglycerides were 620 when I had never had a problem before, but now I know Arimidex can make those number go up and up, that explains it. It seems like when you take one drug, there's another one you have to take to combat the side affects. I take Arimidex to hopefully prevent a reoccurence, but it could cause my arterties to clog and have a heart attack.........AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Yep, we need a cure yesterday. Thanks Leo",

      "Content": "Hi, Just my personal opinion based on what I know and what I've seen since being dx 3 1/2 years ago is hit the cancer with everything you've got and pray it never comes back. CMF is a safer chemo combo on the heart and normally your hair will thin, you won't lose it all (which shouldn't be a factor because it's your life, but that is a + for that type of chemo). I've seen Stage I ladies with 1cm tumors and 0+ nodes have reoccurences. I know that is not the norm, but it does happen. Unless CMF has changed, it's once every 3 weeks for 6 treatments. I was Stage III so there was no doubt what I needed to do and that was get treated real aggressively and pray it got every cancer cell that was floating around. I opted for a simple mastectomy on the other side to increase my odds a little more of it not coming back. It's a very personal decision that only you can make and I'm real disappointed how much I'm hearing lately that oncos are telling the patients to make the choice. They should know what the best course of treatment is for you. You can always get a 2nd opinion. Best wishes and if I can help, feel free to send me a personal message. My e-mail address has changed and for safety reasons (long story that has to do with abusive ticked off ex) I'm not going to put the new one anywhere. Take care and you'll make the right decision. You'll know.",

I was told that one of the chemos gave me a 3% chance of leukemia. When you look at 3% chance of leukemia and virtually 100% chance that the cancer will come back, that's a no brainer. No all chemo causes heart problem. Yes, I have chemo brain, so what, I forget things and then remember them later on. I had no pain with chemo. Some oncos give neulasta shots routinely. I never got any because my white counts bottomed up, but came back up on their own. I was 43 when dx and it's 3 1/2 years later and yes, the Arimidex can cause joint and bone pain..............take Actonel or Fosamax, it completely elimated the joint pain. I'll deal with a little discomfort if it saves me life until something better comes around. Yes, chemo is poison, but for the people like Suzanne Somers who are anti chemo because it's poison, what does she do, inject mistletoe extract into her stomach..........what's mistletoe? POISON. Anyone thinking about going the \" natural\" route, would probably get more info on a board that deals with nothing but natural treatment. I've known 3 indirectly that went that went that route and all 3 have tied. A combo of traditional treatment that is proven to work, along with herbs and all that are fine as long as you TALK TO YOUR ONCO 1st. Some of this \"natural\" stuff will cause you more harm then good. Where did you find that surgery that said most oncos wouldn't take chemo? What are they doing, just waiting to die?",

I can't remember which chemo, either the 5FU or cytoxin, I know I had to suck on ice cubes or drink water while they were giving it to me.... must have been the 5FU and thank God I never had mouth sores either. One of my veins did get hard and you could feel it elevated, I guess the one they used the most, but all that went away after some time.

I know that when it was through that it would work, my PS never mentioned exercising.

Pastor Rich, I couldn't wear a wig, it just felt funny to me, but alot of women have no problems. If your wife isn't comfortable in them, you can go to Hobby Lobby if you have one and they have every color and pattern of bandanas down there from denim to dressy. I wore those all the time and then when I started getting a little bit of hair, I'd buy the women's ball caps from walmart. It's funny now. My hair is to the length it was before I lost it and what do I do, wear a ballcap and pull the back through the opening to keep it off my back and shoulders.....LOL I'll talk to ya'll when I get back on my feet, or wrist.. lol Nancy",

I was able to take a RX for it and it clearned up quickly. I would try (try being the key word) not to worry too much as it takes time for our bodies to heal from everything it's been through. I know you're worried, and anyone that's been dx with cancer would be, but you're 2 years out and I know I quit worrying as much after about 2 1/2 - 3 years of dx. I still take changes seriously and if something happens before my next check up, I go see my PCP or if I feel I need to see my onco, I'll go see him. I'm sure your onco is doing labs everything you go in for a check up and that tells him/her about your counts and how your body is doing. If there were any abnormal reading, indicating a lower immune system, anemia etc. you would know. I hope you don't have to deal with it again and that the medicine will take care of it once and for all.",

It's amazing how many \"friends\" run the other way when they find out you have cancer. It sounds to me like you are doing EVERYTHING right. Let me bring it up when she feels like talking about it and talk about other things when she doesn't. You have no idea how much good and what a huge help you are to her by being there and doing all you do. What she needs more then anything is a friend, and you've proven yourself to be a very dear one. From all of us who have realized just how many friends we didn't have when we were dx, thank you. You are just what the doctor ordered Where has the cancer spread to? Many with Stage IV respond to treatment and become stable and stay that way for many years. I know one lady that had mets in 3 different organs and is NED (No Evidence of Disease) again. They really are making great progress, but of course, we need a CURE and NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I don't have kids and my niece wouldn't be affected by my dx, since she's my brother's daughter and from last I read, they don't consider that paternal side a factor. I'm going to ask my onco about it when I go next month and if I misunderstood and she could be at a higher risk because of me being dx, then I'm going to check into that test. Not everyone on hormones gets BC, but it's definately a scary thing now with so many being er and pr +. I personally don't think he could say that with certainty, that she will have it by the time she's 40. If he was, wouldn't he be snatching her off the birth control pills? I know this has to be so upsetting to you and your daughter, but hang in there until Dr. Leo or Lu can answer your question. I've heard of alot of GYN's that are trying to give HRT to BC survivors that have er/pr+ receptors......go figure. If you need to talk, e-mail or pm me and I'll give you a call. Hugs Nancy",

The onco should be the one that has the knowledge and the latest studies and based on his/her own experience with the different chemos. I'm also surprised with a Stage II BC patient w/node involvement, that they say that hormone therapy would also be acceptable. Just my opinion, but I'd get another opinion. I guess some of this could be based on your wife's age and any other health issues, but I can't imagine leaving the treatment up to the patient. Of course we'd want to take the least amount of treatment like Tamoxifen or Arimidex, or any of those, but that doesn't necessarily give us the best chance of survival without a reoccurence. Prayers to you and please e-mail me and let me know what you found out. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, I found an \"egg size\" mass in my breast 3 years ago Monday. My tumor ended up being 5.5 cm. That included any tissue around the actual tumor that had cancer cells in it as well. The didn't do SNB 3 years ago when I was dx, so when they did the mastectomy, they removed all my lymph nodes as well. As you can see at the bottom of this page, I had 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16. It's always better not to have lymph nodes involved BUT, IF she does have positive nodes, that doesn't mean that she can't live to be a ripe old age. Having positive nodes doesn't mean the end of the road. I know quite a few ladies, like me were dx with Stage III and had as many nodes positive as me and some more and they are doing great 5, 6 and 9 years out. Treatment is even better today then it was 3 years ago when I was dx. I was also considered \"high risk\" because I was \"young\". They will check and see if she is hormone receptive, which means that her cancer feeds off of hormones (estrogen and progesterine). That is a good thing because there are meds out there that, like me, I'm taking for 5 years. The one I'm taking is Arimidex. If she's estrogen/progesterine negative, again that does NOT mean that she won't live to be a ripe old age. They can tell alot by testing the tissue they remove. I'd definately have someone be with your mom at every visit. It is very overwhelming to hear that you have BC and I know I didn't hear 1/2 of what my oncologist said. Not that I wasn't listening, but our brains shut down when it can't absorb anymore and every visit, whoever went with me heard things I didn't and that was good. Have her write a list of questions that she has so she doesn't forget them. Another term you'll hear is HER2. You'd rather have that negative. Someone with a tiny tumor and no nodes can have a reoccurence as well as someone with a large tumor and positive nodes can go and not have a reoccuence. There is no sense to this disease, it has a mind of it's own. I personally, plan on being around for a long time Keep us posted and if you have any more questions, ask away. All of us have been there and done that or going through it now. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

It's been 5+ years and I'm sure here and doing great. I don't know all the info about your mom's pathology report of course, but Stage III is definitely not a death sentence.

      "Content": "This is definately one for Leo. I know when I was 1st dx with a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes, someone told me to ask my onco about a stem cell transplant. I did and it wasn't even a consideration. The studies that showed it helped (I know I'll get this bassackwards, so don't listen to me, listen to Leo) were changed to reflex it's effectiveness for BC by the ones that did the studies. I can't remember who changed or altered the results, but they didn't find that it increased the chance of getting rid of the BC. Your situation could be different, that's why I hesitated to even post. I'm sure Leo will be on line as soon as he can and can give you a lot better answer. I'm confused about something. The PET Scan showed you had no evidence of disease, but because your TM were still elevated, that's the reason the treatment continued? A lot of oncos don't even do TM, they are unreliable a lot of the time. My best friend had TMs done before her dx and it was in the normal range, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11+ nodes. I know someone on the flip side that has elevated TMs and has had every test and scan run and NED, just high tumor markers. Hugs and prayers",

      "Content": "Hi, Just my personal opinion based on what I know and what I've seen since being dx 3 1/2 years ago is hit the cancer with everything you've got and pray it never comes back. CMF is a safer chemo combo on the heart and normally your hair will thin, you won't lose it all (which shouldn't be a factor because it's your life, but that is a + for that type of chemo). I've seen Stage I ladies with 1cm tumors and 0+ nodes have reoccurences. I know that is not the norm, but it does happen. Unless CMF has changed, it's once every 3 weeks for 6 treatments. I was Stage III so there was no doubt what I needed to do and that was get treated real aggressively and pray it got every cancer cell that was floating around. I opted for a simple mastectomy on the other side to increase my odds a little more of it not coming back. It's a very personal decision that only you can make and I'm real disappointed how much I'm hearing lately that oncos are telling the patients to make the choice. They should know what the best course of treatment is for you. You can always get a 2nd opinion. Best wishes and if I can help, feel free to send me a personal message. My e-mail address has changed and for safety reasons (long story that has to do with abusive ticked off ex) I'm not going to put the new one anywhere. Take care and you'll make the right decision.

The muscle pain comes and goes, but the main problem for me with Arimidex is bone and joint pain. There are times if I squat down, my knees won't get me back up. I've gained (shhhhhhhh 50 pounds) since I started treatment and being put into menopause without the benefit of going through it naturally is why I'm being told I've gained so much and a lot is in my stomach area. Have you had a bone density test? I had one last year that was fine, but was put on Actonel. I just had my bone scan last week, as well as a chest x-ray and tumor markers and all the regular labs and thank God, I'm still NED. No matter how healthy I eat, I can't loose an ounce. It's hard to exercise when my knees are this bad. When I have another bone density on the 15th, I don't know what they can do since I'm already on Actonel. I was dx at 43 and 46 now and feel like 110 at times, BUT anything is better then cancer Good luck and hope you can find relief!!!!! Nancy",

You know I'm kidding. When my nephew (21) saw my pink ribbon magnet on my car, he asked where I got it. He said he wanted to put one of his SUV. I have to admit that shocked me. I thought with him just turning 21 and hanging out with the guys, he'd get ragged about it by the ones that don't have a clue what it's for. He told me I was far more important then what anyone said and if they said something, he'd tell them why he had it on his car, because his aunt was dx with BC and wanted to let people know how proud he was of me for going through everything I went through because he didn't want to lose me. Talk about tears flowing. He's had it on for about a week now and everyone of his friends of course who I know, know what it stood for, but even the ones that didn't know me, knew what it stood for because of family members or friend's family memories.

I was dx ILC so I definately don't know alot about IDC besides the fact that it is the most \"common\" kind of BC. I would think they couldn't call it DCIS if it had spilled over into the lobules. Isn't DCIS incapulated? I thought that is what in situ meant, but I could be very wrong so if it spilled over into the lobules, it would be IDC???????? Thank God for Leo because he can explain what it means and we can both learn. I wasn't trying to butt in, but wanted to give you those sites to look at until Leo could answer your question in case they could explain it. Sorry I was no help. Nancy",

I know why I was 2 years NED, my onco said he was \"encouraged\" and when I asked what did he mean, he said that it shows that the cancer wasn't chemo resistant and it wasn't real aggressive. I've known a few ladies that have had reoccurences in less then a year after dx and then I've seen ladies that have a reoccurence after 6, 8, 12 years. I know that is just one reason why it would come back quickly. It is strange how we're dx and can have it back in our liver, bones etc. so fast when it was growing for many years before we could either feel it or a mammogram pick it up and then it can go nuts after treatment. I'll be checking for Leo's answer too, to this very good question. We need a cure for this mess and be done with it. Going through it once should be more then enough!!!! Nancy",

I'm going to get my eyes checked as soon as I can have a few months of a break for docs.....ugh My onco is Monday and my general surgeon is May 1 and dentist inbetween. I think my rads onco is in April. Right now I'm going to get through Monday, go to Talladega and escape reality and then back to the doctors......

It's normal to be nervous, but the strange thing for me was, the night before surgery (my 1st surgery since I was 3 and that was tonsils and don't remember..... lol) I slept pretty good. I was nervous of course, but my thoughts were to get the **** cancer out of me, and that's why I think I was o.k. the day of surgery. Maybe that's an approach for not only you to take, but when your mom has concerns, which are absolutely normal, to remind her that the surgery is a good thing, they are going to take the tumor and the cancerous lymph nodes out of her body. Please do keep me posted on how surgery goes (I know it will go smooth) and what the path report shows. I'm guessing they will do a Sentinal Node Biopsy vs. removing them all (I had all mine removed), but if they don't tell her exercises to do, to ask the surgeon. She needs to get that arm moving so scar tissue doesn't build up. The mastectomy was a breeze, but the node removal was painful and I babied my arm............BAD move on my part. It just delayed the pain and healing. I'm \"thinking\" (dangerous) that they biopsied 1 node or did they already do a sentinal node biopsy? Please tell your mom that she's in my prayers. We're all stronger then we ever thought we were and after the fear, come anger towards this disease and then we're ready to kick some cancer butt",

      "Content": "Hi, Just my personal opinion based on what I know and what I've seen since being dx 3 1/2 years ago is hit the cancer with everything you've got and pray it never comes back. CMF is a safer chemo combo on the heart and normally your hair will thin, you won't lose it all (which shouldn't be a factor because it's your life, but that is a + for that type of chemo). I've seen Stage I ladies with 1cm tumors and 0+ nodes have reoccurences. I know that is not the norm, but it does happen. Unless CMF has changed, it's once every 3 weeks for 6 treatments. I was Stage III so there was no doubt what I needed to do and that was get treated real aggressively and pray it got every cancer cell that was floating around. I opted for a simple mastectomy on the other side to increase my odds a little more of it not coming back. It's a very personal decision that only you can make and I'm real disappointed how much I'm hearing lately that oncos are telling the patients to make the choice. They should know what the best course of treatment is for you. You can always get a 2nd opinion. Best wishes and if I can help, feel free to send me a personal message. My e-mail address has changed and for safety reasons (long story that has to do with abusive ticked off ex) I'm not going to put the new one anywhere. Take care and you'll make the right decision. You'll know.",

Again, I'm not trying to answer for Leo since he's the onco, but the test doesn't take but a second and I had the results within about 10 min. If your onco has his own lab too, for peace of mind, I'd have the test run since you can't tell based on periods. Mine was surprised that chemo did but me into menopause because of my age, so based on that, I don't think there is anyway to be sure without that test. Keep us posted Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, There will come a time that you'll think about cancer everyday, but more of a passing thought instead of consuming your thoughts. You and your onco were very smart for you to take chemo even though you didn't have any positive nodes. With or without nodes, you never know what will happen, but in my opinion your onco was right in giving you the AC since there is no accurate test that can tell if the cancer had gotten into your blood stream. She wanted to make sure you had every chance possible to never have to deal with this disease again and the odds are definately in your favor that you won't. I was dx Stage III, 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes and 3 years later I'm doing well. My chances are greater then you statically that I'll have a reoccurence, but even us with positive nodes can respond well to chemo and radiation. It's not an automatic gloom and doom situation. I think that black cloud will always linger until a Cure is found, but it won't consume your thoughts the more time that passes. Hang in there girl, you're doing great!!!!!!!! and your thoughts are very normal. My onco did put me on Paxil during treatment because I was dealing with more then the BC at the time, not to say I wouldn't have needed it anyway. It's a very emotional and scary time, but treatment has come a long way. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, I would highly recommend against trying to have expanders and then implants because of radiation. I tried it and after 3 months of extreme pain, they removed the expanders to find that they were trying to come back out of my skin around the sternum. I had pain on my sternum for about a year. If you are going to do bilateral reconstruction, from everyone I've talked to, the LD Flap is the way to go. They take tissue, muscle etc from under your shoulder blade and push it to the breast area and reconstruct the breasts. It will mean having drains front and back, but they are more of a pain in the butt, then painful. The only other option is Tram Flap, which is taking the muscle, blood supply etc. from your stomach and pushing all of that under your skin all the way up to your chest. I've heard that it looks nice when it's done, but alot have had complications and extra surgeries and it is painful. Nothing about this disease is easy is it. I know here there is a place and I'm sure there where you can buy everything needed if you've ahd mastectomies. From prothesis to bathing suits that have the prothesis and no one would ever know except you. I'd get a consultation with a PS and they will show you before and after pics of each kind of reconstruction. My PS will no longer do expanders on ladies that have had radiation. I wish he figured that out before I tried it....lol Hugs Nancy",

There are tumor markers that can be done, but they aren't done until after chemo is completed and they aren't always accurate. Since they have done no surgery on her, they could tell my a CT Scan, bone scan etc. to see if the tumors are shrinking. I had a PET Scan about 6 months after I was done with chemo (radiation was after that) and it can pick up smaller tumors then other tests, but also give false positives. I would say the CT Scan, bone scan or MRI would need to be done to see if the tumors were shrinking, but I'm not sure how long after starting chemo that would be done since I had surgery 1st. Does she have Ductal, Lobular, Inflammatory or what kind of BC? Try to find out what kind of chemo too.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had an excisional biopsy and they removed the whole tumor and tissue around it and technically that's considered a lumpectomy. A biopsy is when they take samples of the tumor/mass. I didn't have the wire guided, so I can't help you with that part. I didn't have a SNB because there wasn't much doubt with the size of my tumor that I was going to have node involvement. From what I've heard from others, they do the SNB at the same time they do the lumpectomy or mastectomy after you are dx. I personally would want all of the area removed since the difference in LCIS and ILC's treatment is completely different. If you are opting to have a mastectomy or double since Lobular is prone to mirror itself, then it won't matter if he checks the part that he thinks is Invasive, because pathology will check all of the tissue removed during the mastectomy. If you're not going to have one, I'd be kicking and screaming until the area that is in question is removed with a excisional biopsy. Lobular is a lot less common this Ductal, but it's just as bad and harder to dx because it's sneakier. Go with you gut and if you have to, get another opinion. It's your life, not your doctors!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi, Tamoxifen helps in encasing cancer cells that try to feed off hormones. It is only for women who are Estrogen/Progesterone positive, meaning that the cancer feeds off hormones. It isn't chemo and is used after chemo is given and helps to get any cancer cells that chemo might miss. There is no cure for breast cancer, but chemo is meant to kill cancer cells. The more aggressive the cancer is, the better chemo works. By reducing the size of the tumors and the amount of cancer in her body, that is what will save her from the cancer spreading to other places, mainly organs like lungs, liver etc. Tamoxifen is given AFTER chemo. I'd find another oncologist and get another opinion. She's very young and that puts her at high risk. I had just turned 43 and I was young when it comes to breast cancer and I was high risk at Stage III and it's been 5 1/2 years and there is no signs the cancer has returned, so never give up hope. But, you need an onco that will treat VERY aggressively. It sounds like he's almost given up without even trying and that's not acceptable.",

After 6 months once I completed treatment and I never had a period again, he did a blood test to determine that chemo had put me into menopause and then I was switched to Arimidex. He is right, Arimidex is for post menopausal ladies only, but Tamoxifen is for ladies who are not post. I asked my onco about having my ovaries removed to get rid of more hormones since I was Stage III, young and high risk and there was nothing that pointed him in the direction that it would be a benefit to me and saw no reason to put me through that. I have heard of ladies that were given something and put into menopause, but if I remember, they were the ones that hadn't had a period in a year and were on Arimidex and since that is only for post menopausal ladies, they were given whatever the med was to put them into menopause so they could continue the Arimidex. It's all so confusing. Best wishes Nancy",

I tried reconstruction when I had the SM and it was a disaster, so I'll just remain boobless and happy to be that way. We're alive, and that's what counts. I had a harder time losing my hair then either of my breasts. You don't have your dx or when you were dx on a signature line, but I'm assuming it's been fairly recently. Life everything else with this disease, I'm sure your feeling about your mastectomy will become your new \"normal\" as time goes on. Best wishes.",

Of course because of my age and it had only been 6 months since treatment, he did the blood test to see if I was post or not. I asked the lab tech how they could tell and he said there would be one hormone either present or not, can't remember which, and that would tell them. I couldn't have switched had I not had that blood test to Arimidex. I'm still amazed at the GYNs that try to put BC survivors who are er/pr+ on HRT.",

      "Content": "Hi Diana, I've never heard of what MaryBeth was talking about, but it sounds great to me. The mastectomy itself isn't painful, just a little sore at the incision site (and I'm the President of the Whimp Club) what was painful was where they removed all my lymph nodes (they didn't to SNB when I had mine), but with what MaryBeth says they are using now sounds like you'll be doing great right after surgery. You'll just have to remember to use that arm to keep scar tissue from forming. I have no doubt that I would opt for a mastectomy, mainly because I did from the start and a year later had the other breast removed. Mine was Lobular and Stage III, so it was prone to mirror itself and I wasn't going to give it a chance. I tried one reconstruction (the one more prone not to work I found out later) and it didn't work, but there is the Tram Flap and LD Flap. I doubt I'll ever have reconstruction, but who knows down the road. If I do, I tend to believe it will be at the 5 year mark as long as no reoccurence. With it being in your lymph nodes and only there, it's a local reoccurence, so that's the best kind to get if you have to and now they are saying that Herceptin works good with the initial chemo, so there's a lot to talk to you onco about. I had different chemo then MaryBeth did, but we all respond differently. You may not have any problems except being tired and I think that's a given. I had a few rough days, but also had some days that I didn't feel like I was going through treatment. It's not fun, but it's doable and you'll definately get through it and before you know it, you'll be done with treatment. Keep us posted",

The muscle pain comes and goes, but the main problem for me with Arimidex is bone and joint pain. There are times if I squat down, my knees won't get me back up. I've gained (shhhhhhhh 50 pounds) since I started treatment and being put into menopause without the benefit of going through it naturally is why I'm being told I've gained so much and a lot is in my stomach area. Have you had a bone density test? I had one last year that was fine, but was put on Actonel. I just had my bone scan last week, as well as a chest x-ray and tumor markers and all the regular labs and thank God, I'm still NED. No matter how healthy I eat, I can't loose an ounce. It's hard to exercise when my knees are this bad. When I have another bone density on the 15th, I don't know what they can do since I'm already on Actonel.

I'm with Jim. I don't like the needle biopsies because they aren't reliable. I had my tumor removed and then you know what's going on. You're in my prayers. Thanks for keeping us posted and please continue too. Hugs and praying for B9",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I found out the hard way (like you have) that once we've had chemo, our veins roll and harder to get stuck. I always had good veins, but one person that stuck me 3 times and then finally got someone else for the 4th, it blew my vein to where it's just scar tissue now. It was the big one in the fold of my arm. I will say that I've never had to be stuck more then once at my onco's office. I always tell whoever is doing the sticking for an i.v. for a test, that they have to stick me in the hand and have to use a butterfly needle. I've only had them not listen once and I wasn't the nicest person after 4 sticks, I was going to leave. There's no excuse for that many sticks. I'd remind whoever is going to stick you that ýou've had chemo and that you've been stuck multiple times because no one could get the vein without blowing it and if they haven't been doing it a long time, they will get someone that will. I've also started telling them (most of my tests are done at the cancer institute, so they know) that I have at the hospital that they have 2 sticks and that's as many chances as they get. I say it nicely, but they know I'm not kidding and that has done wonders!!!!!! Good luck and I hope some of this will help the next time so you don't have to have multiple sticks or them digging around",

      "Content": "I hate this disease so much. My best friend was dx 1 day before me (she was in OH and I was in AL), both Stage III. Compared to the care I got and she got, I was really worried about her. No doubt hers was REAL aggressive, but her surgeon (HMO and limited) didn't believe in mastectomies, even though that's what Kim wanted. Anyway, hers came back 6 months later in her liver and then about 18 months after that, to her brain. I lost her Dec. of 04. It's a horribly cruel disease to say the least. I've seen Stage IV do really well for years and still doing really well, so there's always hope. We have to keep fighting and praying for a cure. Thanks for the Happy Nedness It's hard to believe it's been 5 1/2 years since I heard those horrible words. I really think your friend knows by the way ya'll have been talking that you're there for her when she wants to talk about what she's going through and when she wants to talk about everything except. I'd say you're doing perfect just by being yourself. Prayers to you both.",

I had my PCP in my younger days tell me that vitamins were over rated as long as you eat right, but since BC, I'm taking a multi vitamin and make sure my resistance level stays up especially when my stress level is way up there. I have a cousin in Alaska, I want to say Juno and I've not talked to her in years but last time she went to FL to visit my aunt and uncle, she loved it there. That's one place I would love to see.

If they were in their 40's or 50's, I would think you'd start having them by 30. Remember that mammograms miss 45% of all breast cancers in women under 50 because of the dense breast tissue, so I would ask for a MRI.

I've already decided that I if one day I get cancer, I would rather wait for my time to die than go through chemo Somehow I missed this part. As someone who went through chemo, I don't think of it as barbaric in the least. It's doable and it's what has kept me here and doing great. My guess is if your mom passed away after 4 months, her cancer had spread to her bones or organ(s). There are many ladies that have Stage IV BC and are doing goot many years later. Sadly, like my best friend, not everyone makes it, but without chemo, people like me with a Stage III dx, wouldn't have a chance. Also, I have to say something that Lance Armstong said and I couldn't agree more. Whether someone smokes, use to smoke or whatever, NO ONE deserves to get lung cancer, so I don't feel it's \"payback\" time.",

I can't remember the exact wording, but one of the warnings was if you were taking anything to do with hormones (not sure if they meant HRT or like me Arimidex to kill them) and also caused certain tumors to grow, but didn't cause them to mutate. I now I'm NED, thank God, but I'm going to quit taking this. With my age and Stage III, I'm not taking any chances. Do you read the warning the same as me? Which one is the safest for BC ladies and the most effective? Thanks Nancy without taking Zocor tonight I'll have to call the PCP and tell him what I want changed to when you have a chance to check on that........THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

He said they all have risks, but I obviously need to get my levels down and when they did the studies on rats, there was no ammune system like people have. He said that if I was his wife or sister, he would rather see me on zocor because the others have more risks and some even have a risk of causing cancer and once we have been dx, we're more prone to get another kind.

I know, just 1 example, St. John's Wart so depression will demish the effects of chemo, as as you said, don't take anything without your onco saying it's o.k. Too many things interact with chemo and I for one, am going with what has proven to work. I found it interesting. There was a guy on t.v. on an infomercial promoting his book. Can't think of the exact name, but basically doctors are hiding stuff from us and there are all these natural ways to cure every kind of disease. Not only does the book not have any names of natrual remedies in it, the guy has served time in fed. pen for fraud. It had nothing to do with this book, but not this girl. Ya'll have a great day Nancy",

Do what you should do which is your annual check ups, including pap, pelvic and breast exam along with you self breast exams and discuss your concerns with you PCP or Gyn, whoever you go to for the annual check ups. The only thing I would add is from someone who had their annual mammgrams starting at 39, with no family history at all of any kind of cancer, the self breast exams are extremely important.

That wasn't the case. I had a 5.5 cm tumor and 9 cancerous lymph nodes. Unless they did a needle biopsy and got clear fluid and the lump disappeared, they couldn't tell by a test if it was a \"just a cyst\". If they give you an option of a needle biopsy or having the lump removed, I would have it removed for 2 reasons. 1st, a needle biopsy is painful and it's not always accurate. With them removing the lump, they send the whole thing to pathology, so it's all looked at, and then they will know for sure if it is or isn't cancer. Waiting until Monday won't be a problem. Unless the whole office is gone, you could call and make an appt. for next week and if the whole office is gone, if you called Monday, hopefully they could see you next week. Will be praying for B9 results. Let us know when you will be having it done.",

The place at the surgical site was just that, abnormal activity because of surgery. Just because the PET lights up in an area, doesn't mean it's cancer. It is the best test out there to pick up cancer earlier then any other tests, but since it is so sensitive, it does show the false positives also.

      "Content": "I posted this on someone else's thread, but didn't know if you'd go back into that one since you answered. My bio is at the bottom and on my path report and my surgeon also telling me, they found no vascular invasion. He said it wasn't a reliable test and that just because they didn't see cancer cells in the blood vessels in my breast during the mastectomy, didn't mean it wasn't there. Everyone else's I've seen seems to always be postive for vascular invasion especially if nodes are involved. Is it the slightest bit possible that somehow mine stayed in the breast and nodes and didn't get into my blood stream? I was treated agressively of course and I pray that I don't ever have to hear those words, BC again, but just curious if it's a possiblity. I was \"high risk\" according to my onco because of me being \"young\" and stage III. Thanks Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, Absolutely tell her to get a 2nd opinion!!!!!!!!!!!!! My best friend was resist to 2 chemos, but they tried her on others until she responded. I know you don't know much about the details, but do you know if she had chemo when she was 1st dx or what stage she was? I wouldn't walk to a 2nd opinion, I'd be running to one. Please keep us posted. I was dx Stage III (bio below) with a large tumor and 9+ lymph nodes. I had just turned 43 (which was against me because it's considered young for BC). I had a double mastectomy, chemo and radiation and I just had my check up Tues. and I'm 5 1/2 years out from dx and am still NED (No evidence of disease). That's not to say that good oncos don't have patients that have recurrences, but it seems like your mom's friends gave up before he even tried. My best friend had hospice come in when she needed pain meds that only a nurse could administer. Hospice won't come in while a patient is going through treatment. I say find an onco that believes in fighting like the patient. I know quite a few ladies that have mets to their lungs, bones, liver etc. and they are still going through treatment and lead as \"normal\" lives as possible. I'd tell her onco to save hospice for the patients that can't fight anymore, not for ones who hasn't even had a chance to fight.",

Once I was done with treatment, I saw my onco every 3 months for a check up which included CBC w/diff and CMP (Complete Metobolic Profile). After a year and I was still NED, he still did those 2 along with the CA27-29. I will go on Valentine's Day next year, which will be 3 years to the day that I was dx. and I'll have them all done again. I'll go to every 6 months (if my anxiety level can handle it) and still will have labs done. Ya'll are the 1st ones that I've heard of that didn't have labs during each check up. During chemo, I had it done 2 weeks after my FEC and then of course the next week, which was my chemo week. My 1st treatment he did every week to see how my system responded to chemo as far as my levels rebounding on their own. Since they did and I didn't have to get the shot for red or white counts, then it was 2 weeks after and the day of chemo. I really can't think of a logical reason that you aren't getting labs done. They show the liver enzimes, kidneys, calcium and so many things that they need to know as far as reocurrences go, along with you telling them how you're feeling. I'd ask WHY when I saw them again.

      "Content": "Hi, Everyone deals with the fear of the cancer coming back differently, and what you're doing is very normal. I lived in fear the 1st couple of years, and then gradually got better. I would have a new pain and automatically think that the cancer was back. Now, over 5 1/2 years later, if I get a new pain, I can make sense out of it, and give it a little while to get better, without the fear it's the cancer. Needless to say if it didn't get better in a couple of weeks, if I don't remember hurting myself, then I'd get it checked, but the fear has eased so much. I remember in the beginning, I would get panic attacks because of the fear. It will get better with time!!!! Don't beat yourself up, you're human and this beast is scary to say the least. Best wishes and it might be the holidays. People that haven't gone through cancer treatment and life has been as smooth as one could hope for get depressed around the holidays.",

It looks like the main reason that people get it, is too much Vitamin D and recommends staying out of the sun. I had ILC, Stage III but since Chemo put me into menopause, I didn't have my ovaries removed. With LCIS being Stage 0, I wouldn't think it would be necessary to have a hysterectomy or oopherectomy (sp), but it's something that your onco would know the benefits of, if there are some.

Even when it's sunny here and I get motivated to do something outside, I still take the supplements. I don't has osteop (sp) so I'll stop there.... lol but being on Arimidex and the bone and joint pain, I'm taking Actonel, but like you, I want to make sure I get the Vitamin D everyday regardless of how it's gotten. I had my PCP in my younger days tell me that vitamins were over rated as long as you eat right, but since BC, I'm taking a multi vitamin and make sure my resistance level stays up especially when my stress level is way up there. I have a cousin in Alaska, I want to say Juno and I've not talked to her in years but last time she went to FL to visit my aunt and uncle, she loved it there. That's one place I would love to see.

The pill, like condoms aren't 100%, but I sure wouldn't stay on the pill. Too much is known about the pill, HRT etc. I understand that not having kids is important to you, but as someone who's been dx with advanced BC and gone through multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation and was 43, I wouldn't do anything that could raise my chances of getting this disease. I've been there, done that and I'll forever have a black cloud hanging over my head, like everyone else, not knowing if and when the cancer will return. This disease SUCKS to put it mildly. I'm just giving you my view from someone who knows the reality of this disease. If you are certain you don't want kids, but don't want the have your tubes tied in case you change your mind, I'd talk to a gyn and see if there is anyway to do it and the chances being good that it could be reversed. I know my SIL had her tubes tied after 3 kids and put some kind of clamp (I don't know the technical terms and it's been years ago) so they couldn't grow back but on the same hand, if they wanted to have more kids, which hasn't happened, it would be easier to reverse it.

      "Content": "Hi, I had both breast removed. One a week after my dx and the other a year later. I had chemo and radiation as well. There is no cure for this disease, but they have come a long ways. I was high risk for recurrence because I was \"young\" and had 9+ lymph nodes. I will hit the 6 year mark before I see my onco again (saw him last month and I'm doing great). Yes, this disease can kill, but MANY of us are alive and living a full and happy life and I plan on living to be 90 Your fears are normal and your mom is on an emotional roller coaster from hell, but the roller coaster does slow down. I have no regrets about having both breasts removed or going through treatment. The hardest part for me was losing my hair, but once it was gone, the worst part of that was over. Then, my 1st bad hair day was awesome !!!!! The time will go by faster then you'd think. I can't believe it's been over 5 1/2 years since I heard those words, you have cancer, but it has. Best wishes to you both.",

      "Content": "I'm basing what I'm saying on personal experience and ladies I've met over the last 5 years since I was dx. If there's a lump, it needs to come out. Too many of us have been told that it's a cyst, or you're fine, come back in a year, when in reality, had we waited, we would have been SO much worse off, then we were when dx. Some who waited had slow growing tumors and still had early stage BC when a doc finally decided it was time for the lump to come out. This is NOT to say that all lumps are breast cancer, but I'm so thankful that I called a surgeon myself when I was told by 2 docs that I had nothing to worry about. There's a saying that lumps belong in a jar, not in our breast. With that said, if you have lumps during your period and they go away, then those kind of chances do happen during that time, but one that doesn't go away and wasn't there before is \"suspicious\" any way you look at it. I needed to know what the lump was that I knew wasn't there before, and thank God I did. We all have to do what we feel most comfortable with and what we can live with, with no regrets. If you feel confident that the tests are accurate, then of course that's your choice and your right to make that choice. I know I'd want to know for sure, because that's exactly the choice I had when I was dx. Please don't let the fear of having cancer be the reason that you're content with not having anything else done. That's all I can say and I'm just trying to help.",

The nurses got out the brochures, or whatever they are called and there was a very small % that didn't lose their hair. My hair was thick and they thought I might actually not lose it............well, about 2 weeks after my 3rd round (I had FEC every 3 weeks) I went to brush my hair and it was definately coming out. I had a few stray strands when it was all over, but definately had alot more scalp showing then anything else. If your hair is thick, that may be why yours hasn't come out yet. I was dx 2/14/02 so I'm coming up on 3 years and NED so don't think that the chemo isn't working. I've heard a few were like us and late losers, but we did lose it before it was all over. I don't think you still having your hair has anything to do with chemo not working, it's doing what it's suppose to and don't be surprised if in the next couple of weeks you start getting brush fulls of hair.

      "Content": "HI Jayne, The way my onco explained it to me was that he was doing the CA 27-29 (started them 1 1/2 years after my original dx when he was as sure as he could be that I was NED) to keep an eye on them to see what was \"normal\" for me. Mine have stayed between 8.95 and 12.75 and the last one went back down to 10.50. He said if I was having problems and the markers were still well within the normal range, he'd take my problems, like bone pain over what the tumor markers said. If the tumor markers kept going up over a period of time, he'd do testing even if I wasn't having problems. In other words, he'll watch them, but won't depend on them, it's just something to watch. I know the CEA can change if someone quits smoking, it's real sensitive and he's never done that on me. There are reasons that your markers could be going up that have nothing to do with BC. Your onco, in my opinion is being cautious and wanting to check things out since they are over 38. I'm sure you're scared, I would be too, but from what I understand, they are more reliable if you have mets to see if the treatment they are doing is working, but not a guarentee. I \"think\" that it's the white count that is involved if the bone marrow is. Have your labs been normal? When was your last PET Scan? Mine doesn't do them routinely. I have my labs done every 4 months and a chest x-ray once a year unless, like last year my hip was hurting and he did a bone scan. Everything came out fine I know Feb. seems like forever, having to wait. The waiting is always so hard. Again, I've seen alot of ladies who's markers go up and are still NED after the CT's etc. are fun. Praying yours will be the same results. If you don't mind me asking, what stage were you? Hugs and Prayers Nancy",

When you go to your GYN for your annual pap/pelvic and breast exam, they have you lay down with your arms down, then your arms up just like with a SBE because lumps may not be felt in each direction. It's been over 5 years since I had a period (chemo put me into early menopause), but it seems like the lumps went away towards the end of my period or right after. Hopefully someone else can tell you their experience since it's been so long that I may not be remembering correctly.",

      "Content": "Hi, The waiting is always SO hard. A couple of days seems like an eternity when you're finding out if you have BC or not. My mammogram missed the lump I felt and ultra sound was misread, but my gut said something was wrong and thank God I listened to my gut. I was already Stage III and was 43. Since you've been down this road before, I think it's natural to think the worse. I'm having my bone scan, chest x-ray, tumor markers and regular labs in Oct. and I have a bad feeling, but I do everytime I go. I think that black cloud we have hanging over our heads will always put fear in us from time to time, especially when something new hurts or whatever the situation. I was having lower back pain and it was bad. I went to the onco just knowing I had spine mets. He pushed on my back in a certain area and I about came off the table. He said it was a disc, but when we can find out for sure, why not be 100% sure. I had a MRI and it was a herniated disc........ Only we can celebrate something like that.... lol The pain in your shoulder could be so many things besides BC, but I know how you feel and that you're worried. What was your original dx and how long ago? Keeping you in my prayers and will wait to here B9 from you soon Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Liza, I'm by no means implying that I know nearly as much as Leo does but wanted to tell you a little bit based on my situation. My bio is at the bottom. I was 43 when dx, so after I was done with chemo and radiation, I was put on Tamoxifen because my onco felt that at my age, I would start having periods again within 6 months after I finsihed chemo (they quit during chemo). After 6 months had come and gone and at that time it was showing Arimidex to be superior to Tamoxifen, he did a blood test to see if chemo had put me into MENTALpause or not. The blood test showed that it had and I was able to switch to Arimidex. Arimidex is only for women who are post menopausal so he wanted to be sure. From what I understand the general rule is if you haven't had a period for a year, you're considered post menopausal. I would think if you've not had one since chemo, which would be over 6 months ago if my brain is working right, you probably are post, but you can always have the test run for your peace of mind. We definately need peace of mind anytime we can get it. I'll let Leo address this and your other questions so if I am mistaken, he can correct me. That's just how it was determined with me that I was. Take care Nancy",

I bet you're even more glad.... lol I'm still having a hard time dealing with the loss of my close friends Kim and Donna so close together and my check up is in 2 weeks, which just adds a touch (yea right) more anxiety.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sure my brain won't remember everything, but I'll try 1st - NO test can tell if it's cancer or not, just if there is something \"abnormal\" and depending on what they see, a good radiologist can have increased cause for concern. The only way to know if a lump is cancerous or not, or if microcalificaitons are cancerous or not is by removing the lump/cluster and have it sent to pathology. The one that's recommending a biopsy is ABSOLUTELY right. Age, family hx, plays a roll, but a very small one. I was 43, no hx of any kind of cancer in my family. I was dx Stage III (bio at bottom). This is not to say that you have cancer, but I was told to come back in a year, I was fine, it was \"just a cyst\". Well, the \"cyst\" ended up being a 5.5 cm tumor. I didn't have a year to wait and thank God I called a surgeon myself, but the radiologist that read your mammogram is telling you to have a biopsy. Someone gave you some bad info 8 years ago. There is no such thing as too young. I've met ladies that were in the 20's, 30s and 40s and they weren't the exception, there are many of us unfortunately. Did they do a needle biopsy and get fluid out of the lump and the lump completely disappeared? They can't tell by a US or mammogram if it's a fluid filled cyst. I know that 1st hand. Also, I don't know what the latest stats are, but about 10 years ago, it was said that 80% of lumps were B9, but I'm sure now since the odds of being dx with BC, the number is probably more like 75%. Those are still good odds, but when it comes to our lives, it's not time to play the odds. I too am very sorry to hear about your mom. I have no doubt that she would want you to be pro-active and do what needs to be done to know for sure if it's cancer or not. If it's not, celebrate. If it is, we'll be here to help you through. Please let us know what you biopsy shows and as long as it's been going on, I'd get it ASAP.",

      "Content": "Hi Pastor Rich, I noticed FEC. Is that the chemo regime she's on? The only combo of chemo that I've heard that you don't lose all your hair necessarlily, but definately thin out is CMF. I doubt she's getting that being stage III. If she's getting FEC, that's the 3 I was on and I had hopes I wouldn't lose mine because it took awhile. Normally, ladies lose it on the 14th day after the 1st round of chemo. My hair was real thick and that may be why I didn't lose mine until after the 3rd round of FEC, or it may have been a fluke, but I ended up losing all of it even though it started later. If it's FEC, or AC w/Taxol or Taxotere, she's going to lose it unfortunately. What I did, and I'm not sure how long your wife's hair is, is I cut mine 3 different times to make it not such a huge shock until it was right under my ears. He was well below my shoulder and is AGAIN . If her hair is long, why not cut some of the length, so she can still wear the wig. That way she gets use to it and when it does start coming out, she'll be use to seeing herself in the wig. Some ladies I've heard comes out in clumps. With mine, I went to brush it one morning and with ever stroke, the brush was full of hair. I handled both my mastectomies better then losing my hair, so don't be surprised if she takes it hard, I guess it's the outer part of who we are, where at least with a mastecomy(ies), there are clothes cover us. Best wishes to your wife and please keep us posted on how she's doing and how YOU are doing. Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Marion, I don't blame you at all for pushing the issue and I would do the exact same thing. All I know is when I had my simple mastectomy on the non BC side and attempted reconstruction, they sent the incision area from the original MRM to pathology to check for a local reoccurence. I don't know how common it is, but it's not rare from what I understand to have a local reoccurence at the incision line. IF and I'm sure it's a small chance, but IF it is BC in the incision line, that doesn't make you a stage IV, it's a local and you continue on the NED path but obviously have to get rid of it. I'm sure you'll be giving us good news and Im glad you're onco is like mine. He doesn't do unnecessary testing, but even if he feels everything is fine, if he knows another test will give me piece of mind, he'll do it for me and that means a lot. Hugs",

My best friend was Stage IV and she got a lot of the chemos that women who aren't Stage IV get. Not many, but a few have a rough time with chemo. I know one lady that did and they had to switch the kinds of chemo she was taking. Sadly it sounds like your mom was one of the very few I know ladies who's mom had BC and they also were dx down the road. It accounts for about 15% of all BC dx. Many get dx with no family history. About 80% (could be a little more or less since I was dx) of ladies dx have cancer that feeds off hormones. I was told I got it because I had hormones, but there are ladies that are estrogen/progesterine negative, meaning their cancer didn't feed on hormones. They have come a long way, but a LOT is yet to be learned.",

      "Content": "Hi, I found an \"egg size\" mass in my breast 3 years ago Monday. My tumor ended up being 5.5 cm. That included any tissue around the actual tumor that had cancer cells in it as well. The didn't do SNB 3 years ago when I was dx, so when they did the mastectomy, they removed all my lymph nodes as well. As you can see at the bottom of this page, I had 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16. It's always better not to have lymph nodes involved BUT, IF she does have positive nodes, that doesn't mean that she can't live to be a ripe old age. Having positive nodes doesn't mean the end of the road. I know quite a few ladies, like me were dx with Stage III and had as many nodes positive as me and some more and they are doing great 5, 6 and 9 years out. Treatment is even better today then it was 3 years ago when I was dx. I was also considered \"high risk\" because I was \"young\". They will check and see if she is hormone receptive, which means that her cancer feeds off of hormones (estrogen and progesterine). That is a good thing because there are meds out there that, like me, I'm taking for 5 years. The one I'm taking is Arimidex. If she's estrogen/progesterine negative, again that does NOT mean that she won't live to be a ripe old age. They can tell alot by testing the tissue they remove. I'd definately have someone be with your mom at every visit. It is very overwhelming to hear that you have BC and I know I didn't hear 1/2 of what my oncologist said. Not that I wasn't listening, but our brains shut down when it can't absorb anymore and every visit, whoever went with me heard things I didn't and that was good. Have her write a list of questions that she has so she doesn't forget them. Another term you'll hear is HER2. You'd rather have that negative. Someone with a tiny tumor and no nodes can have a reoccurence as well as someone with a large tumor and positive nodes can go and not have a reoccuence. There is no sense to this disease, it has a mind of it's own. I personally, plan on being around for a long time Keep us posted and if you have any more questions, ask away. All of us have been there and done that or going through it now. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

For those who have seen it on the national news, there was a 17 year old that killed his mother, on the street that the houses on my street back yards meet. They did catch him in VA and he'll be coming back to pay the piper. It brought back some pretty bad memories of the abusive jerk I was married to, but I'll be ok. Just glad they caught him. I wasn't leaving my house until they did. Hugs to all and I'm getting my act together. Hopefully after my check up on the 14th, that will relieve alot of the extra anxiety, as long as it's good news of course. Talk to everyone soon Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, First, I'm sorry that you lost your mom to this horrible disease!!! And, yes, you should get an annual mammgram, and if you have a family history of BC, you are at higher risk. With that said, don't just count on a mammogram, also do self breast examines. I was 43 when Dx and had NO history of cancer of any kind that I know of for at least 2 generations. I was the 1st with breast cancer. My mammogram missed mine and it was 5.5 cm. They don't catch all BC, but they are the best thing we have now, and definitely worth having one. If you notice a lump, even if your mammogram doesn't find anything, don't stop there. Go to a surgeon and get a biopsy done. Eating healthy and taking care of yourself is never a bad thing, and can only help your overall health, but it doesn't make you immune to breast cancer. I asked why I got BC when there was no history is my family and the answer I got 5+ years ago, was because I had hormones. Not all BC feeds off hormones, but about 80% of dx's do. Being afraid is understandable, but not doing anything just makes the prognosis worse because the cancer has time to grow and spread. Mine wasn't caught early, but I'm still here 5+ years later and plan on staying around But, caught early, the prognosis is much better and the treatment isn't as aggressive. My bio is at the bottom. Best wishes and be proactive with you health care and get the tests that are available along with monthly self exams.",

My onco did a bone scan, CT Scan of my chest and a chest x-ray, along with a bunch of labs. They want to rule out the cancer spreading into organs or the bones. That was 5 1/2 years ago, so they might do a MRI or a PET now, but I feel certain her onco will be giving her tests. If it has spread, they will have a different line of treatment because she'd be Stage IV. With 1 node +, I would think the chances of it having spread are very very low. I know you hated to leave, but I know how much help you were to her, emotionally and just helping out in general. Keep us posted!!!",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sure my brain won't remember everything, but I'll try 1st - NO test can tell if it's cancer or not, just if there is something \"abnormal\" and depending on what they see, a good radiologist can have increased cause for concern. The only way to know if a lump is cancerous or not, or if microcalificaitons are cancerous or not is by removing the lump/cluster and have it sent to pathology. The one that's recommending a biopsy is ABSOLUTELY right. Age, family hx, plays a roll, but a very small one. I was 43, no hx of any kind of cancer in my family. I was dx Stage III (bio at bottom). This is not to say that you have cancer, but I was told to come back in a year, I was fine, it was \"just a cyst\". Well, the \"cyst\" ended up being a 5.5 cm tumor. I didn't have a year to wait and thank God I called a surgeon myself, but the radiologist that read your mammogram is telling you to have a biopsy. Someone gave you some bad info 8 years ago. There is no such thing as too young. I've met ladies that were in the 20's, 30s and 40s and they weren't the exception, there are many of us unfortunately. Did they do a needle biopsy and get fluid out of the lump and the lump completely disappeared? They can't tell by a US or mammogram if it's a fluid filled cyst. I know that 1st hand. Also, I don't know what the latest stats are, but about 10 years ago, it was said that 80% of lumps were B9, but I'm sure now since the odds of being dx with BC, the number is probably more like 75%. Those are still good odds, but when it comes to our lives, it's not time to play the odds. I too am very sorry to hear about your mom. I have no doubt that she would want you to be pro-active and do what needs to be done to know for sure if it's cancer or not. If it's not, celebrate. If it is, we'll be here to help you through. Please let us know what you biopsy shows and as long as it's been going on, I'd get it ASAP.",

      "Content": "So having \"just a cyst\" after an ultrasound is no guarantee that there was no cancer at the time?! :\\ I was told that mine was a \"B9 cyst\" based on the reading of the ultra sound. That wasn't the case. I had a 5.5 cm tumor and 9 cancerous lymph nodes. Unless they did a needle biopsy and got clear fluid and the lump disappeared, they couldn't tell by a test if it was a \"just a cyst\". If they give you an option of a needle biopsy or having the lump removed, I would have it removed for 2 reasons. 1st, a needle biopsy is painful and it's not always accurate. With them removing the lump, they send the whole thing to pathology, so it's all looked at, and then they will know for sure if it is or isn't cancer. Waiting until Monday won't be a problem. Unless the whole office is gone, you could call and make an appt. for next week and if the whole office is gone, if you called Monday, hopefully they could see you next week. Will be praying for B9 results. Let us know when you will be having it done.",

She finished treatment about 6 months ago, and so far so good. Never give up hope!! She has the most common kind of cancer, Invasive Ductal but the difference is, her has a lot of mucous. I'd say she needs to get started with her treatment ASAP. Did she had a modified radial mastectomy? Oncos do things different ways, but I'd want the mastectomy NOW and get rid of the known cancer and then get started with chemo and rads as soon as she healed. Has anyone done a bone scan and other tests to see if it's spread anywhere else? My onco is the one that ordered those, so she may not have yet. Praying it's nowhere else!! I didn't have it in my chest wall, but I did have ILC and 9 lymph nodes positive. It's been 5 1/2 years and I had just turned 42 (the younger the worst) and I'm doing great. Living with NED (No Evidence of Disease). Please let us know when she gets an onco appt. I got mine within a week after my followup with my surgeon said I had healed enough from surgery to get started on chemo.",

      "Content": "I'd check on going out of town to another oncologist. At the time I was dx, I lived in a small city and drove an hour each way (or had someone drive me) not only for the surgeries but also chemo and rads. I realize I was Stage III and that along with my age but me high risk for a reoccurence, but I was er/pr+, her2- and had all the bone scans, CT scans, etc. before I started treatment so they knew it hadn't gone past the nodes. Everyone I know, even stage I goes every 3 months in the beginning and for 2 years, then they go to every 6 months for 3 years and then yearly. Not to scare you and by what you are saying, your chances are good of not having a reoccurence, but I've known stage I with no node involvement, tiny tumors and had a mastectomy and chemo, just to better their odds and have had reoccurences. Seriously look for an onco outside your city. If he's blowing you off like you had a cold, that can't be comforting for you at all and God knows this isn't a cold and until there is a cure, no one is guarenteed not to have a reoccurence. You deserve the best care possible and you're not getting it. You have to be your own advocate and demand good care. It's your life and if yours doesn't seem to care about it, you do and we do!!!!!!! I lost a very close friend this month and her care compared to mine, sucked. She was stage III like me, but things they did and didn't do, compared to my care and treatment, they never gave her a fighting chance.",

I know my former MIL had a reoccurence to her lungs and one of the nodes in her neck. The surgeon felt certain it would be cancer, but a biopsy was done. It was BC mets from the biopsy they took from her neck. He was a different surgeon then I used 2 years later when I was dx, but he also said the same thing when someone questioned him, that it wasn't going to cause the cancer to spread when air hit it. There are so many things that we've heard all our lives that we just assume they are true. How many were told not to go outside with a wet head or we'd get sick... lol Of course something like air hitting cancer and causing it to spread it a much more important thing to know.

      "Content": "You can always get a 2nd opinion without leaving the onco you are with now. I'd check and see who other people used regardless of what kind of cancer they may have had and get a referral that way. Word of mouth is usually the best way to go. If you can't find anyone, look and see who else in your area has oncologists and make an appt. You can have a copy of all your records faxed over there and no doctor should have a problem with you getting a second opinion. If they do, then that to me would be a red flag. You have to be an advocate in your own health care and like me and most of us, you'll do whatever it takes to give you the best possible chance of never having to deal with this beast again. Just my opinion but as upset as you are, I don't think you will rest until you get a 2nd opinioin and that is definately your decision. I have no doubt if I wasn't completely satisfied in the care and treatment I was getting, I would have gotten a 2nd opinion. Friends referred me to my onco, plus I had heard a lot about him, and it was all good and in a city this big, that made me feel good. Him being head of oncology at the cancer institute made me feel good too. I always felt that he had my best interest and he was determined for me to be a survivor. I know there are no guarentees and never were, but if mine comes back, I know it's not because of anything he did or didn't do and that to me is the way everyone should feel about someone who's treating them for something as serious as cancer. Hugs and prayers and keep me posted. Nancy",

After 6 months once I completed treatment and I never had a period again, he did a blood test to determine that chemo had put me into menopause and then I was switched to Arimidex. He is right, Arimidex is for post menopausal ladies only, but Tamoxifen is for ladies who are not post. I asked my onco about having my ovaries removed to get rid of more hormones since I was Stage III, young and high risk and there was nothing that pointed him in the direction that it would be a benefit to me and saw no reason to put me through that. I have heard of ladies that were given something and put into menopause, but if I remember, they were the ones that hadn't had a period in a year and were on Arimidex and since that is only for post menopausal ladies, they were given whatever the med was to put them into menopause so they could continue the Arimidex. It's all so confusing. Best wishes Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, It's very common for BC survivors to have trouble sleeping. I don't know if it has to do with the chemo, or the fact that we have alot of fatigue going through it and cat nap on and off pretty much day and night. I've literally not had a good nights sleep in over 3 years. I thought it was because I was going through a nasty divorce to say the least and being dx with advanced BC at the same time. The more I talk to ladies, it seems to be very common, so I'm sure the idiot I married (no, I'm not bitter....LOL) didn't help, but it seems that the surgeries, chemo, rads etc. is a huge factor. I don't like taking meds, but I've had to be put on BP med and med for cholesterol in the last 6 months along with Paxil, xanax, vitamins, Actonel to counteract the bone loss that Arimidex can cause and I guess it looks like I do like taking meds....lol I really don't. I finally had enough of not sleeping and broke down and talked to my PCP and onco and between the two of them talking, I've probably tried 6 different meds and they don't phase me. I was put on elavil and then they doubled it, so I don't get sleepy, but when I lay down, I can sleep. I actually got 5 hours last night which is the most I've gotten. We can't let our bodies get run down and we have to get sleep so we can fight any of these satan cells that could be still lurking. I know it's you're choice, but my opinion, which I know you didn't ask for, is think about taking something if it goes on much longer. Something like bendryl over the counter works like a sleeping pill to some and it's just an antihestime (sp). Hugs and best wishes and I'll wait and here how things go. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Pastor Rich, I noticed FEC. Is that the chemo regime she's on? The only combo of chemo that I've heard that you don't lose all your hair necessarlily, but definately thin out is CMF. I doubt she's getting that being stage III. If she's getting FEC, that's the 3 I was on and I had hopes I wouldn't lose mine because it took awhile. Normally, ladies lose it on the 14th day after the 1st round of chemo. My hair was real thick and that may be why I didn't lose mine until after the 3rd round of FEC, or it may have been a fluke, but I ended up losing all of it even though it started later. If it's FEC, or AC w/Taxol or Taxotere, she's going to lose it unfortunately. What I did, and I'm not sure how long your wife's hair is, is I cut mine 3 different times to make it not such a huge shock until it was right under my ears. He was well below my shoulder and is AGAIN . If her hair is long, why not cut some of the length, so she can still wear the wig. That way she gets use to it and when it does start coming out, she'll be use to seeing herself in the wig. Some ladies I've heard comes out in clumps. With mine, I went to brush it one morning and with ever stroke, the brush was full of hair. I handled both my mastectomies better then losing my hair, so don't be surprised if she takes it hard, I guess it's the outer part of who we are, where at least with a mastecomy(ies), there are clothes cover us. Best wishes to your wife and please keep us posted on how she's doing and how YOU are doing. Hugs Nancy",

I had 9 positive lymph nodes and I'm 4 years out. It doesn't mean it won't come back, but having no nodes involved is no guarentee it won't either. Having BC in your lymph nodes doesn't make you a Stage 4. If it comes back to the lungs, bones etc. then yes, that it what makes someone a Stage 4. Has her oncologist done a bone scan to see if the cancer is back in her bones? If she's taking Tamoxifen, that can cause problems and I would definitely go and have a gyn check up. One of the side affects from Tamoxifen CAN, not always and not often, but can cause uterine cancer. She needs to get her onco on the ball and start running tests to find out whats going on with her.

      "Content": "Hi Kaz, I know how scary it is to hear you need a biopsy. My mammogram came back \"normal\" even though I felt something that wasn't right. Biopies aren't bad at all and I'm the President of the Whimp Club My guess is it will be an incisional biopsy which is the kind you'd want as far as getting accurate results. You aren't put under with general anesthesia. I was given Versaid (The I don't give a **** shot) and one minute you're awake and the next min. you're awake and it's over. They will remove the cluster and some tissue around it. In my case they removed a good size area (3.5 cm) and I had a small incision. I was sore, but it wasn't bad at all. As far as not having it done and having regrets. The only way you'll know if it's cancer or not is to have a biopsy. If it's not, then you can relax and not worry about it, but if it is and you don't have it done, then the tumor will continue to grow. I can't imagine how you couldn't have regrets by not having it done if it is cancer. The earlier caught, the better prognosis. You'll see my bio at the end of this. Mine was advanced and it's been almost 3 years and I'm still doing good. I had mine biopsied ASAP. Trying to forget it exists isn't going to make it go away. PLEASE get the biopsy. We're literally talking about your life!!!! Prayers and keep up posted. Nancy",

I didn't, so he did the lab work and chemo did put me into MENTALpause, so I switched from Tamoxifen to Arimidex. I was \"thinking\" (dangerous for me to do these days) that someone had said they could give you meds to put you into menopause, and therefore you could take Arimidex or Femara or which ever one they were going to put you on. I orignally asked for my ovaries to be removed based on my age, stage, etc. but after looking at my case, family history, said that it would not be of benefit. I thought getting every bit of estrogen/progesterine out of me couldn't do anything but help...... there I go thinking again.... lol I'm sure Leo can tell you more. Best wishes Nancy",

Of course because of my age and it had only been 6 months since treatment, he did the blood test to see if I was post or not. I asked the lab tech how they could tell and he said there would be one hormone either present or not, can't remember which, and that would tell them. I couldn't have switched had I not had that blood test to Arimidex. I'm still amazed at the GYNs that try to put BC survivors who are er/pr+ on HRT.",

      "Content": "First, let me say how sorry I am that you lost your wife to cancer. It is definately a very cruel disease. On the list of chemos that you typed out, not one of them, unless things have changed very much, are chemos given for BC during original dx. Since I've never had BC mets, and pray I never do, I don't know alot about the chemos used but the only one I've ever heard of on that list is Gemzar. Just my personal feelings, I'll take the 30% chance of kidney problems instead of the 100% chance that I'll die if I don't take it. I have no doubt had I not taken the treatment I did, I wouldn't be here now and would have been gone long ago. I was Stage III and that's not far from Stage IV. Did you wife have breast cancer if you don't mind me asking? I know Suzanne Somers said she didn't want chemo because it was poison, but she injected herself in the stomach for 5 years and still doing it with mistletoe extract............which is poison. I pray that everyone stays NED regardless of the route they choose, but for me, I took the route with proven results. I do take a multi vitamin, calcium w/Vitamin D since I'm taking Arimidex. Arimidex has caused my cholesterol to be very high, especially the lipids, so besides cholesterol/lipid medicine, I take Omega 3 capsules everyday. I've changed my diet to include plenty of anti-oxidents (sp) everyday, especially blueberries in my oatmeal every a.m. This is what was best for me, not to say it is for everyone. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Betty, I tried to have expanders and then implants done for reconstruction when I decided to have the other breast removed since I was \"young\" and had ILC which is prone to spread to the other breast. I've heard good stories about tissue expanders when radiation has been used, but my PS will no longer do it. I tried and my expander on the radiated side was extremely painful and when the PS went in to get rid of some of the scar tissue from rads, the tissue expander was literally trying to push back out of my chest near the sternum. Needless to say, I woke up with no expanders. I wish now I had opted for the LD Flap, but I'm content being boobless and NED. One day, maybe I will try again, but no time soon. Hopefully it being so long since you had radiation will make a difference and your reconstruction much easier. Hugs Nancy",

Thank God his were all basil cell cancer. There was a discussion yesterday on t.v. by a doctor that said your body can't absorb more the 400 mg or mch or whatever size D is measured in and that anything above that isn't helpful, but I have no idea how long being in the sun would give you that much. He said when taking Vitamin D to take 400 in the a.m. and 400 in the pm, that you needed to spread them out to get the full benefit from the Vitamin D. Can't help you about natural sun exposure, but I'm sure someone will have more info.",

I've moved back to the city I lived in before I got married, which is where my onco is and haven't found a job yet. I don't know if you're referring to a prevous post about mine doing things like that for people or not but it's a right off, no one else ends up paying my bill for me. I have plenty of bills I have to pay. Again, I just stated my opinion and for me, a, there isn't enough info on it yet, or we don't know when it comes to things like soy, I'm not risking it. We all make our decisions based on what we feel is best for us, and as long as we are comfortable with our decisions, that's all that matters. If I had listened to the mammogram and the doctors where I did live and waited a year to have another mammogram, I wouldn't be here today. Listening to our guts usually ends up being what's right for us is there is no definate anwer. Well, I'm going to get ready to be pounded by Katrina.

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I don't know where Gulf Port, MS is and the other city, but I know they have opened the (just went blank) big stadium in New Orleans for those who can't evacuate. Are they close to there? If they can get out, I'd have them go west. North AL where I am is under a Hurricane Warning and that's a 1st for us. We normally get high winds and rain from the aftermath, but she's coming too strong and fast and we're right in her path. My prayers are with your family and of course you as well. I know how worried you must be. Hopefully they have cell phones so they can keep in touch with you. I was born and raised in St. Petersburg, FL and I was young, so didn't realize the severity of hurriances, but I can sure remember using a surf board like a boat, of course when it was over, us kids thought it was fun, but being an adult, we realize reality. Praying Katina moves quickly out of their area and you'll get a phone call saying they are just fine. Take care and FOX news seems to be doing a better job then the weather channel, so hopefully knowing that no one is hurt will ease your mind until you can talk to them. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

      "Content": "Rachelle, Please do keep us posted. Also, I feel like a hypercrite (can't even spell it) because I hate when doctors automatically chalk women's chest pains to anxiety/stress. I've had a problem with anxiety and take medicine for it and have for several years since my dx. Since you have been checked out and they have ruled out any heart problems, like the cardiologist that I was sent to did, it could be anxiety causing the chest pains. Also, I won't even attempt to spell it, but E........ Reflux can cause horrible chest pains. I have that from time to time, but don't have the burning from acid in my throat, but have chest pains. My mother has it so bad, she's actually in the Medical Journals and has gone to Shands in Gainseville, FL and has tried every medicine made. She does have the burning from the acid backing up and bad chest pains. The doctor told her that the symptoms are very similiar to a heart attack and if she notices anything different from another attack, to get to the ER. I just wanted to throw those up as possiblities and hopefully your doctor can figure out what's causing your chest pains too. They are definately scary. Talk to you tomorrow when you get back from the doc. Hugs Nancy",

My dad has had far too many skin cancers removed but he was born and raised in FL and went fishing a lot long before they found out the dangers of sun to the skin. Thank God his were all basil cell cancer. There was a discussion yesterday on t.v. by a doctor that said your body can't absorb more the 400 mg or mch or whatever size D is measured in and that anything above that isn't helpful, but I have no idea how long being in the sun would give you that much. He said when taking Vitamin D to take 400 in the a.m. and 400 in the pm, that you needed to spread them out to get the full benefit from the Vitamin D. Can't help you about natural sun exposure, but I'm sure someone will have more info.",

I've always had 20/20 vision and I've notice that things seem blurry at times, especially up close. I know the print has gotten smaller in things like the t.v. guide etc., but I really have to get some things in just the right light to be able to read it. It will be 3 years in June since I've had chemo and it's not gotten any better. I'm going to get my eyes checked as soon as I can have a few months of a break for docs.....ugh My onco is Monday and my general surgeon is May 1 and dentist inbetween. I think my rads onco is in April. Right now I'm going to get through Monday, go to Talladega and escape reality and then back to the doctors...... The one thing I can say about this disease, is once we have it, we don't get blown off and everything chalked up to be stress. Some of course is, but it's nice to know that someone takes you seriously now. Hugs Nancy",

I like the surgery 1st like I had, just because they know exactly what they are dealing with. With chemo 1st, they don't know what size the tumor really was, because surrounding tissue can be cancerous and with the chemo shrinking it, there's no way to be sure of the size of tumor and nodes involved etc. In your sister's case, since it has already spread to the bones, the size of the tumor isn't a factor as far as treatment goes. I'm just still surprised that they did chemo after everything else and after 6 weeks, decided that Tamoxifen didn't work. You take that for 5 years AFTER chemo. I started taking it after chemo and before I started radiation. I personally would get another opinion. They need to get down to some aggressive treatment.",

The pill, like condoms aren't 100%, but I sure wouldn't stay on the pill. Too much is known about the pill, HRT etc. I understand that not having kids is important to you, but as someone who's been dx with advanced BC and gone through multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation and was 43, I wouldn't do anything that could raise my chances of getting this disease. I've been there, done that and I'll forever have a black cloud hanging over my head, like everyone else, not knowing if and when the cancer will return. This disease SUCKS to put it mildly. I'm just giving you my view from someone who knows the reality of this disease. If you are certain you don't want kids, but don't want the have your tubes tied in case you change your mind, I'd talk to a gyn and see if there is anyway to do it and the chances being good that it could be reversed. I know my SIL had her tubes tied after 3 kids and put some kind of clamp (I don't know the technical terms and it's been years ago) so they couldn't grow back but on the same hand, if they wanted to have more kids, which hasn't happened, it would be easier to reverse it.

      "Content": "HI, I've personally never heard of shingles causing lymph nodes to swell, but that doesn't mean they can't. Are your shingles under the arm area? I would definately want the node biopsied even though I think it's unlikely it's cancer since you just finished chemo and still going through radiation. Mine didn't feel enlarged at all, couldn't even feel them but I had 9+ so just like not feeling anything doesn't mean they are clear, just like feeling something doesn't mean it's cancer. Again, just my opinion, get it biopsied, it's the only way you'll know for sure and we can use all the peace of mind we can get. We worry enough about things that aren't there (I don't mean imagine, I meant like bone pain after we whack our leg on something and forget until a bruse or lump shows up). Keep us posted. Hugs Nancy",

Someone else (chemo brain, can't remember who) was asking about one and I looked it up and it was made out of a poison snake's venom and thinned the blood out, but the person at the health food store recommended it. I personally am staying with a multi vitamin and Calcium w/Vitamin D and so far, 3 years and 3 months out from my dx from Stage III ILC. Of course you have every right to take what you want, but I would really suggest checking with your onco 1st and checking on the internet to see what all is in there and what it affects. Hugs",

For what it's worth, I didn't have a PICC or anything and had chemo and labs done each time because I HAD such good veins. Chemo can and in my case did cause the veins to harden like scar tissue and chemo also causes the veins to roll. Either though it's been over 2 years since I had any chemo, they have a hard time now getting a vein. The bloodwork isn't so bad because they use butterfly needles, but for surgeries, I get stuck no less then twice and usually 3 times because of what the chemo did to my veins. Just wanted to pass that along incase the onco still talks about a PICC line, she might want to consider it. Nancy",

The longer you go without a reoccurence, the better the chances are you won't. But, if you read some of these sites, they say that our chances of having a reoccurence increase after 5 years. I have faith in my onco and it makes sense that the longer you go without one, the less likely you are to have one because it shows you weren't chemo resistant. Just one more thing that is there to confuse us and make us go more nuts...... I'm already nuts, so I don't have much farther to go... lol I know with Tamoxefin, studies showed no benefit to taking it 10 years vs 5 and if I read it right, it was basically saying that after 5 years it's tought, for lack of a better word, your body to do on it's own what it does for you. I could have totally misunderstood that though. After 6 months of Tamoxefin and more info out on Arimidex, I opted with my onco's blessings to change to Arimidex because it was showing to be superior to Arimidex and since the 5 year study has come out just recently, it's showing that it IS superior in preventing reoccurences. And they wonder why we are confused........geesh",

      "Content": "Hi Kristen, I'm not 100% sure about this, but I'm sure Leo can tell you, but when I was concerned about my neice since I was dx with BC young and if I'm not mistaken, I was told that she would need to be tested, not me since I know I had the gene since I was dx with BC. I don't think I would have any bearing on her since she's my brother's daughter and it's looked at as far as the maternal side. My mother is 82 and never had any kind of cancer, her mom, my grandmother died at 86, never any kind of cancer and my aunts on my mom's side died in their late 80s and never any cancer. I guess I was just lucky....geesh I can understand your concern having sisters and a daughter and I'd ask your onco when you see him/her next or Leo. There are alot of sites out there, but you never know which ones are good for accurate and updated info. I was told by my onco, if I had to look something up, to use WebMD. Good luck and I hope you get some answers soon to ease your mind. Nancy",

I was dx ILC so I definately don't know alot about IDC besides the fact that it is the most \"common\" kind of BC. I would think they couldn't call it DCIS if it had spilled over into the lobules. Isn't DCIS incapulated? I thought that is what in situ meant, but I could be very wrong so if it spilled over into the lobules, it would be IDC???????? Thank God for Leo because he can explain what it means and we can both learn. I wasn't trying to butt in, but wanted to give you those sites to look at until Leo could answer your question in case they could explain it. Sorry I was no help. Nancy",

I didn't start losing mine until the end of my 3rd treatment........ so much for thinking I'd be the 1 in a 100,000 that didn't lose theirs or whatever the odds were with the 3 chemo's I took together. Fatigue is a given with chemo. Some work all through treatments, some have accumulative affect and get more tired with each treatment. The day of chemo I felt fine, it was day 2 when it hit me. Everyone reacts differently so it's hard to know. Hope she has an easy time of it. Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, First thing is get to a surgeon and have your mom's lump removed and biopsied. If it is cancer, she will have a choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy. I was 43 when dx and I opted for a mastectomy, I wanted to make sure there were no lingering cancer cells in my breast. When they do the lumpectomy/mastectomy, they will check her lymph nodes to see if it has spread there. If they have gone to her nodes, it's not a death sentence nor does it mean that she won't respond well to treatment. I had a 5.5 cm tumor, which is large (mammogram missed it and I had mine every year) and 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16 that were cancerous. It's been over 3 years and I'm still NED (No evidence of disease) and there are MANY women that have positive nodes that do great. They will, or should do a bone scan to make sure it hasn't gone to her bones, probably a CT Scan of the chest to make sure it's not a local matastises (sp) to her chest wall etc. They will run a complete metabolic profile for her labs and this way they can tell if it has spread anywhere else in her body. Since the lump has been there for 2 years, she needs to get it done now. I have several friends in NY, but not that familiar with different areas, but I will ask them if they know of any cancer centers that they would recommend. Right now the most important thing is get her to a surgeon and get that lump REMOVED and biopsied. The only good lump is one in a jar. Please feel free to e-mail me anytime and I'll let you know what my friends say in NY. I know I'll talk to one later today and I'll call the other one. They also know of other ladies in the general area who could hopefully also help, but again, you need to find out if it's cancer and get it out of her body. I know you're scared, it's a scary disease, but again me and so many I know are doing great even with node involvement, one had all positive nodes and she is 7 years out, so try to relax until you know what's going on, but I wouldn't put it off since it's been there 2 years. If it's cancer, it's continuing to grow. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

Mine, is still given every 3 weeks, probably because I got 3 at the same time. So, since ya'll have been dx, they have made progress on finding better treatments Everyone responds to chemo different, where one may have nausea, someone else won't. I think fatigue is a given with any chemo, but don't assume it's going to be rough, because it may be easier on you then someone else and I pray it goes easy and I KNOW ya'll will do great through treatment.

      "Content": "Hi, To some extent, I can understand the fear of the unknown, but when I found my lump, I went and got it checked. Even though I had no hx, which found out later that has little to do with most BC's and I was \"young\" I knew the lump didn't belong there. I called a surgeon myself when I was told to come back in a year because the mammogram didn't pick up what I and my doc clearly felt. Fear is very real when it comes to cancer, but ignoring it just makes it grow and spread. I pray it's not in her lungs, but it is suspicious. Ladies are Stage IV and chemo can kick butt and keep them stable and I know of one lady that had IBC, had it spread to her lungs, nodes and liver and she went back NED (No Evidence of Disease) and has been there for 2 years. Stable is the most realistic hope, but stable is a good thing. I pray she'll take treatment. As Jim said, be there for her, help when you feel you can and if she doesn't want you to, she'll say something. I wanted to be as independant as I could, especially living alone and not wanting my parents to make the drive to help, but when I needed help, I would ask. Everyone handles it different and you'll know. Having her family around and being supportive and just knowing she has people that love her will be a big help Keep us posted!!",

They will be able to tell through pathology if it's a recurrence of the original BC or if it's a new primary. Was her dx 15 years ago Invasive Lobular? Did the doctor this time say it was Invasive or Lobular In Situ? Jim is right, they take the tissue and substance of the breast with a mastectomy, but they can't get it all. Where we have stitches from a mastectomy is tissue on the cancer side. From what I understand, many times if it returns to a mastectomy side, it's on the scar line and if caught early, it hasn't gone anywhere else and considered a local recurrence. It can also come back to the chest wall. Please let us know the stage etc. with you get the pathology report back.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm going to give my opinion on one and info on the other.......a double ramble...... lol I wasn't dx with early stage BC, mine was advanced. I don't know who or what this radio show is you're talking about, but I would suggest anyone who has been told by their oncologist to have chemo, to ask the onco questions vs a radio show. He knows risk factors as far as er/pr and Her2Neu, how aggressive etc. I've always heard that ladies with early stage BC are told how much it would help with their odds of not having a reoccurence and I think they need to base it on that and if they have confidence in their onco, his opinion also. There of course is no guarentee for any of us, but some would rather go through chemo even if it's only a 5% benefit of avoiding a reoccurence and do everything the 1st time around, then regret not doing everything possible the 1st time around. It definately has to be what the person thinks is best for them and a decision they have to live with. As far as the link and the drugs. I take Arimidex. The drugs on that page are for ladies who's cancer feeds on estrogen and/or progesterine which of course are hormones. It's something that we can use to help prevent a reoccurence.",

      "Content": "There's no doubt this is a crap shoot. I've seen Stage I ladies that took Tamoxifen and nothing else and have distant mets. A lot of the ladies in probably the last year seem to be opting for 4 rounds of A/C to have the best chance possible. All the studies and stats that are out for different stages include all ages from 20-100, it doesn't matter if er/pr+ or what their Her2Neu status is, so they lump all of us into one group depending on Stage, which obviously can't be accurate, but it's all they have to base anything on. When I asked about having a simple mastectomy on the non cancerous breast, I was told it would increase my chances some since Lobular tends to mirror itself and for me, \"some\" made my mind up for me. Others choose to do as little as possible to avoid the side affects and possible risks, which for them, they have made the right decision for themselves. I guess all we can do is find an onco we have faith in, ask questions and do what we feel is the right thing for us.",

      "Content": "Flynn, My opinion for what it's worth. There is already a chance that you could have BC, or it may end up not being BC. The pill, like condoms aren't 100%, but I sure wouldn't stay on the pill. Too much is known about the pill, HRT etc. I understand that not having kids is important to you, but as someone who's been dx with advanced BC and gone through multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation and was 43, I wouldn't do anything that could raise my chances of getting this disease. I've been there, done that and I'll forever have a black cloud hanging over my head, like everyone else, not knowing if and when the cancer will return. This disease SUCKS to put it mildly. I'm just giving you my view from someone who knows the reality of this disease. If you are certain you don't want kids, but don't want the have your tubes tied in case you change your mind, I'd talk to a gyn and see if there is anyway to do it and the chances being good that it could be reversed. I know my SIL had her tubes tied after 3 kids and put some kind of clamp (I don't know the technical terms and it's been years ago) so they couldn't grow back but on the same hand, if they wanted to have more kids, which hasn't happened, it would be easier to reverse it.

      "Content": "Hi Roberta, I'm curious as to how you know no lymph nodes are involved. Did they do a sentinal node biopsy when they did the biopsy on the lump? As far as what to expect. It will all depend on what size the tumor is, if you're hormone (estrogen and progesterine) positive or negative. If you are Her2 positive or neg. You said you have an appt. to see a surgeon. How do you know that the lump is cancerous? Did a different surgeon do a biopsy? If you'll look at my bio at the bottom, you'll see I was dx stage III and had a lot of positive nodes. I had 3 different chemos at the same time, then had radiation for about 5-6 weeks. I had a mastectomy prior to treatment. So, see it all depends on alot of things that you don't have the answers to, or you didn't post. There is a lot of info to absorb, so hopefully you can take someone with you to be a second set of ears. I know I didn't hear alot of what was being said, not because I wasn't listening, but I guess our brains stop taking in things when it goes on over load. Please keep us posted and if you have any more info that I was talking about, be sure and post it. This is a roller coaster from hell, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't, BUT you'll get through it and we'll be here to help. If you need to talk, feel free to e-mail me. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

The pill, like condoms aren't 100%, but I sure wouldn't stay on the pill. Too much is known about the pill, HRT etc. I understand that not having kids is important to you, but as someone who's been dx with advanced BC and gone through multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation and was 43, I wouldn't do anything that could raise my chances of getting this disease. I've been there, done that and I'll forever have a black cloud hanging over my head, like everyone else, not knowing if and when the cancer will return. This disease SUCKS to put it mildly. I'm just giving you my view from someone who knows the reality of this disease. If you are certain you don't want kids, but don't want the have your tubes tied in case you change your mind, I'd talk to a gyn and see if there is anyway to do it and the chances being good that it could be reversed. I know my SIL had her tubes tied after 3 kids and put some kind of clamp (I don't know the technical terms and it's been years ago) so they couldn't grow back but on the same hand, if they wanted to have more kids, which hasn't happened, it would be easier to reverse it.

For you to have bone mets, you would be Stage IV and there would have to be invasive cancer for it to spread to your bones. You might have had some DCIS, but you would have to have Invasive too. Don't hesistate to ask your onco anything. If he gets insulted easily and you aren't comfortable with him, find one you are comfy with. You should be able to ask your onco anything and get straight answers. I'd get a copy of your pathology report and your pre-chemo test results. You probably had a CT Scan of the chest, bone scan and possibly a chest x-ray. I'd ask him what your dx is and what the game plan is for treatment. I'd definitely question the DCIS since you have distant mets. There's no way that's the only kind of breast cancer you were dx with, since the bone mets were there during original dx.",

He came highly recommended, is the head of oncology and goes all over the U.S. giving lectures and has alot of articles in medical journals etc. If they have been practicing long at all, they can see the devistation and fear in all of us that are dx. They don't know how it feels because they haven't walked in our shoes, but they have seen it enough. My PCP never suggested an anti-depressant or meds for anxiety. It was my onco who saw me get to a point that he knew I needed something. He was aware of the divorce mess that started right before my dx, well right before my biopsy and knew both that and the dx were taking it's toll. He put me on Paxil and it helped more then words can say. If I don't make it to a ripe old age because this mess comes back, it won't be for his lack of trying and his knowledge and determination to save as many as he possibly can. He wanted the divorce over before I started treatment because the extra stress of a court battle would only hinder my health and chances and was willing to treat me without me having insurance (I would have lost it or had to pay for COBRA and I wasn't able to work) and it not costing me anything. I would have gotten the exact treatment I got, but the divorce drug on and it's still going on 3 years later, but that's another story. His primary concern was me and kicking some cancer butt.",

      "Content": "Hi, Onco's have different opinions of CA 27-29 because of their unreliability. I never got my 1st one until I was 1 year NED (No Evidence of Disease) and he did them every 3 months at my check ups for 1 year to see what was \"normal\" for me. The last one I had was in Oct. and I won't have another one now until Oct. A friend of mine had the CA27-29 done prior to her biopsy and it was in the normal range, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11 positive nodes. Some oncos never do tumor markers and some put a lot of faith in them. Mine checked them again to see what was normal for me once I was done with treatment and NED, but if I have pain somewhere that doesn't go away, even if my tumor markers are normal, he's going to trust what my body is saying over them. On the other hand, if my tumor markers start going up and continue to go up, he'll start running scans to see if anything is going on. My onco also did a CT Scan of the chest, chest x-ray and bone scan before I started treatment to see if it had spread to any place else, and of course mega bloodwork. Did you have a bone scan prior to starting chemo? I was given FEC for 6 treatments and I'm 3 years out and as you can tell by my bio, I was Stage III. I go to a cancer institute where all the oncos get together and discuss all the new patients and decide what treatment they feel will work best on the individual person and the kind of BC they have. This whole disease is very confusing to say the least. I had labs done 2 weeks after chemo to see if my white count was rebounding because they expect it to bottom out, but want to make sure they can rebound on their own, if not, there are shots they give, like you took to boost the white count. I then got labs again before my next chemo to make sure my counts were back to where they should be. I never had to take any shots because mine bottomed out, but not lower then expected and then came back up on their own. Some ladies have to get the shots with every treatment. Some oncos give the shots whether you need them or not. Mine only gave them if needed. I don't know if I helped you at all, but a lot of this is what the onco feels will work best for you. If you have doubts or don't feel 100% confident that you're getting the best care possible, I would get a 2nd opinion. You really do have to be your own advocate when it comes to this disease and your health. It's your life and usually what your gut says, I would go with. I was told my mammogram was normal, no signs of cancer and my ultra sound showed B9 cysts. I had no idea that they couldn't tell if something was B9 or not without a biopsy. I knew I felt a lump/mass and my gut said something wasn't right. I went with my gut and say a surgeon. It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but thank God I went with my gut, since I was already Stage III and only 43. If I can help at all, please feel free to e-mail me anytime. Take care and kick some cancer butt Nancy",

      "Content": "You can always get a 2nd opinion without leaving the onco you are with now. I'd check and see who other people used regardless of what kind of cancer they may have had and get a referral that way. Word of mouth is usually the best way to go. If you can't find anyone, look and see who else in your area has oncologists and make an appt. You can have a copy of all your records faxed over there and no doctor should have a problem with you getting a second opinion. If they do, then that to me would be a red flag. You have to be an advocate in your own health care and like me and most of us, you'll do whatever it takes to give you the best possible chance of never having to deal with this beast again. Just my opinion but as upset as you are, I don't think you will rest until you get a 2nd opinioin and that is definately your decision. I have no doubt if I wasn't completely satisfied in the care and treatment I was getting, I would have gotten a 2nd opinion. Friends referred me to my onco, plus I had heard a lot about him, and it was all good and in a city this big, that made me feel good. Him being head of oncology at the cancer institute made me feel good too. I always felt that he had my best interest and he was determined for me to be a survivor. I know there are no guarentees and never were, but if mine comes back, I know it's not because of anything he did or didn't do and that to me is the way everyone should feel about someone who's treating them for something as serious as cancer. Hugs and prayers and keep me posted. Nancy",

      "Content": "I was thinking the same thing about oncos or surgeons who have never gone through chemo and obviously have the medical knowledge of what works best and lay out a treatment plan that's best for the individual. There are 5 or 6, can't remember, at the cancer institute I do to and when there is a new patient, they all sit down and go over all the info from the path report, age, etc. and decide what the best treatment plan is, which I think is great, even though I have total faith in mine and he's head of oncology there. The ironic thing is both of the rads oncos at the cancer institute I go to have both had cancer. One was a childhood cancer and can't remember what kind, but he wasn't expected to make it and here, 20 years later he's helping others. The weird thing is, as he's proof that stats don't mean squat and everyone is different, he has a gloom and doom attitude if, in my case Stage III. You'd think that he'd be more encouraging considering his past. I don't want or expect someone to lie to me about prognosis, but the way he put it, I wasn't going to be around long. That isn't what I needed at the time, so I switched. The other rads onco was dx with prostate cancer after I had gone through treatment and he got radiation, that capsule thing. Before and after that, he was the same, honest but encouraging and I only see him once a year now, but each year I make it without a reoccurence, he sincerely is so pleased and once again, says the longer you go without one, the better your chances of not having one, even though as we've discussed, all the written material says our chances go up between 5 and 10 years and that has yet to make sense to me, but no one can explain why the articles say it.",

He came highly recommended, is the head of oncology and goes all over the U.S. giving lectures and has alot of articles in medical journals etc. If they have been practicing long at all, they can see the devistation and fear in all of us that are dx. They don't know how it feels because they haven't walked in our shoes, but they have seen it enough. My PCP never suggested an anti-depressant or meds for anxiety. It was my onco who saw me get to a point that he knew I needed something. He was aware of the divorce mess that started right before my dx, well right before my biopsy and knew both that and the dx were taking it's toll. He put me on Paxil and it helped more then words can say. If I don't make it to a ripe old age because this mess comes back, it won't be for his lack of trying and his knowledge and determination to save as many as he possibly can. He wanted the divorce over before I started treatment because the extra stress of a court battle would only hinder my health and chances and was willing to treat me without me having insurance (I would have lost it or had to pay for COBRA and I wasn't able to work) and it not costing me anything. I would have gotten the exact treatment I got, but the divorce drug on and it's still going on 3 years later, but that's another story. His primary concern was me and kicking some cancer butt.",

      "Content": "Hi, I don't know if it's a given that this happens to everyone that has liver mets, but the reason I was asking about the color of your urine is, my best friend had liver mets and her urine was dark, almost brown and I've heard this from several. I've heard of some that didn't have pain, but I know Kim had pain that just got worse and worse until she was literally bent over in pain. Kim was the kind that wouldn't take pain meds until it was really bad because she wanted to be alert and be able to talk to her husband, kids and grandbaby. So no doubt when she said the pain was unbearable, it had to be far beyond that. From what I know, which isn't alot on the subject, sounds encouraging. The elevated liver enzimes could be because of all the chemo etc. that it had to filter through. The Ackline Fosfatate (no where close to correct spelling) is the part of the liver that shows how your liver is working and if it's having to work harder because of something as simple as meds. Please keep up posted and praying for great news!! Nancy",

We're so lucky to have a med. oncologist who started this and a rads oncologist who's also a huge part of the forum. You'll notice that quite a few of us have our dx, treatments, stages etc. at the bottom of each of our posts. That way we don't have to ask the same questions and you can see when we were dx and how we're doing. It's always nice to see ladies that are doing well years after dx. You can go to your profile and type in your info. Everyone have a great weekend. At least there is a race on Sat. night and NASCAR season is getting underway, so hopefully that will take my mind off of Monday's check up, if even for a couple of hours.........CALGON take me away..... lol Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, What I was told, and things could have changed since I was dx, was that as far as the 5 year survival chance was the same with a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. However, the risk of a reoccurence was higher with the lumpectomy and if it came back, I would then have to have a mastectomy then and more chemo. I was also dx with Invasive Lobular BC, which is prone to mirror itself in the other breast. I opted to have both breast removed. I think because I was dx on Valentine's Day (Thur), saw the surgeon I was going to use, who was out of town (in town now since I moved back after the divorce) on Monday and had the mastectomy on Thur, my surgeon said that he'd do the mastectomy and node disection on the left side and if I decided to have a simple mastectomy, that could be done later. I think because it all happened so quick and I was running on pure fear, that's why he didn't do them both at the same time. I had the other breast removed in March of the following year. Only you can decide what is the best surgery for you. It's a very personal decision and one that you have to feel good about and at ease about. I had no family history at all. I wish there was some way we could know if we should have a mastectomy vs lumpectomy, but unfortunately there is no way to know. Remember too that I was a Stage III and you are a stage II. I was considered high risk because I was 43 when dx (1st time I get called young in a long time and it has to be because of this disease.....ugh). I don't know anything about the genetic testing, but it sounds like you have a plan to have that done and then make a decision about having a bilateral mastectomy or leave things as they are. I will say, the painful part for me is having all my nodes removed (16). The mastectomy itself was not painful and I'm the President of the Whimp Club, so it definately wasn't painful When I had the simple mastectomy done, well after the reconstruction failed and the surgeon went in to remove the excess tissue, so very similiar to a simple mastectomy as far as incision etc. goes and when I woke up in recovery, I was sent to the next step down and I was sitting up talking to one of the nurses who was a Nascar fan like me when my parents came in.

      "Content": "Hi Karen, What I was told, and things could have changed since I was dx, was that as far as the 5 year survival chance was the same with a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. However, the risk of a reoccurence was higher with the lumpectomy and if it came back, I would then have to have a mastectomy then and more chemo. I was also dx with Invasive Lobular BC, which is prone to mirror itself in the other breast. I opted to have both breast removed. I think because I was dx on Valentine's Day (Thur), saw the surgeon I was going to use, who was out of town (in town now since I moved back after the divorce) on Monday and had the mastectomy on Thur, my surgeon said that he'd do the mastectomy and node disection on the left side and if I decided to have a simple mastectomy, that could be done later. I think because it all happened so quick and I was running on pure fear, that's why he didn't do them both at the same time. I had the other breast removed in March of the following year. Only you can decide what is the best surgery for you. It's a very personal decision and one that you have to feel good about and at ease about. I had no family history at all. I wish there was some way we could know if we should have a mastectomy vs lumpectomy, but unfortunately there is no way to know. Remember too that I was a Stage III and you are a stage II. I was considered high risk because I was 43 when dx (1st time I get called young in a long time and it has to be because of this disease.....ugh). I don't know anything about the genetic testing, but it sounds like you have a plan to have that done and then make a decision about having a bilateral mastectomy or leave things as they are. I will say, the painful part for me is having all my nodes removed (16). The mastectomy itself was not painful and I'm the President of the Whimp Club, so it definately wasn't painful When I had the simple mastectomy done, well after the reconstruction failed and the surgeon went in to remove the excess tissue, so very similiar to a simple mastectomy as far as incision etc. goes and when I woke up in recovery, I was sent to the next step down and I was sitting up talking to one of the nurses who was a Nascar fan like me when my parents came in. I went home right after that. A little sore around the incision line, but I didn't even need pain meds. I wish you the very best not only with your treatment, but the decision you make down the road about more surgery or not. If you need to talk, e-mail me anytime.

All the known cancer, as far as the tumor and the + nodes were removed, but the whole idea behind chemo is to kill any other cancer cells floating around. We pray we stay NED, but go for our check ups and even though, especially in the beginning, we'll notice every new pain, even if we know how we got it and worry it's cancer.

He's not only a wonder oncologist, but a wonderful person who really cares. I know these people will be gratefull that on top of everything else they have been through and have been going through with their cancer, they don't have to worry about getting treatment. Their onco have forwarded their charts to the oncos here (there are 8 med. oncos where I go) and will get excellent care. I know they mentioned specifically an 84 year old bone cancer patient. All she had was her little dog and the shelter she's now staying at while she goes through treatments took in her little dog too. They checked her out at the hospital and was seen by the onco that will be taking care of her and was able to leave to stay in a church, one of many that have become shelters. The smile on her face said it all I thought everyone could use an uplifting story from such a terrible tragedy. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I found out the hard way (like you have) that once we've had chemo, our veins roll and harder to get stuck. I always had good veins, but one person that stuck me 3 times and then finally got someone else for the 4th, it blew my vein to where it's just scar tissue now. It was the big one in the fold of my arm. I will say that I've never had to be stuck more then once at my onco's office. I always tell whoever is doing the sticking for an i.v. for a test, that they have to stick me in the hand and have to use a butterfly needle. I've only had them not listen once and I wasn't the nicest person after 4 sticks, I was going to leave. There's no excuse for that many sticks. I'd remind whoever is going to stick you that ýou've had chemo and that you've been stuck multiple times because no one could get the vein without blowing it and if they haven't been doing it a long time, they will get someone that will. I've also started telling them (most of my tests are done at the cancer institute, so they know) that I have at the hospital that they have 2 sticks and that's as many chances as they get. I say it nicely, but they know I'm not kidding and that has done wonders!!!!!! Good luck and I hope some of this will help the next time so you don't have to have multiple sticks or them digging around",

I'm sure you remember her from the old board, but Trish \"bought her boob off e-bay and it looks great\". Now I think it's safe to say, there's nothing you can't buy on e-bay.... LOL She had a good idea though. I've had a double mastectomy, so I'd had to find a set, but she paid $20 for 1 and they normally cost about $250.00 before insurance each if you go to a speciality store. I'm going shopping for boobs on e-bay myself........ Nancy",

I know it's possible, but having a recurrence after almost 30 years seems hard to believe, even though we're never safe from it happening. I pray that her pain is able to be controlled.

Or is it one of those damned if you do and damned if you don't. Arimidex would help someone with a higher % but chance of reoccurence better, then someone who had a low% and even though Arimidex wouldn't work as well because the cancer didn't need alot of hormones to feed off of, but less likely to come back because the cells would have to work harder to find receptors? I totally confused myself just now, but hopefully you can figure it out and make sense of it............LOL Nancy",

Mine, is still given every 3 weeks, probably because I got 3 at the same time. So, since ya'll have been dx, they have made progress on finding better treatments Everyone responds to chemo different, where one may have nausea, someone else won't.

      "Content": "Hi, You asked Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan A biopsy is considered surgery even though you aren't completely put under, instead are given Versaid (or at least I was......the I don't give a *** shot). Again, I'm speaking from what they did with me and I'm sure there are many variations. I had an incisional biopsy and the surgeon removed the lump and tissue around it. I later found out he actually did a lumpectomy. Once it was confirmed that I had cancer, I opted for a mastectomy without a 2nd thought. I wanted no chances that the cancer could be somewhere else in the breast too. Had I not chosen a mastectomy, they would have gone back in to get \"clean margins\" which is where they remove more tissue around the area that has already been biopsied until they get tissue with no cancer cells in it. I've heard of ladies having 3 done before clean margins were gotten, but quite often they get clean margins with the 2nd try. They didn't do sentinal node biopsies when I was dx, or maybe because the size of the tumor, they expected to find node involvement. They removed all (16) of my lymph nodes at the same time as my mastectomy and 9 were positive. I'm confused at how they are already planning a treatment plan when they don't know what they will find. Alot of oncos give chemo to Stage I ladies routinely now to increase the chances of not having a reoccurence. There is no logic to this disease and many are treating with chemo even if there is no node involvement and the tumors are small. Of course as you can see in my case, that wasn't an option. My mammogram missed a large tumor and I had alot of + nodes. I started chemo about 4 weeks after my mastectomy and node disection so the time frame they are speaking of in regards to starting radiation sounds right. Again, I would want to know what is found before talking treatment. If they feel that the tumor is cancer, I would question why they aren't doing the sentinal node biopsy at the same time. It seems like alot of surgeries to accomplish the same thing as a couple could take. Obviously if they don't know or don't feel as certain as they can without a biopsy that it's cancer, then they wouldn't want to do a sentinal node biopsy. From what I understand and I could be wrong on this since I didn't have one, they have to inject the dye into the nipple a day or 2 before surgery and if I'm right, that would explain not doing it the same day as the incisional biopsy. I had my biopsy done and found out I had cancer on 2/14/02 and had the mastectomy/node disection on 2/21/02 so I got it over with as soon as possible, but if you aren't comfortable with what they are telling you, you can get a 2nd opinion and a couple of weeks isn't going to change the outcome. I was told that mine was a cyst even though I could feel an egg shaped lump that just popped up. They did an ultra sound and told me I had 2, 1 cm b9 cyst. I knew what I felt was one thing, not 2 and my gut told me to go somewhere else, which I did and well, you know the rest of the story. Listen to your gut, be your own advocate, use a doctor that you trust and don't settle for anything but the best treatment possible (and I'm not saying the doc you're talking about isn't giving you that). Best of luck and let us know. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

The longer your doc waits to refer you, the more \"take weeks\" it will take. I would suggest going to another doctor. I called a surgeon myself when I was told mine was nothing, come back in a year. As to your question if a mammogram and/or ultra sound would pick up a mass if it were advanced, in my case NO. My bio is at the bottom, but I was Stage III, 5.5 cm tumor and 9 positive nodes out of 16 and my mammogram/ultra sound didn't pick it up. Again, that doesn't mean that's your situation. You're not going to relax, understandably until you know for sure, so I would definately seek another opinion.",

I can't tell you the number of women that I know, who are Stage IV and once they had treatment, whether chemo and/or radiation, they have been stable for many years. The longer we stay NED or Stable if it comes back. the more time that gives researcher to come up with newer and better treatment. NEVER lose hope. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't fall apart if I found out my cancer was back, just like I did when I first heard the words \"you have cancer'. I was the 1st one in my family....... Get mad at this disease, and get ready to kick some cancer to the curb!!!!! Please keep us posted. Hugs and prayers",

      "Content": "First, let me say how sorry I am that you lost your wife to cancer. It is definately a very cruel disease. On the list of chemos that you typed out, not one of them, unless things have changed very much, are chemos given for BC during original dx. Since I've never had BC mets, and pray I never do, I don't know alot about the chemos used but the only one I've ever heard of on that list is Gemzar. Just my personal feelings, I'll take the 30% chance of kidney problems instead of the 100% chance that I'll die if I don't take it. I have no doubt had I not taken the treatment I did, I wouldn't be here now and would have been gone long ago. I was Stage III and that's not far from Stage IV. Did you wife have breast cancer if you don't mind me asking? I know Suzanne Somers said she didn't want chemo because it was poison, but she injected herself in the stomach for 5 years and still doing it with mistletoe extract............which is poison. I pray that everyone stays NED regardless of the route they choose, but for me, I took the route with proven results. I do take a multi vitamin, calcium w/Vitamin D since I'm taking Arimidex. Arimidex has caused my cholesterol to be very high, especially the lipids, so besides cholesterol/lipid medicine, I take Omega 3 capsules everyday. I've changed my diet to include plenty of anti-oxidents (sp) everyday, especially blueberries in my oatmeal every a.m. This is what was best for me, not to say it is for everyone. Nancy",

I had alot of pain in my hip which freaked me out, thinking the same thing, bone mets. My onco did a bone scan which came back normal. He then sent me for a bone density test since I am taking Arimidex. The bone density test showed the beginning of osteop. (can't spell it so I won't try... ugh). I'm now on actonel and it has all but stopped not only the hip pain, but the joint and bone pain caused by Arimidex. If I remember correctly too, and I don't know if it's in all cases, but your calcium levels will be elevated if you have bone mets, or that's a sign to check furture. How have your calcium levels been and have you had a bone density test done? I'm 46 now and have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years. Chemo put me into MENTALpause. A friend of mine had a bone scan done to check for mets and the onco ordered an x-ray of the specific area because the bone scan was inconclusive. The x-ray showed normal and she was told, no bone mets based on the x-ray. I hope this helps some Good luck and keep us posted Nancy",

Once I got moving, my feet and hip would ease up too. What would happen if you called your med. onco to make an appt.? I'm still amazed that he released you after treatment, that just seems beyond crazy to me. Even if I stay NED for 5 years, which I PRAY I do, I will still be seen by my onco once a year and more often if I need to. It's been 3 years since your bone density test and you've been on Arimidex for a year, I'd definately have another one done. alkaline phosphotase has to do with the liver. Dr. Lu or Dr. Leo would know if a liver function test would have any relevence to bone mets, but I'm 99.9% sure that the alkaline Phos. shows how much activity is going on with the liver, or how hard it's having to work. That can be elevated if you are taking a lot of meds, or it may have no affect on it. I'm going to be watching out to see what the good docs have to say about this. I think sometimes we know too much and other times, we don't know anything about this, if that makes sense. Hugs Nancy",

At the bottom of this page you'll see my bio. I was dx Stage III. I'm a little confused. You said that your tumor was over 5 cm and so was most of the tissue in your breast. Did you have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy? What about your auxillary nodes? Did they remove all those or do a sentinal node biopsy and what were the results? This question is going to sound strange, but it's very important. When you pee, what color is it? This has to do with the liver question. Write back!!!!!! Sending hugs and prayers Nancy",

I'll still freak out before every check up, but that's what I do best...... lol For anyone taking Arimidex. I talked to the onco. today to find out if my lipids being 650 is a false positive from the Arimidex or if Arimidex actually causes cholesterol, especially lipids to go up. Be sure and get your cholesterol checked. Arimidex DOES cause them to go up and it's not a false positive. They are trying me on Lipitor since Zocor was giving me a fit. I think I'll get the \"kids\" together and have them do the NED dance with me. Hey, my animals know I'm nuts, but they humor me.......LOL Thanks for all your prayers, good thoughts and support!!!!!!!!!!! Question for the docs............ Is it more encouraging to see a Stage III NED for 3 years, starting the 4th since I was high risk to start with, then if I was a Stage I or no nodes, or not much difference. I know you can't tell me it won't ever come back, but would like your imput.

They had a special race on Sat. and qualifying on Sunday for Daytona 500, so I'm SO ready. I have my ticket for Talladega May 1. I usually go for the weekend, but lack of money (anyone know where I can get a money tree?.. lol) won't let me this year, but at least I'm going to one in the spring. Hopefully come the fall race, which is in Oct. I\"ll be working and will have gotten another NED report. Thanks everyone for everything. I feel like I could go to sleep and not get up til the a.m. This stress will wear you out..... lol Hugs Nancy",

If I wasn't so scared, I could have enjoyed looking more.... lol I thought he was not only good looking, but his personality made things alot easier. He asked if I had any questions and I said no, and he said well, THAT (not me...lol) was easy. He asked if I wanted something to relax me and I said oh yea. Before he left, he asked me if I was sure there wasn't anything and I told him just to make sure I wake up. He said he only issued round trip tickets and that made me relax. I think I'll skip any more surgeries even if it means not seeing them. 8 in less then 3 years is enough, I'm retired ...lol",

I personally am staying with a multi vitamin and Calcium w/Vitamin D and so far, 3 years and 3 months out from my dx from Stage III ILC. Of course you have every right to take what you want, but I would really suggest checking with your onco 1st and checking on the internet to see what all is in there and what it affects. Hugs",

For what it's worth, I didn't have a PICC or anything and had chemo and labs done each time because I HAD such good veins. Chemo can and in my case did cause the veins to harden like scar tissue and chemo also causes the veins to roll. Either though it's been over 2 years since I had any chemo, they have a hard time now getting a vein. The bloodwork isn't so bad because they use butterfly needles, but for surgeries, I get stuck no less then twice and usually 3 times because of what the chemo did to my veins. Just wanted to pass that along incase the onco still talks about a PICC line, she might want to consider it. Nancy",

I would definately ask for something else to help you get through this. My onco put me on Paxil which helped a lot and effexor is another popular one that ladies are put on. I've never heard of someone not getting a bone scan, CT Scan and all those prior to starting treatment so they can stage you correctly, if for no other reason, but that's another reason we all stay confused is because things are done so many different ways, depending on where you go. If you are able to see the screen as the bone scan is being done, degenerative (sp) chances, arthritis and other things will light up on the screen, so don't panic if you see those. The radiologist will read it and he knows what to look for. The tech that did mine saw me quietly freaking out during it and told me what I saw weren't mets. They aren't suppose to do that, but my sanity was extremely grateful. Also, since you've never had one, more then likely if anything shows up like degenerative chances, the radiologist to cover his butt will say something like it doesn't appear to be mets but the only way to rule them out is a PET Scan. He has nothing to compare this one to, so he'll have to say something like that, they did on mine. I've had 2 other ones and on those the radiologist said, no signs of mets period, because he had the ones before to compare. I really feel that you're going to be fine and it's just false readings because you're going through treatment. I know that doesn't help since it's you that's so scared, but all of us have been there so we do understand. We're here anytime you need us. Remember, you're talking to a Stage III 5.5 cm tumor w/ 9+ nodes out of 16 and the cancer hadn't spread anywhere else prior to treatment and I'm 3+ years out with no signs of it being back Nancy",

We are in such an emotional roller coaster with this disease as it is, but it seems like you are being put on an extra long one. There isn't a cure for BC, but treatments sure can make us stay with NED, which is great until a cure comes along. I honestly don't think that it will make a difference in the success rate of your treatment by having to skip a week, many do. I'm confused as to why they are saying they can't give you the shot to boost your white count? I never had one, so I don't know a lot about them, but many ladies have to get the shots and some even get them for days prior to their next chemo or before their chemo. It's hard enough emotionally and physically to go through this without all this added confusion. I think I'd seriously consider a 2nd opinion and see if there is someone else, outside that practice that makes me feel more at ease and more confident in your treatment. I'm hear anytime, just an e-mail away. Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, Onco's have different opinions of CA 27-29 because of their unreliability. I never got my 1st one until I was 1 year NED (No Evidence of Disease) and he did them every 3 months at my check ups for 1 year to see what was \"normal\" for me. The last one I had was in Oct. and I won't have another one now until Oct. A friend of mine had the CA27-29 done prior to her biopsy and it was in the normal range, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11 positive nodes. Some oncos never do tumor markers and some put a lot of faith in them. Mine checked them again to see what was normal for me once I was done with treatment and NED, but if I have pain somewhere that doesn't go away, even if my tumor markers are normal, he's going to trust what my body is saying over them. On the other hand, if my tumor markers start going up and continue to go up, he'll start running scans to see if anything is going on. My onco also did a CT Scan of the chest, chest x-ray and bone scan before I started treatment to see if it had spread to any place else, and of course mega bloodwork. Did you have a bone scan prior to starting chemo? I was given FEC for 6 treatments and I'm 3 years out and as you can tell by my bio, I was Stage III. I go to a cancer institute where all the oncos get together and discuss all the new patients and decide what treatment they feel will work best on the individual person and the kind of BC they have. This whole disease is very confusing to say the least. I had labs done 2 weeks after chemo to see if my white count was rebounding because they expect it to bottom out, but want to make sure they can rebound on their own, if not, there are shots they give, like you took to boost the white count. I then got labs again before my next chemo to make sure my counts were back to where they should be. I never had to take any shots because mine bottomed out, but not lower then expected and then came back up on their own. Some ladies have to get the shots with every treatment. Some oncos give the shots whether you need them or not. Mine only gave them if needed. I don't know if I helped you at all, but a lot of this is what the onco feels will work best for you. If you have doubts or don't feel 100% confident that you're getting the best care possible, I would get a 2nd opinion. You really do have to be your own advocate when it comes to this disease and your health. It's your life and usually what your gut says, I would go with. I was told my mammogram was normal, no signs of cancer and my ultra sound showed B9 cysts. I had no idea that they couldn't tell if something was B9 or not without a biopsy. I knew I felt a lump/mass and my gut said something wasn't right. I went with my gut and say a surgeon. It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but thank God I went with my gut, since I was already Stage III and only 43. If I can help at all, please feel free to e-mail me anytime. Take care and kick some cancer butt Nancy",

I've never heard of someone not getting a bone scan, CT Scan and all those prior to starting treatment so they can stage you correctly, if for no other reason, but that's another reason we all stay confused is because things are done so many different ways, depending on where you go. If you are able to see the screen as the bone scan is being done, degenerative (sp) chances, arthritis and other things will light up on the screen, so don't panic if you see those. The radiologist will read it and he knows what to look for. The tech that did mine saw me quietly freaking out during it and told me what I saw weren't mets. They aren't suppose to do that, but my sanity was extremely grateful. Also, since you've never had one, more then likely if anything shows up like degenerative chances, the radiologist to cover his butt will say something like it doesn't appear to be mets but the only way to rule them out is a PET Scan. He has nothing to compare this one to, so he'll have to say something like that, they did on mine. I've had 2 other ones and on those the radiologist said, no signs of mets period, because he had the ones before to compare. I really feel that you're going to be fine and it's just false readings because you're going through treatment. I know that doesn't help since it's you that's so scared, but all of us have been there so we do understand. We're here anytime you need us. Remember, you're talking to a Stage III 5.5 cm tumor w/ 9+ nodes out of 16 and the cancer hadn't spread anywhere else prior to treatment and I'm 3+ years out with no signs of it being back Nancy",

Something I thought about and if I always mentioned it, ignore me, chemo brain is still so much alive. I started breaking out in sweats and I mean the kind where I needed a towel to wipe my face dry. You might want to get your thyroid checked. Mine got burned during radiation, but there are other reasons for it being messed up and one is because it feels like it..... lol One of the symptoms of, either hypo or hyperthyroidism (I can't remember which symptoms go with which one) is unable to tolerate heat. I was sweating so bad, even in the air conditioned house I was miserable. Just a thought about having it checked. I'm glad you thought things through and made a decision that you felt was best. I wouldn't ever tell someone to do anything, just give my opinions (asked for or not sometimes.... lol) and throw out some options etc. I'm trying to lose weight that I gained through chemo and all the surgeries and who knows what meds, probably all of them, that I'm taking can cause weight gain. Before BC, I was around 125-135 and let's just say.......... pregnant with twin elephants and past the due date looking stomach. I've been eating healthier then a human should have to and exercising (that's like manual labor... lol) and I'll be damned if I didn't gain 5 pounds in 2 weeks and gained 1 1/2 inches around my waist (if I could find it)/stomach. What's wrong with this pictures........ I wonder since cocoa beans is a veggie, which makes chocolate, if a chocolate would work..........LOL Take care and let me know how you're doing. Hugs",

Oncos give that alot for hot flashes. Chemo put me into MENTALpause as well.

I still have days of being depressed and feeling BLAH and of course anti-depressants can only do so much, it can't stop all the depression. I can tell you that I was told my a counselor I was seeing (I was going through a divorce at the same time as BC treatment) that I felt like I was going crazy. He told me the ones that feel like they are going crazy, as the sane ones. It's the ones that think they are fine are the ones you worry about when it's obvious they are having emotional problems. I suggest you mom talk to whoever put her on Effexor, tell them how she's feeling and they will, my guess put her on something different. We all have our days of worrying if the cancer is going to come back and times when we have no aches and pains, that we automatically think it's cancer and you bet, that will cause depresson and ruin your whole day. I would definately have her go see her doc and it may be that effexor may be increased, the dosage or again, they might try her on another one. I was up to 75mg twice a day. What strength is she talking?",

I'm almost 3 years out and was also Stage III ILC, so I know that we can do well. The AMS says a totally different stat then your onco told you and your wife, which I know stats are just that, numbers. What did he base his 10% chance of reoccurence on? I know being 43 when dx is against me, and my onco doesn't like giving stats or odds because he said it's all a crap shoot. I had the FEC too, just like Cathy and again, so far so good with me and I'm thrilled about that, but I was told it was about a 50/50 chance of having a reoccurence at stage III, but being er/pr+ helped and made it more in my favor.

Biopies aren't bad at all and I'm the President of the Whimp Club My guess is it will be an incisional biopsy which is the kind you'd want as far as getting accurate results. You aren't put under with general anesthesia. I was given Versaid (The I don't give a **** shot) and one minute you're awake and the next min. you're awake and it's over. They will remove the cluster and some tissue around it. In my case they removed a good size area (3.5 cm) and I had a small incision. I was sore, but it wasn't bad at all. As far as not having it done and having regrets. The only way you'll know if it's cancer or not is to have a biopsy. If it's not, then you can relax and not worry about it, but if it is and you don't have it done, then the tumor will continue to grow. I can't imagine how you couldn't have regrets by not having it done if it is cancer. The earlier caught, the better prognosis. You'll see my bio at the end of this. Mine was advanced and it's been almost 3 years and I'm still doing good. I had mine biopsied ASAP. Trying to forget it exists isn't going to make it go away. PLEASE get the biopsy. We're literally talking about your life!!!! Prayers and keep up posted. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, The tightness you're feeling is unfortuately normal. I tried bilateral reconstruction with expanders and then implants, but got no further then the expanders. Are they planning on giving you radiation? My plastic surgeon and another opinion I got from a different one both said they will no longer use expanders for ladies who have gotten or will get radiation. There is so much damage to the tissue, that the skin just keeps getting tigher. If you had the expanders put in after surgery, but prior to chemo, just my opinion, but it concerns me that you're having so much tightness already. I had to have my expanders removed because the radiated side wouldn't stretch and the expander was literally trying to push back out of my chest near the sternum area. Are you completely filled now? From what I was told, the 1st couple days you would be tight and then it would get better, which mine never did, it was tight and painful all the time. Finally after 4 months of filling and removing some saline, filling and removing, the PS went in to remove the damaged tissue from radiation and the tissue wasn't stretching and that's when he saw that it was trying to come 'back out. I doubt I'll ever try reconstruction again, but if I do it will be the LD Flap. I don't know if I was of any help, but feel free to write me if there's anything I can do. Nancy",

      "Content": "Rose, Did they do a biopsy to make sure it was just an infection? I just looked it up on the internet and I'm NOT saying that it is, but the symptoms sound like IBC. I'm sure what you were dx with have the same symptoms, but I'd want to be 100% sure an infection was all it was. As far as your hair. Mine came back real dark (before chemo light brown with blonde highlights naturally) and real curly. The longer it got, it straightened out and it like it was before, texture wise. I'm not sure if I'm just use to the color after 5 years or if it went back closer to what my natural color use to be. You're right, it's hair. I loved my 1st bad hair day. I looked like Alfalfa all over and I wasn't about to try and comb it flat... lol",

      "Content": "Hi, That's great news about the scans being clear. Remember, I was dx Stage III and that was 2/14/02 and I'm doing great. I have my check up on the 25th, but don't have any reason to think there will be a problem. Did they only remove 2 of her lymph nodes? Have they done a mastectomy? I know some oncos want to do chemo before surgery to shrink the tumors, and others do surgery and then do chemo/radiation. As far as chemo, with her having Invasive Ductal, I think the chemo most get is AC for 4 treatments, 2 weeks apart and then 4 of either Taxol or Taxotere. I had a completely different course of chemo because I had Invasive Lobular, so I had 3 chemos at the same time and the only 1 that was the same was the C, which is Cytoxin. The AC/T is what I've seen given but with it being in her chest wall, the onco may have a different treatment plan. Let us know when you find out tomorrow what kind she'll be getting. The most important thing is for her to drink LOTS of water the day of and for the next couple of days. I couldn't stand the taste of water, so I got bottled water so I could guzzle it. I drank 6-8 of those a day, during the 1st few days. Some women work through treatment, some only take off a couple days after treatment and then work the rest of the time. The most common side affect is fatigue, and with me, that wasn't all the time. My had a cummulative affect, so I stayed tired more days each treatment. I had nausea, but never got sick. They have new nausea meds out now then when I was dx. For me, eating something actually made the nausea go away. Keep us posted.",

      "Content": "First, let me say how sorry I am that you lost your wife to cancer. It is definately a very cruel disease. On the list of chemos that you typed out, not one of them, unless things have changed very much, are chemos given for BC during original dx. Since I've never had BC mets, and pray I never do, I don't know alot about the chemos used but the only one I've ever heard of on that list is Gemzar. Just my personal feelings, I'll take the 30% chance of kidney problems instead of the 100% chance that I'll die if I don't take it. I have no doubt had I not taken the treatment I did, I wouldn't be here now and would have been gone long ago. I was Stage III and that's not far from Stage IV. Did you wife have breast cancer if you don't mind me asking? I know Suzanne Somers said she didn't want chemo because it was poison, but she injected herself in the stomach for 5 years and still doing it with mistletoe extract............which is poison. I pray that everyone stays NED regardless of the route they choose, but for me, I took the route with proven results. I do take a multi vitamin, calcium w/Vitamin D since I'm taking Arimidex. Arimidex has caused my cholesterol to be very high, especially the lipids, so besides cholesterol/lipid medicine, I take Omega 3 capsules everyday. I've changed my diet to include plenty of anti-oxidents (sp) everyday, especially blueberries in my oatmeal every a.m. This is what was best for me, not to say it is for everyone. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, From the part of the pathology report you posted, if your mom or anyone had to have BC, she's got an extremely good path report. The tumor was small and her being er/pr+ and Her2- is also really good. One thing is, when they do the lumpectomy, they probably will find more cancerous tissue, if they just did a biopsy vs. a lumpectomy in the beginning. If it's under 1 cm, most will have a lumpectomy followed by radiation, as long as no lymph nodes are involved. I'm very pro-active in doing everything possible the 1st time, and pray it doesn't come back, but knowing that you did everything you could. If I had her dx, even at the age I was dx, I would have had a lumpectomy, I truly believe. I'd say not to make a decision about lumpectomy vs. mastectomy until you see if they got \"clean margins\" after the lumpectomy and see how large the actual tumor is and if there is any node involvement. That's what I would do, but of course I realize that the decision is your mom's and of course, she wants your help, so yours as well. I don't like surgeons who don't believe in mastectomies and \"mutalating\" a woman. I don't feel mutalated, I feel alive. My best friend's surgeon believed in breast conservative surgery, even though Kim wanted a double mastectomy. We were both dx with Stage III, about the same size tumor and # of nodes involved. He refused to do the mastectomy and ended up, there was more cancer in the remaining tissue and I lost my best friend. Now, with that said, your mom has NO WHERE near the dx that her or I had, so that's not by any means said to scare you, but to remind you that the surgeon works for your mom, she doesn't work for him, and whatever she is most comfortable having, that's what she should have. I was 43 and boobless, but I'm alive and doing great 5+ years later ))))) Unless they find a lot more cancerous tissue and node involvement, she caught hers about as early as can be, so that's awesome!!!!! Please let us know what they find when they do the lumpectomy. If they don't get clean margins, they will have to go in again to get more tissue, so that would be the time she would decide if she wants to go again and have the mastectomy, or keep trying surgery until they get clean margins.",

I know some have chemo before surgery but they still had them removed. Second question. My pathology report showed unknown vascular invasion because my surgeon said that the blood vessels/veins or whatever they checked had no cancer cells in them, but I had 9+/16 nodes. I was told that wasn't a good test and that just because they didn't see any, didn't mean it wasn't in my blood system. Is there a chance that it was contained in my breast and nodes and didn't get into my blood stream? I was treated aggressively because of the stage and my age and the nodes, but I've not read anyone else's path that didn't find it in the blood stream. Thanks nancy",

I had no family history and the last thing I expected to hear was that I had breast cancer, stage III to boot. No one can make the decision for you and I'm not trying to, but have you considered having a mastectomy and just getting rid of all the breast and tissue in case there are cells lurking? I was 43 when dx and I opted to have a mastectomy. That was 2/14/02. I opted to have the other breast removed and had that done 3/03. I wanted to do everything humanly possible to increase my chances of beating this beast of a disease. That was the right decision for me, not to say it is for you. A lot of ladies with BC have lumpectomies and do great. I'm so sorry for your losses. I can't imagine how it feels to lose your sisters and then hear you have BC. Try to remember that we are all individuals and all of our cancers are different based on our age, other health issues etc. The waiting is the hardest. My surgeon moved quickly, which is how I wanted it. I was dx on a Thur. came to the city I've sense moved back to, saw the surgeon I knew I'd use on Monday and had the mastectomy and node disection Thur. Three weeks after surgery, I met with my oncologist and a week later started chemo and then radiation followed. Once the process gets started, then you know the end of treatment is getting closer too. We're hear to help in anyway we can. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

During treatment there were times my stomach got big to the point of having trouble breathing, but that's when my ankles were swollen. I was drinking water like I was told, but then I couldn't get rid of it without the Lasix.

      "Content": "Mine didn't do tumor markers until about a year after I finsihed up treatment. He did them every 3 months for a year to see what was \"normal\" for me and now does them once every 6 months. Too many things can make them rise and I would think chemo would be one of those things since it's not something normal going into your body. The way mine put it was if I had problems, my complaint would be checked out even if the tumor markers were normal. If I felt fine but tumor markers kept going up and up, then he'd run scans. It's just an opinion based on how I understand my onco, but TM during treatment is a waste of worry and that's why he never did them. Not all are like this of course, but my best friend had TMs done before biopsy and they came back normal. She was Stage III, IDC, 9cm tumor and 11+ nodes......needless to say, they didn't bother with markers on her again. I've heard they are much more accurate if you're dealing with a reoccurence, but I don't want to find out Hang in there, you're doing good!!!!!",

Grade 1 is slow growing, I was Grade 2 (of course I have to be different) which is not the slowest, but not the fastest, and Grade 3 is the fastest growing cells. Most ladies I know are grade 3. I don't know if that's more common or just the ones that I've gotten to know. From what I understand and thank God we have Leo to correct me if I'm wrong. Chemo responds better to faster growing cells, so if you are a grade 2 or 3, it will respond generally to those, BUT like everything else with this disease, everyone regardless of their grade could respond the opposite. Grade 1 may still respond well to chemo and some Grade 3's don't. It's a crap shot, but I'm betting on the winning side Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Leo, That link has me wondering something. It's showing what the 5 year survival rate is, not sure if it means survival without a reoccurence or survival period. It's showing after 5 years the survival rate goes down. I thought the longer out without a reoccurence the better chance not to have one, but that link says differently. Next question.... lol Not sure if i want the answer though.. When it comes to er/pr+......is it better to be 80% er/pr+ as far as prognosis and using Arimidex, Tamoxifen or whatever or is it a better prognosis if your er/pr + is 30%? Don't you love my questions.... lol Thanks Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm going to give my opinion on one and info on the other.......a double ramble...... lol I wasn't dx with early stage BC, mine was advanced. I don't know who or what this radio show is you're talking about, but I would suggest anyone who has been told by their oncologist to have chemo, to ask the onco questions vs a radio show. He knows risk factors as far as er/pr and Her2Neu, how aggressive etc. I've always heard that ladies with early stage BC are told how much it would help with their odds of not having a reoccurence and I think they need to base it on that and if they have confidence in their onco, his opinion also. There of course is no guarentee for any of us, but some would rather go through chemo even if it's only a 5% benefit of avoiding a reoccurence and do everything the 1st time around, then regret not doing everything possible the 1st time around. It definately has to be what the person thinks is best for them and a decision they have to live with. As far as the link and the drugs. I take Arimidex. The drugs on that page are for ladies who's cancer feeds on estrogen and/or progesterine which of course are hormones. It's something that we can use to help prevent a reoccurence.",

      "Content": "There's no doubt this is a crap shoot. I've seen Stage I ladies that took Tamoxifen and nothing else and have distant mets. A lot of the ladies in probably the last year seem to be opting for 4 rounds of A/C to have the best chance possible. All the studies and stats that are out for different stages include all ages from 20-100, it doesn't matter if er/pr+ or what their Her2Neu status is, so they lump all of us into one group depending on Stage, which obviously can't be accurate, but it's all they have to base anything on. When I asked about having a simple mastectomy on the non cancerous breast, I was told it would increase my chances some since Lobular tends to mirror itself and for me, \"some\" made my mind up for me. Others choose to do as little as possible to avoid the side affects and possible risks, which for them, they have made the right decision for themselves. I guess all we can do is find an onco we have faith in, ask questions and do what we feel is the right thing for us.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was hit from 3 angles with radiation because of the large tumor and nodes involved. I did get sunburn and because it was done in the heat of the summer, I did have alot of itching on my neck, but there is meds for that. The biggest problem with rads is I lived over an hour away from my rads oncologist, so making that drive was a pain. Once you get tattoed so they know where they need to aim the radiation, it takes less then 5 min. to go in, have it done and leave. I didn't feel tired after radiation, but everyday I'd end up taking a nap when I was watching t.v., but the fatigue was nothing compared to chemo. I think you'll breeze right through radiation. Best of luck Nancy",

I'm almost 3 years out and was also Stage III ILC, so I know that we can do well. The AMS says a totally different stat then your onco told you and your wife, which I know stats are just that, numbers. What did he base his 10% chance of reoccurence on? I know being 43 when dx is against me, and my onco doesn't like giving stats or odds because he said it's all a crap shoot. I had the FEC too, just like Cathy and again, so far so good with me and I'm thrilled about that, but I was told it was about a 50/50 chance of having a reoccurence at stage III, but being er/pr+ helped and made it more in my favor.

      "Content": "First, thanks Shelly. I pray we all have a long and healthy life with NED until his brother, CURE comes around This is where this disease is more confusing then even, different opinions from the docs. My surgeon, who does more breast surgeries than any other here, told me that the overall survival rate is the same with a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, however, there was a greater risk of a local reoccurence with a lumpectomy because there is no way to know what is lurking in the rest of the breast. A local reoccurence of course is by far betting then a Stage IV reoccurence. I personally couldn't see taking a chance of keeping my breast for the sake of having it, if the risks were higher that it would come back locally and end up having to have a mastectomy anyway and go through chemo once again. I've had both removed so they aren't coming back.... lol but I'd be curious in how the surgeon explained how a lumpectomy is better as far as reoccurences then a mastectomy. I've never regretted my decision to have both breast removed and I had no family history, but since I was only 43, that put me at a higher risk because I was \"young\". Most of the ladies I see now whether they have a lumpectomy or mastectomy still get chemo, just not as aggressively as a Stage II or III would, even if they are Stage I. Most I know get 4 rounds of AC even with no node involvement. Since there is no rhyme or reason to this disease, it can come back regardless of stage and node involvement just like it can never come back regardless of stage and node involvement.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your wife's dx of Stage IV breast cancer. It's not good to have the cancer spread to vital organs, but many many women live years with mets to organs. I've seen some ladies that chemo stablizies the tumor so they don't grow and others actually show NED (No Evidence of Disease) after they go through chemo and radiation. Remember too that there are always new drugs coming out. I was dx 3 years ago and in just those 3 years, there have been 3 new drugs to help stop the growth and/or prevent reoccurences. They have gone from every 3 weeks to every 2 weeks with some kinds of chemo because they have found out BC responds better to that way of treatment. Was this her original dx or did hers come back? Is she estrogen and/or progesterine positive? Depending on her age and if she's post menopausal there are several drugs they can give that kill hormones like Arimidex, which is what I take to hopefully prevent a reoccurence and there is also Femara and one more that I can't think of it's name. Where there is life there is hope and this disease is so unpredictable. There are stats out there, but we're not numbers, we're individuals. Your wife is in for a hard fight, so tell her to put her battle gear on and kick some cancer butt Prayers to you and your wife and feel free to write anytime. Keep us posted Nancy",

Tamoxifen encases the hormones in hopes of preventing left over cancer cells from being able to feed off of them and therefore mutate and because another tumor. I know many ladies with bone mets that have been around for 5, 6, and one is going on 8 years. I sure wouldn't cancel Christmas or anything else. If she had to have to come back (which I pray no one had to deal with it ever, let a lone more then once) the bone is the best place (not that any place is good) for it to return too. Better there from ladies that are Stage IV then in the organs. There are better drugs out there now for menopausal women that is superior to Tamoxifen. Prayers to you both.",

I always leave the med. onco's appts feeling relieved after the labs because they tell more then I realized. You could always go to your PCP and have a CBC and CMP twice a year, I'm sure he/she would do that, would be like a physical if you wanted labs checked. Time to get stuff together for Talladega......

I saw my rads. onco for awhile pretty frequent for about the 1 st year. I saw my surgeon quite a bit, but that's because of having so many surgeries for 2 separate mastectomies and then fixing the mess that happened after my reconstruction diseaster. After the 2nd year, I went to once a year with the rads onco and once a year with the surgeon. My med. onco was going to put me to every 6 months after 2 years NED, but I didn't want to give up that much of my security blanket, so I'm seeing him every 4 months and I have my appts. for June and Oct. with him. MY guess is he'll put me to every 6 months if I'm still NED after 4 years, which would be after my Feb. visit. I hate how much control insurance has over OUR lives. I see my PCP for general stuff and he's taken over giving me my meds for my thyroid that got burned during radiation, but my med. onco still gives me my RX for Arimidex and anything BC related. I can call my onco anytime if I have a problem and go see him. My surgeon asked if I had a preference and I told him who I wanted to use based on referrals and just by reputation and I don't have to go through anyone to see any of the specialist since I'm established with them. I can see a med. onco seeing his patients every 6 months if you're a Stage I, but everyone I know, including me, will be seen at least every 6 months for 5 years, then you go to once a year unless there is a problem. A friend of mine was cut loose from her med. onco after 10 years, but can go see him anytime she has a problem, which she hasn't thank God and her PCP does the labs once a year. I feel so bad that, in my opinion, you aren't getting the care you deserve. I'm praying this new onco will have a different attitude and will give you the reassurance that you're doing well by doing labs and checking you out on a regular basis. I'm leaving about 4 a.m. Sunday, so I'm hoping to get to bed at a decent hour tomorrow night (sleep is hard for me to get much of) and I'll be home late Sunday night, but please e-mail me and let me know how you are and if you need to vent, cuss, scream, talk, or anything, I'll check my e-mail as soon as I get home and on and off tomorrow and before I go to bed. I'm here anytime, so please don't hesitate to e-mail me. I'm definately going to enjoy the race. My boy qualified the fastest so the race Sunday is off to a good start for me. I'm going to miss not being there tomorrow like I miss being there today, but just getting away and going to the big race is o.k. Next court date with the idiot isn't until July, so maybe if that actually happens for a change, it will be financially easier and I can go to an Atlanta race as well as the fall race at Talladega. Oooops, rambling big time here. Take care and you're in my prayers that you get some answers. If you would feel better have labs done, TELL the new med. onco you're going to . You've got to be an advocate in your care because you know what you need and piece of mind goes a long way. Hugs my friend Nancy",

I've heard of very few who didn't get these prior to treatment. You should never feel like you are insulting the oncos intelligence. Your mom has ever right to know about the care she is getting and to question anything that she's unsure of. Chances are this and that, but without the tests/scans, they really don't know for certain where they stand and assuming isn't good enough for me. This is too imporant to assume anything. Good luck",

I can understand not doing scans and tests regularly unless there are symptoms, but I would think that the labs could tell more sooner then you would have symptoms, but you aren't going to get this beast back!!!!!!!!!!!! I always leave the med. onco's appts feeling relieved after the labs because they tell more then I realized. You could always go to your PCP and have a CBC and CMP twice a year, I'm sure he/she would do that, would be like a physical if you wanted labs checked. Time to get stuff together for Talladega...... Talladega take me awayyyyyyyy is better then Calgon......LOL Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "From my experience from friends who had lumpectomies, they check the nodes at the same time has they do the lumpectomy. If the went in and did a biopsy, then they wouldn't have done the nodes at the same time as a general rule I don't think. I honestly can't remember if they tested me for er/pr status and Her2 status at the time of biposy when it came back positive for cancer or waited until my mastectomy. I know now they do a lot of sentinal node biopsies vs. removing all the nodes like they did when I was dx. My guess is, based on what I know, with or without node involvement, they would do chemo because she has Invasive Ductal BC, Invasive being the key word. Thanks Shelly.

      "Content": "Hi, DCIS means that it's incapsulated, which is the best possible dx. That means it hasn't spread into other tissue. For you to have bone mets, you would be Stage IV and there would have to be invasive cancer for it to spread to your bones. You might have had some DCIS, but you would have to have Invasive too. Don't hesistate to ask your onco anything. If he gets insulted easily and you aren't comfortable with him, find one you are comfy with. You should be able to ask your onco anything and get straight answers. I'd get a copy of your pathology report and your pre-chemo test results. You probably had a CT Scan of the chest, bone scan and possibly a chest x-ray. I'd ask him what your dx is and what the game plan is for treatment. I'd definitely question the DCIS since you have distant mets. There's no way that's the only kind of breast cancer you were dx with, since the bone mets were there during original dx.",

Matter of fact, when the surgeon went in to remove some of the damaged tissue, the expander was trying to push itself back out of my chest near the sternum area. The PS's around here have all but refused to do expander/implants for those who have had to have radiation. I didn't look until now when you were worried that it looked bad, since I had it done. I'm happy that it worked for you and I think they did a great job. Hope that makes you feel better. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Mia, I'm sorry you're having such a rough time. Have you considered a 2nd opinion? We are in such an emotional roller coaster with this disease as it is, but it seems like you are being put on an extra long one. There isn't a cure for BC, but treatments sure can make us stay with NED, which is great until a cure comes along. I honestly don't think that it will make a difference in the success rate of your treatment by having to skip a week, many do. I'm confused as to why they are saying they can't give you the shot to boost your white count? I never had one, so I don't know a lot about them, but many ladies have to get the shots and some even get them for days prior to their next chemo or before their chemo. It's hard enough emotionally and physically to go through this without all this added confusion. I think I'd seriously consider a 2nd opinion and see if there is someone else, outside that practice that makes me feel more at ease and more confident in your treatment. I'm hear anytime, just an e-mail away. Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, From what I remember reading about it, it has an excellent prognosis. I know one lady that was dx with it, and it hadn't even spread into any tissue and stayed in the nipple, so she had that removed and needed no other treatment. I would write down a list of questions you have and ask the doctor, as far as any other treatment necessary, has it spread etc. In most cases, I would say, saying you're going to be fine, is something none of feel when we're dx, especially with later stage dx, but in her case, you very well be able to say that with 99.9 accuracy. I had a 50/50 chance of it coming back within 5 years, 5 1/2 years ago, so I would have loved to have heard 99 % chance that it wouldn't !!! Ask lots of questions. Everyone's dx is different and even though the internet has good sources, they clump everyone into one catagory and we're all individuals. In my case, the ACS, at that time (they have updated since) said 46% chance for me. My onco said it was better because I was hormone positive, but because I was only 43, that was against me, so their stats really only apply to the general dx, not everything else that is involved. Just be yourself and hopefully the pathology report will be to where her doc can explain it better to lessen her worry. Remember, it's called Padget's DISEASE, not CANCER, so it's a very unaggressive kind that rarely gives anyone problems. That's a lot to be thankful for. Let us know when you find out more.",

      "Content": "Hi, Any of us, regardless of stage, kind, with/without node involvement could have a reoccurence at any time. I 'm definately not saying that is what has happened to you, but if you find a lump, you need to have it biopsied. That is the only way to be certain and I mean an incisional biopsy, sometimes the needle biopsies can be misleading. They can get clean margins, saying there is no more tissue around the lump and know that they got all of it that way, but the main reason I got a mastectomy, and then other was because there could still be cancer cells floating around, that have not yet clustered together enough to be picked up by test. There is not a test either to see if it got into your blood stream. I know the odds are very high mine did with being StageIII and 9+ nodes, but I have seen tiny tumor and no node involvement have reoccurences. Again, I'm not trying to scare you, but if you have any questions or concerns and there's a lump........the only good lump is one that is in a jar. Nancy",

If you're talking about down your side of the MRM vs. on the chest area itself, I felt like I was swollen there also. I guess we don't notice it when we have breasts, but there is tissue on the side that was all connected. Mine wasn't fluid, but that tissue that just became obvious to me once the breast was gone. With it being on the MRM side, that very well is what it could be. It will always feel swollen and numby feeling, but it becomes our new \"normal\" and you don't think about it after awhile.

      "Content": "That's another thing that oncos have different views on. I never got any of those shots. I had my labs done 1 week after my 1st chemo, then 2 weeks and then 3 weeks, which was also the time for another chemo. They saw when my counts bottomed out and when they started rebounding. I was then checked 2 weeks after chemo and 3 weeks, which again, prior to the next treatment. My white count always rebounded on it's own, so I never had to get the shots. Some onco's give it regardless and as part of the routine and others give it only if needed. Sue is so right about the hair. My mastectomy when 1st dx and then the simple mastectomy I opted for due to stage, age and kind of BC never bothered me. I'm boobless and doing good. I guess I connected the breast with cancer and I have never missed them, just like I haven't missed the cancer, but my hair. That was the hardest thing for me by far. I had always had long hair and even though I had it cut twice to try and prepare myself, you can't. For me, when it started coming out, I started coming apart. It wasn't long before I accepted it, but when it 1st happens, that seems to be the toughest part. Your hair is part of your identity I guess and it seems cruel for the cancer to take that away from us while we're fighting the beast. It didn't help me at the time, but it really does come back. Mine is as long as it was before chemo. I need to get it cut, but.............. lol She's doing great!!",

There are many types of treatment for Stage IV ladies and I know many that have been Stage IV for MANY years and still leading happy lives. Have they said there is no more treatment available? There are SO many kinds of chemo, many taken by mouth and of course, the I.V. kind that do wonders for keeping Stage IV \"stable\" or even shrink them as far as where they can't be found anymore. I'm one of those that wouldn't travel to another State unless where I go wasn't doing a Trial that could help. If you have a really good onco, I don't think anywhere else knows anymore then another. If you are in a small city where you only have a choice of 1 or 2 oncos, then that's different. Small areas normally aren't able to participate in Trials, but those are usually only done after nothing else has worked. If her onco is saying there is nothing else that can be done, get a 2nd opinion!!!",

      "Content": "I was thinking the same thing about oncos or surgeons who have never gone through chemo and obviously have the medical knowledge of what works best and lay out a treatment plan that's best for the individual. There are 5 or 6, can't remember, at the cancer institute I do to and when there is a new patient, they all sit down and go over all the info from the path report, age, etc. and decide what the best treatment plan is, which I think is great, even though I have total faith in mine and he's head of oncology there. The ironic thing is both of the rads oncos at the cancer institute I go to have both had cancer. One was a childhood cancer and can't remember what kind, but he wasn't expected to make it and here, 20 years later he's helping others. The weird thing is, as he's proof that stats don't mean squat and everyone is different, he has a gloom and doom attitude if, in my case Stage III. You'd think that he'd be more encouraging considering his past. I don't want or expect someone to lie to me about prognosis, but the way he put it, I wasn't going to be around long. That isn't what I needed at the time, so I switched. The other rads onco was dx with prostate cancer after I had gone through treatment and he got radiation, that capsule thing. Before and after that, he was the same, honest but encouraging and I only see him once a year now, but each year I make it without a reoccurence, he sincerely is so pleased and once again, says the longer you go without one, the better your chances of not having one, even though as we've discussed, all the written material says our chances go up between 5 and 10 years and that has yet to make sense to me, but no one can explain why the articles say it.",

      "Content": "I personally think you did the right thing by taking chemo and give yourself every possible chance to keep the beast away. A good friend of mine was Stage I and no node involvement and she opted for chemo too. It's been 9 years and she's still doing great !!! My guess is your onco didn't tell you your results because he knew you'd worry. I wouldn't know mine until my next visit or unless there was a problem if I didn't hang around the lab to get the print out when they were done.... As far as going back in and talking to your onco, that's your decision. If I put myself in your shoes, I probably would for peace of mind. If he was concerned, he'd be doing tests though. You can wait and talk to him at your next visit and that way you see what your next results are to compare them, or you can go talk to him now. Again, what ever makes you feel more at east. I know one time mine went from 8.9 to 15 and I about feel apart. Even though they were both in the normal range, to me they jumped. It really does get easier the longer you're out . I'm actually surprised he's still seeing you every 3 months with you being Stage I. I would think it would be every 6 months, but all onco's are different. I should be once a year, but I opted to keep going every 6 months...... That piece of mind thing I have no doubt if mine was 39, my onco wouldn't do anything but just check it again at my next appt. and see what it is then, and that's with me being Stage III. Let me know what you decide and what you find out. TRY not to worry, which is know is easier said then done. If you have faith in your onco, then know he's looking out for what's best for you, but if the results are causing you added stress, then I'd go talk to him.",

When I took Tamoxefin 2 years ago, I paid either $101.00 or $110.00 for 30 pills, so that is a huge difference, more so knowing the cost I'm sure has gone up since I took it. Call and ask them what Arimidex costs for 30 pills. I pay $213.00 for 30 pills. I don't think they could possibly sell something that wasn't what they say but again, I would be curious like you. I can see a $5.00 difference or maybe even $10.00 with something expensive, but that is a HUGE difference. I don't use CVS, so I don't know what they would get for the Arimidex. Curious to find out, that's for sure Nancy",

As far as calcifications go, and I'm no expert on them by any means, I think if they cluster, they will remove them because some can become or are breast cancer. It sounds like you're in good hands and that the docs are making sure exactly what they are looking at on the mammogram. My mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor, so I'm glad when someone's picks up something because IF and it's a big IF, it is BC, it is being caught real early which is great!!!. Keep us posted Hugs Nancy",

Not to say there aren't alot over 50 out there, but most of the ones I've met are in their 30s and 40s. They are saying that the reason the number is going up for woman with BC is because of early detection. What a bunch of bull. Whether it's caught early or not, doesn't make the stats go up. It definately is a good thing to have it caught early for prognosis reasons, but the # of women with BC has nothing to do with early detection. The ACS doesn't tell you that 45% of all BC in women under 50 are missed with mammograms and 35% of women over 50 are missed. They need to be alot more upfront NOW and not just after we're dx. O.k.

      "Content": "Hi Mary, I was 43 when dx, so we're around the same age. I started on Tamoxifen because the onco thought I would start having periods again. After a year had passed since my last one and the studies were showing Arimidex to be superior to Tamoxifen, I switched. Arimidex can cause some pretty bad bone and joint pain. Mostly your feet/ankles and hands/fingers. My onco put me on Actonel which is given for osteoporosis since Arimidex also can weaken the bones. Since the 2nd week (take once a week) of me taking Actonel, 95% of the bone and joint pain was gone. I had to have surgery on one of my thumbs because of a \"trigger finger\" that locked up and I couldn't straighten out. I had 3 other ones. The 3 other ones completely took care of themselves once I started taking Actonel. I'd also get your cholesterol checked after you've been on Arimidex for awhile. It can cause the cholesterol, especially the tryglicerides to be high. Normal is under 150 and mine bounce back and forth between 450-650. Neither zocor or lipitor brought it down, plus the side affects for me of those I hated. I started taking Omega 3, fish oil, and I'll go in next week and get rechecked. Hopefully the Omega 3 will help to bring it down. I know what you mean about feeling like an old lady, but the Actonel hopefully will help you like it has me. Anything is better then cancer. Fosamax didn't help with the bone/joint pain and my stomach couldn't handle it, then I was switched to Actonel and what a blessing!!!!!! Hope this info helps. Oh, also, I noticed even with Actonel, the more I go barefoot, that's when I start having some of the pain in my feet/ankles. If I wear tennis shoes most of the time, I guess it's the support, but I don't have any problems. Nancy",

The 5 year survival is the same with lumpectomy and mastectomy, but you have a higher chance of having a local reoccurence with a lumpectomy, which would mean a mastectomy. He should also know if a sentinal node biopsy is necessary or not. I think it's great he's giving you an input with your care, but he's the one that should be telling you what he feels is best, not leave it totally up to you. Then you weigh the options. Yes, yours was caught early and your chances are very good that you won't have to deal with this beast again, but there are no guarentees. I've only seen er/pr + or -, never seen a number next to it.

      "Content": "Hi Mary, I was 43 when dx, so we're around the same age. I started on Tamoxifen because the onco thought I would start having periods again. After a year had passed since my last one and the studies were showing Arimidex to be superior to Tamoxifen, I switched. Arimidex can cause some pretty bad bone and joint pain. Mostly your feet/ankles and hands/fingers. My onco put me on Actonel which is given for osteoporosis since Arimidex also can weaken the bones. Since the 2nd week (take once a week) of me taking Actonel, 95% of the bone and joint pain was gone. I had to have surgery on one of my thumbs because of a \"trigger finger\" that locked up and I couldn't straighten out. I had 3 other ones. The 3 other ones completely took care of themselves once I started taking Actonel. I'd also get your cholesterol checked after you've been on Arimidex for awhile. It can cause the cholesterol, especially the tryglicerides to be high. Normal is under 150 and mine bounce back and forth between 450-650. Neither zocor or lipitor brought it down, plus the side affects for me of those I hated. I started taking Omega 3, fish oil, and I'll go in next week and get rechecked. Hopefully the Omega 3 will help to bring it down. I know what you mean about feeling like an old lady, but the Actonel hopefully will help you like it has me. Anything is better then cancer. Fosamax didn't help with the bone/joint pain and my stomach couldn't handle it, then I was switched to Actonel and what a blessing!!!!!! Hope this info helps. Oh, also, I noticed even with Actonel, the more I go barefoot, that's when I start having some of the pain in my feet/ankles. If I wear tennis shoes most of the time, I guess it's the support, but I don't have any problems. Nancy",

      "Content": "Kristen said it as well as anyone could. Breast Cancer knows no age, I was 43 (and yes, that is as young as 42... lol). Not to scare you, but my mammogram missed my tumor that I found and it was 5.5 cm which is large and I had positive lymph nodes as well. I didn't have any pain in my lymph nodes, but 9 were positive for cancer. I wouldn't stop at a mammogram, even if it says you're fine. Mine said I was fine and needless to say, I wasn't. If anyone says, \"let's watch it for 6 months\", find another doctor. If the antibiodics take care of it, then I would say chances are extremely good it was some type of infection. I think all the ladies here will tell you, not knowing and the waiting is the worst part. Don't wait, get an appt. and get the ball rolling. Chances are in your favor it's not BC, but you won't know until you're checked out and like you should be. If it comes back, not breast cancer, you can breathe a sigh of relief and put this scare out of your mind, but always do self examines. IF by chance, and I'm saying IF, it is, the sooner it's taken care of the less treatments will probably be necessary and of course the better the chances are you'll do great. I had no family history of cancer of any kind. Because your aunt had it, doesn't mean you will, but you need to be doing what you're doing and that's getting things checked out. BC isn't a death sentence anymore. I was dx Stage III and there are only 4 stages and 3 years+ later, I'm doing great. I know of one lady that had no lump in her breast that could be found, but her lymph nodes were positive for breast cancer and she's the only one I've heard of like that. I would say get an appt. and if the swelling and pain hasn't gone done and gotten better, I personally would tell the doctor you wanted a biopsy done on one or all of the nodes. That would be something they would know better then me, since it's happening in the nodes only. The American Cancer Society sent me literature AFTER I was dx and it said that mammograms miss 45% of all breast cancer in women under 50 and 35% in women over 50. They are great tests and have saved many lives, but don't but all your trust in the mammogram, take it further. Hugs and prayers and keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Hi Karen, Welome and you'll get a lot of support here. The mammogram missed what I found, which was an egg shaped lump/mass. I was told it was a cyst and see you in a year. My gut something wasn't right. I asked for a referral in the ciy I used to live in and after the surgeon wasn't able to get anything from a needle biopsy, so surgery was scheduled for a biopsy. To my shock, I had a 5.5 cm tumor 2/ 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16. I went throught the mod. radial mastectomy exactly 1 week after I was dx (dx on Valentine'Day 2002), chemo (FEC) x6 and 33 radiation treatments. I'm estrogen/progestine positive, so I am able to take something to help avoid a reoccurence It's been 3 1/2 years and no signs the cancer has returned. You're going to feel emotions you never knew you had, that that is completely \"normal\". Keep us updated and if you need someone to vent to, yoou can come to this forum and also, you are more then welcome to e-mail anytime. Best wishes and it's time to kick some cancer butt Nancy",

When I took Tamoxefin 2 years ago, I paid either $101.00 or $110.00 for 30 pills, so that is a huge difference, more so knowing the cost I'm sure has gone up since I took it. Call and ask them what Arimidex costs for 30 pills. I pay $213.00 for 30 pills. I don't think they could possibly sell something that wasn't what they say but again, I would be curious like you. I can see a $5.00 difference or maybe even $10.00 with something expensive, but that is a HUGE difference. I don't use CVS, so I don't know what they would get for the Arimidex. Curious to find out, that's for sure Nancy",

I was 43 when dx and her mom is 44 and she's considered \"young\" so they would be more aggressive. Also, I guess there are 3, oh well I can't count... They are having to go back in and see if the califications are malignant or B9 and even if B9, why wait around to see if they become cancer, get rid of the breast and the prognosis is even better. Why take a chance of having to do a mastectomy down the road and more treatment. It doesn't sound like they got clean margins, which means the actual tumor will be bigger then .6 cm and most Stage I ladies I know are getting 4 rounds of AC since you can have a reoccurence at any stage, they are treating more aggressive. Sounds to me like her onco/surgeon is on the ball and staying on top of things which is great.",

      "Content": "Hi, Your wife definately sounds like the kind of nurse I'd want taking care of me. You can see my bio at the bottom, so I won't repeat what you can read. I will say one thing. If she's unable to work, or they won't let her work part time, she can draw disability while she's going through treatment. Because of abuse, a week before my biopsy, I was also starting with a nasty divorce (not my idea of it being nasty) at the same time as my mastectomy and treatment. Since I was getting no help from him (that's another story in itself) I had to rely on my elderly parents. I finally went and applied for food stamps, but at that time hated doing it because so many abuse the system. I finally let myself realize that I needed and deserved the help and I wasn't going to be labeled anything for getting food stamps. Not only can ya'll apply for them since you aren't working right now, she can apply for short term disablity through her job or she can contact the social worker if she's going to a cancer institute vs an individual onco who doesn't have a social worker and they can tell ya'll what you are eligable for and will help you do all the paperwork needed. I lived an hour each way from where I went for treatment and I was able to get gas cards to cover that expense. If she feels like working that's great, but if she doesn't, she doesn't need to wear herself down and overdue it. I hope we've helped answer some of your questions. As much as I hated hearing I had this disease and an advanced stage on top of it, I really think in a lot of ways, it's harder on the care giver/loved ones then the patient, because you don't know what to do. For me, I didn't want the disease or treatment to take away my independence from doing what I was use to doing. I would tell your wife that you want to do anything she needs you to do, but you don't know what those things are and for her to tell you. That way she has no doubt (not that she does anyway) that she can ask for help, but that you won't try and stop her for doing things she feels up to. I had days that I felt great and mowed the yard (riding lawnmower) played with the dogs, cleaned house etc. Other days, I just wanted to lay on the couch and not move. I know she's taken care of cancer patients, so it may not be the same for her as us, but then again being the patient is different then the caregiver. It's an emotional roller coaster and she may be moody at times or be angry at the disease, so anything she says that is out of character for her, don't take it personal. I had a friend who wanted to take a hot bath and have a \"pitty party\" alone. Her husband, trying to be there for her, went into the bathroom and asked if she needed anything. She threw a bar of soap at him, then he realized she needed to be alone..... lol We can do and say some goofy things that's for sure. You're both going to great through this and I\"m so glad she has a loving husband that has reached out to us so you'll know what to expect and what to do to help her........ She's lucky to have you as I'm sure you're lucky to have her. K, shutting up now. As you can tell I'm the blabber mouth of the board and I'm also the President of the Whimp Club of America",

      "Content": "Hi, Something I forgot. Soy products and Flax seed are a definate no for anyone who's er/pr+ also. I don't know how old your wife is (you probably told me but chemo brain continues) but chemo put me into MENTALpause. For some reason, GYN's will alot of times I've heard offer meds for menopausal systems like hot flashes etc. but they have HORMONES in them.... not something we need or want. Many ladies have been put on the anti depressant Effexor and it seems to really help with the symptoms if that is/becomes a problem for your wife. I had alot of hot flashes on Tamoxifen along with the lovely night sweats (hey, still better then cancer, so I didn't complain) but when it was determined by the blood test that I was post menopausal and switched to Arimidex, I've not had anymore. If she is put on Arimidex down the road after treatment, have her keep an eye on her cholesterol. They have found about more and more that it is a side affect of Arimidex and my tryglicerides are 650 with under 150 being normal, so we're trying different kinds of statins and I'm taking4-5 of the omega 3 fish oil pills a day and we'll see what happens. If I told you that already, sorry, I forget what I've told what to who. Take care and best wishes Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Liz, I was also dx with Lobular BC. Mine was Stage III and Invasive with 9+ lymph nodes. I had just turned 43. My bio is at the bottom of this page. All the feelings and emotions you are feeling, everyone of us have had and you'll have more as the treatment, surgeries get started. There's nothing you could say to any of us that would be abnormal or be a shock. We've lived the nightmare. You might want to talk to your surgeon about a mastectomy vs. a lumpectomy, especially if you have node involvement or a large tumor. Lobular is prone to mirror itself in the other breast and the chances go up (not dramatically) depending on the size of the tumor and nodes involved if any. I opted to have the other breast removed as well to avoid it coming back in the other breast and going through chemo and radiation again. It may have never gone to the other breast, but I wanted to do everything humanly possible to avoid a reoccuance. And with what all I did, there are still no guarentees it won't come back. I was considered high risk because of my age and being Stage III. It's been 3 1/2 years and I'm doing good. I'm still with NED (No Evidence of Disease) and I'll have a bone scan, chest x-ray, tumor markers and all the routine labs that are done at each follow up visit. Cancer sucks and so does the treatment BUT it is doable and many work full time going through it. They have come a long way with nausea meds and treatment in general. You can and will get through this and before long, you'll start your new life, of life after BC and there is life after this. If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me as I don't get on her much anymore. Only 10% of women get Lobular......aren't we lucky....ugh Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, It's only natural to be worried. It seems everytime we turn around we're hearing of someone else being dx with cancer. A swollen lymph node could be from an infection BUT you are doing the smart thing by going to the doctor. Most of the time, the lump associated with breast cancer in the breast isn't painful, but mine was a little sore and I've heard from other ladies other the years that said theirs were painful. With this disease, there is no set of rules that it plays by. Family hx only accounts for 10-15% of all breast cancers. I had no family hx. 75% of lumps are B9, but the only good lump is one that's in a jar and that has been checked with pathology. Too many doctors still want us to \"watch and wait\". Mammograms are great tests, but they miss 45% of all BC in women under 50 and 35% of women over 50. That's why it's so important to have mammograms and to do Self Breast Exams. When is your appt? Know that you're in my prayers and just don't let the doctor blow you off. There are great doctors around and there are some who still don't understand that cancer knows no age limits, family history and doesn't really care if you're in excellent health or not........ it's a cruel disease, BUT the earlier it's caught, the easier to treat and the better prognosis. Keep us posted.",

VERY long story short.....a week before my biopsy, caught hubby cheating, he beat the crap out of me and went to live with his g/f. It would take a book to tell you the whole story, but my point is, I had to go through it alone. I didn't live in the same city as my family and since I never worked in the city I was living in, and just knew people that worked for the police department (now ex is a cop), I was not only going through treatments alone, but also having to go through court through all of it. It wasn't fun and at times it wasn't easy, but but your armour on and kick some cancer butt. I had a friend who came over at night when she could, but she worked and had a husband and kids to take care of, so it wasn't very often. If you need someone to talk to, I'll be glad to call you if after 9 central time is o.k. since that's when my cell goes free minutes. Don't mean to sound cheap, but I haven't been able to find a job yet since moving back to the city I lived in before I got married and where my family is. I'll be more then happy to be there to listen, answer questions, or anything else you need. If you just need to cry and someone to understand, I can do that too. Let me know by private message as we're not suppose to give out numbers on the board which is smart for safety reasons. There are alot of nuts in this world that love to find boards like these and get info. You WILL get through this, you really will. I didn't think I would but I did and don't think you'll feel like crap the whole time. The majority of women, myself included had days I was tired and felt like crap, but also had days that I felt like I was fine and wasn't going through treatment at all. What state are you in?

The ones I'm having checked in a couple of weeks, is the 1st one in a year. They aren't reliable, but more reliable for picking up reoccurences then initial dx. If I'm having problems, he listens to my problems and does test if necessary even if my TM are normal. One the other hand, many times you can have, example bone mets, long before you have any symptoms. If my tumor markers start rising and continue to rise, then he'd check things out. He puts more stock in what I say then the tumor markers, but since he knows what is normal for me, if they all the sudden go out of the normal range, something could be up.",

There are many types of treatment for Stage IV ladies and I know many that have been Stage IV for MANY years and still leading happy lives. Have they said there is no more treatment available? There are SO many kinds of chemo, many taken by mouth and of course, the I.V. kind that do wonders for keeping Stage IV \"stable\" or even shrink them as far as where they can't be found anymore. I'm one of those that wouldn't travel to another State unless where I go wasn't doing a Trial that could help. If you have a really good onco, I don't think anywhere else knows anymore then another. If you are in a small city where you only have a choice of 1 or 2 oncos, then that's different. Small areas normally aren't able to participate in Trials, but those are usually only done after nothing else has worked. If her onco is saying there is nothing else that can be done, get a 2nd opinion!!!",

I still have problems with sleep. I think my body got use to not sleeping through the night, it doesn't know how to anymore. BUT, the dogs and cat remember all to well what time breakfast comes, so no matter what time I fall asleep, I'm up by 6 to a cat on my chest and one dog staring me in the face........LOL Keep us posted on what kind of chemo she'll be getting and hopefully we can give her some pointers. No doubt she's a compassionate lady working with cancer patients, but I'm sure she feels like a fish out of water when she's the patient. Most onco's consider the day of surgery, when the visable cancer is removed as the beginning of her living with NED (No Evidence of Disease) and some even the dx date so even though it doesn't feel like it, she's kickin butt already Is she getting AC and then Taxol or Taxotere or 4 rounds of AC only? I noticed that she had node involvement, how many nodes were cancerous? I had 9 and my onco said they would have treated me the same way, very aggressively even if I had fewer nodes or for that matter in my case, no nodes since my tumor was so large. If you or Karen are up late at night and need to talk, just send me an e-mail and there's a good chance I'll be on line or it won't be long. Hugs and prayers to you both.",

He said the reason I have BC is because I'm a woman and have estrogen and progestine. Of coure I'm er/pr+ which says that my cancer was feeding off hormones, that why I'm now on Arimidex.

Seems to me we have an epidemic going on with this disease and I wish there was alot more money going into research. I have seen full page ads in magazines, not promoting any drug, but promoting the need for more money in hopes of finding a cure. I think more and more people have been affected by this disease, one way or another and finally realizing that it's not going to go away just because everyone wants it to. I just wanted to put my 2 cents in, o.k. 3 cents... lol I'm getting more and more nervous as my check up time gets closer, just a little over a week.

The other is, some people feel the same through all their chemo treatments, some the 1st one is the worst and others, like me, each treatment got harder and harder. With my 1st one, I felt real tired for a couple of days and then felt great, but each one had more bad days. Fatigue is a given with chemo. If there is anyway to make a final decision after she's had her 3 round, or even 2 round, I'll play it by ear and see hows she's feeing. That's the \"gone through chemo\" version.. lol IF the onco says go for it then go for it. I'm just concerned about how she might feel the more chemo she gets. Hopefully she'll be one of the lucky ones and it not be bad the entire time. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, I've never heard of a biopsy being done on a lymph node, but maybe that's something new some have started doing. Her taking hormones for menopause symptoms definitely should have been stopped. It's been studied and shown to increase the risk of breast cancer. I'm still amazed at the doctors who prescribe them when other drugs work just as good, if not better and don't increase the risk. Her being told to stop taking them doesn't mean that she's hormone positive or not. Even women who are negative, are told to never take them. Depending on the kind of cancer will determine the chemo's that will be used. Some seem to be more effective on one kind moreso then another kind. I thought there was \"breast cancer\", I didn't realize there were different kinds until I was dx. The most common kind is Ductal, and with nodes involved, it would be Invasive Ductal. Another kind is Lobular. In my case it was Invasive because I had it in 9 of my lymph nodes. The surgeon will know what kind it is, but I'm really surprised that they are giving your mom a size when surrounding tissue can be cancerous and that's included in the actual size. The tumor and surrounding tissue that was removed during my biopsy, was 3.5 cm. but when I had the mastectomy, there was an additional 2 cm of tissue that was cancerous. It's more then the actual \"lump\" that can and is involved unless it's \"in situ\", which hers wouldn't be since it's in node(s).",

      "Content": "You're definitely been doing your homework and know a lot more about it then I did when I found out I had cancer. Any questions you have, don't hesitate to ask. Yes. If he opts for a lumpectomy and they don't take enough tissue and they don't get clean margins, they will have to go back and either take more tissue and hope they get clean margins or do a mastectomy. Also, if they do a lumpectomy and get clean margins and it ends up you mom has quite a few lymph nodes positive, she may opt for a mastectomy. There are so many unknowns right now. It might be that if your mom doesn't want to chance extra surgeries, that she tell the surgeon if when they get in there and there are quite a few suspicious looking lymph nodes and or the tissue surrounding the tumor looks suspicious, to go ahead with the mastectomy. I can tell you that after just turning 43 and going through a divorce, so it wasn't like my husband would learn to deal with me nothing having 1 or both breast, that surgeons can do really nice jobs as far as the scar looks. I don't look \"mutilated\" like so many think. I never thought about it because I had no family hx (boy did I have a lot to learn), but I might have thought the same thing. You really do get use to it. They now have prothesis that adhere to your skin and you can wear a regular bra. There are bathing suits for masectomy patients. Here we have a store that is nothing but wigs, bathing suits, bras, etc. etc. etc. for BC survivors. I'm not by any means telling her to have a mastectomy, but without knowing how many nodes are involved or the size of the actual tumor, I wouldn't rule it out. When I knew mine was 3.5 cm and no clean margins, I had no doubts I wanted it gone. I wanted the cancer out of me and have never regretted my decision. As far as the size of the tumor and the nodes, it changes the dx, but it's all a crap shoot. I had a large tumor, young and 9+ nodes and it's been over 5 1/2 years and I'm still doing great and living with NED (no evidence of disease). I've seen ladies with tiny tumors and no node involvment have it come back. Of course the smaller the better chance, but there are many of us with large tumors and lots of positive nodes that are 5 1/2 - 11 years NED and still counting. There's every reason to have hope and to believe your mom will do great!!! How old is your mom if you don't mind me asking?",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, How long it takes to get chemo depends on what chemo you're getting. I got FEC and got all 3 at the same time. Some get AC and then Taxol or Taxotere, CMF etc. I'd definately bring a book to read. My onco's office had magazines, snacks, juices and all that good stuff but bringing a book will help the time pass. I'm assuming that to start off each treatment, everyone gets the same which would be nausea meds and decadron (steroids) before they actually start giving the chemo. Some chemos are drips and some have to be pushed and those the nurse will be right there with you and all the nurses that work for the cancer institute I go to were great and we'd just sit and talk about everything while they were giving the chemo. Where I went, sadly, they were open to 7:00p.m. even with all the rooms they had for chemo, it was always full, so your appt. might be the time they gave. I'm sure there are similiarities and differences depending on where you go, but the chairs I sat in were recliners and you could actually take a nap if you wanted to. Good luck and you'll do great Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Peggy, I'm not sure what kind of chemo you're taking. My info is at the bottom. I did have shortness of breat during chemo, but I also had times that my stomach would swell, almost like I was pregnant with twin elephants and past my due date......o.k. maybe not quite that bad, but you get the idea. I assumed it was either water retension or the bloating was causing pressure up high so I had trouble breathing. I don't think it started with me until about the 4th treatment, but of course we all react differently to chemo. Are your ankles swollen? I had to be put on lasix twice, not for fluid around my heart and lungs, but fluid period. After a few days on that, my ankle swelling went down and the breathing was better. I was also taking xanax and Paxil. I can't remember if I was taking that before it started or not. I don't know anyone that goes through this that couldn't use an anti-depressant and something for anxiety. If your onco doesn't suggest it, ask him. There's no point of this being any harder then it has to when there are meds out there to help. Something else I just thought about and no idea if it has anything to do with anything. Chemo put me into instant menopause, which might have contribuated to the stomach swelling, bloating etc. Keep and touch and keep asking questions until you get an answer, not just what it's not, what it is.

      "Content": "Hi, You asked Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan A biopsy is considered surgery even though you aren't completely put under, instead are given Versaid (or at least I was......the I don't give a *** shot). Again, I'm speaking from what they did with me and I'm sure there are many variations. I had an incisional biopsy and the surgeon removed the lump and tissue around it. I later found out he actually did a lumpectomy. Once it was confirmed that I had cancer, I opted for a mastectomy without a 2nd thought. I wanted no chances that the cancer could be somewhere else in the breast too. Had I not chosen a mastectomy, they would have gone back in to get \"clean margins\" which is where they remove more tissue around the area that has already been biopsied until they get tissue with no cancer cells in it. I've heard of ladies having 3 done before clean margins were gotten, but quite often they get clean margins with the 2nd try. They didn't do sentinal node biopsies when I was dx, or maybe because the size of the tumor, they expected to find node involvement. They removed all (16) of my lymph nodes at the same time as my mastectomy and 9 were positive. I'm confused at how they are already planning a treatment plan when they don't know what they will find. Alot of oncos give chemo to Stage I ladies routinely now to increase the chances of not having a reoccurence. There is no logic to this disease and many are treating with chemo even if there is no node involvement and the tumors are small. Of course as you can see in my case, that wasn't an option. My mammogram missed a large tumor and I had alot of + nodes. I started chemo about 4 weeks after my mastectomy and node disection so the time frame they are speaking of in regards to starting radiation sounds right. Again, I would want to know what is found before talking treatment. If they feel that the tumor is cancer, I would question why they aren't doing the sentinal node biopsy at the same time. It seems like alot of surgeries to accomplish the same thing as a couple could take. Obviously if they don't know or don't feel as certain as they can without a biopsy that it's cancer, then they wouldn't want to do a sentinal node biopsy. From what I understand and I could be wrong on this since I didn't have one, they have to inject the dye into the nipple a day or 2 before surgery and if I'm right, that would explain not doing it the same day as the incisional biopsy. I had my biopsy done and found out I had cancer on 2/14/02 and had the mastectomy/node disection on 2/21/02 so I got it over with as soon as possible, but if you aren't comfortable with what they are telling you, you can get a 2nd opinion and a couple of weeks isn't going to change the outcome. I was told that mine was a cyst even though I could feel an egg shaped lump that just popped up. They did an ultra sound and told me I had 2, 1 cm b9 cyst. I knew what I felt was one thing, not 2 and my gut told me to go somewhere else, which I did and well, you know the rest of the story. Listen to your gut, be your own advocate, use a doctor that you trust and don't settle for anything but the best treatment possible (and I'm not saying the doc you're talking about isn't giving you that). Best of luck and let us know. Hugs and prayers Nancy",

I know ladies who stay in the upper normal range. I know it's scary and I'm sure I would be too, but what mine told me was he was watching to see a pattern. Some oncos don't even run them because they aren't always accurate. With some ladies they are a good indicator that something is wrong. With others, theirs are normal even though they are Stage IV. I'm surprised you're still being seen every 3 months with being Stage I and he's running the tumor markers every time. If they continually go up, then I'm sure he'll do a bone scan, PET Scan or others tests. For right now, try not to worry. The chances of yours coming back being Stage I is very low. Did you have chemo or no treatment?",

      "Content": "Me personally, I would take one of the chemos, the one her onco thinks is the most effective for her type of BC. She's Stage II and I wouldn't just take Arimidex or Femara. Most women are getting 4 rounds of AC for Stage I and no nodes. There is no rhyme or reason to this disease and I would get the big guns now and hopefully avoid it in the future. I've seen ladies that were Stage I and just took hormone therapy just to have reoccurences. Stage II, I just don't think it's worth the risk and not take chemo.",

      "Content": "HI, I can't answer all your concerns, but I can tell you this. I had a 5.5cm tumor and 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16. They did a CT Scan, bone scan, chest x-ray and tons of lab work before I started chemo and I had NO distant mets. Just because you had node involvement does not mean that it has spread to organs or your bone. I know 3 ladies, one like me had 9+ nodes, one had 15+ nodes and 1 had 11+ nodes and none had distant mets. I'm 2 years and 8 months NED (No evidence of disease) and the other ladies are 4 yeras out and 6 years out. YOu always hope you don't have node involvement, but it doesn't mean it's gone to organs. I've seen ladies with tiny tumors and no node involvement and they have had reoccurences to the liver or bones. There is no rhyme or reason to this disease, I guess that's where there is no cure. Things may have changed since I was dx, but my surgeon said that they check several blood vessels during my mastectomy and found no cancer cells in them BUT that didn't mean it hadn't gone into my blood stream from the nodes. Again, unless things have changed, there is no test to know for sure. Obviously if they found vascular invasion then it is in the blood stream, but either way, the treatment would be the same. Chemo and radiation. I had 6 rounds of Cytoxin, Epriubensin (sp) and 5FU and then 33 or 36 treatments of radiation (Thank God I'm starting to forget some of this nightmare). I'd sit down with the surgeon and/or oncologist and ask them to explain the parts you don't understand. This is a very emotional time and I always had someone go with me because my brain shut down after hearing just so much. Your wife will get in the \"kick cancer butt\" mode, like we all do and she'll get through all the treatments fine. It sucks, but she can do it. I know this is hard on you also, so don't hesistate to ask questions. Most don't ramble like me.. LOL Take care Nancy",

Although not common, it can came back to the pancreas, kidneys and anywhere else it decides to mutate. Usually when it's mets vs a primary, it's more treatable, and as quickly as she's declining, to me it sounds more like primary pancreatic cancer, but I'm no doctor and I'm sure yours know what they are doing. I know it's possible, but having a recurrence after almost 30 years seems hard to believe, even though we're never safe from it happening. I pray that her pain is able to be controlled.

      "Content": "Hi, I've never had kids, so I don't know if the discharges and everything are normal or not. You're young, but that doesn't mean anything. BC knows no age. I would find a breast specialist or a surgeon and let them look and see what's going on. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of docs who think if you're under 50, don't worry. I'm NOT by any means saying your situation is like mine. I found a lump, jump popped up from nowhere. I had a mammogram, it came back fine. I had an Utra Sound, said that was fine too and come back in a year. My gut said something wasn't right so I called my Family Doc and told her I wanted to see a surgeon. I did and the bottom is my bio of my dx. Again, this DOES NOT mean you have breast cancer, it's just to point out, if you are worried and you feel uneasy about the, you're fine, I would go with your gut, get checked out by someone who specializes in breast cancer and get things checked out. If it's nothing and there's a good chance it is nothing, you'll have peace of mind knowing that you were checked over by someone who deals with breast cancer and diseases of the breast. I've heard of too many gyn. who still TRY to prescribe hormones to women for menopause even though they are breast cancer survivors and were hormone receptive, meaning their cancer feeds on hormones, which the majority do. Please keep us posted and write anytime. I think on how you're feeling, there's little doubt you need definate answers and I don't blame you. When I was dx in 2/02, it was 1 in 9 women. Last year it was 1 out of 7, this year I've read both, 1 out of 7 and 1 out of 6. This disease is an epidemic and the government doesn't seem to realize it and we need more funding!!!! It's time for a CURE. Hugs and prayers and I'm here anytime. E-mail me anytime. Nancy",

Not they I sit and look at women's chest..... lol Next time you watch t.v. and you see someone with a low cut dress on they will either look like you did prior to your mastectomy or they will look rounded, the rounded ones are inplants. The PS did tell me upfront that they wouldn't look like natural breasts, that they would be round and that's why he recommended the LD Flap since I was to chicken to even consider the Tram Flap, because they use your own tissue, muscle etc and they look natural.

      "Content": "Hi Liz, Like you, I'd want a bone scan to be sure it wasn't bone mets but I can tell you from experience, Arimidex can cause some major pain. I had a bone scan because of hip pain that was new (had stiffness and pain in my finger joints/feet and ankles, which started shortly after the Arimidex). I just knew it was bone mets, but that's the 1st thing we think about. My bone scan was fine, showed some degenertive (sp) places and 3 healing fractured ribs (not a clue how I did that). I also had a bone density test which showed the very earliest stages of osteoporosis (sp) so my onco went ahead and put me on Actonel. Within 2 weeks (you take it once a week) I had no hip pain, no feet/ankle and finger pain and have felt SO much better, almost human..... lol I had lower back pain and by physical exam, my onco said it was a disk, but he saw how stressed I was, so he went ahead and sent me for a MRI and, it was a herniated disk, no mets. We are going to feel pain, that had we had it before BC, we wouldn't have thought anything about it, but now, everything scares us unfortunately. Just wanted to give you my experience with bone/joint pain and what I found out. I celebrated having a herniated disk and only we can celebrate something like that ...... lol Hopefully someone will get that bone scan scheduled and find out what's going on and you might want to ask about Actonel or Fosamax to help strengten the bones, because Arimidex will do a number on them. Praying for good results and relief from the pain. Hugs Nancy",

I've heard of very few who didn't get these prior to treatment. You should never feel like you are insulting the oncos intelligence. Your mom has ever right to know about the care she is getting and to question anything that she's unsure of. Chances are this and that, but without the tests/scans, they really don't know for certain where they stand and assuming isn't good enough for me. This is too imporant to assume anything. Good luck",

You'll be hit by 3 angles like I was with all the node involvement you have, as I did. Use aloe vera after each treatment (not before) and if you start itching, I was given a RX for \"Zone A\" cream that really helped. The only thing bad about radiation is you go everyday. I had a hour each way so that made it tougher. You'll see the same people everyday and before long, everyone in the room feels like they know each other. I actually miss seeing some of the people that were taking radiation the same time I was. Not bad enough to go through it again...... lol I like you had ILC. No one tells us that mammograms miss 45% of all BC in women under 50 and doesn't pick up Lobular until we are dx. You gave your sisters good advice. Let us know when all treatment is over and we'll all do the NED dance with you. Most onco consider you NED either on the day you were dx or the day you had the obvious cancer removed, so you're already there Nancy",

I didn't start losing mine until the end of my 3rd treatment........ so much for thinking I'd be the 1 in a 100,000 that didn't lose theirs or whatever the odds were with the 3 chemo's I took together. Fatigue is a given with chemo. Some work all through treatments, some have accumulative affect and get more tired with each treatment. The day of chemo I felt fine, it was day 2 when it hit me. Everyone reacts differently so it's hard to know. Hope she has an easy time of it. Hugs Nancy",

Everyone I know says it's amazing at all the pink survivor shirts that are there and all the white shirts for the supporters. I've been told just seeing the thousands there with pink on gives them more hope and God knows, we can use all of that we can get. I don't know if you noticed and you may not know of anyone, but there's a place on that link from Northern where you can make a square for the quilt. It can be in honor of someone, or in my case, I made one in memory of my dearest friend Kim who we lost in Dec. NASCAR season is beginning, so now I won't have as much free time on my hands, which means not as much time to think.........thinking is a dangerous thing for me...... Let us know how it goes and take pics Tammy Nancy",

      "Content": "That's another thing that oncos have different views on. I never got any of those shots. I had my labs done 1 week after my 1st chemo, then 2 weeks and then 3 weeks, which was also the time for another chemo. They saw when my counts bottomed out and when they started rebounding. I was then checked 2 weeks after chemo and 3 weeks, which again, prior to the next treatment. My white count always rebounded on it's own, so I never had to get the shots. Some onco's give it regardless and as part of the routine and others give it only if needed. Sue is so right about the hair. My mastectomy when 1st dx and then the simple mastectomy I opted for due to stage, age and kind of BC never bothered me. I'm boobless and doing good. I guess I connected the breast with cancer and I have never missed them, just like I haven't missed the cancer, but my hair. That was the hardest thing for me by far. I had always had long hair and even though I had it cut twice to try and prepare myself, you can't. For me, when it started coming out, I started coming apart. It wasn't long before I accepted it, but when it 1st happens, that seems to be the toughest part. Your hair is part of your identity I guess and it seems cruel for the cancer to take that away from us while we're fighting the beast. It didn't help me at the time, but it really does come back. Mine is as long as it was before chemo. I need to get it cut, but.............. lol She's doing great!!",

My only suggestion and it may be the worse thing to do, so I'd check with a counselor or even if possible, find one who's a cancer survivor, regardless of the kind. Alcohol isn't going to help her liver and she's already had mets there once and, Thank God, she's back with NED. Would it help her (you know more of her frame of mind) to remind her about the liver mets and she needs to keep herself as strong and healthy as possible? Or would that just scare her more? There are meds (I take them) for anxiety which has helped me a lot through some of the toughest times. My prayers are with you and it's obvious you love your wife, but you do NOT deserved to be abused!!!!!!!!! Take care of yourself too!!!!!!!!!! Nancy",

That's over my head... lol I know they have found that ladies that are Her2Neu+++ benefit from having herceptin as part of their 1st round of treatment and I never understood why they waited to give herceptin after a reoccurence had happened. I'm sure they had their reasons. Maybe that was on the back burner in case someone went to stage IV and needed a kick butt drug. I don't know alot about Her2Neu and herceptin since I'm Her2Neu-, but I have friends who are Her2neu+++. I think (and you know I try not to, gives me a headache.. lol) you can only have Adriamycin once. There is Epirubensin which is in the same family as Adriamycin but more aggressive and has fewer side affects that someone could take if it came back, but I think Adriamycin is only a one time thing. I'm sure Leo or someone can correct me if I'm wrong. I'm glad they found that herceptin shows alot of promise as a 1st round treatment. In the 3 years since my dx, I'm amazed at how much they have learned and all the new treatments, nausea meds etc. that are out there to make things a little easier on the ones that are just starting the journey.",

      "Content": "Hi, YES, find a doctor that will do a biopsy. The only good lump is one in a jar. I too had a negative mammogram and ultra sound but my gut said there was something wrong. I insisted on a biopsy and I was dx with Stage III Invasive Lobular BC. The actual lump, isn't necessarily the total size, IF it is breast cancer. My actual lump was 3.5 cm, but what I had a mastectomy done, they found 2 more cm of cancer in the surrounding tissue. I also had 9 positive lumph nodes out of 16. I have no family history of breast cancer or cancer in general. The only way to be sure if it is cancerous of B9 is with a biopsy. My suggestion is an incisional biopsy beacuse even a needle biopsy can show a false negative. Again, it may not be breast cancer, BUT you won't know until a biopsy is done and if you're like I was, when my gut wasn't comfortable with what I was being told, you won't relax until you have it done. Please keep us posted Praying for B9 Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Marion, I've written you 3 times and then deleted them. TM's and oncos go from one extreme to the other. A friend of mine before she had her biopsy, had the CA 27-29 done and it was normal, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11+ nodes. Needless to say, they didn't do anymore tumor markers on her. I think they are better at detecting reoccurences then initial dx. I didn't have my 1st one until I was NED a year and my onco did them at each of my 3 month check ups for a year, to see what was normal for me. My last one was in Oct. and my next one will now be in Oct. I'm definately not a doc and I'll let one answer you with more definate answers but wanted to give you a little info that I learned based on my onco's views of TM. He said he would not do any on me during treatment as so many things can cause false positives, as well as false neg. and with the chemo, which is obviously a foreign body going in, he just wouldn't do them. The reason he waited a year was he wanted to be as sure as humanly possible that I was NED, then he could see what the norm was for me. The labs they do, tell a big picture, more then I even realized until recently. Of course the liver enzimes obviously keep an eye on the liver. Calcium levels, tell a lot about the bones, as far as mets go. Some oncos never do any TM. Mine doesn't do the CEA because everything can cause those to go up and down. I know easier said then done, because I freaked when mine went up 5 points and it was still in the low normal and the next time went back down. I was running a fever and that's more then likely what caused the slight change, but to me it was a huge change since they had always been almost identical each time. Try not to think about the TMs, especially at this point. You're getting the chemo regimine that your onco feels is best for your type of cancer and radiation and getting good care. I think a good onco is half the battle and it sounds like you've got one that is very good and truly cares about you as a person, not a number. You're already considered NED because the obvious cancer is gone and this is to get any stray little suckers that might be floating around, so you're on your way and before long, you'll be celebrating your 1 year NED. I don't know what is standard after treatment care, but mine did another CT Scan of my chest after treatment and a year later, did a bone scan (that was because I was hurting in places I hadn't hurt before) and that was fine. The way mine told me was if my tumor markers went up and continued to go up, he'd start checking to see IF it meant the cancer was back somewhere and on the other hand, if I was having problems, like I did when my lower back hurt so bad, that I just knew I had bone mets (he said it was a disk) and even though the TMs were normal, he did an MRI of my lower back and it was a herniated disk thank God. I hope this makes sense because I can confuse myself sometimes.....lol Hang in their girl, you're doing great and before long, you'll be done with treatment and starting your new life after cancer.

I had a 3% cance of getting leukemia from one of the chemo's I took, but that 3% chance vs. basically 100% chance the cancer was come back, wasn't a hard decision to make. I'd talk to your onco about your fears and go from there. A lot of the natural remedies also have side affects and what they are made from (the ones I've read about that ladies have talked about) like venom from a poisonous snake, mistletoe extract, which is nothing put poison etc. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi Mary, I was 43 when dx, so we're around the same age. I started on Tamoxifen because the onco thought I would start having periods again. After a year had passed since my last one and the studies were showing Arimidex to be superior to Tamoxifen, I switched. Arimidex can cause some pretty bad bone and joint pain. Mostly your feet/ankles and hands/fingers. My onco put me on Actonel which is given for osteoporosis since Arimidex also can weaken the bones. Since the 2nd week (take once a week) of me taking Actonel, 95% of the bone and joint pain was gone. I had to have surgery on one of my thumbs because of a \"trigger finger\" that locked up and I couldn't straighten out. I had 3 other ones. The 3 other ones completely took care of themselves once I started taking Actonel. I'd also get your cholesterol checked after you've been on Arimidex for awhile. It can cause the cholesterol, especially the tryglicerides to be high. Normal is under 150 and mine bounce back and forth between 450-650. Neither zocor or lipitor brought it down, plus the side affects for me of those I hated. I started taking Omega 3, fish oil, and I'll go in next week and get rechecked. Hopefully the Omega 3 will help to bring it down. I know what you mean about feeling like an old lady, but the Actonel hopefully will help you like it has me. Anything is better then cancer. Fosamax didn't help with the bone/joint pain and my stomach couldn't handle it, then I was switched to Actonel and what a blessing!!!!!! Hope this info helps. Oh, also, I noticed even with Actonel, the more I go barefoot, that's when I start having some of the pain in my feet/ankles. If I wear tennis shoes most of the time, I guess it's the support, but I don't have any problems. Nancy",

I don't know anything about the genetic test you're talking about, but I know that I was told that I had a 3% chance of getting leukemia from one of the chemos that I had. I was a Stage III w/9+ nodes, so obviously a 3% chance of getting leukemia and virtually 100% chance of it coming back without chemo was a no brainer. I know this is entirely different then what you're talking about, and I really don't know why I even typed it.....LOL Some days I think I'm a few french fries short of a happy meal....LOL Leo, I'm sure can shed some light on your situation. He checks the board and posts as often as his schedule will allow, but with him being an onco, I have no doubt he can help answer some of your questions. I definately would get a 2nd opinion.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your mom's dx. I had a bone scan and CT Scan of my chest to check for cancer in other places, but if it's a full body MRI, that I would think would be as good. This is my personal opinion, so I'm not saying that her surgeon is wrong. I opted for a mastectomy at 43 because my mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor and I wanted to be sure there wasn't cancer in any other part of the breast and the only way to know was to have the mastectomy. I also had the other breast removed because of my age (higher risk for recurrence) and Stage etc. I also had Invasive Lobular which is prone to mirror itself in the other breast. Do you know what kind of BC she has? How many nodes were involved? I think the week post surgery is when she could use the help the most. I think that would be perfect timing for you to go visit. The length of chemo and radiation sounds completely normal. Chemo put me into menopause, so it gave me more options of drugs to take since I was estrogen and progesterone positive (cancer fed off hormones). I would think at your mom's age, she has a good chance of the same thing happening to her. Do you know if she's hormone positive? Did they already do a lumpectomy and node removal but didn't get \"clean margins\"? The hardest part if not being able to lift after having nodes removed, but they are saying she already has nodes involved, so I'm confused on that part.",

      "Content": "Hi Kristen, We were the exact same age when dx and it sucks. I honestly don't know the answer. Have you talked to your onco about having your ovaries removed or get that shot that puts you into MENTALpause? I don't know if the combo of 3 chemos I took made a difference as far as it putting me into menopause or not. My onco fully expected me to start having periods again within 6 months of finishing chemo, but I didn't. I \"think\" (you know that's dangerous for me... lol) I asked about having my ovaries removed while I was on Tamoxefin and before I knew I was post menopausal, but I can't remember for sure. I just wanted everything removed that produced hormones to give me my best shot since I was Stage III. I'd talk to your onco and ask him the benefits of having your ovaries removed as far as helping to prevent a reoccurence. I'm sure like everything else with this disease, there will be differences of opinion depending on which onco you talk to which is why we stay confused. I really don't want to have surgery #9 (2 weren't BC/reconstruction related) but if it would help me live to be a ripe old age, then I'd do it in a second. I know Arimidex is suppose to kill hormones vs. putting some kind of protector around them so cancer cells can't get to them (that still confuses me), but even with Arimidex, I'd have my ovaries removed if he thought it would be beneficial. So, bottom line Kristen is I've been absolutely no help to you and I'm sorry. I would think having it done would help any er/pr+ and especially when we're \"young\" and that isn't in our favor, but mine told me it wouldn't help my chances, so I'm lost and confused as well. I'd talk to your onco at your next appt. and see what he/she says. Let me know what you find out and I'm going to ask mine again when I see him and see if he still feels the same way. I know getting through the 1st 2 years is a good thing because it shows our cancer wasn't chemo resistant and wasn't real aggressive, so they may be more apt to say no now because if it's not broke, don't fix it......... I'm as lost as you. I have my rad onco check up tomorrow so I'm having a case of canceritis and if I've made less sense then normal, I'm sorry, just real nervous when it comes to check ups. Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Mia, Look at my bio compared to yours........ I have NO plans of going anywhere anytime soon If I went by stats that are probably 5 years old, I would have a 50/50 chance or a little better of not having a reoccurence within 5 years. You being Stage II with a tiny tumor, the ACS stats for that are 85% chance you won't have a recurrence in 5 years. Those are old stats, and they are better now and we are all individuals. My best friend died 12/1/04 who was dx Stage III, one day before me. I'm over 3 1/2 years NED. I know some feel that if you have node involvement then that's the worse news possible......... we were treated very aggressively, we're er/pr+ and Her2 negative.....those are in our favor. Of course er/pr neg. and Her2 positive can also do great. It's a crap shoot, but based on what dx, you've got VERY good chances of never dealing with this beast again!!!! I promise, it gets easier. You've just completed treatment and you're beyond scared, just as I was. We feel like we're not doing anything anymore to kill the cancer since we're done with treatment. Our security blanket has been snatched away from us and it's terrifying. The 1st year I would get nervous 2 months before my check up and they were every 3 months. Now, I get nervous a couple of days before. In Oct. I have a bone scan, chest x-ray, tumor markers, regular labs and check up. I do get extremely nervous when it's test time (I have the bone scan and chest x-ray once a year) and there's no amount of xanax that will completely calm my nerves down, but that's once a year. I can honestly say that I think about cancer everyday, but it's more of a passing thought. It doesn't consume me like it use to. I use to live and breathe cancer. Go to sleep thinking about it and wake up thinking about it, but I PROMISE the more time that passes and you're NED, the easier it gets. I think we'll always have times of fears especially when something hurts that didn't use to (or we think it didn't use to) and will always have that black cloud hanging over our heads, BUT for me, once my hair started coming back and I started looking not so tired all the time and had some \"normalcy\" in my life again, it started getting easier. My onco doesn't believe in stats. If I ask him, he'll tell me what the ACS stats are, but he doesn't like numbers because we aren't numbers. My PET showed 2 hot spots in Dec 2002 and I was dx as you can see by my bio at bottom 2/14/02 and my last treatment/rads was 9/11 (I know, what dates). The hot spots were down my node disection side and my thyroid. The node disection side was healing still from the surgery and my thyroid ended up getting damaged during radiation and now I'm on synthroid. PETs are great (especially dogs and cats.....sorry, trying to make you smile but they are very prone to show false positives. Last year when I had my chest x-ray done, it showed I had 3, healing fractured ribs.......I'm on Arimidex, but they don't know if that did it, radiation could have caused it, or when I had a sinus infection and coughing caused it. An infection will also cause a PET to show a hot spot sometimes because it picks up any abnormal activity and inflamation is \"abnormal\" activity as well. I know easier said then done but we've all been where you are my friend but try to relax, get the sinuses cleared up and they can do another chest x-ray. Does your onco do tumor makers? Mine did them a year after I had been NED for a year, just to see what was normal for me and now does them once a year. He's not a big fan of them, but if they are elevated and keep going up, then he'll start running scans etc. It's a little less then 2 months before my tests/scans and I'm nervous, but not consummed. Now, about 2-3 weeks before, I'll be wondering the same thing you are right now but it's because of the scans. I'm not afraid of the tests, but of the results. That's once a year case of pure, raw nerves and that's alot better then in the beginning when I stayed that way. Hang in there and you'll see, it DOES get easier, thank God. If you need to talk, send me a personal message and I'll be sure and check throughout the day. Hugs and prayers for easier times that will come. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Susan, It really surprised me when I saw it was made from venom of a poisionous snake....never expected to see that. Yes, Talladega is where Nascar goes twice a year for racing. I'm a huge Kevin Harvick fan and I promised myself that I was going to start doing things I enjoyed after I finished up with treatment. It was last weekend and I had a great time. Never thought about cancer which is great. My driver missed the 25 car wreck they had, but was in the middle of the last wreck with only 2 laps to go. His car didn't quite look the same as it did and since the same driver caused both wrecks, I know mine wasn't happy, but he's learned not to say what's on his mind or it will cost him with money and points. As far as your other question, no, I don't think we ever quit worrying. I will say that prior to my check ups, I don't start worrying until a few days to a week before, where in the beginning, I'd worry 2 months before and I saw him every 3 months. It does get easier, but unless they come up with a Cure or something we can take that is 99% (since nothing is 100%) affective in preventing reoccurences, we'll have that black cloud hanging over our heads. My onco did tell me that the 1st 2 years is a big milestone since most reoccurences happen within the 1st 2 years. He said by getting past that 2 year point shows that I wasn't chemo resistant and that my cancer wasn't real aggressive. It's been a little over 3 years now and we all know it can come back after 3, 5, 10, 15 or anytime it wants, I feel a little more relaxed about it and where I wouldn't plan anything in advance out of fear that it would come back, I have plans to be back in Talladega in Oct. for the 2nd race there of the season, so there does come a time that you start living again. I hope that helps. It may have happened sooner if not for going through a divorce the last 3 years at the same time of my dx and treatment and my ex still is playing his games and keeping me in court every 4 months..........Dirty cop, corrupt city equals nothing but trouble for me. He's a good con man that's for sure. Anyway as usual I'm rambling. Take care and know all of this will get easier",

Usually when they do rads to bone mets, they also give me Aredia, Xomeda (ap) or another bone strengthner that makes the bones stronger so the pain is a lot less. The UK is where we get our info from a lot because the studies are able to be done more timely then in the U.S., but someone is missing something it seems like with your mom. I know many that have mets to the bones that have been stable for many many years and are virtually pain free. I'm not a doctor, but it might be time for a 2nd opinion. It may be that you learn a lot more about your mom's condition when you get there since no one is asking questions. Please keep us posted and you take care of YOU too!!! You're all in my prayers.",

      "Content": "Hi Worriedmom, It could be that they didn't get clear pictures and need more. If they see something on the mammogram and want to do an ultra sound, then I would insist that a biopsy be done on the area they see microcalifications or a lump. With you having a hx of BC in your family, you need to be very pro-active in getting mammograms and anything found removed. I could feel my lump and had no hx of Breast Cancer in my family, but my mammogram missed it and so did the ultra sound. The is NO test that can say if something is B9 or not, only a biopsy can do that. The tests are to show any abnormal findings. If it is a mass they see, it could be too small for you to feel if you're doing Self Breast Exams (which is how I found mine), which would be good news. I felt great when I was dx and most ladies I've talked to did too. My lymph nodes weren't swollen, but I had 9 + for cancer, so for the most part, there are no symptoms. Have the other films done. Again, I would insist on having a lump or cluster of microcalifications removed and not a needle biopsy, those aren't always accurate. The only good lump is one in a jar. I had just turned 43, again with no hx in my family. From this day forward, do monthly self breast exams and get your annual mammograms. Please let us know what you find out and please do NOT let the fear of having breast cancer, stop you from doing what you need to do. If it is, ignoring it won't make it go away, just more time to grown.",

      "Content": "Hi, Things are done very different in the U.S. I had a mastectomy, the entire breast removed because I had a large tumor. They also remove my lymph nodes and 9 out of 16 of them were positive for breast cancer as well. I had chemo and radiation and am doing well. There are side affects to chemo, but I've heard of very few that had alot of trouble. You stay tired, but really, that's the main side affect. There in an oncologist, Leo, that checks this forum when he's not on duty and has some time, and he will be alot of help to you. I'm not sure what to say since treatment there and here are completely different. Chemo may have side affects, BUT it's temporary and it's meant to KILL cancer cells that are left behind. Without chemo, the cancer continues to grow. I wouldn't say that if the dx had been a Stage I, even though most are taking chemo with the lower stages too, but if you were in the US, there would be surgery to remove the cancerous breast, all lymph nodes removed and chemo and radiation done. Has it spread to the liver, lungs, bones or anywhere? What kind of test have they done? Hugs and prayers",

      "Content": "Unfortunately, it's not unusual these days to see women in their 30's or even late 20's being dx. Family hx only accounts for between 10-15% of all breast cancer dx. Mammograms, even though they are the best we have and I highly recommend women get them because they DO find BC at early stages, they miss 45% of all BC in women under 50 (under that is considered young and higher risk) and 35% over 50. I wish they'd tell us these things before we're dx. It seems many doctors still think family hx is a huge factor and that mammograms results are full proof. I was told I was fine and to come back in a year........ Good thing I didn't listen.",

Mine didn't start coming out until right before my 4th round of FEC. The nurses looked up the chemos to see if there was a small % that didn't lose all their hair and there was but only on 1 of them, but I convenienced myself, I wasn't going to lose it. My dad happened to be at my house when I went to the bathroom to brush it and I felt so sorry for him. I didn't just cry, I was squalling and cussing the disease and pretty much had a meltdown. I'd say within a few days or a week, I accepted it as it was, gone. I wasn't smart like you and had it cut off. I had 3 haircuts before chemo, so my hair went from 1/2 way down my back to right under my ears, but let it come out at it's own speed (fast). I found a sweather hanging in the closet when I was moving and it was clean, but had alot of strands of my hair on the inside of it. BUT now it's back to half way down my back and hard to believe I ever lost it.....my hair not my mind, that's a given... lol You'll be amazed at how quick time goes and chemo is over. You're doing great!!!!!!!!!!! Hugs Nancy",

No one knows if or when they will have a reoccurence regardless of stage. All I know is he's alive and doing great. I have no doubt had I not had chemo, I would have been gone a couple of years ago. I did what my onco recommended, I did alot of research and I'm here 3 1/2 years later. Everyone needs to do what is best for them. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I personally also don't think it's healthy to dwell on the disease and to enjoy life, so having said that. Someone else will have to debate with you on this topic. I do know the longer someone goes without a reoccurence, the better chance they have of beating it again if it does come back. Those who have reoccuences within the 1st couple of years, usually don't do well because treatment wasn't as effective. I could get run over by a car tonight and die. There are no guarentees in life, but I'm going to do what gives me the best chance. Have a good day. I'm off to do something besides think and talk about cancer, and no, that's not called burying my head in the sand, it's called \" Life after cancer\"",

This is what I found on it and based on what it's made from, and what it does, which is works as a blood thinner, scares me. There isn't much info on it except for site that tell you to buy it from them. Check out what it's made from. I've heard alot of women on Effexor for menopause systems. Chemo put me into menopause and I was on Tamoxifen and Effexor, and for me, it didn't help. Once I changed to Arimidex, I had no more hot flashes or night sweats. I went from Effexor to Paxil for depression mid treatment, so I'm assuming Tamoxifen was the culprit as far as menopause side affects. I'm sure you'll hear from other ladies that take Effexor as that's the most used med I've seen to combat hot flashes etc. Lachesis Mutus This homeopathic remedy comes from the poisonous venom of the bushmaster snake. Lachesis mutus has potent effects on the blood and central nervous system. The most important effect of Lachesis mutus is its blood-thinning, or anti-coagulant, function. This action enhances blood flow and facilitates the healing process by hastening the removal of toxins from the blood. The remedy is effective against many bleeding disorders. Lachesis mutus is prescribed for relieving depression, palpitations, migraines and other throbbing headaches, tonsillitis, anal fissures, hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged menstrual periods, poor circulation, cold extremities, a swollen or inflamed tongue, and all types of skin ulcers and wounds. It is also used to ease menopausal symptoms.",

      "Content": "Hi, To some extent, I can understand the fear of the unknown, but when I found my lump, I went and got it checked. Even though I had no hx, which found out later that has little to do with most BC's and I was \"young\" I knew the lump didn't belong there. I called a surgeon myself when I was told to come back in a year because the mammogram didn't pick up what I and my doc clearly felt. Fear is very real when it comes to cancer, but ignoring it just makes it grow and spread. I pray it's not in her lungs, but it is suspicious. Ladies are Stage IV and chemo can kick butt and keep them stable and I know of one lady that had IBC, had it spread to her lungs, nodes and liver and she went back NED (No Evidence of Disease) and has been there for 2 years. Stable is the most realistic hope, but stable is a good thing. I pray she'll take treatment. As Jim said, be there for her, help when you feel you can and if she doesn't want you to, she'll say something. I wanted to be as independant as I could, especially living alone and not wanting my parents to make the drive to help, but when I needed help, I would ask. Everyone handles it different and you'll know. Having her family around and being supportive and just knowing she has people that love her will be a big help Keep us posted!!",

Your FIL needs to drag her to a doctor even if it's with her kicking and screaming. Fear is not going to stop whatever is going on but it will keep it going and getting worse and worse.

I've heard of ladies that have had discharge and from what I understand, it can go either way. I have no hx of cancer of any kind in my family, and was dx not long after I turned 43. I'm praying your results will be B9, but if they aren't, we're here. If you'll look at my dx, I had so many things against me, but 5 1/2 years later, I'm doing great and NED (No evidence of disease). There's no doubt, it's scary not knowing. Having the lumps removed is absolutely the right thing to do. There is not test besides a biposy that can tell if it is or isn't cancer.

BUT, the dogs and cat remember all to well what time breakfast comes, so no matter what time I fall asleep, I'm up by 6 to a cat on my chest and one dog staring me in the face........LOL Keep us posted on what kind of chemo she'll be getting and hopefully we can give her some pointers. No doubt she's a compassionate lady working with cancer patients, but I'm sure she feels like a fish out of water when she's the patient. Most onco's consider the day of surgery, when the visable cancer is removed as the beginning of her living with NED (No Evidence of Disease) and some even the dx date so even though it doesn't feel like it, she's kickin butt already Is she getting AC and then Taxol or Taxotere or 4 rounds of AC only? I noticed that she had node involvement, how many nodes were cancerous? I had 9 and my onco said they would have treated me the same way, very aggressively even if I had fewer nodes or for that matter in my case, no nodes since my tumor was so large. If you or Karen are up late at night and need to talk, just send me an e-mail and there's a good chance I'll be on line or it won't be long. Hugs and prayers to you both.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom having a reoccurence. It's amazing and makes no sense how after 15 years those cells are still lingering. You'd think one time around with this crap is more then enough. From what I've read latey and Leo can correct me if I'm wrong......and he will. lol Some say take Tamoxifen for 2 - 3 years then switch to Arimidex, Femara or one of those. Others say use Arimidex as 1st line of treatment. I was dx Stage III (mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor....bio below) and I was put on Tamoxifen after treatment because my onco thought I'd start having my periods again because of my age. After I didn't have one for 6 months after I was done, he did a blood test and chemo put me into MENTALpause. At that time more and more was known about Arimidex and my onco and I both agreed that Arimidex was the way to go. I've been taking it now for over 2 years. My personal opinion, is with your mom being Stage IV, I would go with Arimidex. She needs to sit down with her onco and discuss it and they decide which is the best way to go. Arimidex has been proven to be superior to Tamoxifen in preventing reoccurences and given to Stage IV ladies. I don't know how it works with Stage IV, but I didn't start anything until after I finished chemo. They might put her on Arimidex or one of the others while she's taking chemo for the liver mets. I've seen many do that. If she took Tamoxifen during her 1st dx, I don't know if she can take it again or not. I never thought of that. I hope I've been of some help, but I'm sure Leo (he's the onco that started this forum) can tell you more and in a much shorter post Hugs and prayers to you and your mom and let's kick some cancer butt Nancy",

      "Content": "The only thing your mom could have taken the 1st time being pre-menapausal would have been Tamoxifen. Arimidex and the other are for post menopausal women only and as far as I know, none of them were around 15 years ago. As far as I know, the only difference in the Aromatase inhibitor are the side affects. Again, Leo will know more as well as some of the other ladies, but normally after someone is on Tamoxifen for 5 years, they go on Femara. Starting out on something else, or as a 1st line of med is Arimidex. I think it's an individual opinion of the onco as to which he likes better. I have seen someone start with Tamoxifen and after 5 years, they go on Arimidex. I don't think and haven't read any studies that says one of the inhibitors is better then the other, but Arimidex has been out longer and have more studies on that.",

With as much that's in my bio, I'm sure it looked like it had to be more then one, but I ramble in even them..... lol 'No, I'm done with reconstruction unless they come up with a less invasive way to do it. I've had 8 surgeries, 6 were connected to the BC/mastectomies and the attempted reconstruction, one from, more then likely the Arimidex and the other is questionable. I tore the ligament (sp) completely in my wrist, but didn't have any kind of injury or accident that would have caused that much damage. So not sure if chemo, Arimidex weakens the muscles and ligaments too or if I'm just that lucky...... lol If I could do it over, I would have seen a PS before my mastectomy, but at the time I was dx on a Thur. Valentine's Day, went to an out of town surgeon that I wanted to do the MRM on Monday and had the MRM on Thur., so not much time to think, which was good for me. Who knows what else they will have in a couple of years. I told myself if I made it the 5 years, which I plan on then I might consider trying again, but definately not until then. I've retired as a professional surgery patient..... lol My last one I had prior to BC is when I was 3 and it was my tonsils. I don't do anything in moderation.......UGH Your PS really did do a good job.

I like you am concerned about the dimpling. It being soft sounds like a cyst. My personal opinion based on my experience is if nothing shows up on the mammogram, an ultra sound should be done and whatever is found needs to be biopsied. Praying for B9, but if by chance it's not. You've come to the right place for support. Hugs and prayers",

      "Content": "Hi Liz, I know you wrote to Leo and I wouldn't begin to give advice on something I don't know anything about. You said your onco discharged you this year? In the states, you see your onco every 3 months for the first couple of years and then every 6 months and after 5 years it goes to once a year. I'm sure there is some various to this, but that's in general. I can't believe that he just basically said you were on your own after a year. I'd call him and make an appt. or get an earlier appt. with your surgeon, or even get one with your PCP and any of them can order a MRI or CT Scan of your head. I don't know and haven't heard of some of the things you mentioned in your post, so again, I'm not suggesting that it does or doesn't sound like mets, but you can't just sit there and worry about it. Call those docs and get in with the 1st one you can. The waiting and wondering and worrying is a horrible thing. Best wishes and please keep us posted You're in my prayers Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, Arimidex can cause bad bone and joint pain. Mine was so bad it was hard for me to get out of bed, my feet/ankles hurt so bad. I also got trigger fingers. I told my onco about it and even though I don't have osteoporosis, he put me on Actonel (it prevents it too) and the 2nd time I took it, the pain in my feet/ankles, hands and fingers was gone. The trigger fingers even quick locking up and my fingers are completely normal. You might want to ask your onco about that. Let me know what he/she says and how it works for you. It was such a blessing to me. NO MORE PAIN and Arimidex is such a good drug, I didn't want to get off of it, especially with my age/stage. Also, get your cholesterol checked. Arimidex can cause that to go sky high. My triglicerites have been as high a 725. I'm on crestor now and get it rechecked later this month. It doesn't affect everyone, but a friend of mine who's on Femara is having the same problems. I'll happily take another pill to keep this cancer away",

It's showing after 5 years the survival rate goes down. I thought the longer out without a reoccurence the better chance not to have one, but that link says differently. Next question.... lol Not sure if i want the answer though.. When it comes to er/pr+......is it better to be 80% er/pr+ as far as prognosis and using Arimidex, Tamoxifen or whatever or is it a better prognosis if your er/pr + is 30%? Don't you love my questions.... lol Thanks Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, To some extent, I can understand the fear of the unknown, but when I found my lump, I went and got it checked. Even though I had no hx, which found out later that has little to do with most BC's and I was \"young\" I knew the lump didn't belong there. I called a surgeon myself when I was told to come back in a year because the mammogram didn't pick up what I and my doc clearly felt. Fear is very real when it comes to cancer, but ignoring it just makes it grow and spread. I pray it's not in her lungs, but it is suspicious. Ladies are Stage IV and chemo can kick butt and keep them stable and I know of one lady that had IBC, had it spread to her lungs, nodes and liver and she went back NED (No Evidence of Disease) and has been there for 2 years. Stable is the most realistic hope, but stable is a good thing. I pray she'll take treatment. As Jim said, be there for her, help when you feel you can and if she doesn't want you to, she'll say something. I wanted to be as independant as I could, especially living alone and not wanting my parents to make the drive to help, but when I needed help, I would ask. Everyone handles it different and you'll know. Having her family around and being supportive and just knowing she has people that love her will be a big help Keep us posted!!",

You said your mom took the chemo \"pill\". Did she have chemo or only take something like Tamoxifen? Are they giving her any bone strengthener or just did radiation? Radiation is very common for bone mets, but most I know also take something to strengthen the bones as well. Please know that your family is in my prayers. I've been dx with Breast Cancer had my best friend was dx as well, so I've been on both sides of the patient and the care giver. Being the caregiver is an emotional roller coaster itself.

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, OUCH sounds like an understatement. Bless your heart that has to be miserable. I used 100% aloe vera after each radiation treatment and then when I started burning, my rads onco told me to use the liquid Vitamin E to put on after treatment. About a week, maybe 10 days before I was done, I had blisters on my neck from where the rads hit me and it was right there where you sweat and that burned SO bad. My rads onco. gave me \"Zone A\" cream that helped with the itching. It wasn't horrible at the end, but it wasn't fun by any means. About a week after radiation, my chest looked black (remember I had to get hit and hit hard because of being stage III and hit from 3 angles, not 2) and I don't know how many layers peeled, but it was fried, but no pain because it was dead skin and the skin under it was tan, but no pain. Well, maybe your oozing wasn't as gross as you thought after reading what I just wrote.... lol Just think, your final part of your journey is almost over....... congrats!!!!!",

I'm no expert on Pagets, but I find that hard to believe that they are accurate numbers. I had Stage III, with a large tumor and 9 lymph nodes that were cancerous also and only 43. My survival rate was about 50/50. When they talk about survival rate, it's survival rate without a recurrence in 5 years, not if someone will be alive or not. Of course, none of us want a reccurence, so it's scary, but it does get easier with the more time that passes. Here's a site that I have found to be one of the best and accurate. It said most of the time, Paget's is not invasive and contained in the nipple with an excellent prognosis. If it has spread, then more aggressive treatment would be necessary, but still sounds like there is every reason to believe that she'll be around for many, many years http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/pagets_disease.asp A day at the spa sounds like an awesome gift and one I know she'll enjoy (you can mail my certificate......LOL). I would let her bring up the subject and be there to listen, but if she doesn't bring it up, try to keep things as normal as possible. Chances are excellent that she's going to do great and not have to deal with this ever again!!! There is a paget's disease of the bone, and that's a whole different disease, but have the same name.

      "Content": "Hi, From what I remember reading about it, it has an excellent prognosis. I know one lady that was dx with it, and it hadn't even spread into any tissue and stayed in the nipple, so she had that removed and needed no other treatment. I would write down a list of questions you have and ask the doctor, as far as any other treatment necessary, has it spread etc. In most cases, I would say, saying you're going to be fine, is something none of feel when we're dx, especially with later stage dx, but in her case, you very well be able to say that with 99.9 accuracy. I had a 50/50 chance of it coming back within 5 years, 5 1/2 years ago, so I would have loved to have heard 99 % chance that it wouldn't !!! Ask lots of questions. Everyone's dx is different and even though the internet has good sources, they clump everyone into one catagory and we're all individuals. In my case, the ACS, at that time (they have updated since) said 46% chance for me. My onco said it was better because I was hormone positive, but because I was only 43, that was against me, so their stats really only apply to the general dx, not everything else that is involved. Just be yourself and hopefully the pathology report will be to where her doc can explain it better to lessen her worry. Remember, it's called Padget's DISEASE, not CANCER, so it's a very unaggressive kind that rarely gives anyone problems. That's a lot to be thankful for. Let us know when you find out more.",

I'm taking that as a good thing since I had a bone scan and upper quad ultra sound, along with my annual chest x-ray and all was fine. This appt. should be one I don't worry about as much, since I've had \"problems\" but not were related to the BC and a reoccurence. I want so much to come on here and post NED, exactly 3 years on Monday I started doing the 15 min. Denise Austin abs workout and I didn't know I had so many muscles that could hurt.....LOL I keep telling myself, the pain is from working out so I don't \"go there\", and I'm doing a pretty good job of that. Thanks for being here for me to vent and freak out......LOL Hugs to you all Nancy",

I think the key word in that is that this guy SELLS books. There is a vitamin called biotin that helps with hair growth and has been known to for years, but nothing that makes it come back quicker then the 1/2 \" a month average, but helps for it to come in healthier. I took that and never noticed a difference even. I don't know about everyone else, but I actually measured my hair to make sure I was getting my 1/2\" a month... lol and there were a few times that I would have spurts where it seemed to come in faster. It's hard to believe now, but it will be back before you know it. My last chemo was 2 years ago this last June and it's half way down my back again and have actually had 2 hair cuts.

Right now, they know there's a lot of LCIS, but unless all the breast tissue (Mastectomy(ies) is removed and sent to pathology, there's no way to be 100% sure that there isn't any invasive. Since Lobular is prone to mirror itself in the other breast, that's why I would and did opt to have both removed.......... I went for the most aggressive way to treat, including surgery so hopefully it would be the last time. Keep us posted.",

      "Content": "The one I know that didn't have chemo and the one that did, both had mastectomies. Your wife's tumor isn't huge, but it's not small. Since there is no test to see if the cancer is in the blood stream, they have to go on the assumption that it has traveled especially if there are nodes involved. Stage II ladies without nodes have chemo. I was Stage III 5.5 cm tumor and 9+ nodes out of 16. Several blood vessels that were removed during the mastectomy were checked and there were no cancer cells present, BUT it was highly unlikely that it wasn't in my blood stream. They just check an area, that at that particular moment, didn't have cancer cells floating though. This is a decision only your wife and you can make, but from my experience and the MANY ladies I've met in the last 3 1/2 years, I would definately have chemo if I had just been dx Stage I as well as II. It's hard now with having chemo and radiation and mastecomy (the simple mastectomy on the other side) because every new pain, the 1st thought is, it's back. I would think, for me, being Stage II and not having treatment would make that cloud that much darker and when you worry that much, you lose quality of life. I do real good until right before check up time, but I think everyone does that. I went in to this determined to do everything I could to give me the very best chance of not having it come back.",

      "Content": "Hi Betty, Jan is right. You should drink plenty of water the day of and for the next couple of days after chemo to flush it out. The onco should give you a list of things to do and what side affects are very common and if you have a problem, when you should call them. Most tolerate chemo without much more then nausea and fatigue. I've seen women who went to work everyday during it. I think fatigue is a given, but some don't even have nausea. I never had to take the Nuelasta shot which will cause bone pain because my white counts rebounded on their own after they bottomed out. Your onco will probably tell you to stay away from strawberries and salads because where normally it wouldn't phase us, strawberries are impossible to get completely clean. Mine told me with a few exceptions, to eat what I felt like. I actually found that when I had nausea, when I ate something like baked chicken, it calmed my stomach. More then likely you'll gain weight from the steroids (Decadron) but you can lose that when treatment is done. I had no problems from the steroids. They will give you nausea meds along with the chemo. Again, most tolerate it well and just take it one day at a time. You'll get through this and we'll be here to help in anyway we can. Before you know it, treatment will be over, your hair will start growing back and you'll start to get more energy back. It was 3 years ago yesterday I was dx and it's seems so hard to believe that much time has passed. Hugs and prayers and know you aren't alone. We're with you each step of the way. Nancy",

The only good lump is one in a jar and as far as family history, that only accounts for 10-15% of BC. I was the 1st one in my family, 3 generations back is all we are sure of, but that's many years back. Praying it's an infection or B9, just find out for sure for your sanity and God forbid it is cancer, better to find out now then down the road when it's had time to grow. Keep up posted. Nancy",

She never got to feeling much better and started having a lot of pain to the point of having to have morphine even after she got home. They had focused on the left side since that's the side the pneumonia was on. They did a bone scan last week and she just got the results, mets to the spine and right rib. She'll talk to her onco later today and find out what his game plan is. She was dx Stage III and had just finished up chemo then rads in Nov. Praying they can do rads and something to strengthen her bones and get this beast gone once and for all. She had come over here and posted for awhile, but then got sick and hadn't been on in a couple of months, but I'm sure many remember her. She's a wonderful lady and a dear friend. Thanks Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Pam, 1st, shingles and cancer as far as I know aren't related at all. You can get shingles during chemo or anytime your immune system is compromised. It's from the same virus as chickenpox, so if you ever had them, you can get shingles. I had them during radiation, which was after chemo. As far as IBC, I have a good friend that was dx with it and as far as I know, the rash and fever of the area doesn't come and go. But, like any other kind of BC, the only way to be sure is with a biopsy. Mammograms are great for many ladies, but they also miss large tumors in others, like mine did. I personally would ask for a biopsy so you have a definate answer and not have the contant worry. Not knowing is horrible. I'm troubled with the fact that the breast specialist couldn't find time for you. I'd ask my PCP for another recommendation or do what I did when I was told I was fine, to come back in a year, I called a surgeon myself and had the biopsy done.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom's cancer coming back. This disease is beyond cruel and can rear it's ugly head anytime. We need a cure NOW. You said your mom took the chemo \"pill\". Did she have chemo or only take something like Tamoxifen? Are they giving her any bone strengthener or just did radiation? Radiation is very common for bone mets, but most I know also take something to strengthen the bones as well. Please know that your family is in my prayers. I've been dx with Breast Cancer had my best friend was dx as well, so I've been on both sides of the patient and the care giver. Being the caregiver is an emotional roller coaster itself. I'm sure someone who's dealing with mets will be able to give you more info.",

      "Content": "Hi tmma, When you get to the UK, I'd be asking her onco when they plan on finding out if it's a reccurence of BC or a new primary. Also, is she not on any bone strengthner? Usually when they do rads to bone mets, they also give me Aredia, Xomeda (ap) or another bone strengthner that makes the bones stronger so the pain is a lot less. The UK is where we get our info from a lot because the studies are able to be done more timely then in the U.S., but someone is missing something it seems like with your mom. I know many that have mets to the bones that have been stable for many many years and are virtually pain free. I'm not a doctor, but it might be time for a 2nd opinion. It may be that you learn a lot more about your mom's condition when you get there since no one is asking questions. Please keep us posted and you take care of YOU too!!! You're all in my prayers.",

This all changed after healing time. You need to be sure and do the exercises you were given. I babied my arm because it hurt so bad and that just made matters worse, and I didn't get the range of motion back that I should have. I have 100% range of motion back and have had no problems at all. The drain stays in until the blood and gook it gets is down to a certain level. One stayed in a week and one time, it stayed in 3 weeks. I'd rather leave the drain in until it was ready to come out, then have to go in and have it aspirated. If you keep your arm elevated when you're laying down, that will help. Best wishes",

No clue why 14 days seems to be the magic number, but it does. I personally started losing my hair right before the 4th treatment which really sucked. I had convenienced myself that I was going to be the lucky 1 out of who knows how many that didn't and even my onco and the nurses were surprised I still had it, but then I brushed my hair one day and it was coming out by the brush loads. I'd have your wig, scarfs or whatever you're going to use ready so it's there when you need it. As far as how everyone responds to chemo, it's all different. Most tolerate it with fatigue and some nausea (meds for the nausea) and do well. It's not fun but definately doable. I had 3 at the same time, so I had 6 treatments. You'll have 2 at a time, then 1 by itself, but I'm assuming the normal 8 treatments. Hang in there, you'll do great!!!! Hugs and prayers Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Jilly, I don't think you are being too sensitive at all. Breast Cancer is serious stuff and he acted like you had a cold. LCIS is considered pre cancerous by some, but it is considered early (very) stage BC by others. When I had my mammogram (which missed my tumor) and the ulta sound, the surgeon that I used for my mastectomies, asked me to bring the films from the hospital where they were done. I didn't have to have a repeat test that I just had, which insurance probably wouldn't have paid for anyway. If this surgeon doesn't think they are that great, then why can't he get a radiologist that he likes to read them? Why rack up more bills for you, not to mention having you repeat the same test again?? This wait, watch and see what happens is total BS. I was told to come back in a year, since the mammogram missed mine and thank God I didn't listen. Was this the 2nd surgeon or the 1st one? If it takes 3, it would be worth it. You need to know if it's Invasive or only In Situ. Even if it's only LCIS and none is invasive, I'd want that mass out of me. Since there is question if there is Invasive or not, I'd want that out of me and biopsied. I can understand why you're disgusted. This is your life and your health and you feel like you're getting blown off. Remember, the doctors work for YOU and if it takes another opinion or going back to the 1st one, I have no doubt that's what I would do. Of course the decision is yours, but from someone who got blown off, I know how it feels. Thank God I didn't listen and got another opinion. Please let me know what you decide and what happens. I was pre menopaual at 43, so I'm assuming you're in your 30's or 40's since he's mentioning Tamoxifen?",

      "Content": "Hi, There is no test besides a biopsy that can tell if it's Invasive or not, unless of course it's in the bones or another organ, which thank God is not the case. I was dx with ILC (bio at bottom). Lobular is sneakier then Ductal. Lobular is prone to mirror itself in the other breast. You can have DCIS and Invasive Ductal, just like you can have LCIS and Invasive Lobular, but Lobular hides itself on mammgrams. My Ulra sound was read that I had 2, 1 cm cysts and to come back in a year. I didn't know at the time that an ultra sound or no other test can tell if it's cancer or what kind. My gut said to get it out, which I did and thank God. I was already Stage III with 9+ nodes and had just turned 43. PET Scans are good, but they aren't 100%. They can pick up tumors smaller then other tests, but again, I wouldn't be 100% sure it wasn't in your nodes based on that test. It can also give false positives, which in your case it looks like it didn't show anything. I personally think it would be a huge mistake for the surgeon not to do a Sentinal Node Biopsy. That's where they remove about 3 and if the 1st 2 are negative, then they don't take anymore. I opted for a double mastectomy, not only because it's prone to mirror itself, but on the cancer side, there was no way to be sure if that one tumor was the only one, or if there were more small ones that couldn't be picked up yet. I hope this has helped and please e-mail me or post anytime. I don't think I have it checked to show my e-mail and I need to fix it, but it's [email protected]",

      "Content": "Hi Betty, Sorry you had to join the \"club\" of breast cancer ladies. Being scared is very normal. The word \"cancer' itself scared me long before I was dx. I don't know what kind of chemo you are taking, but because I was Stage III w/9+ nodes, I was on a very aggressive chemo combo. I took 3 chemos each treatment. It wasn't fun, but it's doable. Everyone responds to chemo different. I never got sick, but had nausea. They have come out with new meds for that since I was dx 3 years ago today. They are always making progress with treatment and side affects. You will go through an emotional roller coaster from hell in the beginning. I'm not saying that to scare you, but for you to know when you think you are feeling something that you've never felt before (emotionally) or if you ever think what you are feeling isn't normal......... it is. Once you start treatment, believe it or not, you'll find humor in some of the things people say or things you do. We have to find humor in this mess to save our sanity. Anytime you need to ask a question or feel something out of the ordinary for you, write us and there's nothing you will tell us that we haven't all felt and hopefully that will help you, to know you aren't alone. I had no problem or regrets having both breasts removed at 43. Losing my hair was the hardest part, but even then, after you have accepted it's coming out or gone, you'll be o.k. My hair is half way down my back and I never thought that would happen. We're hear for you anytime. Hugs nancy",

      "Content": "MRI suggested multi-centric, diffuse tissue that is possibly invasive This concerns me. Not that you could have Invasive, that's not uncommon, but that your surgeon is already saying no chemo or radiation, when there is no definite dx yet. You know you have LCIS, but without another biopsy or (I agree with your double mastectomy with Lobular) the mastectomy(ies), and ALL the tissue sent to pathology, you won't know what treatment will be best and that's for you and the oncologist to discuss. I truly believe I'd be going back to the 1st surgeon. The 2nd one seems to be \"assuming\" way too much when it's your life, not the surgeons. I had on problem with insurance approving the 2nd mastectomy. Because of it being Lobular, and prone to mirror itself, my surgeon wrote a pretty simple letter, explaining I wanted it, why I wanted it and he agreed and thought it was a resonable request. They approved it. For what it's worth, even though I had 9+ nodes, the cancer in them wouldn't have been big enough to be picked up on a PET Scan. They only way to know not only what kind of cancer, whether LCIS or LCIS and ILC, and if you have positive nodes is by a biopsy. It's not real common to have positive nodes with ILC, but I know 5 ladies that have had ILC (only about 10% are dx with it), and even though the latest studies I've seen and they may have been updated since, said that only 5% with ILC will have positive nodes........ all 5 of the ladies I have met since I was dx, that had ILC, all had + nodes. It's so important to know if it's Invasive and if nodes are involved to know the right course of treatment. Please keep me posted, and again, if I can help, please let me know.",

Have they told you what kind of chemo you'll be getting yet? I had Cytoxin (all BC ladies get that), Epirubensin and 5FU. There was a lady on here awhile back that got the same chemo as I did. I know someone who was dx 2 years before me and got 2 different chemos and not all at the same time and she's doing great too. There aren't many of us with ILC AND Node involvement, so anything I can help you with, please ask.",

      "Content": "I'd call the surgeon and tell him you want a copy of your pathology report. It will tell you what Stage (as of now how large the tumor is), what kind of breast cancer etc. In my case they removed tissue around the actual tumor and that too was cancerous, so my surgeon knew that I had at least a 3.5 cm tumor and there was more because he didn't get \"clean margins\", meaning all the tissue he removed had cancer cells in it. There's no way to know if you have any lymph nodes involved without removing them and doing a biopsy on them too. They do a Sentinal Node Biopsy quite a bit now, which tests several nodes and if they are negative, then they don't remove anymore. In my case knowing it was a large tumor, my surgeon removed all of them, and I'm glad about that since 9 out of 16 were canceous. You said your husband loves you inside and out and that's great. Even if he is a \"boobman\", he'll love you if you have one removed. He'd rather have you alive with 1 boob, then gone with 2. You definitely need to get a copy of that pathology report so you'll know what is going on. When you get it, we can help explain what it means.",

I put on about another 10 with the 8 surgeries in less then 3 years. This is by far the most I've ever weighed. Most of the weight gain has been in my stomach, which I was told was common with menopause and the chemo put me into that. I've pretty much stayed at the same weight since I started taking Arimidex in 2/03 and I started off with Tamoxefin, but only for about 6 months. It doesn't matter what I eat, how much I exercise or anything, I can drop about 6-7 pounds and that's it, so I'm sure the Arimidex isn't helping. Are we having fun yet? UGH Nancy",

Mammogram showing nothing there and I was told not to worry it's nothing, so I didn't worry and I ended up Stage III. So far when I've worried about my check ups, they have all been good ones, so I have to worry I know worrying or not has nothing to do with the outcome, but so far worrying has worked..... lol Hugs Nancy",

She was such a warm, caring, compassionate lady. I'm not sure if I'll go to the funeral. It's 2 hours away, but I don't know if I can handle it right now. I know she would understand and her family does. I guess I just need some down time and try to deal with these 2 huge loses in my life. Everyone take care and know I'll be thinking of you. I'll check my e-mail from time to time, but I just won't be doing much more then that on the computer. I've got too much time to think and that's not good right now.

Grade 1 is slow growing, I was Grade 2 (of course I have to be different) which is not the slowest, but not the fastest, and Grade 3 is the fastest growing cells. Most ladies I know are grade 3. I don't know if that's more common or just the ones that I've gotten to know. From what I understand and thank God we have Leo to correct me if I'm wrong. Chemo responds better to faster growing cells, so if you are a grade 2 or 3, it will respond generally to those, BUT like everything else with this disease, everyone regardless of their grade could respond the opposite. Grade 1 may still respond well to chemo and some Grade 3's don't. It's a crap shot, but I'm betting on the winning side Nancy",

I know where I live they have a lymphadema clinic for the ladies that have it and I would think the onco would know where you'd need to go and who to see for it. If you're in a different city or state, maybe call a cancer institute there and explain your situation and ask where they send their patients. I've only had mild bouts of it and just kept my arm elevated for a couple of days and it would go away. I know many that have to wear the sleeves all day and then a different kind at night.

I want so much to come on here and post NED, exactly 3 years on Monday I started doing the 15 min.

      "Content": "Hi, I know if I found out my cancer had spread, I'd be a basket case too. With that said, I know many ladies who's cancer has spread to their bones and are still stable and leading an active life many years later. I'm not a doctor, but I've seen other ladies who were given Arimidex, Femara or one of the other meds if their cancer was estrogen/progestere postive for bone mets and if they responded to that, that's all the treatment they got. I know some have had to have radiation to the bone mets, but I don't think chemo is an everyday treatment for them. There are bone strengthers that they get and depending on which one, is how often they get it. I've never heard of a doctor making someone wait for 2 months to have surgery when it's cancer related, but I'm sure all those bone mets didn't happen in that short period of time. Is there not an oncologist on call for your mom's so you can get answers before next month? I know you want to know what the treatment plan is, and if it's to try Arimidex, Femara or one of the other ones 1st and see how she responds, then you'd like to know that too. Please let us know.",

      "Content": "Hi, There is no test besides a biopsy that can tell if it's Invasive or not, unless of course it's in the bones or another organ, which thank God is not the case. I was dx with ILC (bio at bottom). Lobular is sneakier then Ductal. Lobular is prone to mirror itself in the other breast. You can have DCIS and Invasive Ductal, just like you can have LCIS and Invasive Lobular, but Lobular hides itself on mammgrams. My Ulra sound was read that I had 2, 1 cm cysts and to come back in a year. I didn't know at the time that an ultra sound or no other test can tell if it's cancer or what kind. My gut said to get it out, which I did and thank God. I was already Stage III with 9+ nodes and had just turned 43. PET Scans are good, but they aren't 100%. They can pick up tumors smaller then other tests, but again, I wouldn't be 100% sure it wasn't in your nodes based on that test. It can also give false positives, which in your case it looks like it didn't show anything. I personally think it would be a huge mistake for the surgeon not to do a Sentinal Node Biopsy. That's where they remove about 3 and if the 1st 2 are negative, then they don't take anymore. I opted for a double mastectomy, not only because it's prone to mirror itself, but on the cancer side, there was no way to be sure if that one tumor was the only one, or if there were more small ones that couldn't be picked up yet. I hope this has helped and please e-mail me or post anytime. I don't think I have it checked to show my e-mail and I need to fix it, but it's [email protected]",

      "Content": "MRI suggested multi-centric, diffuse tissue that is possibly invasive This concerns me. Not that you could have Invasive, that's not uncommon, but that your surgeon is already saying no chemo or radiation, when there is no definite dx yet. You know you have LCIS, but without another biopsy or (I agree with your double mastectomy with Lobular) the mastectomy(ies), and ALL the tissue sent to pathology, you won't know what treatment will be best and that's for you and the oncologist to discuss. I truly believe I'd be going back to the 1st surgeon. The 2nd one seems to be \"assuming\" way too much when it's your life, not the surgeons. I had on problem with insurance approving the 2nd mastectomy. Because of it being Lobular, and prone to mirror itself, my surgeon wrote a pretty simple letter, explaining I wanted it, why I wanted it and he agreed and thought it was a resonable request. They approved it. For what it's worth, even though I had 9+ nodes, the cancer in them wouldn't have been big enough to be picked up on a PET Scan. They only way to know not only what kind of cancer, whether LCIS or LCIS and ILC, and if you have positive nodes is by a biopsy. It's not real common to have positive nodes with ILC, but I know 5 ladies that have had ILC (only about 10% are dx with it), and even though the latest studies I've seen and they may have been updated since, said that only 5% with ILC will have positive nodes........ all 5 of the ladies I have met since I was dx, that had ILC, all had + nodes. It's so important to know if it's Invasive and if nodes are involved to know the right course of treatment. Please keep me posted, and again, if I can help, please let me know.",

      "Content": "Hi Jilly, I don't think you are being too sensitive at all. Breast Cancer is serious stuff and he acted like you had a cold. LCIS is considered pre cancerous by some, but it is considered early (very) stage BC by others. When I had my mammogram (which missed my tumor) and the ulta sound, the surgeon that I used for my mastectomies, asked me to bring the films from the hospital where they were done. I didn't have to have a repeat test that I just had, which insurance probably wouldn't have paid for anyway. If this surgeon doesn't think they are that great, then why can't he get a radiologist that he likes to read them? Why rack up more bills for you, not to mention having you repeat the same test again?? This wait, watch and see what happens is total BS. I was told to come back in a year, since the mammogram missed mine and thank God I didn't listen. Was this the 2nd surgeon or the 1st one? If it takes 3, it would be worth it. You need to know if it's Invasive or only In Situ. Even if it's only LCIS and none is invasive, I'd want that mass out of me. Since there is question if there is Invasive or not, I'd want that out of me and biopsied. I can understand why you're disgusted. This is your life and your health and you feel like you're getting blown off. Remember, the doctors work for YOU and if it takes another opinion or going back to the 1st one, I have no doubt that's what I would do. Of course the decision is yours, but from someone who got blown off, I know how it feels. Thank God I didn't listen and got another opinion. Please let me know what you decide and what happens. I was pre menopaual at 43, so I'm assuming you're in your 30's or 40's since he's mentioning Tamoxifen?",

It was a scary decision of course, but my gut said to do it, so I did and almost 3 years later, so far so good. I definately don't think it has put you at risk. Alot of studies showed that being on Tamoxefin for 2 years and then switching, had a higher survival rate without a reoccurence, then the Tamoxefin for 5 years. You've done good so far, so switching now gives you 5 more years that you're taking something to hopefully prevent the beast from coming back. Mine is going to have a hard time getting me to stop in 3 more years (I pray this crap stays away!!!!). Hopefully by then they will know more. This black cloud always over our head really sucks, just like the disease, but thank God we're hanging with NED Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi, Even though the pathology report showed no cancer cells in the blood vessels they checked during my mastectomy, there is no doubt that it was in my blood stream, having 9+ nodes. I don't know how it couldn't have gotten into my blood stream since it was already in many lymph nodes. With that said, I'm 5+ years out with no recurrence. I've seen ladies with no node involvement have a recurrence, and those with node involvement still doing great. A lot of this is a crap shoot, but getting with a good onco and getting the treatment best for your kind of cancer along with all the other details of your specific path report, gives us all the best chance of killing any of those suckers still floating around in our blood stream so they can't set up shop. There is nothing saying having positive nodes means you won't live with NED for many many years. We have to keep praying for a cure, so we don't live with this black cloud over our heads. The longer out from treatment you are, the less you live and breathe cancer. I remember when I was dx and for probably the 1st year, maybe 18 months, I went to bed thinking about cancer and woke up thinking about it. Now, a lot of times, it feels like I'm talking about someone else. Time really does help!!!",

The ones that are stablized, some have been that way for MANY years I know from experience that oncos know the average of how long someone may be able to fight mets (I'm talking about the one that said she was told she had 2 years) but we are all different and all individuals, we aren't numbers as in stats.

      "Content": "Hi, You've gotten good advice. There are more nausea meds now then even when I went through it 3 years ago. Also, I found if I ate something like baked chicken, it stopped the nausea. The last thing I thought about was eating, thinking it would make me feel worse, but it made me feel so much better. I know work is important, but chemo is going to keep you fatigued. Don't overdue it. Listen to your body and when it says rest, you need to. You'll have good days that you'll be able to work and feel like it more then likely, just don't push yourself. Yoúr body is going through alot. I had the same chemo you did except mine was FEC.... I had the epirubensin where you're having the Adriamycin (sp). It's in the same family. I got mine every 3 weeks and it seemed to have been worse for me the 2nd day and depending on which # treatment I was on, the days would change, but I always had some good days. Definately call the onco. Take care and before you know it, you'll be writing saying that you're done with chemo Nancy",

There's never a day go by I don't think of it, how can we ever forget, but it's more of a passing thought most times. I do get nervous before my check ups, which is something I think we will do for quite sometime. I promise, it will get easier and this is coming from a Stage III ILC lady. It will be 3 years for me Valentine's Day that I was dx. I can't tell you honestly how I'll feel with it being on the exact day, just 3 years later but I don't get myself worked up weeks before my check up, it's down to days now. We'll always have that black cloud hanging over our head, so we just have to keep fighting for a cure. I'm a big Nascar fan and one of the drivers has a \"Race fans for a Cure\" website where pins, t-shirts etc. are sold and it tells exactly how much goes to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. In Oct. one of the drivers drove a pink and white car and not only did his sponsor donate to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, but the driver did as well. There are alot of big companies that are donating and fighting for us, we just have to jump up and down and get more people to realize that when 1 out of 7 ladies will be dx with BC in their lifetime, someone in their family if not themselves will be dx and they need to start putting the big $$$$$ into research. I have no plans of going anywhere anytime soon If anyone needs to talk and would feel better doing it privately, please feel free to e-mail me anytime. Some will find that moving on and staying off support boards is the right thing for them and others will stay on the support boards, which is right for them. We all handle things differently, but the emotional roller coaster from hell when it comes to being diagnosed and going through treatment and the fears for the 1st year or so are the same. Only we can understand how it feels. Never feel like something you feel is \"abnormal\" or strange because I can assure you everyone of us has had the same feeling and wondered the same thing.

      "Content": "Hi Mia, Unfortunately towards the end of radiation is when the problems start. Aloe Vera is a great suggestion from your onco. I would put it on over the entire area that's being radiated, not just where it's red now. I'd use it after radiation and several times throughout the day. I got hit by 3 angles because of my stage and amount of + nodes, so you shouldn't have a problem with your neck like I did. Check with your onco about liquid Vitamin E. Mine said that was fine, but I'd never suggest anything without you asking yours. If it starts itching and as soon as it starts itching, ask for Zone A. That's what my onco gave me (it's a RX) and I put it on all throughout the day and it did help with the itching. I did peal on my chest area about a week or 2 after rads was over, but it wasn't painful because it was all dead skin. I don't know if you had a lumpectomy or mastectomy, but I have a real nice tan on the radiated side and you probably will also if you had a mastectomy. I don't know about lumpectomies. You're almost done with treatment!!!!!!!!! Hang in there just a little bit longer. Take care Hugs Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothy Lynn, I'm not a fan of waiting for 6 months and trying again. All mammograms can do is show a suspicious area, not diagnose. If he's seeing something in your lymhn nodes and you're having pain there, I would go see a doctor. It could be nothing more then an infection, but I wouldn't assume anything. Mammograms miss 35% of all breast cancer in women over 50 and 45% in women under 50. I found a lump and the mammogram came back clear and I was told the ultra sound showed 2, 1cm B9 cyst and to come back in a year. I wasn't comfortable with that and called a surgeon myself. That's when I learned that a radiologist couldn't tell if it was a B9 cyst or cancer, just that something was there that was abnormal. Thank God I didn't wait. I was dx Stage III with 9 positive lymph nodes at 43. I felt fine and thought I'd feel bad if it was cancer or lose a lot of weight, not true. Again, it very well may be nothing more than an infection, but I wouldn't wait 6 months to get another mammogram. What happens if he sees the same thing..........wait another 6 months........ I wouldn't.",

I'm a firm believer in biopsies since I was told I was fine and come back in a year when the mammogram and ultra sound didn't find the lump that me and the doctor could feel and I ended up Stage III BC. Also, since it's the only way to know for sure, peace of mind if it's B9 and if it is cancer, catch it early. Let us know and try not to look at stats. Stats are numbers and we are people.

      "Content": "Hi, Of course I meant to say that mammograms are NOT 100% accurate. I should proof read before I send I personally think stress does have a lot to do with cancer cells mutating. I was in a horrible marriage, involving physical and mental abuse and after finally finding a way out (I had moved out of town when I married him and had no family or friends close), is about the time I was dx too. I don't know if there are any studies saying it's a factor, but I know many believe it is based on their lives prior to dx. The fact that you're having pain in the nodes that are showing abnormal on the mammogram is reason enough for someone to get off their butt and check things out further. Even without pain, when there is something abnormal on a mammogram, it should be checked out. My mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor and it was in 9 of my lymph nodes. Yours is showing a red flag, so don't wait. If it is something, catch it NOW. If it's something like an infection, you still need to catch it NOW. Neither go away on their own and will only get worse with time.",

There's never a day go by I don't think of it, how can we ever forget, but it's more of a passing thought most times. I do get nervous before my check ups, which is something I think we will do for quite sometime. I promise, it will get easier and this is coming from a Stage III ILC lady. It will be 3 years for me Valentine's Day that I was dx. I can't tell you honestly how I'll feel with it being on the exact day, just 3 years later but I don't get myself worked up weeks before my check up, it's down to days now. We'll always have that black cloud hanging over our head, so we just have to keep fighting for a cure. I'm a big Nascar fan and one of the drivers has a \"Race fans for a Cure\" website where pins, t-shirts etc. are sold and it tells exactly how much goes to the Susan G. Komen Foundation. In Oct. one of the drivers drove a pink and white car and not only did his sponsor donate to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, but the driver did as well. There are alot of big companies that are donating and fighting for us, we just have to jump up and down and get more people to realize that when 1 out of 7 ladies will be dx with BC in their lifetime, someone in their family if not themselves will be dx and they need to start putting the big $$$$$ into research. I have no plans of going anywhere anytime soon If anyone needs to talk and would feel better doing it privately, please feel free to e-mail me anytime. Some will find that moving on and staying off support boards is the right thing for them and others will stay on the support boards, which is right for them. We all handle things differently, but the emotional roller coaster from hell when it comes to being diagnosed and going through treatment and the fears for the 1st year or so are the same. Only we can understand how it feels. Never feel like something you feel is \"abnormal\" or strange because I can assure you everyone of us has had the same feeling and wondered the same thing. May 2005 be a year of happiness and HEALTH for all of us Nancy",

      "Content": "I started on Tamoxifen and took it for 6 months. At that time all the info on Arimidex was starting to come out. My onco felt like there wasn't enough info to convenience him that it was better then Tamoxifen. When more info came out, the data said that Arimidex was superior to Tamoxifen in avoiding reoccurences. I chose to switch since I had Stage III ILC. You have to be post MENTALpausal to take Arimidex. My onco did a blood test to make sure I was post, since I wasn't peri menopausal prior to chemo. When it came back that I was, I switched to Arimidex and have been on it over 2 years. Arimidex does weaken the bones and you can be more prone to fractures and osteoporosis (sp). I had a bone density test done and it showed the smallest signs of osteop. and was called negative. My onco put me on Actonel to strengthen the bones and I take Calcium w/Vitamin D, per his orders to avoid problems with Arimidex. I do have joint and bone pain, mainly in feet/ankles and fingers. I had to have surgery for a trigger finger, but once I started taking Actonel, the other trigger fingers were gone without surgery. There is a chance of blood clots and uterine cancer with Tamoxifen, but they aren't common side effects, but have happened so they have to list that as a possible side affect. If you are pre or perimenopausal, then you'll have to take Tamoxifen. If you are post, then you can take either but again, Arimidex is shown to prevent reoccurences more often in the 5 year study. I'd keep researching like you have been to learn about both drugs and between you and your onco, decide which is best for you and what you feel is best for you. I wish you the best of luck and know you'll make the right decision for you.",

      "Content": "Hi, Before taking anything, be sure and ask your wife's onco. There are some suppliments and herbs that will interfere and cause the chemo to be less effective. If your wife suffers depression, which most of us do, again ask your onco for something if he doesn't offer. Example, St. John's wart, which is used for depression is one of the worst things you can take during chemo. If he's vague, make him tell you yes or no. As far as nutrition, the only thing I was told not to eat were strawberries because no matter how hard to wash them, you can never get them clean enough. Eating helped alot with my nausea and it seems too with alot of ladies. I thought it would make me feel worse, but it helped big time. The advice I was given was, because chemo (not sure about CMF but all the others do, so I would think CMF would too) leaves a horrible taste in your mouth, eat whatever tastes good. There's not alot of worrying about eating healthy as we try to after, because she needs to keep her strength up and she'll find the one thing that really tastes good. I would eat things like baked chicken and baked potatoes, but sherbert really hit the spot with me. I've never eaten it since chemo, but I sure did during it. Hope this helps Nancy",

      "Content": "Originally, if I'm not mistaken, the 1st studies for Arimidex were for \"advanced\" stage ladies, then it went to early stage, etc. I think studies have been done on just about every aspect, age, 1st or 2nd line of treatment etc. The link I sent has just about everything they have done trials on. I've been on it 2 years also and started when I was almost 44. We both have 3 years to go on Arimidex and hopefully they will something else for us to follow up with. I think I read that the government or whatever funding only allowed 5 year studies, so I have no idea if there is benefit to taking it more then 5 years of if they even know. Like I said, if I make it to 5 years NED, which will still give me about a year left on Arimidex, me and my onco are going to go round and round because I won't want to quit taking it regardless of the cost. We just have to pray that they will come up with something even better by then. This black cloud always hanging over our heads to me makes it impossible to have a \"normal\" life, even though I don't think about it 24/7, you sure can't forget it. Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Nick, Did they remove the swollen lymph node + more and send them to pathology? Or is the surgeon basing his opinion that she has 1 node positive on breast cancer based on a swollen node? This is the definition of DCIS Ductal carcinoma in situ (or DCIS) refers to the most common type of noninvasive breast cancer in women. In situ, or \"in place,\" describes a cancer that has not moved out of the area of the body where it originally developed. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to milk ducts in the breast and have not spread into the fatty breast tissue or to any other part of the body (such as the lymph nodes). From what I've read of her pathology report, it's saying that she has Invasive Ductal. If she 1 node involved, I'm really surprised that they aren't planning on doing chemo. The tumor is very very small, but if it was just a biopsy, then they just took a sample, which means there's more that will be added to the actual size, which still could be very little.",

Mine didn't start coming out until right before my 4th round of FEC. The nurses looked up the chemos to see if there was a small % that didn't lose all their hair and there was but only on 1 of them, but I convenienced myself, I wasn't going to lose it. My dad happened to be at my house when I went to the bathroom to brush it and I felt so sorry for him. I didn't just cry, I was squalling and cussing the disease and pretty much had a meltdown. I'd say within a few days or a week, I accepted it as it was, gone. I wasn't smart like you and had it cut off. I had 3 haircuts before chemo, so my hair went from 1/2 way down my back to right under my ears, but let it come out at it's own speed (fast). I found a sweather hanging in the closet when I was moving and it was clean, but had alot of strands of my hair on the inside of it. BUT now it's back to half way down my back and hard to believe I ever lost it.....my hair not my mind, that's a given... lol You'll be amazed at how quick time goes and chemo is over. You're doing great!!!!!!!!!!! Hugs Nancy",

Let's just say I woke up for the 1st time in the recovery room and I wasn't the nicest person when asking for pain meds. I am now very concaved (reconstruction failed big time) and I've cracked 3 ribs just from how tight the tissue is because the pectorial didn't bounce back. I would think that if they could be built up, my PS would have had me doing something to accomplish that, because it's no better and that was over a year ago. The only option I have now and they said there were no guarentees would be to have a bilateral LD Flap. 8 surgeries in 3 years, I'm done. I have officially retired from being a surgery patient and I will be happy being boobless...... lol Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Tina, When I went to my surgeon to discuss having a mastectomy (I had both removed, but different times. No cancer in the right) and he scheduled surgery, he asked me if I had a preference on which oncologist I wanted to use. I had friends that recommended 1 in one of the cancer institutes here and I wanted to use him. It will be about 4 weeks after your surgery before you'll see your onco for the 1st time, so your surgeon might be waiting until then. I would want to know the game plan too, but the medical and radiation oncologist will be the ones that will discuss treatments with you since that's their speciality. I would call your surgeon's office and make an appt. with your surgeon and go over all the questions you have prior to your surgery. I saw mine on the 19th and had surgery on the 21st. I'm surprised that it's going to be over 2 weeks before you have it done, unless you requested some time to let things sink in. The surgeon I used, and from what others have said, they always do surgery for cancer over elective and will reschedule elective if they don't are booked. That's what mine did. What did the surgeon say about the pathology report? What Stage are you? How large is the tumor? Did he do a biopsy or a lumpectomy and didn't get clean margins? Hang in there, you really will get through this!!!! It's hard to believe not long after I turned 43, I found out I was Stage III, ILC with 9+ nodes. It's been 5 1/2 years and I'm doing great.

      "Content": "Hi Tina, It looks like from what your pathology report says that your surgeon didn't get clean margins and that you had Invasive Ductal as well as Ductal InSitu (contained, not invasive). He has down that node involvement is unknown at this time as well as distant mets (normal since you've had no CT Scans, bone scans etc run and no nodes removed). The tumor that is Invasive Ductal was about the same size as my Invasive Lobular were without clean margins. Me personally, I wanted a mastectomy because there was no telling where else in the breast the cancer could be and I wanted it all gone. You won't know until after a Sentinal Node Biopsy is done during your surgery if you have nodes involved. Some thing that having nodes involved is the most horrible thing, but I had 9+ for cancer, and I know many other ladies that have had as many or even more and they are still doing great MANY years later, so don't let the possibility of having node involvment scare you more then you already are. The Estrogen/Progesterine Receptors will tell if your cancer feeds off hormones (about 80-85% of BC does), which means you can take meds after treatment to help keep the cancer away. The Her2 that you will also find out about is a gene that shouldn't be present, but if it is, there is a drug called Herceptin that you will be taking that has showed great results when taken during original dx. All in all, my opinion based on what I've read, I think your surgeon made a good call in recommending a mastectomy. He's trying to give you the best chance possible of beating this beast. Some surgeons like to be conservative when it comes to breast cancer and lumpectomy vs mastectomy and when it comes to having a large tumor, with a pretty good chance there could be nodes involved, that's not the time to be conservative. My biopsy/lumpectomy showed that my tumor was about the same size as yours without clean margins and I jumped on having a mastectomy. This is all still so new to you and you're still going through the shell shock, I'd make an appt. with your surgeon and have him explain everything to you. Make sure you take someone with you because our brains can only handle so much info before it shuts down. That way, between you and who you take with you, will get everything the surgeon is saying. I didn't see my medical oncologist until after I healed from the mastectomy and node disection, and then he discussed what kind of treatment (chemo and radiation) I should have. Make sure you feel confident with all your doctors. That is very important. Keep us posted.",

Also, I found if I ate something like baked chicken, it stopped the nausea. The last thing I thought about was eating, thinking it would make me feel worse, but it made me feel so much better. I know work is important, but chemo is going to keep you fatigued. Don't overdue it. Listen to your body and when it says rest, you need to. You'll have good days that you'll be able to work and feel like it more then likely, just don't push yourself. Yoúr body is going through alot. I had the same chemo you did except mine was FEC.... I had the epirubensin where you're having the Adriamycin (sp). It's in the same family. I got mine every 3 weeks and it seemed to have been worse for me the 2nd day and depending on which # treatment I was on, the days would change, but I always had some good days. Definately call the onco. Take care and before you know it, you'll be writing saying that you're done with chemo Nancy",

The only thing I know is on my path report, it stated that I was N1, which meant (I think, it's been almost 3 years, thank God) that they were cancerous, but not clumped together, they were individual still and it also told the range of size of the cancerous nodes. I'm sure Leo or one of the other ladies can help you more then me, but I wanted to share what I knew and I had 9+/16, so I had quite a few too. Keep us posted on how you're doing and you'll be in my prayers as everyone else I've met on the board. Ya'll are the best!! Nancy Oh, wanted everyone to know, because I just found out. For me, it's easier to have my info about dx, stage, treatment etc. on each of my e-mails incase someone else is dx Stage III and they can see my progress and I think it would be great if everyone did that, so when questions were asked, we could read the bio and remember what's been done so far. Chemo might not reach your brain, but it can sure make you feel DUH at times when it comes to remember. Just go into \"profile\" and scroll down and at the end, there is a place for a \"signature line\" Hugs Nancy",

I was dx Stage III and all indications at that time was Arimidex was superior, but the studies are showing more and more that it is superior. More then likely you'll have bone and joint pain. Mainly in your feet/heels and hands. A few I know including myself even got trigger fingers. Even though my bone density test after taking it almost 2 years showed no bone loss, my onco put me on Actonel, which will strengthen your bones and prevent (or help to prevent) osteoporisis. Since taking Actonel, I very SELDOM have bone and joint pain and the trigger fingers went away. Of course I had surgery for one that was really bad before I started taking Actonel.... ugh I know this crappy disease can come back anytime and to any stage, but since I was Stage III, I wanted to big guns and it's been almost 3 1/2 years and as of now, everything looks good, no evidence of disease (NED).

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I too was dx Stage IIIA. My onco does CBC, CMP blood tests at each checkup. Once a year I have a bone scan, chest x-ray, tumor markers and the regular CBC and CMP. My once a year scan/test is the end of this month, so my nerves are getting shot the closer it gets...... lol The only test I know of that gives false positives, but also picks up cancer earlier then any other one is the PET. Many insurances won't cover a PET unless they see something suspicious and a PET is necessary to confirm it's a problem or not. Here, they are about $8,000 and that's why insurance companies don't like to give them. I had one after I was done with all my treatments only because I wouldn't quit bugging him and the original bone scan, since they had nothing to compare it to, said that the only way to comfirm that it was degenerative and not mets was by a PET and that's how I got insurance to pay. It did show abnormal activity in 2 areas. One around the surgical site, which my onco expected to see and one my thyroid, which ended up being damage due to radiation and I'm now on synthroid. Each onoc has their own protocol of what they do after treatment is done. Even though it's a lot of anxiety and fear, I'm glad mine does the bone scan and chest x-ray once a year. I think the reason he does it is because of my stage, number of positive nodes I had and because I was \" young\" when dx. Again, the other check ups throughout are labs only and of course him pushing and proding. Hope this helps. Hugs Nancy",

It's not common for someone your age to have BC, BUT it's not impossible. If they found a lump on the mammogram or ultra sound, then they could biopsy it to be sure it's nothing. More then likely it is not breast cancer, but you can never say never. I personally would ask to have it removed and tested so you know for sure. If you're not comfortable with what the doc is telling you and they refuse to remove it and do a biopsy, I'd find another doctor. Where I live, you don't have to have a referral to make an appt. with a surgeon, but it's probably different from state to state. Please let us know what you find out. Nancy",

Good luck and let us know how things go.

      "Content": "Hi, Every step of this disease and treatment is scary. Most people tolerate chemo well. If she has nausea, they have better meds now then they did even 3 years ago when I was going through it. The main side affect is she'll be tired more and get tired easier. She needs to listen to her body and rest when she's tired. Most also have very good days in between treatments. I don't know what kind of chemo she's going to be getting, but I got 3 at the same time and I was tired and didn't feel good for several days after, but then there were days that I didn't feel any different then before I started chemo. The hardest part for me was losing my hair. I had always had it long and when it didn't come out in the normal 12-14 days and I still had it all after 3 treatments, we thought I might be one of those very few that don't lose their hair, but right before the 4th treatment, it started coming out. I was devistated, but you accept that too and then you celebrate your first bad hair day... lol I looked like alfalfa (sp) all over and I didn't even comb it down, I was proud of it..... lol She'll do great and with you there to support her, that will mean alot.

You can stay NED (No Evidence of Disease) but any dx of BC has the chance of coming back, either in the same breast or the liver, lungs, brain etc. I don't know if this is the norm, but a friend of mine had microcalifications but none clustered enough to do a biopsy on them. They waited and watched even though she had BC in the other breast the year prior and wanted another mastectomy. Finally, when they did cluster enough for a biopsy, it was cancer. Not to say this is true for everyone, and I know in some cases, not many, that you have to wait and see if there is no way to check them out. I might get a 2nd opinion and definately stay on top of it. IF it is cancer, some are very slow growing and some are very aggressive. Praying for B9 for you Nancy",

The hair under my arms didn't ever grow back, with the exception of 2 or 3, just enough to be aggravating... lol The hair on my legs grew back alot faster it seemed then on my head, but after about 6 months, I noticed that I didn't need to shave my legs nearly as often and the hair came back, but not all over my legs like before. I don't remember about my eyelashes and eyebrows. I didn't lose all of them during chemo, but they thinned out A LOT. I didn't wear mascara because I was afraid it will weigh down the lashes I had left. It will be 3 years in June since I had my last chemo, so my memory is fading, thank God!!! My hair seemed to come back slow, but my hair was half way down my back before, so it would probably seem that way to me because I'd never worn it short. Are you taking Arimidex? I know there is a chance your hair can thin on that, but mine never did. A friend's did, but that didn't last long and then he got back to normal growth. I'm not sure if Tamoxifen can cause hair loss or not. My guess is that everything will start growing back normal as far as your lashes go and the % of ladies losing their hair on Arimidex or Tamoxefin, is very low. Hugs Nancy",
