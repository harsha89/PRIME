Muttsmom: 1st - NO test can tell if it's cancer or not, just if there is something \"abnormal\" and depending on what they see, a good radiologist can have increased cause for concern. The only way to know if a lump is cancerous or not, or if microcalifications are cancerous or not is by removing the lump/cluster and have it sent to pathology. The one that's recommending a biopsy is ABSOLUTELY right. That's what I'm learning, so I will get the biopsy. Age, family hx, plays a roll, but a very small one. I was 43, no hx of any kind of cancer in my family. I was dx Stage III (bio at bottom). This is not to say that you have cancer, but I was told to come back in a year, I was fine, it was \"just a cyst\". Well, the \"cyst\" ended up being a 5.5 cm tumor. I didn't have a year to wait and thank God I called a surgeon myself, but the radiologist that read your mammogram is telling you to have a biopsy. Hmmm. So having \"just a cyst\" after an ultrasound is no guarantee that there was no cancer at the time?! :\\ Someone gave you some bad info 8 years ago. There is no such thing as too young. I've met ladies that were in the 20's, 30s and 40s and they weren't the exception, there are many of us unfortunately. Did they do a needle biopsy and get fluid out of the lump and the lump completely disappeared? They can't tell by a US or mammogram if it's a fluid filled cyst. I know that 1st hand. Also, I don't know what the latest stats are, but about 10 years ago, it was said that 80% of lumps were B9, but I'm sure now since the odds of being dx with BC, the number is probably more like 75%. Those are still good odds, but when it comes to our lives, it's not time to play the odds. No one else told me I was too young; I just figured I probably was. I was 37 at the time, and thought my risk was probably not that high, all things considered. No biopsy or FNA was done back in '99; it was not recommended or mentioned at all. The latest stats I've heard is that it's still 80% of lumps are benign. I too am very sorry to hear about your mom. I have no doubt that she would want you to be pro-active and do what needs to be done to know for sure if it's cancer or not. If it's not, celebrate. If it is, we'll be here to help you through. Please let us know what your biopsy shows and as long as it's been going on, I'd get it ASAP Thank you. I certainly HOPE it's not cancer! I won't delay in getting a biopsy, but the surgeon who was so highly recommended appears to be out this week; maybe on vacation. I might very well be gone tomorrow 'til Sunday and will have to wait 'til Monday to make calls in absence of cell phone service where I'm going (Medicine Lake, CA). I assume a few days isn't going to make or break anything, and I did already call for the magnification view mammos earlier today--getting that done this coming Tuesday. I will keep everyone informed, and thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hello, everyone. I'm 45 (female). I recently had my second mammogram last month. First one was in '99 (unilateral) after finding a \"lump\" which turned out to be what I was told was a simple fluid cyst on my right upper breast, confirmed with ultrasound. At the time, they told me there was nothing to worry about and to just go home, everything was fine. The reasons for the eight-year lapse are multiple; no insurance for a long time, not wanting to experience that kind of fear again nor expose myself to excessive radiation, assurances that 90% of any lumpiness is always benign, I was too young to worry about cancer yet, etc. This time, they did several digital x-rays, since my newer doctor noted a \"mass\" in the same area I had the cyst years ago. On palpation and self-exam, the area didn't change much except it feels like the cyst was smaller. Here are the radiologists' reports from the mammo and ultrasound: Digital mammography bilat w/CAD. Assessment code: suspicious mammo-ca++ Follow-up code: biopsy Comment: bilateral digital mammography is performed in the craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections. Additional spot compression views of the right upper outer breast were obtained in the region of a palpable abnormality. The breast tissue is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. There is a grouping of pleomorphic and suspicious microcalcifications in the upper outer right breast corresponding to the palpable site. Biopsy is recommended. In addition, ultrasound may be useful to determine whether there is an associated mass as dense breast tissue may obscure a lesion. R2 computer-aided detection (CAD) analysis was performed and used in the interpretation of this mammography examination. Conclusion: MICROCALCIFICATIONS IN THE UPPER OUTER RIGHT BREAST CONCERNING FOR MALIGNANCY (BIRADS-4). BIOPSY IS INDICATED. ~~~~~~~~ Ultrasound (unilateral), Conclusion: 1. The palpable abnormality is a simple cyst. 2. There remains a group of pleomorphic calcifications in the right breast and magnified views are recommended. [Actually, I just called the breast center to get some answers, and they're going to set up an appointment for these additional views.] ******************************************* My confusion on it is thus: First, don't these radiologists talk to each other?! One reads the mammo; one reads the sonogram. Second, why would my doctor jump the gun and immediately recommend a biopsy instead of considering extra views first? My questions: Can a sonogram pick up calcifications very clearly? Can you have calcifications inside a cyst, and what can that mean? Should I go ahead and schedule a biopsy AND do the additional views, or wait and see what the next reports say? Other notes: my mother died this January of metastatic ovarian cancer. Only close female relatives with breast cancer are my paternal grandmother. ***EDIT (new info today): My grandmother was 77; my aunt was 40, and it was found on her very first mammogram--a 2 cm invasive lobular carcinoma w/out lymph node involvement; she had a mastectomy due to the size of it (back in 1994) and then developed atypia in the other breast eventually and opted for a mastectomy on that side, too.*** Both relatives were smokers for many years. I am childfree and have never smoked. Thyroid disease is quite strong on my mother's side; I've had Hashimotos for years. I'm not that much overweight (maybe 15 pounds), and live in the northern California Bay Area--supposedly one of the 'dangerous' areas in the U.S. for a higher percentage of breast cancer cases. Naturally, I'm scared nearly out of my wits. I have Susan Love's breast book, Bosom Buddies, and several other general women's health books, and of course there's always the 'net ( ) -- which can be frightening at times, I admit. I'm glad we have these forums, however! Any advice or helpful comments would be greatly appreciated, and TIA.",

      "Content": "I went through this, too. It's hard give an actual percentage because different facilities can have different rates of false positives and the numbers of those whose mammograms actually turn up malignant after biopsy. Mine was a BIRAD 4 and biopsy was strongly advised, but that was mostly due to the fact that it was my first mammogram in eight years (after one in my 30's to check for what turned out to be a simple cyst). BTW, my biopsy and cyst contents both turned out benign. If a stereotaxic biopsy can be done and you've had more than one professional opinion on the mammogram, combined with a good history and taking other exam findings into consideration, it might not be a bad idea -- just to be sure what you're dealing with. On microcalcifications, know that many things can contribute to them, not just cancer. But if it IS cancer, the sooner you know, the better! (That said, I do think many radiologists and surgeons are scared to death of missing a cancer for fear of lawsuits and so end up erring on the side of medical paranoia, but it's still YOUR health and life we're talking about.) Good luck, continue educating yourself, but don't sweat it too much. There's lots of help and information out there either way. Take care. Gail",
