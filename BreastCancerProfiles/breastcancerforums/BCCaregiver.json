      "Content": "My wife is a breast cancer survivor - first diagnosed 4/2002 at age 49, treatment ended 1/2003 and everything looked clear. 10/2004 we discovered that her cancer had metastasized throughout her skeleton with a spot on her skull and liver. After radiation and another round of chemo, all scans show no activity!! Hooray! I believe that Herceptin is what did the trick. Anyway... she was very brave and courageous during both episodes, but now she says she is scared and I see that she is drinking much more than ever. This is compounded by the fact that she is much more sensitive to alcohol than she ever was - only one glass of wine can make her pretty loopy, but not always. She has trouble controlling the alcohol, and sometimes gets abusive toward me. I'm scared that she is becoming an alcoholic. I don't know how to help her. I've researched on the Internet and I can't find ANYTHING about survivors and alcohol - has anyone heard of this or is our case unusual? How can I help her?",
