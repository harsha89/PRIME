    "Content": "Uhm.. My mom (49 years old) is going to a biopsy and is almost definitely breast cancer positive, I was wondering if anyone of you could tell me a place for a surgery. I think it is adviced to get the surgery as fast as possible after the biopsy, so I really need to know the places in toronto where they do breast cancer surgeries. If you know a place (online or not) where i could be reffered to for more information, perhaps a local forum or something, that would be appreciated.) thanx in advance",
