      "Content": "Hello. To all that are going through these trying times, keep your chin up. There is a lot to say about positive thinking. My wife has again succumbed to breast cancer and we have been chasing what we can. We are now going overseas to a place, not just for treatment, but for some time together, to enjoy a break. I am sure many have spent hours upon hours researching and so have we, but we found something online which has made things a LOT easier for us. We would like to extend our love to everyone on this forum and we both hope that each one of you can find your own miracle, even if its just acceptance. Life is about love !!!",
