      "Content": "I was 50 when diagnosed and still premenopausal. My IDC cancer was 98% ER+ and PR+...very sensitive to hormones. My onc. felt hormonal therapy was more important than chemo as my cancer was very slow growing. I was put on tamoxifen which actually stimulated my ovaries! My estradiol (the bad estrogen) was very high and I developed ovarian cysts. My doctor suggested ovarian removal or suppression. I chose suppression with Lupron because I figured I was so close to natural menopause. That did the trick and after 6 months he took me off it. My estradiol soared again and I redeveloped the ovarian cysts. This time I went on the Lupron for a whole year. I tolerated both the Lupron and the Tamoxifen really well. When I ended the Lupron it appeared I was on the cusp of menopause so they kept me on the Tamoxifen. This time I developed uterine spotting. At this point I wished I had had the surgery to remove the dang ovaries. After a lot of testing, they decided that I was truely in menopause this time so they switched me to Arimidex. I've been on it for 6 months and feel like an old woman with arthritis. I think that the reason there is so much conflicting advice is because each of us have such different cancers. My cancer was much more hormonally sensitive than many others. Therefore ridding me of estrogen was more important than someone who is ER+, but only 30%. Rita Diagnosed Jan 01 with IDC 1.6 cm, no nodes involved, slow growing Lumpectomy, radiation and hormonal therapy",

However, if the calcifications are in a clump or linear (like in a duct), they are considered suspicious for cancer. That is when they want further tests. Both of mine were suspicious, and both were not cancer. Actually, when I WAS diagnosed with cancer, I had no calcifications, just a lump.",

However, recently they are finding that certain DNA tests can determine if the chemo is really needed in cases like yours and mine (1.6cm). I was diagnosed 4 years ago and my oncologist didn't have those tests available but he convinced me that I wouldn't benefit much from chemo because my cancer was especially slow growing and very very estrogen and progesterone sensitive. Therefore he felt the gain wasn't worth the chemo risks. It was a difficult decision to make but I am now happy that I decided not to do chemo.
