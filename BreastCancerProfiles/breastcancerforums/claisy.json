      "Content": "Hi JM....I don't blame you for being concerned about this. I have had only one breast removed, my left one, 4 years ago. I had 15 nodes taken, all negative. My heart goes out to you. I have often thought what would I do if I got cancer in my right breast and nodes were removed. This is a terrible position to be put in. So far, I have not had any swelling. I don't have many comforting words for you. I think I would ask every question I could think of to the surgeon about where to put that IV. Seems like I have read somewhere that they can put it in other places, especially since you have had nodes removed from both sides. I also had a port...and I am so glad I did. I would recommend it to anyone having chemo. But your case is special. I can't comment on what the nurses told you. I know they know more than I do. Having said that, I also know the medical establishment does not take lymphedema questions as seriously as I think it should. Maybe Leo can help more if he reads your post in time. Good Luck to you...you will be in my thoughts and prayers",

So I guess waiting until she is 35 seems reasonable before she has a screening, that's what her ob/gyn has told her. SEEMS REASONABLE TO EVERYONE BUT ME!!!!!!! I have heard and talked to so many young women that have this horrible disease, and I guess I just want my daughter to do everything she can to catch it early. It seems to me she would be in a much higher risk...mother with breast cancer, having her first baby at age 33...I don't know...I am rambling on and on here...she is not nearly as concerned about it as I am.

I am not overweight and did not have radiation. Has anyone else been told this? My husband measured my arms Saturday, and there was no swelling. I guess this heavy feeling is a normal thing?
