    "Content": "Hi, Everyone, I was just diagnosed with carcinoma ductal, 2.8 cm, poorly differentiated with abundant necrosis, grade 3, 12 oclock, right breast. It's funny how breast cancer can be so wordy! I am trying to keep my humor but find those times when the fear is overwhelming are getting more frequent. My doctors have been extremely fast about setting up surgery. I will get a lumpectomy with sental node biopsy and if posititve, my surgeon will take out the \"fatty pad\". I will go through chemo after surgery. But the waiting just feeds the fear and every pain I have, I think it's cancer coursing through my body. Two of my sisters did not survive cancer; one with breast, the other with ovarian. One of the highlights this week was finding out I didn't have ovarian! That was a HIGHLIGHT! My surgeon said that he doesn't lose patients to this disease and my survival rate is good. But I am just so scared they're going to find it everywhere and I won't make it. This is normal, right?
