    "Content": "So a little background, I am a 34 year old mom of 2, never breastfed. About 5 or 6 months ago I started getting a painful pinching and burning in my left armpit and it feels like I have something under my arm when it is lowered. Saw my dr and she sent me for a mamm and an u/s plus referred me to a surgeon. Both came back normal and when I saw the surgeon she sent me for another u/s. Still clean but the tech didn't go anywhere near my armpit for whatever reason so the surgeon sent me for a full axillary u/s. It showed enlarged lymph nodes but they look normal. I also have an area of thickening on my breast right near my armpit that she isn't concerned with either. So I was put on the 6 month watch and wait. Well now the pain is getting worse and it is in my shoulder, collar bone, down my left arm and the top of my ribs hurt. I am also constantly having a feeling like I am holding my breath even when I am breathing normally. On occasion my chest wall feels really sore as well. Wearing a bra is unbearable most of the time so the fact that I am a stay at home mom is nice so I don't have to go thru that torture at least. I am thinking it is time to call the surgeon back and get in before my 6 month appt. The progression is freaking me out and I really don't know what to make of it. Any words of wisdom or personal experiences would be great. Its getting kind of hard to ignore it and wait it out when I am constantly uncomfortable or in pain.",
