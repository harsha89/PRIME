    "Content": "I had a mammogram & ultrasound on Wednesday for a mass I found in my left breast. I had found it quite a while ago, but with no insurance, I had put off getting it checked. The radiology report says \"in the tail region adjacent to the chest wall, there is a small nodule that has a slightly lobular contour, with its margins well circumscribed. It has a questionable fatty hilus. Suspect it reflects a small lymph node.\" The other two masses (I didn't know they were there) appear to be a small cyst & a benign appearing nodule that likely reflects a fibroadenoma or lymph node. The Bi Rads is Category 3-short interval follow-up (6 mos) suggested. I'm not sure that I'm comfortable waiting for 6 months. I've never had anything like this show up on a mammogram before. Is it customary to let it go for that long? The place I went to get the mammogram is in a small, backwards town & that somewhat bothers me. Anyone have any advice? Am I just being paranoid?",
