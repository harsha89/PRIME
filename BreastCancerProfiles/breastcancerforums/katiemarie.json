    "Content": "Hi guys. My mom is about 53 years old and she went to her yearly mammogram and the doctor called her the day after saying they wanted her to come back in and take additional pictures...so she did. The area that they thought was suspicious was very small and they had to magnify it to even see it. They then told her they wanted her to get a biopsy because they weren't 100% sure that what they were seeing (they told her it was calcifications) were benign. The radiologist ended up speaking with her that day and told her that he was 95% sure that this was benign. Before she had her biopsy she talked to the doctor who was performing it and she said she felt strongly that this was nothing and it was benign. She had her biopsy last Wednesday. She's getting her results this Wednesday but I am a wreck. I'm so nervous I'm going to lose my mother. Should I be this concerned? Thanks everyone.",
