    "Content": "Hi there, My mum was diagnosed with the same disease few days ago. She had a lumpectomy and will have another check-up to see if the cancer is spreading to other areas. I know you are scared, depressed and helpless. I feel the same even though I'm not one with it. Stay strong and you will recover from it. Besides, could you share a bit how's your situation now? How're things progressing? Any advices? Thanks TL Originally Posted by Ladyblue I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma 2 months ago. I had a lumpectomy and the cancer had already spread to the lymph nodes in my underarm. I'm currently undergoing chemotherapy. I've been very depressed today because my hair started falling. I want to vent, to ask questions, to get answers. I'm hoping I came to the right place. I'm scared !!!!",
