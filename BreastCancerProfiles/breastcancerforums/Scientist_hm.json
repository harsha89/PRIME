    "Content": "Hi my friends, I want to post some links about the Germanic New Medicine and Breast Cancer, a new discovery about the genesis, evolution and treatment of cancer in general and breast cancer in particular. I'm not SELLING any medical product, so please don't banned me. I can't \"copy and paste\" the information, because it's protected by copyright. So, I post the links. This is very important information for breast cancer patients, and they need to read it. Germanic New Medicine was discoveried by medical doctor and scientific researcher Ryke Geerd Hamer. He could prove the precise connection between specific emotional conflict shocks and cancer. His works can be verified by any scientist (and patient) anytime. It isn't a theory we need to \"believe\". It's a scientific theory that we, as patients or researchers, can verify in our own bodies and experience. The GNM's discoveries about breast cancer's causes, may be read at the following links: http://www.germannewmedicine.ca/docu...erarticle.Html and the complement: http://www.Newmedicine.Ca/breast.Php for more information about the gnm, please visit: www.germannewmedicine.Ca Have you live conflictive emotional experiences as postulated by GNM? If it so, maybe thw GNM may be of help. Best regards",
