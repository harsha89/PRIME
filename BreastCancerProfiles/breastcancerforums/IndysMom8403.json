    "Content": "I am 33, and was diagnosed with IDC last October. Surgery (mastectomy) in November revealed it had spread to 6 of 16 lymph nodes, so between that info and size of tumor I was categorized as Stage III. Had 4 months of chemo, followed by 8 weeks radiation, and now am on tamoxifen for at least 5 years. My question is: My oncologist (in Wash DC) is NOT recommending any follow-up PET/CT scans because he said the data shows that these scans do not help catch recurrence. He said that doctors in my area (a few hours outside the city, more rural area) are scan-happy and order them when they're not necessary. He said I should stick with 1-2 mammograms a year (on the remaining breast) and chest wall exams on the surgery site, and that's all that's needed. Anyone have any advice or opinions? Seems like friends and aquaintances I know who live near me are ALL sent for follow up PET/CT scans. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with not having those tests done if they can help detect a problem in the future (I do plan to do the 1-2 mammograms a year and chest wall exams). Thanks",
