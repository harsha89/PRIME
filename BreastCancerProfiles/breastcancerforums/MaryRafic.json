      "Content": "Hi ProudMommy, I think you are right to want to go sooner than your six-month follow-up. You know your body, I believe that is true. And you know what- better to find out good news than to wait and find out worse news. Don't let the doctors persuade you to wait- you know what you're feeling. I base this opinion on my mother's having complained of an unusual pain for months after her first surgery, but the doctors telling her it was nothing. Only to find out later there was a recurrence as well as lymphedema. If they had let her come in sooner to check it out, at least she would have had treatment sooner. Good luck and please write again.",

      "Content": "Hi Lara, Hope you're doing ok for today, anyway. I know it is really nerve-wracking to be in that limbo of wonder. I think you should wait and see what the medical experts say, as other posters here suggest. Also, why not get a second opinion? Sooner rather than later. My mother went through something similar- her metastatic breast cancer tumor in the liver showed up suddenly, according to her doctors. I remember, she told me one Friday in August that just a week prior her CT scan showed nothing, then a week later there was a mass. What I wish is that at THAT time, right away, we had gotten a second opinion. That is my advice. Even with the best medical professionals, which my mother had at New York University Medical Center, it does not hurt to get another professional opinion. Ironically, we had a breast cancer surgeon in the family and did not know till things had gotten too late. Just hang in there and be there for your mom- I know that was what my mom stressed was most important to her. That my sister, my son, and I were there all the time for her and with her.",
