Even the dachshunds take turns keeping vigil in bed with her. The hospital bed and Hospice have allowed us to be able to do all of this in the comfort of our own home. What a blessing. It's hard work, but a true labor of love. We are blessed to be able to do this. The finish line is in sight and Jesus is holding her trophy.",

      "Content": "My wife is now in Hospice care. She gets weaker every day. Both she and I know that her life is nearly over. Our faith has allowed us to begin to accept this. I mean, it still stinks, but we're at peace with her impending death. Since my retirement, I have had the opportunity to work at a funeral home for the last year. That experience (I've done it all) has given me the opportunity to look at death with much greater perspective. I guess that you'd have to experience it to understand what I've learned. I will miss my good friend of 30+ years very much. But both she and I know that she will be in Heaven with no more pain. That's a huge comfort. When I look back at the anger and frustration of my original post, I can't believe that I am so much calmer now. That, I know, is because so many people are praying for me and for my wife. It does make a difference. The next little while will be a test of our strength. I hope to continue to do a good job all the way through. I'm glad to be able to recognize the change that has occured in me in just a little over a year. I guess I was supposed to stumble across my own posting today...",

      "Content": "My wife's breast cancer returned after a valiant round of treatment a year and a half ago. This time it's terminal. Her time left? We're not quite sure. What I do find confusing is that none of the local cancer resources seem to have anything available for patients and families in this position...I'm dying, but I'm not dead yet... Am I wrong, or have I just missed resources? Who talks to you about your loss of job/career, how this affects your family, how about the patient's feelings? I mean, neither my wife or I can find anything. I'm SO TIRED of looking at survivor sites and reading survivor stories. That's wonderful. What about the women who don't win against breast cancer? What about their families? If we didn't have strong faith and an active church life, we probably both would have gone even crazier with this. Knowing that others understand this or have found resources would be a comfort. Not quite ready for Hospice just yet. Doxdad",

      "Content": "My wife is near the end of a 5 year battle with breast cancer. She has bone and liver mets. Both she and her oncologist agree that chemo is no longer having positive effects. In the last two weeks her abdomen has swollen a lot. Now her legs and feet are filling with fluid. Although her liver can be drained, it may not be effective for very long. Does anyone have ideas about this rapid, extreme fluid build-up? I am assuming it is related to liver failure. I'm not sure what else to deduce. I would like to be able to provide her some relief. Stupid, danged cancer. Doxdad [/b]",
