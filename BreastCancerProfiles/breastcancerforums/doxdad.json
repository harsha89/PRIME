      "Content": "My wife is near the end of a 5 year battle with breast cancer. She has bone and liver mets. Both she and her oncologist agree that chemo is no longer having positive effects. In the last two weeks her abdomen has swollen a lot. Now her legs and feet are filling with fluid. Although her liver can be drained, it may not be effective for very long. Does anyone have ideas about this rapid, extreme fluid build-up? I am assuming it is related to liver failure. I'm not sure what else to deduce. I would like to be able to provide her some relief.
