      "Content": "This is so very true. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 5 years ago. It had spread into 8 out of 13 lymphnodes, so the chance that it had spread to another part of my body was high. I have been a born again christian for 30 years now, and know personally the awesome power that my heavenly Father has, and how powerful prayer can be. The thing was, I was absolutely so weak from extremely strong chemo treatments, I did not have the energy to hit my knees. One day, I was sitting on the front porch swing and felt the presence of the Holy Spirit. All I could mutter, was Jesus, please hold me and don't let go, I have four children that need their mother, please heal me. I began to strengthen, the doctors were able to find some medicines that really helped with the nausea. I finished all of my treatments and all of my radiation, and found out that it never left my lymphnodes. I am a 5 year cancer survivor, now. Jesus did hold me that day, I felt Him. And He never let me go, and I am holding on to Him, too. I do not know how someone could go through something like this and not have Jesus to lean on. He is there, just waiting for someone to come to Him. It will be the best move anyone can ever make.",

      "Content": "I know exactly what you are going through. It hurts so bad. It has been 5 years since I received the neulasta shots, but I still remember them very well. You must be receiving the red devil chemo treatments. I had four of these spaced out every three weeks, and had to have a neulasta shot the day after every one of them. The pain is absolutely excrutiating. My doctor actually prescribed me pain killers, which I tried not to take, due to the fact that they are so addictive. The pain was usually really bad for about 5 days, by the 7th day I could tell a big difference, and by about the 9th or 10th day I was a whole lot better. I remember saying that it took me nearly weeks to get over the treatment and the shot, and I would have one good week before it was time to go through it all again. Hang in there, you can do it. I was only 36 and had 4 children from the age of 5 to 18. My oldest daughter helped me out alot, with laundry and cooking, and so forth. Let people help you, God has alot of blessings out there to help us, if we will let them. If you ever need someone to talk to, just hollar. I am now a 5 year survivor, and look back and think how in the world did I make it through. But with God's love and the love of my familly, all things are possible. God Bless You, Keitha T.",

      "Content": "Went through all of this 5 years ago. My lump was about the size of a small lemon. Crazy thing is, I had an exam 5 months earlier and nothing was found. The doctor and I talked about a mammogram, but decided against it, since I was only 36, with no family history. Five months later I found the knot. I did the first four treatments (red devil) before my masectomy. And when they removed my breast, they could not find any live cancer cells in the mass. However, it had spread to 8 of 13 lymphnodes, so I had to continue with treatments and radiations for another year and half. I do think it is a good idea to have the strongest chemo first. Who knows you may do like me, but not have any in your lymphnodes, which would be amazing. These treatments are the hardest, and it will take about a week and half to get over them, but you can do it. Hang in there and keep your faith strong, and you will pull through. I will be praying for you. God Bless You, Keitha T.",

Invasive means that it is aggressive and will spread if not taken care of. I actually went to the doctor in January of 06 and had a breast exam. Everything was normal, matter of fact my doctor told me that he did not feel I needed a mammogram, since I was only 36 and no history of breast cancer. Well, I found the lump in August of 06, it was nearly the size of a lemon and was stage 3. It had spread to 8 of 13 lymphnodes. But, here I am over 5 years later cancer free. Glory to God.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 36. So my oncologist has been telling me for 5 years that I need genetic testing to see if I have some mutant breast cancer gene. When I had insurance, they still would not pay for it because it is so expensive. Since then, my insurance company dropped me. Well, the other day I had an appointment with my oncologist, and he brought it up again. He has insisted on paying for the test himself, since I have 3 daughters. This was a blessing for sure. The question I have is because the nurse told me that if it comes back positive for this gene, then it would be a good idea for my three daughters to all have double mastectomies before they are 25. Is she correct or not? What exactly is this mutant gene? And will I definately pass it to my daughters? I also have a son, should we be concerned about him too? Totally Confused, Keitha T.",

      "Content": "I know exactly what you are going through. In 2003 the doctors found cervical cancer cells, so I had a hysterectomy (but they left my ovaries). And then in 2006, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. I could not help but think why me, what have I done to deserve this? Later I found out that if the doctors had taken my ovaries, I probably would not have ever come down with breast cancer, since mine was estrogen based. You are fortunate that your breast cancer is only stage one. More than likely you will not have to go through the hardest of the chemo's, and definately will not have to do radiation. One word of advice is to have both breasts removed. This cuts your chance of breast cancer reoccurance greatly. You also need to eat healthy and try to build your immune system up, so that you can fight further cancer cells better. Cause everyone has cancer cells in their bodies from time to time, but a healthy immune system will kill them. If you need any other info, or just have a question, just hollar, I will be watching your posts. I did not know anyone who had had breast cancer when I was diagnosed, and it would have helped so much to be able to talk to someone. Hang in there, you are not being punished or anything. Sometimes life is just not fair, it just depends on how you handle your situation. So keep your head up, square your shoulders, and take this whole mess head on. Kick cancers ass this time!!!! I will be praying for you, this is the best thing I could do for you. Always here, Keitha T.",

      "Content": "The law is if an insurance company covers you through a mastectomy, they MUST cover the reconstruction. I am fighting my old insurance company right now, because they cancelled me before I got the reconstruction done. When you talk to them tell them that you know about the following law: The 1998 Federal Breast Reconstruction Law: Sec. 713. Required Coverage for Reconstructive Surgery Following Mastectomies. (a) In General - A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, that provides medical and surgical benefits with respect to a mastectomy shall provide, in a case of a participant or beneficiary who is receiving benefits in connection with a mastectomy and who elects breast reconstruction in connection with such mastectomy, coverage for: \u2022Reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed; \u2022Surgery and reconstruction of the other breast to produce a symmetrical appearance; \u2022Prostheses and physical complications all stages of mastectomy, including lymphedemas; in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient. Such coverage may be subject to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions as may be deemed appropriate and as are consistent with those established for other benefits under the plan or coverage. Written notice of the availability of such coverage shall be delivered to the participant upon enrollment and annually thereafter. (b) Notice - A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer providing health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan shall provide notice to each participant and beneficiary under such plan regarding the coverage required by this section in accordance 1078 with regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Such notice shall be in writing and prominently positioned in any literature or correspondence made available or distributed by the plan or issuer and shall be transmitted: \u2022In the next mailing made by the plan or issuer to the participant or beneficiary; \u2022As part of any yearly informational packet sent to the participant or beneficiary; or \u2022Not later than January 1, 1999; whichever is earlier. (c) Prohibitions - A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not: \u2022Deny to a patient eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll or to renew coverage under the terms of the plan, solely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section; and \u2022Penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of an attending provider, or provide incentives (monetary or otherwise) to an attending provider, to induce such provider to provide care to an individual participant or beneficiary in a manner inconsistent with this section. 1079 (d) Rule of Construction - Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage from negotiating the level and type of reimbursement with a provider for care provided in accordance with this section. (e) Preemption, Relation to State Laws: \u2022In General - Nothing in this section shall be construed to preempt any State law in effect on the date of enactment of this section with respect to health insurance coverage that requires coverage of at least the coverage of reconstructive breast surgery otherwise required under this section. \u2022Erisa - Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect or modify the provisions of section 514 with respect to group health plans. (b) Clerical Amendment - The table of contents in section 1 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 note) is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 712 the following new item Go ahead and google Breast Reconstruction Laws, there is a ton of info on it. Call them and see what happens. It looks like I will be sueing the state where I live, because my insurance company was a state insurance company. Let me know how it goes.
