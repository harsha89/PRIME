I myself was not told at the time of my dx that there were any trials of the herceptin for us early stage HER2+ women. At the time of dx I didn't even know anything about the HER2..I feel my onco at the time missed the boat with me and it is still bothering me to this day (as you can tell). I guess its time to put it to rest since there is nothing that I can do about it now, but I sure would have liked to have had the opportunity to be given the option of the trial. Kristen",

I did 4 A/C and 4 Taxol dose dense. I did not have the numbing on my face but I did have it in my feet and my finger tips. I did have some tingling in my lower back hip area. All this went away after a few days along with the hidious joint pain. All in all I did find the Taxol easier than the A/C.... By the way....I am now officially two years out since my dx WHOOHAAA!!! so there is light at the end of the tunnel.. Take care and let us know how you are making out. Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Madge, I am also HER2+++ and have not been contacted by my doctor. I am insterested to see what will happen. Like Alaska said, I wonder if there will be a study for women like us that were not offered Herceptin at the time of chemo. I am two years out since my dx and I am not sure I am ready to do any more meds. One thing to be careful about is that Herceptin is not without side effects. It can cause heart damage and I am a very athletic person and a personal trainer so I am not sure I am willing to put myself on the line. (I know someone who did get heart damage from the Herceptin) Although, if it really carries a high rate of protectiveness for reoccurance, I guess I may do it. I will be calling my oncol in a few weeks to ask her, my visit with her is not until August. I have always wondered why I was not given the option of the added herceptin at the beginning, but everything happened in such a whirlwind I didn't even know to ask. I hate the fact that my oncol (at the time) did not even tell me about being HER2+++ and what it meant. Lets try to keep this subject active, as I think its important to all us HER2 + ladies.

      "Content": "Hi everybody, It has been ages since I have been on this board. I have also begun to reseach a more \"natural\" approach since my chemo ended two years ago. I was wondering if anyone could tell me anything about shark oil's (omega 3's)or specifically \"Seabiotics\" ...has anyone heard of this product. It is all about the inflamation in your body and this is supposed to be great for reducing inflamation along with tons of other benefits such as cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes.......the list goes on. So does anybody have any experience with this??? Thanks Kristen",

Funny thing happened today, my sister had a biopsy on her breast now has to go in for another type of wire thingy.. she just had the wire guided biopsy, now she has to have some kind of other thing. The good news is that if is is anything, then its very early stage and not invasive. My oncol said we may have to consider gene testing, that is why I was wondering if your doctor suggested this. Also, I didn't realize our situations are very similar as is our ages. are you post menapausal? Also I noticed you are Her2+ have you checked out the her2 website? Take care and Merry Christmas to you also. Kristen ps...yes I have not been posting but have been reading. I guess I just needed to take a break from all this...i am sure you know what I mean!",

      "Content": "Hello everybody, Hi Laurie thanks for the link, I will be sure to check it out. Also I am not new to the board, in fact have been here for a while and I thank god that I found it. Not only is there great advice from all you ladies, but having access to the doctors ears for answering questions is a huge bonus! Shelly....yes your post makes perfect sense. My oncol said that I have about as much chance as having the gene or ovarian cancer that she does (hopefully her chances aren't good)..because of the no family history. However, my surgical oncol said because I have twin daughters (age 10) that I should be sure that they get checked out early in their life. This whole gene thing is very confusing. To tell you the truth, if I tested postive for the gene, I would not even have a second thought about going in and getting ride of the ovaries. Good luck on your last A/C chemo...I remember it all to well!! Nancy...I beleive that the person with the breast or ovarian cancer is the one that needs to get the testing done. From what I know from my friend is that there is only one place that does the testing and it is in Calif..the cost is around 4,000 or so. If you test positive for the gene then my sisters or daughters could also be tested at the same lab but the cost is only about 300 or 400 dollars because the gene will already be isolated. But what if you don't know if you have any family history, are you better off to get the gene testing done? As far as I know I really don't ahve any family history but if one of my sisters should get bc or ovarian, are you then considered to have a family history enough to get tested? Thanks for all your posts and inputs everybody.... Kristen",

I think that anybody that wants to check out that issue may find it online in the back issues. This bc issue was full of really good information, especially if you were newly dx like I was at the time I discovered this magazine. I always look forward to getting the new issue in the mail, and you are right, its not a gloom and doom magazine. Its a highly informative magazine with all the newest and upcoming treatments and detections that are available and will be available. Anyway, I highly recomend checking this out like Nancy suggested. I hope you all have a great New Year! Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, This topic aways confuses me. First like Sam says, Tamox is for pre-menopausal women. If your doctor feels strongly about using the arimidex there is a lupron shot that can shut down your ovaries. I choose not to do this because I didn't want to mess around with anything else in my body. I am 44 and was dx in when I was 42 and chemo put me in menopause. However I would like to also say that someone else mentioned on this thread that you are likely considered post menopausal if you have no period for a year. Well I had no period for 15 or so months, then the flood gates opened and my GYN tested my hormone levels and I came back pre-menopausal. I had my period for three months now I have missed it again for almost 3 months. MY GYN ran the hormone levels again and I came back as still pre-menopausal. So, you always have a chance of getting back your period if you went into forced menopause with the chemo if you are a young age. So, right now I will stay on the tamox for the full five years and switch over to the Arimidex and have that for a full five years. Kristen",

So right now its either removal of ovaries or stay on the tamoxifen. Other than the ovarian cysts, (which may be enough to get the ovaries out) I have not had any problems at all with the tamoxifen. You are lucky you did not get your period back, I really really thought I was done with that! I guess I also want to just make sure that getting your period back is OK, I seem to be getting every 3 to 3 1/2 weeks, which is nothing like I use to get. I use to get it 4 to 4 1/2 weeks.

      "Content": "Hi Marybeth, I will let the doctors answer your question about lymph nodes beyond number 5 but I just wanted to share with you my experience. I had the sentinel node removal of three nodes. The orginal path came back negative nodes. However, when they did the final path they found one node was indeed positive, unlike you it was the first node not the 5th node. But, regardless my surgeon took me back in (3rd surgery) for removal of more nodes. I had 13 more removed all back negative. Sure your risk of lymphdemia is increased the more nodes that are removed. But I think I would want to make sure there were no more node involvement especially it being in the 5th node. I had the same treatment you are having, 4 A/C and 4 Taxol dose dense. It will be interesting to see what the doc's have to say. If I can be of anymore help, just let me know... Kristen",

I am going on 2 years since my dx on Good Friday (April 2003) Like Nancy said most of you know we both had appointments today. Like Nancy, I am lucky enough to say that I also had a good appointment. Although my med oncol does not really do much other than a really good breast exam...no blood, no scans...nothing...But she does ask a lot of questions and takes her time with me. We discussed staying on the tamox for the full five years but we will see what happens. I also had my 6 month GYN last week and still waiting for those results but today went well. Right now I need to stay focused on the good news and not think about my May appointments! Take care all Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi everybody, This topic aways confuses me. First like Sam says, Tamox is for pre-menopausal women. If your doctor feels strongly about using the arimidex there is a lupron shot that can shut down your ovaries. I choose not to do this because I didn't want to mess around with anything else in my body. I am 44 and was dx in when I was 42 and chemo put me in menopause. However I would like to also say that someone else mentioned on this thread that you are likely considered post menopausal if you have no period for a year. Well I had no period for 15 or so months, then the flood gates opened and my GYN tested my hormone levels and I came back pre-menopausal. I had my period for three months now I have missed it again for almost 3 months. MY GYN ran the hormone levels again and I came back as still pre-menopausal. So, you always have a chance of getting back your period if you went into forced menopause with the chemo if you are a young age. So, right now I will stay on the tamox for the full five years and switch over to the Arimidex and have that for a full five years. Kristen",

She already had breast cancer, so she just went in to remove the ovaries. If you have no family history that you know of...and I stress THAT YOU KNOW OF....should one get the gene testing. I have three sisters and two young daughters. One of my sisters has had a biopsy which came back negative, but they still watch her every six months with mammo and ultrasound. Has anybody here had the gene testing, and if so was it only because of a sister, mother, daughter...etc with either breast or ovarian? Has anybody had the test with no other relatives having had breast or ovarian? If my sister should come back as cancer as some point, would I then be in a higher risk and have the testing???? Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks again everybody. Kristen",

She feels I am tolerating the tamox just fine so the plan is to remain on it for the full 5 years, at which point then switching to the Arimidex. She also said that this gives me 10 years (crossing fingers) to take advantage of the hormonal therapy. So, unless something changes in the next few years I will take her advice. If I am still pre-menopausal when I complete the tamox (been on it for 16 months) then we will discuss taking the ovaries out and forcing myself into full menopause so I can go on the Arimidex. I am not sure I am making much sense here...LOL Kristen",

However, one thing that I do is have my appoitment scheduled so I can go to the oncology dept first and have them run the line. My first MRI five different people tried to stick me, they called the ER nurse, Pedi nurse...etc nobody could do it and my MRI got cancelled. They scheduled me to go to oncology for the oncology nurses to run the line and she go it the first time. They are soooooo much more experienced from working with chemo veins. I had another MRI on Tuesday...(waiting for the results...pain in the butt and nervous all week!!!) anyway they got it the second time but it sure was better than getting stuck five or six times.

I did not have the side effects that you mention, in fact I had nothing really that I can recall except the chemo side effect of course. Could these side effects be caused by something else? Have you talked to her doctor. I suppose she could be having some sort of reaction but I would check with the doctor because if its dose dense chemo she is on, its important to take these shots to continue on the chemo regiment. She is very lucky she has such a caring daughter and one that is willing to step up and do research and ask questions.

      "Content": "Hi Sue, I don't know if there is anything other than time....to help the \"chemo\" veins. However, one thing that I do is have my appoitment scheduled so I can go to the oncology dept first and have them run the line. My first MRI five different people tried to stick me, they called the ER nurse, Pedi nurse...etc nobody could do it and my MRI got cancelled. They scheduled me to go to oncology for the oncology nurses to run the line and she go it the first time. They are soooooo much more experienced from working with chemo veins. I had another MRI on Tuesday...(waiting for the results...pain in the butt and nervous all week!!!) anyway they got it the second time but it sure was better than getting stuck five or six times. So my only suggestion is to get the line done by an experienced Oncology nurse.... Hope this helped some.. Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Rachelle, I am glad you found the site, hopefully someone will be able to share helpful information for you. I am not positive, but I thought I heard someone say once that breast cancer usually is not painful, however I could be wrong. Either way, its a good thing to get it checked out by your PCP. You may need to be forceful and insist on further testing....like and MRI. For some reason some doctors will order any tests, like MRI, CT scan ...etc...but others you just have to nag and insist...... Usually young women have dense tissue in their breast and a mammogram does not always \"see\" through it. I have dense tissue and in addition to the mammogram, I get an MRI every year. Breast cancer really does not know an age. Although I know typically it is rare for one in their 20's. I know so many young women that have had breast cancer, myself included (OK so I think 42 was young..lol) Actually I know more women in their early 30's and 40's than over 50. Your swollen lymph nodes could be just a sign of infection which the Batrim may take care of. I hope everything works out for the best for you, please keep us updated! Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Everybody and Dr Leo.... I am wondering who of you that are on tamoxifen and got their periods back. I have been on it for 15 months and had not had a period since 7/03. I went for my six month check at my GYN and she was running a baseline pelvic ultrasound and it showed I had cysts. She watched and they did go away. She also ran that blood test that determines where you are as far as menopausal status. It came back that I was Pre-menopausal, which surpised her because I had not had a period in 15 months, but at the same time when she did the ultrasound, it did show signs of ovarian activity. Then two days later I got my period!!! and three weeks after that I got it again. I am 43 and don't really want it back, and would really just like to have my ovaries and uterus out because of all the increased risk of cancer. I go back to my GYN in February to discuss this removal of these pesky organs! Did any of you women get your period back after being in \"chemo\" pause? Also, My ocon was going to switch me after two years to one of the newer drugs. I guess she was assuming that I would stay post-menopausal. Now I guess I can't get on one of the better drugs...right?? Any ideas here would be greatly appreciated. Dr Leo, any input on having your period back while on tamoxifen would be greatly appreciated!

I use to have it filled in the local pharmacy for $10 for 30 pills, but my insurance company now uses a mail in called Express Scrips and I get three month at a time for the same price of $10. This has been a great service because you don't have to refill it every month. Also I have a daughter (10) who is a diabetic and I can get all her supplies this way too, which saves me a huge amount of money. Just a thought, you may want to check it out. The only thing you need to do is get a 90 day script made out instead of a 30 day, which most doc's will do without a problem.

It wasn't until much later when I got all my path sent to me and doing my own research that I figured out what HER2 even was. Maybe my oncol at the time mentioned it but I was in such a fog, but still I believe I would have participated in the trial. I was in a trial/study for sentenal node biopsy. Ok so now I need to move on and get past it!!! I don't believe they are willing to try herceptin alone at this time, but maybe some new trials will be coming in some day.. Thanks for the input Leo.

I look at it this way...at the time of going through treatment you feel it will never end. Then suddenly one day its over! I try to think about the 9 months as a short detour in my life that has made me a stronger person who looks at life much differently. I take the time to enjoy my kids more and I try not to beat myself up if things don't get done the way I would like them to...ie housework, laundry...work...you know!!

I have put a call into my oncologist but so far only spoke to her nurse practioner, which is OK but I asked her the same question that you ask here. She is going to discuss it with my doctor so when I come in for my appt in August hopefully some light will be shed on the subject. I know this is a very frustrating topic right now for those of us that HER+++.....and I just hate the fact that I was not more informed at the time of my dx just over two years ago.

      "Content": "Hi Jill, Leo and Nancy, OK...this subject really confuses me. I went into menopause for 15 months then got my period back then gone again. Now I got it again very light which only lasted 3 days. I had a blood test that showed I was premenapausal so I realize it is a wait and see thing. Here is my questions. Those of us that are in their early 40's and got their periods back...... is this considered safe or not????? I have been on tamox for 19 months and would not object to get my ovaries out if it added protection because of the hormone status. (plus the ovarian cancer scares the heck out of me) My current plan with my onco is finish up the 5 years with tamox then hopefully switching over to arimidex. I realize that you need to be in full menapause for Arimdrix but I have friends that started on the Arimidrix and still got there period back and had to be taken off. Please help me understand if it is more harmful for us to get this spotting or our periods or not. And...if we are considered premenopausal how long does this typically last before the actual menapause sets in???? I just want to do all I can to prevent reoccurance. Because of the Tamox we also have added risk of uterine cancer, so besides a pap every 6 months is it advised to get a uterine biopsy as well? When I first began spotting right before my period came back I had a uterine biopsy and an ultrasound. The biopsy came back fine (thank god) but my ultrasound showed ovarian cysts, which were followed and seemed to have disappeared. PLease help me understand all this!!!!! THanks so much for you help Kristen",

I look at it this way...at the time of going through treatment you feel it will never end. Then suddenly one day its over! I try to think about the 9 months as a short detour in my life that has made me a stronger person who looks at life much differently. I take the time to enjoy my kids more and I try not to beat myself up if things don't get done the way I would like them to...ie housework, laundry...work...you know!!

      "Content": "Hi Alaska... What an interesting study, how did you manage to hook up with that study? I am glad that the cream gave you some success. I agree that just having better moods and more energy makes for better living in general. Did you talk to your onc before you went on the study? I am PR/ER + and I worry about these types of things. But, I will also say that I am suffering now in the libedo department! My energy levels are good, I weightlift and doing cardio almost everyday, but I do notice at night I crash pretty fast, but its usually a good kind of tired. I wonder if my libedo problem stems from the flip flopping with my period and my pre-menopausal status. In Feb my GYN ran the blood test again, and it came back pre-menopausal. I pretty much thought I was considered post-menopausal after not having my period for over 15 months. Then out the clear blue sky, it returned for three months every 21 days like clock work. Now its been4 months again since I have had a period...So I am wondering if this could contribute to the libedo problem???? My husband has been patient and understanding, but it is starting to make me crazy!! At first I didn't want to try any treatments, but I am wondering about this cream??? Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Susan, I was on the same treatment as you. I have just reached my two year dx date. I am not a vitamin expert by any stretch of the means, but I think by eating a balanced diet you can get most of what you need. However, like your doctor, mine also recomended a womens mulit vitamin and like doctor Leo mentions also extra calcium. I think the recomended dose is 1200 units. I think my multi vit has 250 and I take a calcium with D (make sure you take one that says calcium with D) and they are 600 units. You can take two calcium tablets a day, but take them at different times. I only take one additional right now because I drink a lot of milk and eat a lot of diary products (also I am not post menopausal...(43) or so the blood test say... ) Again, there are a lot of people that take a lot of different suppliments for a variety of reasons. I only take a multi and extra calcium and try to eat a balanced diet. Good luck in finishing up your rads....its so very nice to have a light at the end of the tunnel!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, It will be interesting to hear what the good doc's say. I just thought I would share something that happened to me... I was in the Sental node biopsy study which was to show that they could pick up the first few nodes and have better results than first removing all the nodes (which was standard of care). I got on the arm that they would do the sental node and if any came back positive (discovered during the surgery) they would remove the rest right then and there. Well my surgery went well with no positive nodes out of 3. Then a week later I get a call saying that when the lab was doing the permanent slides they discovered that one was POSITIVE.. so back in I went for more to be removed (I think 11 or 15) which all were negative..thank goodness!! But, I can't help but wonder if other women gone through the sental node dissection with negative nodes, may have had positive nodes like me. In your case are they talking about lymph nodes which came back postive the second time around like me??? Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Peggy, I am now two years out, but I remember having a similar problem when I got up in the night to go to the bathroom. I remember a very heavy chest feeling and sort of short of breath, Oddly enough they thought i may be dehidrate, and I guess I was because from that point on I made myself drink lots of water and that seemed to help. Recently I started experiencing some sort of chest discomfort that started after I was lifting weights. It started out hurting every time I took a breath on my left side, now it seems to be a pressure or slight heavy feeling. The doctor thinks its some kind of inflamation caused by working out with too heavy weights. She called it something but I forgot what she called it. Good luck, Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi again Susan, You mention that you will be taking the multi and extra calcium and that you are post menopausal.....Are you ER/PR + and on Arimidex, or even Tamoxifen??? I ask because I think the recomended dose for any post menopausal women is approx 1200 to 1500 units of a calcium with D suppliment to keep the bones healthy after menopause. If you are ER/PR + and on Arimidex, this is known to have adverse effects on the bones, therefore extra calcium is a must. If you are on tamoxifen, this is known to actually not have adverse effects on the bones. Either way though, you may want to increase your calcium with D to 1200 units simply because you are post menopausal....Ask your OBGYN and see what they say. About the hair.... my chemo ended 9/03 and by 12/03 I was hatless..very short and curly but enough to be comfortable to not wear anything. I can wear my hair very short and it looks good. My hair grew back really fast and curly and a different color...EEK!! (grayish)...However, I kept cuitting it and eventually the curly totally came out and my original color...blondish brown also came back. I was very surprised how fast my hair came back. I have kept it short and now get it highlighted to get some added life to to it..LOL..",

      "Content": "Hi Everybody, My Name is Kristen and I live in Central Mass. I am 43 and was dx April 2003 on Good Friday. I had lumpectomy with re-incision and sental node with reported negative nodes, only to find a week later one positive node. So back in for the THIRD time, the rest of the nodes were negative. I was dx with invasive ductal carcinoma with 1.6 cm, ER/PR + HER2 strongly positive. I had 8 rounds of chemo 4 A/C, 4 taxol dose dense with daily nuprogen shots and 38 rounds of rads, 5 years tamoxifen. Treatment ended Dec 30, 2003 but I still carry a lot of the emotional stuff. So, as you all can see I have almost hit the one year mark for the ending of treatment. But, like someone else here stated, I feel the need to be in constant contact here and elsewhere on the board because it has been a very emotional year. I have two wonderful twin girls who just turned 10, and a very supportive husband. It's great to meet you all, and I would like to say a special thanks to Leo for all his hard work in responding to all our postings.

      "Content": "Hi Marion, Someone else may have mentioned this...but you can only go on Arimidex if you are post menopausal. I went into menopause (or so they thought) for 15 months. Then out of the clear blue sky I got my period back....so now the blood test comes out that I am pre-menopausal. I have been on tamoxifen for almost two years and have really not had any problems at all. Don't let the weight gain side effect scare you because further studies have shown that women on tamox and women not on tamox have lost or gained the same amount of weight. The studies do shown that Arimidix is shown to reduce the reoccurance more than tamox, but you can only take it if you are post menopausal, so I didn't really have any choice of what drug I took. So my plan is to stay on the tamox for the full five years, then switch over to the Arimidex....hopefully I will be post menopausal by then...if not I will remove the ovaries. Hopefully this has helped some, please continue to let us know how you are.. Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy, Thanks for the reply. I am on tamox and have been for 16 months now with no previous hair loss on it. I have been off chemo since 9/2003 and I was not wearing a hat by Dec 2003. So my \"new\" hair grew in strong and thick and has been ever since. I did notice my leg hair and underarm hair was less, but now it seems to be gone. Almost like no follicles. I have dirty blonde hair and was never hairy to begin with. But this new thinning and lack of shaving got me really scared that something was going to happen to my head hair...I was (am) in a panic. When I lost my hair during chemo it was horrible, but at least I knew it was going to come back and it did. Maybe because of my cancer experience of loosing all my hair sets me in a panic now like it might happen again with no chemo. Does this make sense? So I am curious if the doctors here can explain or if they ever heard of anybody loosing their hair again almost two years after chemo. I hate these things that get your imagination going wild!!! Thanks and I hope to hear more repsonses. Kristen",

As far as rads go, I think more than anything the tiredness stems from the traveling every day for a treatment that last 15 minutes for six weeks!Most people I know, myself included, have managed to work throughout the treatment. My rads finished 12/03 and I think I did pretty good, it's not the same kind of tired that chemo gives you. I would think that a trip after rads is done would sound like a wonderful idea. I did everything I could just to get my kids to school everyday and then to work that I did feel pretty tired by the end of the day..(and still do).. Kristen",

I went to a surgeon who reviewed the ultrasound (didn't show on the mamo) and he was pretty sure it was nothing. His feeling (must have been a gut feeling) was that it could obscure any future findings so he wanted to just take it out. Which I thank God for this very day. I was dx is invasive duct carcinoma 1.6 cm, with no family history and very healthy, workout with cardio and weight lifting daily , I was 41. While I agree that you are young and most likely its not bc..you just never know for certain unless you have it taken out or biopsied. Kristen",

      "Content": "Hi Everybody, I have a hair question. To tell you all the truth I thought I was pretty much done with hair issues since my chemo ended Sept 03. My hair came back really fast and thick. Different color and different texture at first but it pretty much turned back to normal. Here is my question. I noticed the other day that I had not needed to shave my legs or my underarms for what seemed a few weeks. Then a week later I still noticed I didn't need to at all. Now I notice my eye lashes and eyebrows really thinning out again. I am starting to freak out about loosing my hair again. Has this happened to anybody? Should I worry about loosing my hair on my head again??? I thought I was done with hair issues now I am really scared. At least the first time was explained by chemo, what could explain this? Thanks all for your help. Kristen",

Well my surgery went well with no positive nodes out of 3. Then a week later I get a call saying that when the lab was doing the permanent slides they discovered that one was POSITIVE.. so back in I went for more to be removed (I think 11 or 15) which all were negative..thank goodness!! But, I can't help but wonder if other women gone through the sental node dissection with negative nodes, may have had positive nodes like me....",
