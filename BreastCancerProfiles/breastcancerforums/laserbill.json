    "Content": "Dizzybuf38, We found out 8 weeks ago that my wife has breast cancer. She also has had Crohn's for the past 15 or more years. From 2001 to 2003, she took Remicade (infusions) to help with the Crohn's. We found a way in September 2003 to cure the Crohn's, but now the breast cancer has arrived...Hers also spread to the lymph nodes (9 of 1 but they did not find any cancer elsewhere (other than the 5.2cm tumor in the breast) so she is rated stage 3B. She has already had a double mastectomy and had her first 2 rounds of chemo. My question for you is this: did you also take Remicade for your Crohn's? My wife's oncologist told us that she has several Remicade patients that now have cancer. By the way, while my wife was on Remicade she had many episodes of what felt and seemed like Rheumatoid Arthritis - now that she is cured of the Crohn's, these Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms are all gone. She was also on 50 to 60mg of Prednisone for 6 years. Thanks, laserbill",
