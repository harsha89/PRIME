      "Content": "Hi Nathalie, hows your Mom now? for whatever this is worth, i'm sahring with you this website on the body's own immune system and its capacities to prevent illnesses and diseases including those that we dread, or help the body recover from infections of these diseases already. i hope you find something helpful from this site http://www.natureheals4life.bravehos...andCANCER.html I am a believer in nature's own ways of preventing diseases or allowing the body to recover from them. it can comfort me to think i could not be susceptible to later discoveries that this drug or that has been found to cause another disease and has been ordered recalled from the shelves!",

      "Content": "i understand the anxiety that condition can start. I agree with Cindy about getting a second opinion. it is always prudent. In case too it is actually what we dread, 6 months is a long time for it to have developed badly. Whether or not, however, these are any sort more disturbing, the body's immune system is really the first line of defense if not really our defense of the first order against diseases of all kinds including those we dread. May i share with you this site on the body's immune system and its abilities to altogether protect or help the body recover from such illnesses.",

I agree, though with Cindy about getting a second opinion. it is always prudent. Whether or not, however, these are mere allergies or any sort more disturbing, the body's immune system is really the first line of defense if not really our defense of the first order against diseases of all kinds including those we dread. May i share with you this site on the body's immune system and its abilities to altogether protect or help the body recover throm such illnesses . http://www.natureheals4life.bravehost.com/TFinfo.html here's something more specific on allergies: http://www.powerbod.com/asia/orlan/?...ials#allergies i hope you find this useful and helpful",
