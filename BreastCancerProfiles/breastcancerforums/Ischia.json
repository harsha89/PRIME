      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed in 2000 w/ breast CA. I had a Lumpectomy w/FS and an Axillary Node dissection. Tumor-1cm-0 nodes - strongly HER2 positive. I had a course of Adriamycin & Cytoxin followed by radiation therapy. I have been having pain in my arm on the affected side with occasional pain around my lumpectomy site, which had been numb since surgery. Should I be concerned? I am going to my orthopod this week. Thanks & God Bless!",
