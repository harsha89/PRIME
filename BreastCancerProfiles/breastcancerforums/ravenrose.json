      "Content": "I am a 45 year old woman that was diagnoised with breast cancer in November 2004. I had a hysterectomy, forgive me if I mispell words, in 2001 and was put on estridol and am almost certain that it caused my breast cancer. I try to warn all ladies not to take a estrogen pill or patch. My cancer was highly sensitive to estrogen. I have all ready been through chemo and have 4 more treatments of radiation left. After that I have to go on a antiestrogen therapy and aromatase inhibitor. Trust me, it's not worth taking any hormone replacement therapy. I don't want to scare anyone to death but please believe me when I tell you these things because most Doctors won't tell you this because they don't know themselves.",
