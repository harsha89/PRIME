      "Content": "Thank you for the reply GingerLing. It is scary no matter what forum of cancer it is. Its still the major C word. This might be wrong of me, but I think if I know about how long I have with her, that when her day does come maybe possibly it will not hurt as much as her passing and not expecting it. And I do see where my lack of knowledge does not help the situation, but I can not force my dad to tell me anything. So it really is very confusing right now, especially I think I should know because I have already had cervical cancer three times. It would be nice if my dad would let me know everything so that I can tell my pcp. But hes completely lost right now. They have been together for 43 years.He lost his mother and brother to cancer also. So I just try not to push him right now.",

      "Content": "Hello I am writing about my mother. I think maybe more for me, it seems to help me the more I try to talk about this. Ok here is what is going on, I do not know all of the specifics, basically due to my father. He will not speak of my mother dying or anything negative which is good, but he also will not tell us what is going on with her. Three years ago my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, the tumor was the size or an orange. Well she had a mastectomy, went through all of the chemo, radiation, had all but one of her lymph nodes removed. After all of that she was in \"remission\" for 2 years. About 2 months ago she went to stand up and could not. We took her to the ER. Her back is broke in two places. We had found out that the cancer was back and had metastasized to her spine, right rib cage, and the right side of her pelvic bone. At that time they had said that her cancer was \"treatable\" not \"curable\". They had done 6 mega doses of radiation, and basically sent her home. Well she can not even walk mind you, due to her back being broke. So my father has her in a nursing home. I think it is next week she will be having another MRI done. But what I am scared of right now is her right arm is so swollen, and red. I know that is somewhat normal. But her right side also hurts really bad. She says she having a hard time breathing. She also says it feels like there is a balloon in her side. Well all of that is scarring me because it all sounds like one of 2 things to me. 1) the cancer has broke her ribs, or 2) the cancer has now spread to her lungs. I would have thought that her doctor would have already had her come in for another MRI, but he has not. But this also the same doctor that mom had called everyday for 2 weeks asking about her back pains, and he would not do a scan, because her blood work had came back fine. When they say cancer is treatable but not curable, how long can a person live with it? I mean I know she will not be here forever. But even if they had given her a time frame, no one would tell me. My mother would not want me to worry, but I think I am worrying more not knowing anything, than if they would just be honest. I have 3 children and if their grandmother could go any day, then I would want her grand babies with her as much as possible. Sorry I just rattle on and on. But I have never been so lost and confused in my life. I just do not know what to expect from any of this.",
