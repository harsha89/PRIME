    "Content": "Dear Sir/Madam: My aunt who is 58 years old had been diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast in 1995 and she underwent lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Axillary lymph nodes were obtained for sampling and were negative. She tolerated the treatments well. However, she was not tested for ER/PR status and was not given tamoxifen. She did well after this and was cancer-free till 2003 when she developed metastasis of the breast cancer in to the liver with 2 lesions. Liver biopsy was done and histopathology showed breast CA metastasis. She underwent chemotherapy with docetaxel, doxorubicin and 5-FU. After chemotherapy completion, she underwent treatment with Aromasin for 5-1/2 years, as she was estrogen receptor positive. She did well and was cancer-free until June 2011 when she had difficulty swallowing. She underwent CT abdomen, PET scan, and other routine blood tests like CA 15-3 and AFP. PET scan showed a lesion that was FDG avid in the GE junction extrinsically. There were 3 lesions in the liver. She underwent 2 endoscopies within 2 weeks and both showed normal esophageal mucosa with no evidence of any lesion or malignancy. Our oncologist suggested CT-guided biopsy of both the lesions, i.e. liver and GE junction. The radiologist could not locate the liver lesions on CT, but he made an attempt at transhepatic biopsy of the GE junction lesion. The histopath report of this lesion just mentioned adenocarcinoma. Our oncologist told us this was a new primary (GE junction adenocarcinoma) and prescribed 3 cycles of cisplatin and paclitaxel. We have not gone ahead with chemotherapy till today because I have a doubt regarding the diagnosis. As the 2 endoscopies have shown normal mucosa till duodenum and as the lesion is extrinsic, there is suspicion of this being Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma as it is very unusual to find an adenocarcinoma of GE junction extrinsically with mucosal, submucosal, lamina propria and other layers being normal. We had another appointment with an oncologist who suggested re-staining the GE junction biopsy reports and test it for HER2/neu and ER/PR status before proceeding with chemotherapy. Please tell us how we should proceed further as we are all very anxious and my aunt is already in depression. Hoping eagerly for your reply. Gurman",
