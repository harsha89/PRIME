      "Content": "Since my previous posting, I have managed to come across some materials that are right in line with the kinds of questions I\u0092ve been asking. Gregory\u0092s post got me to thinking about how important it is to focus on cells, and as I explored the Internet to find more information about this kind of approach, I came across something called Atavistic Oncology. It seems to be doing just what I was hoping to find \u0096 offering fresh thinking about cancer by rethinking what is happening at the cellular level. Dr. Arguello is the one who is doing this, and he believes that cancer cells are not so much \u0093sick\u0094 as remembering what it was like when all living cells were single-celled organisms like fungi and bacteria and so forth. This has taken him in the direction of treating cancer with pretty common antifungal and antibacterial drugs that have already been approved by the FDA. The really interesting thing is that it seems to be working quite well. What\u0092s even more exciting is that he\u0092s been treating patients with Stage IV cancers that had pretty much run out of both options and hope. And he\u0092s treating them effectively. I would point anyone who\u0092s interested in finding out more about this innovative approach to the area on his website that shows pictures of before/after atavistic treatments for late-stage patients. I\u0092ll be the first to admit that these are difficult photos to look at, but the after-treatment photos tell a powerful story of people receiving effective treatments even with late-stage cancers. The place on the Internet where these before/after photos may be viewed is http://www.atavisticchemotherapy.com...cer_treatments and then you can also explore the rest of the website to find out more about this new style of treatment that appears to be getting real results and offering real hope to people in the Stage IV phase of cancer. I hope some of you on this forum find the information useful! With all my best, Sherman Morrison",

      "Content": "I read with interest this thread because I think Gregory D. Pawelski is offering some real insight into cancer and its treatment. After my mother successfully beat her breast cancer, I have continued to research information about various treatments and cures and progress in the field. It is staggering to me that after decades of research and awareness, treatments of late-stage cancers remain largely ineffective. Why is this? I think in many ways it has to do with not taking the traditional thinking into new directions. There is another \"stick\" thread in this forum about electrochemotherapy that I thought was quite interesting -- that the use of electricity can make cancer cells much more porous so that the chemo drugs can more easily penetrate the cells to do their cancer-fighting work. What Gregory points out seems to me to be the key -- a fuller and perhaps non-traditional approach that focuses in on a better understanding of the living cells that are cancer cells. What if we're not asking the right questions? What if our basic ideas about what cancer is are just wrong? Traditional thinking views cancer cells as \"sick\" cells. What if this is just wrong? What if they aren't sick at all but actually are highly successful at what they are doing, which just so happens to be something that makes people very ill. By viewing cancer cells as sick cells, we put all our energies into how to make them just go away. But if we see them as highly successful, where might that thinking lead? At this point I don't have answers, but I'm in the process of trying to find where such fresh thinking exists and to see where it leads. Sherman Morrison",

      "Content": "My mother battled breast cancer some years ago, and I thank God that she won. She was fortunate in that it was caught very early on and she chose to take very proactive approach and underwent a double mastectomy. Years later she remains cancer free. But the whole episode left me with some really nagging questions that I have continued to think about a lot ever since. When I first started looking around at information about the sort of \"big picture\" of cancer, the thing that really struck me was how little progress has been made in decades of focused research and awareness. In particular, I was left wondering why there has been so little advancement in the treatment of late-stage patients. I feel a great deal of compassion for anyone dealing with a Stage 4 cancer and its treatment. What my initial research brought me to was this conclusion: What is most needed is new, fresh thinking that is willing to question even the most basic assumptions about what cancer is and how to treat it. After all, traditional thinking is what has created the status quo of ineffective treatment for our sickest loved ones! I'm interested in exploring what more non-traditional thinking has to offer, and I don't mean these kind of crazy-sounding cures you see all over the Internet. I want to know more about fresh thinking based on good science that questions basic assumptions about what cancer is and how it operates. I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of such fresh, outside-the-box thinking that's backed up with good science! In the meantime, I hope everyone struggling with cancer can find ways to feel as well as they can under the circumstances. Sherman Morrison",
