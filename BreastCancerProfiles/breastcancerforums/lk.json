    "Content": "Hi, I've been having a pain in my right breast on and off for a couple of months. The Dr. felt a firmness and sent me for a mammogram. Mammogram and ultrasound did not show anything, but report stated I have extremely dense breasts. The Dr. thinks this may be fibrocystic condition, but is concerned why the lump hasn't gone away. He's ordered a biopsy. I believe it will be an incisional one. I only started looking into the different kind that are available once I got home. I want to call him and find out which kind I will have and why. Can someone tell me if incisional ones are more accurate than needle biopsies? I'm trying to do my research as much as possible. I am getting scared because I'm linking all possible symptoms together...I know that 80% of biopsies are benign...but that doesn't help my anxiety. Can anyone recommend specialists in Atlanta? How do I determine if my Dr. is good or not? Are there any sites that rank breast surgeons? He was recommended by my Ob/Gyn. Also, does fibrocystic condition occur usually in only one breast or both? Thanks in advance! LK 36 yrs old.",
