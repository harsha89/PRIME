      "Content": "I developed a hematoma after surgery which was huge and painful. The surgeon decided to put on a pressure bandage and not drain it. It has been a month after my partial mastectomy and the blood (and scar tissue?) has become rock hard and still painful. The oncologist said I would need to heal for about 4 more weeks before starting radiation. My fear is that the radiation will make it harder and more permanent. Has anyone been in this situation?",
