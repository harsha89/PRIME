      "Content": "Originally Posted by sumeetshah The symptoms which you mention seem more in favour of an infective pathology and not a cancer. Besides, most breast cancers, rarely if ever, produce pain and redness (except inflammatory breast cancer). So I suggest, you visit your doctor and let him/her assess and opine. I got up this morning and I could tell my breast mass is shrinking As wierd as it sounds I want it to stay with me till I see the doc on Wed to get a biosy but I can guess shrinking is a good sign. The pain though is still there and sometimes its really bad. I just thought I'd update. Thanks for replying to my post.",

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2011 I noticed my breast lump/mass that was very painful and big. I saw a radiologist who examined, did mamo and US the same day. That huge painful mass did show on both mamo and US but the result was Birad 1. I was prescribed anti biotic, took them accordingly and the lump/mass went away. 10 days later the lump/mass disappeared and the breast felt normal. 2/15 no significant symptoms but I saw a BS for a second opinon anyway. He couldn't feel anything ofcourse since the lump was no longer there, did US and mamo. He annouced: Everything is normal. April 5th, my breast started getting painful and sore. The next day I found a golf size ball lump in the same spot and in the same breast. April 7 the lump/mass got even bigger and turned in to an oblong shape about 3\"x5\". It is painful just like the one in Dec. Arthritis on my knuckles and my elbow comes and goes. throat is tender on one side when swallowing, feeling tired and out of breath about once a day. Has anyone ever been in my situation and what is your diagnosis?",

      "Content": "Hi there, Yes, hubby has been diagnosed with PC and we hope it is not the agressive type. He has decided to get a surgery and remove the whole prostate. I had a visit with a breast specialist today who did a thorough exam. US and Mammo. When she examined my breast she thought it was really bad but the mammo and US showed nothing suspecious except for a thinkening area or a lump that is about 3.5 cm. She prescribed me antibiotic for the pain and swelling on my breast if the symptoms don't go away in a week she will send me to a surgeon for biosy. SO yes, I am so woried. I mean how many cancer could be detected with US and Mammo right.",
