      "Content": "Hello. First things first. I don't want condolences. I want sound Medical opinions. My Name is..unimportant. I was born in '94. When i was 2 my parents split because my father couldn't keep himself to himself. My ma and i moved around quite a bit (9 times in 14 years). When we lived in Texas she developed stage 3 breast cancer and successfully fought the bastard through a year and a half of chimo. (I lived in Queens with my aunt during this time). We live in Florida now and I'm 16. Her stomach and back have been hurting her, so she took of work and saw the chiropracter. They gave her the quack medicine and shes been taking it for a month. She has been debilitated by the pain and now walks with a cane for one minute at a time and very slowly. She finally went to the doctor and they found a lump. (!) they rushed her in to the hospital and discovered the cancer in her spine and stomach... shes 54. She is in there now... Can someone tell me candidly what her chance of making it through? She's a very strong woman and i love her to death. Thank you...",
