      "Content": "I have a sister who was diagnosed stage 4 breast cancer in 2007. She has undergone chemo, double mastectomy,radiation and a lot more chemos. It is in one of her lymph nodes now and her doctor is giving her taxol starting on Thur. Mar.1. Her cancer is a hormone based cancer. It feeds off hormones. Her doctor told her that when she was diagnosed that there hadn't been a treatment for this cancer until around 2005. She has suffered so many side effects but remains strong and positive. I got on this forum to get information, support, and anything that will help both her and myself in dealing with this disease. She is 69. Our mother died from this cancer at age 67, so our family has had personal experience with cancer. I would appreciate hearing from survivors of this disease as well as hearing from anyone who has undergone the drug taxol. Thanks so much for all of you who continue your fight with this and who support those who are fighting. Love and prayers, Pat",
