      "Content": "so very sorry to hear of your wife's mets....but hang in there as I have a tale to tell! I live in England, met some US friends in Spain when we all retired there some 20 years ago. Our friend Allan was diagnosed with stage IV non small cell cancer in his right lung some 4 years ago. They were told it was terminal and to make appropriate arrangements (sic). He had his right lung resected and was very ill for a year afterwards - his wife even got a hospital bed delivered to the house. Trish finally got Allan referred to the Moffitt Cancer Hospital in Tampa, near to them in Florida and Allan saw 45 different doctors, cost over $1m for his treatment, which was all covered by insurance. He then had to have his left kidney removed and that is when I flew over to help out. He looked like 90 yrs old - no hair, couldn't walk,eat or even brush his teeth. We got him into a rehab unit for a month and he slowly started to pick up - but when we took him in there the administrator's first question was: \"Which funeral director have you made arrangements with?\" I was astounded by the lack of tact, but I guess down in Florida they deal with this all the time. Fast forward to last year - he made the long airline flight to England and stayed here a month, with us and various other friends and looks like 60 yrs old - he is 76 yrs old. He has a little problem with walking uphill due to decreased lung function, but is so enjoying his life and is participating in such. So, please, never give up hope - get whatever second or third, opinions as you can and go to the very best hospital you can find. Allan is now giving supportive talks to stage IV cancer patients at Moffitt - so there is always hope. If he can cut it, most of us can. I got breast cancer 2 years ago which had spread by the time it was discovered, but Allan has been my absolute inspiration. My motto is, every day is a bonus, and I will do whatever it takes to give me more wonderful days. Truly hope for the best for you and your wife. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Kaz - just seen your posting - glad you are feeling happier about the biopsy. There is a way to \"get rid\" of malignant calcifications before they turn into invasive cancer and that is either a lumpectomy (or wide local excision) if the calcifications are clustered together - if they are widespread I fear it is a mastectomy. Either way, rather have it out than it turn into something that requires chemo and rads. Hope you will come back after your biopsy results with a benign result. You will be in my prayers and thoughts. Take care. Liz.",

      "Content": "I had a non palpable tumour that showed on normal 3 yrly mammo and was recalled to a specialist breast care centre in the UK. They showed me the mammo and the big shadow and that is when I knew it was cancer. Apparently cysts show up differently on mammos and ultrasound. They did a compression mammo and ultrasound and immediately asked if I would have a core biopsy - heck, yes! I only felt a sharp prick as they put some local anaesthetic in the area. I don't know how much tissue they took out, but no scar at all, and it was certainly enough for the pathologist to determine I had invasive ductal cancer, as well as ductal carcinoma in situe (calcifications). I had a wide local excision with sample node ( removal and they removed the tumour and the DCIS. The tumour was 2 cm and 2 out of the 8 nodes positive so I had to go back for removal of the rest of the nodes, 1 more found positive. Thank God for mammos as no-one could feel the lump which was just below the nipple. I had chemo, radiation and now on Arimidex and feeling fine. If I was you, I would insist on a biopsy as DCIS can turn into invasive and the quicker you get that stuff out the better. Good luck - my thoughts are with you. Liz.",

      "Content": "Fro Dr. Lu, thank you most sincerely for responding so quickly to my post about cording in my breast. I do have another question that you may be able to help me with. I have had moderate to severe pain in my left hip for some months now. I saw my GP who did an alkaline phosphotase blood test which came back normal. He then sent me to a local \"cottage hospital\" for a simple x-ray of the hip, which he said was also normal. He diagnosed the pain as an inflamed bursa and gave me some anti-inflammatory cream, Phorpain which doesn't even touch the pain. The pain really is worse when lying in bed and disturbs my sleep, no matter whether I lie on a side, my back or stomach. Would an ordinary x-ray show if I had bone mets? He didn't mention anything about a CT or MRI scan. I will bring this up, along with the cording problem, with my original surgeon when I see him in March, but wonder if I need to go back to the GP and ask for further tests. I am concerned about mets as my breast cancer had spread to my lymph nodes before I was dx. Although not within your field of rx, I had a blackout in October 04 which necessitated calling paramedics - I was unconscious for 30 or so minutes before they gave me oxygen. I was hospitalised overnight and had an ecg, but no eeg. My gastro thinks I may have had a mini stroke, but again I am worried about mets. Many thanks, Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, thanks for responding. I was seen last Wed in the breast care clinic - new female bc surgeon, very communicative. She sent me off for a mamo on both breasts and ultrasound on the right one. Radiographer called in Consultant Radiologist and he did another u/s. H said he didn't see anything abnormal, which I expected, as I have read that ibc does not show on these tests. Back to see surgeon who did a biopsy. Result in two weeks - that old waiting game again! She said it could be tissue changes due to rx tx. I am not convinced. I emailed Johns Hopkins' bc site and the nurse there said it would be unusual for changes due to rx to happen 3 yrs since finishing treatment. She suggested a skin punch biopsy, but don't think I had that, as the surgeon used a big needle - no local anaesthetic, and boy did it hurt. If the biopsy is inconclusive I am going to ask for a skin punch one to be on the safe side. Just praying it is either due to rx or some kind of skin infection. The white lumps that can clearly be seen on the surface bother me most. Thanks again, Liz.",

      "Content": "I was dx with invasive ductal cancer Jan 2003, stage and grade 2, 2 cm, 4/18 lymph nodes affected, had WLE, total axillary removal, 6 x FEC, 25 rads. Been on Arimidex 3 yrs. Complicated by weekly injections of 25 mg methotrexate for Crohn's, which is now under control. For some months now I noticed the breast where I had the tumour, below the nipple, is very swollen, as is the aureole. Last week I noticed a large area around the scar and at least 3\" beyond, is pink, with white noticeable lumps that have spread very fast to become long white lumps. My orginal tumour was none palpable (found on 3 yrly mammo). Hubby urged me to ring my bc nurse at the specialist breast care centre where I had my surgeries and treatment. Nurse said to see GP asp, which I did that evening. She said \"there is definitely something wrong, but I don't know what\" and typed a fax to my bc surgeon for an urgent referral, as I dressed. Nurse rang today, obviously worried at my symptoms, and said they hadn't rcvd the fax, so asked GP, who said it was definitely sent. In the meantime I have been doing all the research I can, on the internet, and it rather looks to me as if it could be inflammatory bc. Is this possible, 4 yrs after the original invasive ductal dx? If it is, what is the treatment, as I guess I can't have rx on that breast again. Has anyone else had this set of circumstances? There is so little information on my UK bc site. Many thanks for any insight and help. Liz.",

      "Content": "I had a non palpable tumour that showed on normal 3 yrly mammo and was recalled to a specialist breast care centre in the UK. They showed me the mammo and the big shadow and that is when I knew it was cancer. Apparently cysts show up differently on mammos and ultrasound. They did a compression mammo and ultrasound and immediately asked if I would have a core biopsy - heck, yes! I only felt a sharp prick as they put some local anaesthetic in the area. I don't know how much tissue they took out, but no scar at all, and it was certainly enough for the pathologist to determine I had invasive ductal cancer, as well as ductal carcinoma in situe (calcifications). I had a wide local excision with sample node ( removal and they removed the tumour and the DCIS. The tumour was 2 cm and 2 out of the 8 nodes positive so I had to go back for removal of the rest of the nodes, 1 more found positive. Thank God for mammos as no-one could feel the lump which was just below the nipple. I had chemo, radiation and now on Arimidex and feeling fine. If I was you, I would insist on a biopsy as DCIS can turn into invasive and the quicker you get that stuff out the better. Good luck - my thoughts are with you. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Drl Lu - welcome to the Board - I am sure lots of us bc survivors will have questions for you. I was dx with invasive ductal cancer, 2 cm, 3/19+ nodes in Feb 03. I had a WLE then total axillary removal. 6 x FEC, 45 rads and 2 boosters. Now on Arimidex. A few months ago I noticed a long lump in the top of the breast that had the tumour, which was below the nipple. Saw my GP who sent me to the Breast Care Centre on an urgent basis and I saw a surgeon, not the one who did my surgery. He sent me off for an ultrasound and the Radiologist said there were no tumours and that the lump was cording due to radiotherapy. As my original tumour was not palpable I have no way of knowing what a malignant tumour feels like. I had cording in my right arm after the axillary removal but have never heard of it in the breast itself. Have you come across this - just to put my mind at rest? I was discharged by the Oncology/Radiotherapy Dept in Feb 04 after completing my treatment with them. I have annual check-ups with my surgeon, next one due March 05. I would be pleased to hear your comments and whether or not I should seek further advice before March. I live in the Uk and really have no choice over who treats me on our socialised medical system. Many thanks, Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Dr. Lu - thank you such an erudite reply to my \"cording\" question. As I think I told you, I had an ultrasound at my last visit (some 3 months ago now) to the breast surgeon and radiologist. Can the radiologist tell from the ultrasound whether the palpable lump is fibrosis or a tumour? The radiologist categorically said to me there was no tumour and he would write a report to the surgeon. This was all done very quickly, within an hour or so, and it was the surgeon who, apparently, said it was cording. They don't normally give you copies of any reports in the UK, but I would imagine the surgeon got this dx from the radiologist and felt that no further tests were necessary. Can fibrosis occur more than a year after radiation? Thank you for your time. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy - thanks so much for responding - I feel like such a hypochondriac at the moment, but having dealt with chronic Crohn's for some 34 yrs I know I am not imagining things. Perhaps it is Arimidex which I have been on for about a year now. My GP is very kind, but a tad clueless about breast cancer. I just want some answers. My biggest problem is that the hospital I go to don't do 3 monthly or even 6 monthly check ups and as I said previously I was discharged from Oncology after I finished chemo and rads. My GP would have to refer me back and he seems to think he can do these tiddly little tests that are neither nought nor something. I haven't had calcium tests because he said the alkaline phosphotase test would show if I had bone mets. I think the reason he sent me for just a normal x-ray of my hip was to look for osteoarthritis. I have been on steroids most of the last 34 years and I know they can cause serious bone loss. I had a bone density test about 3 yrs ago (ordered by my gastro) and this was normal. However, about 12 yrs ago I had my only other bone density test and this showed necrosis of the hips, so I just don't know who to believe. All I know is, I have severe pain at night in my hip joint when in bed. I am fine during the day except for the odd twinge. Many thanks again for responding. I hope Dr. Lu may have some insight as to what I can do next. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Hoosier - I live in an isolated Fort on the water in Cornwall, and it takes almost 2 hours each way to get to the hospital where I am being treated - by car, ferry then car. When I was told I needed chemo I didn't think I would be able to do this journey but then I realised I would do anything to prevent a recurrence - I had invasive ductal carcinoma which had already spread. Chemo was only every 3 weeks and my elderly, disabled husband thankfully took me to every session and sat next to me whilst having the infusion. However, the thought of 5 and a half weeks of Mon-Fri radiotherapy treatments filled me with horror - I just couldn't see myself doing that awful journey and my husband was not up to all that driving.I broke down one chemo session and my breast care nurse said she would arrange volunteer transport for the rx. I had male drivers, who came right to the Fort, we picked up dialysis patientson the way to the hospital, had 3 mins treatment then had to wait up to an hour for the driver to come back and pick me up, and others, who were in a worse state than myself. It made me feel very humble. Some days it took 6 hours door to door - I took a book, a drink and some dry discuits. I am so glad now that I did it and gave myself every chance I could. Most of the drivers had lost their wives to breast cancer, and this was their way of putting something back into our socialised health care system.It is a very individual choice whether to go with rx or not, and you have every right to refuse it. Could you perhaps ask the treatment centre if they have volunteer drivers in your area? I didn't know they were available here until my nurse told me. I wish you well in the forthcoming months - the rx treament is a doddle compared with chemo, but it does make you very tired. Take care, love, Liz.",

      "Content": "Margie - thank you for your posting and sharing your experience. As Dr. Lu said, it probably is fibrosis. It's funny but I don't remember either the Radiologist or the Surgeon saying \"cording\", but my husband mentioned this expression to me some time after the consult and ultrasound. I only remember the surgeon saying that I shouldn't expect the breast to feel the same after I had chemo and radiation. I too wondered how chemo could make the breast tissue feel so radically different to my other breast. This \"cording\" happened well over a year since I finished rx and that is why I am so concerned. If it was cording I would have expected it to occur sooner, as did the cording in my arm after axillary removal. As you can feel the lump easily, I don't understand how the radiologist could say in his report to the surgeon that he knew it was not another tumour. Perhaps fibrosis and tumours look different on ultrasound. I just wish I had had the presence of mind to question the surgeon further. It never occurred to me at the time to ask for a biopsy, but when I see my surgeon in March for an annual checkup I am going to do what Dr. Lu said and ask why he doesn't think this is a recurrence and if I am not satisfied with his answer, press for a biopsy. In the meantime I think I will make an appt with my local GP - he referred me to the surgeon when he felt this new lump but I never went back to see him after the ultrasound as I didn't think he could bring anything to the party. When he referred me he asked if I wanted to see the Oncologist or the Surgeon and I chose the surgeon because all the breast cancer machinery for diagnosis is in a specialist Breast Care Centre of Excellence, whereas chemo and radiotherapy are in an entirely different part of the hospital, quite a ways away, where many different forms of cancer are treated. I think I now need to talk to the Oncologist because I have other problems, such as hip pain (GP said it is an inflamed bursa - what, for 3 months? Methinks not) and the recent blackout and unconsciousness. I am still dizzy when I get up from a sitting or laying down position. My gastro was surprised I had not been sent for a brain scan when I was taken into hospital after the blackout - all I got was an ecg for my heart which was fine. My GP can't order bone scans, CT's or MRI's - it has to go through what we call a Consultant at the hospital, but I guess he should be my first port of call now. Thank you sincerely for your help and support. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi - I had decadron as an IV infusion before my FEC chemo for invasive breast cancer in 2003. I was also given decadron tablets to take home after the chemo. I was advised it was to reduce the nausea effects of the chemo. I had no reaction like your Mum's, except extreme nausea, loss of appetite and tiredness, but put this down to the FEC chemo. Decadron is a steroid (dexamethasone) and normally induces insomnia! Because I also had Crohn's disease and had to stop my normal chemo, methotrexate, I was prescribed a 2 mg dose of decadron daily, for the four months of FEC chemo. Unfortunately, not all patients react to drugs in the same manner, but I would not think your Mum should be exposed to this drug again, considering her reaction. Sounds best idea is to get a new Oncologist. I don't understand why your mother has significant metastases if she was dx with DCIS. I had an invasive ductal tumour plus associated DCIS, intermediate grade. DCIS is confined within the breast ducts, so I am not sure how the cancer could have spread to other organs. Do you have a copy of the pathology report that was done after your Mum's mastectomies? It reads like a foreign language at first, but with the help of some internet bc sisters, I finally figured out what mine meant. This is really one of the most important pieces of information you can get. Let me know if you need help with the path report, if you have it. If you don't, I would strongly suggest your mother asks for it. Take care, Liz, in Cornwall, England.",

      "Content": "Hi Dr Leo - thank you for such a prompt response. The neurologist I saw in the ER and the Medical Admissions ward did some tests on my hands and vision and ordered an ecg, but no scan of my head and no follow-up appointment. I didn't realise then that my sense of taste and smell had disappeared as I didn't eat whilst in the hospital. I think I will ask my GP (PCP)'s wife - the nurse I am seeing about quitting smoking - if I should see him for a referral to a neurologist at the hospital. My GP can't order scans, it has to go through a consultant at the hospital. I don't know if I had a seizure as the power went out just before I blacked out and it was a few minutes until my husband could get a torch. I don't remember anything after I got up to get some candles - next recollection was being put in a wheelchair and having an oxygen mask, which was around 30 minutes after the fall. The only symptoms I have are extreme dizziness on standing up and the loss of taste/smell. I guess it was a tia, but with local spread of my bc I just wondered if it could be brain mets. Either way I need to know so I can get appropriate treatment. Liz.",

She did some more therapy today and can move my left leg a lot more without pain - now she tells me it is muscular, something to do with the piriformis muscle and a nerve being trapped there. I think she is grapsing at straws because she really wants my GP to send me for a bone scan, which he has so far ruled out. Guess I won't settle until I get a bone scan and can rule out bone mets. Thank you for being there for all of us - we should all have such a caring and compassionate doctor as you. liz.",

      "Content": "Hi Dr. Leo - my history is invasive ductal carcinoma, 2 cm, with associated intermedicate DCIS, tumour grade and stage 2. I had WLE and total axillary removal Feb/Mar 2003, 3+/18 nodes, followed by 6 x FEC and 45 rads. Finished all treatment end Nov 03. Followup with breast surgeon March 04 and mammo clear. I also have chronic Cron's - since 1970, under control now with methotrexate. Some 2 months ago I had acute erysipelas and was hospitalised; treated with erythmoycin and now clear. 10 days later I had a blackout and was unconscious for 30 mins until paramedics arrived and I was given oxygen. I was taken to hospital by ambulance and kept in for observation for 24 hrs. ecg was normal, BP 100/50 as it was with the erysipelas. I saw my gastro last week and he thinks I may have had a transient ischemic attack (my mother died of strokes) and has advised me to stop smoking - I am seeing a nurse counsellor for this on 30 Dec but have already cut to 3 a day. However, I happened to see a neighbour today, who is a GP in another town, and she was here when I had the blackout. She suggested I may have brain mets as I have no sense of smell or taste. The blackout resulted in injury to the occipital (sp?) and a boggy haematoma. Is it possible that I may have brain mets? We only get 3 yrly mammos here in England from 50 yrs, and my tumour was not palpable, so it is possible I had it for some time before diagnosis. I really do not know what to do next. I was discharged by my Oncologist in Feb 04 and am not due to see my breast surgeon for annual check up until March 05. I would be grateful for any insight you may have. Thank you for a wonderful site and all the effort you put in. Liz.",

I asked my GP (only peson I seem able to get to see) if he thought it might be arthritis and he said this would have shown on the x-ray. He doesn't see the need for a bone scan, feeling the alk blood test and x-ray were sufficient. The physio thinks it is to do with a nerve in my spine (L4 and L5 vertebrae have collaped due to long term steroid use). When I finally get my annual check up with the breast surgeon I will ask for his opinion and perhaps he can order a bone scan. I wonder if it is a side effect of Arimidex as bone/joint pains seem prevalent. Many thanks, Liz.",

She said if it is no better after this 5th therapy she will refer me back to my GP for a bone scan - she is unable to authorise it. In the meantime I have received an appt with my breast surgeon for annual check up on 19th April and will bring this to his attention. There was an article in a national UK newspaper last week detailing magnetic resonance neurography for back/hip pain, which can show nerves - it has been developed by CedarsSinai but I doubt it is available where I live, or even in the UK. As she thinks my problem is either a trapped or inflamed nerve, this would be the course to take. Thank you for your help and insight. Liz.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone had been diagnosed with cording in the breast, a year after radiotherapy? I had a 2cm invasive ductal cancer, 2 surgeries early 2003, then 6 x FEC and 45 rads, finishing treatment Nov 03. About 3 months ago I felt a long lump in the upper part of the breast which had the tumour - the tumour was below the nipple. I went to my GP and he felt it and sent me for an urgent referral to the breast care centre where I was treated. I was seen on a Sat morning, so guess it was urgent. Unfortunately the duty breast surgeon was not the one who treated me, but he was kind and communicative. He sent me off right away for an ultrasound (no mammo) and the radiologist advised there was no tumour, and the lump was due to radiotherapy. I don't even remember the surgeon telling us this, I only remember his saying that I can never expect my breast to feel the same, after chemo and rx. My husband remembered about the cording, and says I should forget about the lump, as I had very good advice from the surgeon. I have never heard of this - cording in the arm due to axilliary removal yes, but not in the breast itself. I feel such a hypochondriac and daren't go back to my GP - but the lump is still there. It wasn't there until 3 months ago and I am concerned it is a recurrence. I was grade 2, stage 2, with 3/18 nodes positive. I am not scheduled to see my own breast surgeon for an annual mammo until March 2005 and the worry of this current lump is making me sick with worry - I can't eat and am losing a lot of weight. Dr. Leo - have you heard of this cording due to rx? I would appreciate any advice from anyone to put my mind at rest. Many thanks, Liz in England.",

      "Content": "Dr. Leo - you have been very kind in the past answering my queries about a long ropey lump I found in the breast where I had invasive ductal cancer. I was seen this week by the Breast Care Centre where I was initially diagnosed - a surgeon, a radiographer, a radiologist and finally by the Director of the Centre herself, a Consultant Radiologist. Her opinion, after doing mammogram and ultrasound is that I have a thrombophlebitis in my upper breast, caused by radiotherapy. It has only taken some 9 months to get this seen but I am so relieved now that it is not a recurrence of cancer. Thank you for being there for all of us with cancer. Liz",
