    "Content": "I'm a new poster here with a question. Despite having mammograms yearly since the age of 44 (I'm now 54), I'm not sure how much of the \"armpit\" area is included. I have recently noticed a lump on my right about half way (on a diagonal) between my breast and my armpit. It can be tricky to locate at times and I really don't think it's anything serious as it feels smooth and round. I do have very dense breasts. I had a core biopsy done on the same breast, upper & outer quadrant, some years ago that was benign. Anyway my regular screening mammo is in Dec. and I was wondering if this area between the breast and the armpit will be covered? Thanks! MusellaRose",
