    "Content": "Good afternoon, I am new on this site. It has been a year since I was 1st diagnosed with IDC stage 2 HER2 ER PR positive - taking Herceptin treatments every 3 wks for 52 weeks -Feb will the end of that - also taking Tamoxiphen for 5 year plan. I opted to do the genetic testing per my oncologist request - came back that I have ATM gene mutation. Now what? I do have an apt w/genetic councelor next week that my insurance DOESN'T pay.....I think it will be worth the information to pay out of pocket for this visit BUT my ? is .....Is any one else been tested and found they have this mutation also? I would love to discuss your findings as well. I have 2 daughters 24 and 27 years and that is what my biggest concern is.... thank you very much Liz",
