    "Content": "Hi, I am 37 and currently nursing a 3 y/o. A week ago I thought my right nipple was sore from nursing, but it's really just sore. my areola is slightly swollen and if you pinch my nipple, it's thicker between my fingers then the other side which is basically just skin on skin. it hurts like hell, but is not red at all and doesn't bother me unless touched kinda hard or sucked on. I feel fine otherwise. It came on suddenly. Thank You so Much for reading, Amy",
