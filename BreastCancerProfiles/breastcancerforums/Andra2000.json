    "Content": "Hi everyone, Is there anyone out there who had Hodgkin's Lymphoma (Disease) many years ago and has had a secondary breast cancer diagnosis? I had radiation (mantle) 17 years ago for a mass next to my windpipe in my chest. This week I was diagnosed with breast cancer and am preparing for a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I would love to connect with other Hodgkin's survivors. http://btvsoloweb.com/home/index.jpg",
