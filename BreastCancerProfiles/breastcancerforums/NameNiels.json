      "Content": "Thanks for the replies so far. To add to the first post I've written above: Allthough the cancer cells in my wife's sternum still is active, the doctor is certain that the chemo must have worked since she have no other sites of spread since first detected 3 years ago. But I cannot understand why it cannot fight the cells in the sternum when it can fight the cells in the blood and keeping them from further spread. It has only been 2 months since Taxotere treatment ended and her lymph nodes behind the sternum has been enlarged allready according to the PET/CT scan done last week. Now we are very worried that it is a sign that her stable condition for the last 3 years might come to an end. That's why, looking back makes me angry that we might have prevented this if the sternum was removed from the beginning. But just as Jim says, once the cancer has spread it could be anywhere, and with that same reason the doctors says remove/reconstruct of the Sternum will be useless. But looking back, this might just have worked and our situation now would have been different. We are living in Denmark, Europe, and the doctors here are not so aggressive as what I've heard in countries such as the US, and we would like to find a location in the US that can/willing to do the removal/reconstruction of the Sternum if the doctors here refuses to do it. If anybody knows of such please let us know. Our doctors want to put my wife back on Chemo (Xeloda). If this makes the swollen node goes away, and she continues to remain spread free other than the Sternum, then we will go for the removal of the sternum and do a plastic surgury reconstruction. I am so very tired of the cancer. It is out to get the womens in my life. My wife's breast cancer was detected just 9 months after my mother's deth, also from cancer!",

      "Content": "In response to mymaria: I must admit that there are a few bright sides in our situation, compare to many other in same situation as ours in that the Danish government health care take care of all midical expences. But when confronted with seeking help in other countries, our doctors allways say that the Danish health system is amoung the best in the world. And also that there are more approved drugs in the EU than in the US. One bad thing is that we are assign to a an oncologist who pretty much ditermind the stradigy for the treatment. They fail badly with in the case of my mother, so I think it is worth to do some thinking for ourselves and take more chances. But they disagree on removing the Sternum, though strangly enough our operation doctor thinks that it might be a good idea. But our oncologist will not stop us if we want to go for it. They say that it is a bad place to operate, and in Denmark with only 5 million people there are not many such operations to create an experence doctor in the area. If we want to do so, it should be a specialist, and that's what we are trying to look for right now. I am also looking for a specialist in Europe at the same time. Thanks for listenning. ___________________ Niels",

      "Content": "Hello everybody, I am new to this forum and this is my first post. I would like to know if anyone have any experance with breast cancer that has spread to the sternum (chest bone). Specifically, if a removal or partial removal and reconstruction can/should be done? I know that once cancer has spread, it could be anywhere in the body and therefor an overall treatment such as chemo is most effective. My wife cancer was detected 2 years ago with metastasis to the sternum(no where else other than the sternum). After her first line of treatment (7 round of Chemo CEF, radiation and hormone), no new spread, but cancer in sternum remain active. She was then given 18 rounds of Taxotere over one year and Zomata, and has started another hormone theraphy. After ended Taxotere treatment, still no new spread, but still the cancer in the sternum is active. A result of a PET/CT scanning resived today 2 months after ended Taxotere treatment, suspect that the active cells in the sternum might cause a lymph node behind the sternum to swollen. We can't help but wonder that we might be cancer free now if the sternum was removed from the beginning. Our operation doctor mentioned plastic surgury for removal and reconstruction of the sternum for two years ago when she operated the lump from my wife's breast. But our Ocology doctor says its useless once spread. Now we are trying to get informations and are seriously considering it. Thanks for any help.",
