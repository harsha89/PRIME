      "Content": "Barbara K, I'm sorry to here about your case. Since the pleural fluid showed breast cancer cells, yes it would be called a recurrence of your original breast cancer. Unfortunately when cancer spreads to other areas of the body, chemotherapy is really the only treatment to control all of the disease. Radiation and surgery only help a local area, but not the whole body. Chances are you may have small microscopic areas of breast cancer that are undetectable so far. Thus, without doing more harm than good, chemotherapy is the only option left. One would have to do too much radiation to try to treat the whole body. A double mastectomy would only get rid of the cancers cells there, but not everywhere else. I hope this information helps. Best wishes,",

Why not provide a synopsis of each here in this forum? Please respond thoughtfully, as I'm looking for a succinct and sincere response. If not, then I am very close to removing this post. In the future, I suggest providing the book title and a short summary if you would think others here would be interested. Otherwise, I find your posting to be very advertising driven.

      "Content": "In regards to your symptoms, this is not uncommon complaint patients have after surgery and radiation. You had more extensive surgery on your right due to the LN dissection as well as had more RT on the right. These things can cause abnormal sensations, which may or may not resolve. The burning sensation and pain is probably due to some nerve damage, not unusual. However if the symptoms progress significantly, then you should consider re-evaluation. Tumor markers are compounds excreted by a portion of cancers, and in your case it appears these were elevated. Often these can be used to monitor for recurrence of cancer. Sometimes these will be elevated before any clinical or radiographic signs of recurrence have started. It is difficult to say what nodularities mean, especially after surgery and RT. Yes this could be signs of cancer, but this could also reminants of cancer that have died away, scar tissue from surgery & RT, or just nonspecific tissue finding that are benign. The best way to determine this is if these nodularities change over time. I'm not sure of your monitoring schedule but it often takes 3-6 mo to determine if any change is occurring. If you image to early, ex 1mo, it would be much too early unless this was a really fast growing cancer to notice any difference. And likely if it was this fast growing, you could determine this by clinical exam. If you have any concerns about the decision your medical team is making, it never hurts to discuss these with them.

      "Content": "I'd like to concur with the previous posts. Cancer that has spread beyond the primary site (metastasis) is by definition Stage IV breast cancer. It is not considered curable, but you should not lose hope. Incurable cancer can still be treated by conventional means to improve quality of life as well as extend life. Your mother should consult with her oncologists, and if she hasn't had a good experience, she should seek another physician or at least a 2nd opinion. As for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), few quality studies exist for treatment purposes. However, it can play a role as a complement to standard treatment especially in a supportive capacity such as to help with pain or stress. As stated earlier, your best option is to find a center or physician who is familiar with both treatment modalities. Remember, just because they are herbs doesn't mean they are safe. Many chemotherapies are derived from plants. So side effects and interactions can be serious. Please be careful.

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear about your Mother's situation. Breast cancer is unique in that recurrence can occur many years later after the primary has been removed. The cancer in your mother's other breast could be a new primary rather than a recurrent lesion. You would need to discuss this with your medical team. If this is the case and it was caught early, then your mother would have a good chance of cure from this 2nd primary. Another thing to consider is if this is a 2nd primary, why your mother is at risk for Breast Cancer. It could be just bad luck or it could be a genetic and/or environmental risk factors. If you're family has a history of breast, ovarian, colon or other cancers- consider genetic risk evaluation. However, if your mother has recurrence ie metastatic disease, you shouldn't lose hope. Many women with metastatic disease can liver years with the disease. With new treatments, often the cancer can be controlled. Without knowing more specifics it is difficult to say much more.
