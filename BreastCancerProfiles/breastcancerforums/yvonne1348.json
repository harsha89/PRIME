      "Content": "I go along with Linda on the special diet and the vitamins/minerals. I also watch my diet, and I'd like to think I benefit from it. No sugar, no junk food (donuts, candy, brownies, ice cream, etc), lots of fruits and veggies, plenty of fish (like salmon). I don't have the self-discipline to eliminate meat completely, though, so I eat chicken occasionally. I make sure I buy it myself (no fast food) and that the label says 99% fat free. I really watch my nutritition labels....I eat very little saturated fats and no trans fats. I take vitamins, minerals and herb supplements that are loaded with antioxidants. You can go to any vitamin store and get recommendations on those. And I do alot of brisk walking around my neighborhood every single day. Here are links to a couple articles on the benefits of walking. http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/co...ancer_Risk.asp http://walking.about.com/cs/cancerpr...nursestudy.htm It makes me feel like I'm taking some kind of positive action, instead of just swallowing my little white pill every day as you mentioned and just leaving everything to fate.

I definitely eat tons of fruit, and as many veggies as I can stand - salads, veggie platters, side dishes, etc. I just use the powder stuff as a supplement only - not in place of the real thing.

I've met or heard about a number of women who have opted for chemo as a \"preventive measure.\" I met a couple women who chose chemo, and they were both \"node negative.\" I guess it's all a personal decision that must be made with your onco, and the facts of your particular case. I just wanted to share what my onco told me. She insisted that no worthwhile oncologist would recommend having chemo as a preventative measure when the nodes were negative and the tumor under 1cm. The reasons she gave were that chemo can cause leukemia (although the odds are obviously very low), or that it can mutate any escaped cancer cells into ones that are even harder to treat. She said that at some level, the overall health risks simply outweigh the small percentage of benefit I might achieve. But she said that there are health advocates that believe that - if you aren't suffering - you aren't doing enough to help yourself. But as I said, this is a very individual decision that must be made with your own doctor. I guess the leukemia risk really struck a chord with me. Twice in my life, I've had a medical condition that only strikes a tiny percentage of the population. I'm not naive enough to believe \"that isn't going to happen to me!!\" Instead of having preventive chemo (I was node negative and small tumor), I've chosen instead to take Tamoxifen, have my ovaries removed, observe a strict low fat diet, take every antioxidant vitamin & herb supplement known to man, and walk half-hour a day....and hope for the best.

      "Content": "I'm fortunate to live in a warm climate. Most nights, the weather is pleasant enough that I can walk around the neighborhood. I bought a gym membership though, so when it's really cold out I go to my gym and walk on the treadmill....even if I do nothing else. I try to be really \"religious\" about walking everyday. As far as vitamins and such....here's what I take. First of all, I take a major mega-vitamin everyday of course. I also have dietary powder supplements that I drink with water. One is called \"Ruby Reds\" and supposedly has vitamins, minerals, freeze-dried fruits & vegetables, and probiotic antioxidants. I take one tablespoon of that stuff in water each morning, along with my other vitamin pills. In the evening I drink a powder supplement that has \"greens\" (supposedly 6 servings of veggies - If I get even one or two servings out of it, then it pays for itself). It tastes like lawn clippings. With my powder dietary drinks, I take a major multivitamin, as well as a B-complex, Vitamin E, Lecithin, organic mushroom tablets, Citracal, Selenium, Omega 3-6-9 fish oil tablets, and Grape Seed Extract. I dump a tablespoon of Flax Oil into my breakfast cereal, and into my daily yogurt. I may be overdoing it on the vitamins, but if it contains an antioxidant, I take it. Yvonne",

      "Content": "I was dx in March this year with DCIS in my right breast, at least 5 cm. No positive nodes, but they never got clean margins. Had a total mastectomy on 5/17/05. The news was devastating, of course. I opted for a total mastectomy because it covered such a big area, but I remember thinking it seemed pretty radical for something that is supposedly \"pre-cancerous!\" I had reconstruction, and all things considered, my breasts look very good (had the other side done also, as you can see from my sig). I have a temporary expander on both sides, and I'm in the process of having them expanded to the size I want. This will probably take some weeks, because they can only put in so many cc's per week. Eventually, they'll replace the expanders with silicon implants. The doc will also create fake nipples and tattoo them the appropriate color. I had a latissimus dorsi flap on both sides, so I have scars on my back that will be hidden by my bra. The breasts don't feel the same as real ones of course..... Let me know if you have any other questions, I'll be glad to share any info I have!",

      "Content": "Nobody - male or female - should EVER disregard a lump. You're young, and there's an 80% chance it's benign. But you DO want to have it checked out. Don't let anyone gaff you off because you're young or male! Make sure it get's biopsied! I'm not sure what to tell you about how to get medical care....I'm in southern california, and I go to UCSD. They have one of the country's leading cancer centers there. Perhaps you can call and get some guidance. It's the Moores Cancer Center - Toll Free at (866) 773-2703. There's another great website sponsored by the Y-Me National Breast Cancer Organization. They have a 24-hour toll free phone number where you can call and talk to a counselor. The number is (800) 221-2141, and the link is http://www.y-me.org/hotline/default.php. Finally, I also suggest you log on the Susan B. Komen Website. Their message board is VERY busy, and there's bound to be someone who can give you better suggestions. The link is: http://www.komen.org/forums/modules/forums/Default.aspx Good luck to you!!! Make SURE you get it checked!!! Yvonne",
