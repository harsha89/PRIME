    "Content": "Hi, My mom was actually suffer in breast cancer 2 years back at the moment she got \u0094 diffuse spine skeleton metastases\u0094. The doctors told that this disease can\u0092t be cure only we can extend it for some time that too by giving the radiation and chemotherapy .I want to know how much days we can prolong if we give the treatment. And also my mom is so emotional she can\u0092t bare that she is suffer in spine skeleton metastases and she can\u0092t bare with the radiation or chemo because my dad is also died due to cancer. she know definite pain on cancer treatment. So please guide me someone I am very confused . I mean 2 suggestions below which one to follow to keep my mom happy until her last days . Suggestion 1: If I give treatment for my mom whether she doesn\u0092t get pain until her last day in earth or will get pain in last stages even if she gets treatment. or Suggestion 2: If I hide that she is having cancer and fine with everything and having only normal back pain and getting some pain killer tablet for her. So that she would be very happy . Will leave me without any frustration and stress in her last days . (whether the normal pain killer is enough to mask her back pain, please suggest me I am the only son to my mom to take care) Thanks, Jayakumar Natarajan",
