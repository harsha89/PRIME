      "Content": "I too opted for a double mastectomy in 2004. I was scheduled to have immediate reconstruction but they couldn't find the expanders as I was getting ready to go into surgery ... long story. I had reconstruction last August but the surgeon decided not to use expanders --- didn't work. I had those implants taken out and now have expanders in. The results are much better, my right almost feels like my own breast but some scar tissue on the left has kept the expanders from \"growing\" to the same size as my right. I've only had one fill and my plastic surgeon says that will correct itself in time. I certainly wasn't glad to have had to go through the additional surgery (I still have one more to go). I've never been a vain person but I didn't like wearing the prothesis. There were a lot of my clothes that I couldn't wear and swimming wasn't happening. Yes, I am thankful I was a Stage T1a and have a long life to look forward to. I just wanted to feel \"normal\" in my clothes. The decision is an individual and you should do what you feel is best for you. I wish you luck, God Bless.",

I was diagnosed T1a with a very aggressive cancer but because I opted for a bilateral and I was ER/PR negative but Her2 3+ my oncologist didn't recommend any treatment. She said Herceptin has cardiovascular side effects and the risk / benefit ratio wasn't worth it. While I know statistically my chance of recurrence is slim I still wonder and worry. I don't dwell on it but the what if's do cross my mind. I don't really talk to my family about my thoughts. I want to \"let go' and move on but maybe it's too soon. Once I hit the one year mark maybe it will become easier to feel like a survivor.

      "Content": "I went to the site and posted but I'm never sure posts get where they are intended to go. I for one appreciated your sharing the photos. I am going to have implants (this suregeon doesn't recommend expanders for me) this summer. I've been to 3 PS. The first two were going to use expanders. The first one failed to provide the expanders at the time of my bilateral mastecomies (they went missing). The second PS was more into the asthetics and made me feel like I would end up with good results but alas, my insurance wouldn't cover him (off plan) and I couldn't afford the 10K ou of pocket. This PS wants to go ahead with implants to create \"mounds\" I was intrigued by how different physicians practice, both in procedures and in the way they present things to a patient. I am a nurse and can usually get past personalities but since my dx I guess I'm al ittle more sensitive than I used to be. Hopefully I will have surgery within the next couple of months. In the meantime I am mostly ok with the prothesis. I am going with my sister to a spa this weekend. I am anxious about getting into a bathing suit to go into the jacuzzi. My prothesis aren't made for hot water, nor does my suit have pockets to hold them. I guess I'll just put on a tee over my suit . Unfortunately I am not a small person and not having breasts to counter the rest of my body makes me look pregnant. Working on the stomach but have a way to go. I read an article called inner cleavage recently and it really gave me a kick in the pants ( was feeling sorry for myself). I gave up my breasts for life...now I am going to live it and be thankful I can. Enough rambling. Doing the Race for the Cure next weekend. This will be the first time I've worn a pink shirt doing the race. So many women die every year from this disease - we MUST find a cure! Wish you all health and peace.",

We were the only two women in the jacuzzi at the time and everyone who works at the spa were wonderful. I got over myself thanks to my wonderful caring sister. As for the Race for the Cure, there were over 23,000 participants today. It was a beautiful day, beautiful people. All too many In Memory of signs. We need to beat this #$%^&U* disease. I am especially moved by the younger survivors. I can't imagine being hit with bc when my kids were small. No time is a good time for diagnosis for sure but especially then.",

He's not going to use tissue expanders, just implants. My original surgeon left a lot of skin. I am not a canidate for other surgical reconstruction options, only the implants. My question is ... can you build up pectoral muscles? Two PS have told me no but then you see these body builders with large pectoral muscles.

      "Content": "Hi Kaz, I know this is a horrible time for you, worrying and wondering. I had microcalcifications and ended up with a sterotactic bx. It really was ok, not too uncomfortable. You lay on a table that has a hole your breast falls into. They \"clamp\" the breast and look at live pictures so they can see where they need to go. They take multiple biopsies about the size of a pencil lead ---- but only after you are numbed. I had a wonderful nurse who explained everything before it happened. Once I was diagnosed I opted for a bilateral. I had a biopsy on the opposite breast three years previous for calcifications and my mother had Paget's disease which is a form of cancer of the breast. Also, my total area was >5CM and I am older so a bilateral seemed the most sensible. I wish you luck and know that you are among a very caring and sharing group of women on this website. Don't be afraid to ask quesitons. Write your questions down, if indeed you have BC (and you may not!) start a diary, take a familymember/friend with you to visits ... another pair of ears is priceless, Bless you!",
