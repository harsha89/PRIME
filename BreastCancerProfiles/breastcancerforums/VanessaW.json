    "Content": "I am writing a novel based on the experience of a close friend of mine, about a woman recovering from breast cancer. I have posted the first 6 chapters at www.abq76.dial.pipex.com . It would be wonderful to get feedback from you, all opinions welcome. I am committed to an accurate portrayal, but also a message of hope for the future. I look forward to hearing from you. Vanessa",
