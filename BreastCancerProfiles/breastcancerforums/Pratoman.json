      "Content": "Curious for some feedback on this situation for my wife.... Lumpectomy + radiation in 1986 - age 36 1990 new cancer in same breast, so mastectomy Cancer free since. Annual monitoring of markers, always showed normal readings, in the 20's. Then about 3 1/2 years ago, jumped to 35, so doc started checking markers every 3 months. Numbers fluctuated between 35-42, up and down, no trend. After one year of this, doc felt it was just her new baseline, but still warranted watching. So for the last 2 1/2 years she has been testing every 6 months and it is consistently in the 30;s, last reading 32. No symptoms whatsoever. Anybody ever see this before, anybody have an opinion or any thoughts? Is the doc being too cautious at this point? She does not handle this stuff well and these appointments are hell for her (No doubt that is not unique). After 3 1/2 years of no trend, and no symptoms, how safe would it be to assume that this is not a sign of something brewing? Especially after 25 years of being disease free (knock wood a million times) EDIT: All other tests, including CA-125, normal",

      "Content": "I have an issue i hope someone can shed some light on. Wife had BrC in late 80's (age 37) and again in 1991. Two separate cancers, diff pathology. Same breast. First time lumpectomy and rad, second time mastectomy. She has been disease free ever since. At first her follow up visits were every 3 months, then every six months, then at 5 years once a year. Till about 5 years ago. Her CA 15-3 which had always been in the 20's, jumped (actually i think trended) into the 30's, high thirties, then as i recall low 40's. With the first jump above 32, which Onco calls the normal range, he started watching her more closely, every three months. Thats when it moved to mid thirties, then low 40;s. Then back to high 30's, At that point he moved the visits to every 6 months, because he felt that it was nothing, just her new normal. Then if i recall, it went back to 40, then dropped to mid 30's. and has more or less stayed there for a few years. The last two readings, which were 6 months ago, and this week, were both the same, at 33. It has now been 4-5 years since this all started. Still no symptoms, and no sign of a rising trend. But the Onco, wants her to continue to come in every six months. I just wonder about this. It seems to me if this were something that needed to be watched, we would have seen something more after 4-5 years. But i am not a Dr so we just follow his instructions. BTW the original Dr that she was seeing who moved it to one year visits, has since retired and the one she is seeing now is his son. Seems very competent. We trust him, and my wife doesnt want to change because she knows him. I just wonder why at this point we dont move back to one year. When i ask, he just says, to be careful, leave it at 6 months for the forseeable future. These visits and tests are so stressful for her, I;m sure i dont have to explain that to anyone here. Thats why i wish he would move it to 1 year. I have done a lot of reading, i know that CA 15-3 is controversial as to its value, and i know that some drs do not use it. But her Doc does, so we go with i. Any experience, or thoughts on this?",
