    "Content": "Hi Everyone. So my friend's mom has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm looking for a site where I can create a community to support my friend, she's been really stressed out lately. Is there one that has more functionality than just managing tasks and posting messages? Like inviting friends through Facebook for support and where you can gift money? I really want to be able to help her out and I feel the only way she'll accept it is if I just do it. I ask all the time and she just says she's stressed, but is handling it. I know that I personally have not had much experience with this, but I felt that this forum would really be able to help me with all the resources and knowledge of others who have experienced it. Thank you all so much.",
