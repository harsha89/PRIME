I have a special interest in this field and I am wondering if assays on cell clusters of cells are accepted by the regulatory instances? How are the challenges with integrating such assays in HT screening addressed? Looking forward to responses, Best regards, Francis Upgrading clinical therapy by using drug sensitivity assays measuring cell-death of 3 dimenionsl microclusters of live \"fresh\" tumor cells can improve the conventional situation by allowing more drugs to be considered.",
