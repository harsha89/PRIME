Are you worried? afraid? Cancer by simple definition is abnormal/immature rapidly growing cells. Every day count towards prognosis. Call now and go NOW!",

      "Content": "Breast density is a major risk and yes, with family history that strong, annual mammograms with religious self breast exams and clinical breast exams is warranted. Look for places that offer Automated Breast Ultrasound System (ABUS) scanning or Automated Breast Volume System Ultrasound (ABVS). These are accurate automated ultrasound scanning systems for dense breast tissue. Mammogram would miss is many times while these technologies would catch it early in dense tissued women. Ultrasound (regular) is very accurate but the problem is that the results are dependent on thee experience of the technician. Big room for human error",
