      "Content": "Thank you. My wife and I were regular drinkers a gin and tonic when we first got homw from work. A shared bottle of wine over dinner and a nightcap of a rum and coke. That was our regime nightly. Initially she has cut back to maybe a single drink each day but after 6 rounds of FEC100 she is allowing the adys that she has a few drinks to become more common. I simplyneed to know chemo is still working in the background. The fact that a drink in the evening helsps her to relax has definite benefits...

And, \"a glass\" = \"one glass\" And, only during the middle off week of chemo. The reason given is that you need your liver and kidneys during chemo to handle the chemo, and don't want alcohol to interfere. Pastor Rich",
