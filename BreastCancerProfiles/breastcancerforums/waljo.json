That was our regime nightly. Initially she has cut back to maybe a single drink each day but after 6 rounds of FEC100 she is allowing the adys that she has a few drinks to become more common. I simplyneed to know chemo is still working in the background. The fact that a drink in the evening helsps her to relax has definite benefits...

When we took the chemo class, the onc. nurse said the same thing. It doesn't mean totally. Special occasions, like Christmas, have a glass of wine or beer but no hard liquor. And, \"a glass\" = \"one glass\" And, only during the middle off week of chemo. The reason given is that you need your liver and kidneys during chemo to handle the chemo, and don't want alcohol to interfere. Pastor Rich",
