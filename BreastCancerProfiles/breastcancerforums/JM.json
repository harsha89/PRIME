I thought it may have resulted from the nerve damage from all the nodes removed in my arms. Also, I have two large scars from the tumor removal, which I thought may have contributed to skin sensitivity I get that burning under both arms and on the side of my torso near where the skin meets with the underarm. It is bad when I prespire,and it is especialy painful for any clothing to come in contact with my skin, especialy on my left side. I didnt make the connection between that and tamoxifen though. I just started on tamoxifen in April, this coming October will be my one year since surgery. Jan",

Does this sound correct? I start dose dense chemo this afternoon, four rounds A/C over the next 8 weeks followed by 4 rounds taxol over another 8 weeks. I just turned 45 a few weeks ago. Had hysterectomy in 1998 for fibroids and endometriosis. Just wondering if anyone was told that, since I've seen it posted that way on the Internet. thanks, Jan",

My treatment is chemo every other Monday with a Neulasta shot on Tuesday. The chemo plan is 4 AC followed by 4 Taxol followed by radiation and then hormone treatment. I don't think this plan has changed much as I've heard of others who were on same schedule. I had stage 3 C invasive lobular in both breasts, but the treatment is the same whether it was found in one or both breasts at time of diagnosis. Hope this was helpful, Jan",

      "Content": "Greetings all, I recently got an email from someone who mentioned that lobular carc. can have all typical mets that ductile cancer can have plus higher incidence of mets to gastrointestinal areas and bone. I did a quick search online and see that when lobular mets to bone, it can appear osteolytic, which is to say it can appear more as swiss cheese or holes and not be obvious for mets. It can be misdiagnosed as osteopoikilosis. Anyone else heard of this? Seems this could cause misdiagnosis if radiologist isn't aware of the patient having lobular carcinoma that can look different it it goes to the bone. I had bone scan 3 years ago that came back with unusual spots all over my bones, thought to be possibly osteopoikilosis. Saw Ortho. specialist who didn't think it was anything more than a radiological oddity. Then, last Sept. I am dx with bilateral lobular bc stage 3C for each breast. Just had bone scan in june, came back as one line report that said no evidence of bone metastasis. Now I'm wondering if maybe it is bone mets. What are the chances that I would have possible dx of osteopoikilosis and be diagnosed two years later with a type of breast cancer that can have bone mets that can appear as osteopoikilosis, and not have bone mets? Just curious if anyone has heard of unusual bone mets with lobular cancer and interested in any opinions. Thanks, Jan",

My hair started to break off some a few weeks back and my husband gave a buzz cut. I still had a full head of hair but it was cut very short. Now, it is actually starting to grow. I asked the nurse practitioner at the onc. office about it and she had no explaination. She rubbed my scalped and said something about very strong hair follicles. Does anyone thing there is a correlation between not losing hair and chemo not working? I'm trying to not sound paranoid but everyone has said I would lose my hair within 5 to 21 days post 1st chemo and I am well beyound that. Anyone else not lose their hair on A/C? On the plus side, I will be half way done with chemo after tomorrow, which I appreicate as I am having a hard time with nausea and fatigue. Thanks for any input, Jan",

      "Content": "AA Totally agree with you on this one! I haven't had health insurance since I got laid off and took care of my dad while he fought his losing battle with kidney cancer back in 2001. Still, as a woman who is in her early 40's I paid every year for my annual exam and also for a mamo. Every year I was told all was good. I have invasive lobular carcinoma now. Diagnosed Sept 2004. I have 2 primary cancers, one in each breast. I am stage 3C in each breast with extensive nodal involvement. If I had known that not all breast cancers show up on a mamo I would have paid for the ultrasound too. Why do testing that only covers some of the group and not all of the group? I have told my 2 sisters to have both done and I tell everyone I meet to do the same. No one in the medical community that I have talked to agrees with me, they don't see the need for ultrasound screening unless there is a problem. Well, I just finished my 6th of 8 chemo treatments yesterday, then radiation tx, then hormone treatments and with all of that statistically I am still in the 50% 2 year survival rate, so I think I have a better perspective on the importance of these tests. Just my 2 cents worth. Jan",

      "Content": "I was horrified when I met with the surgeon after my bilateral modified mastectomies and learned how extensive my breast cancer was. I was in a fog for a few days and then moved on. I just had my 7th round of chemo yesterday. I am on an dose dense regimen, every other monday for 8 treatments. I had four rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxin and have had 3 of 4 rounds of taxol. I drank too much water the day before, the day of and the day after my first chemo and had horrible side effects from that. For the next 3 rounds with A/C I was very sick for the first week, I couldn't get any anti-nausea medicines to work. I was tired and my eyesight was blurry. I had headaches from the steroid that is also given. It was cruddy but not impossible. I still have my hair though. Sometime between my 2nd and 3rd chemo it started to break off about 1 inch from my scalp and was making a mess around the house. I had my husband buzz cut me, like GI Jane, and that's the way it has stayed. If I had known it wasn't going to all fall out I wouldn't have done the buzz cut. Live and Learn. The taxol is much easier than the A/C. My main side effects are upset stomach and bone pain, which has gotten worse with the Nuelasta shot and Taxol together. I have pain meds for it and so I never thought to discontinue treatment. I'm tired a bit, but that is managable too. I also went into a chemically induced menopause and I am hot and cold all night long. I don't get a solid nights sleep mostly due to the hot and cold, but also because I have a port on my right side of my chest that is uncomfortable to sleep on and I have severe bone pain in my left hip if I lay on it for more than about 30 minutes. I hope this doesn't sound too horrible. It isn't good but it is do-able. The fears subside as you move along the different steps in the process. I hope this is helpful for you and good luck with your chemo, Jan Age 45",

      "Content": "Hi OrionRose, I have bilateral,(both breasts), Stage 3 C lobular carcinoma. I was dx in Sept. 2004. One breast has a 12 cm tumor, the other had a 9 cm tumor. (about 5\" and 3.5\" respectively). I also had a total of 37 lymph nodes removed from both arms, of which 34 were positive for cancer. I had a full mastectomy, no choice there. That was followed by \"dose-dense\" A-C-T chemo, which means every other week for 8 rounds. A month off then on to radiaton. Between my fair skin and the effects of radiation in many women who have been on Adiamyacin, my skin melted and I was in pain for several weeks as the burns healed. (You will be on top of this though if your mom needs radiation, so you'll be able to prevent what I wasn't). My tumors were both ER+ and PR+ and HER2-. I was 44 at diagnosis and started on Tamoxifen in April 2005. I am still taking the tamoxifen. I have not had a recurrance, although I do suffer many side effects from the treatments of my cancer, not the actual cancer itself. I'm still in my 40's but there are days when I feel I must be in my 80's. And, because of the tamoxifen, I'm always having hot flashes or drippy sweats, no matter what other medicines I have tried to counter act it. And yet, I am grateful to be well enough to \"complain\" about my side effects. My cancer was diagnosed in what is refered to as an Advanced Stage. Some in the medical community don't buy the Stage 3C, and feel, that because of the number of lymph nodes involved, I am a Stage 4. Either way, I'm alive and have survived longer than some of the original doctors I met gave me hope for. I hope your mom's cancer is not extensive. I didn't read your post about her diagnosis and I don't really follow this list. I just came across it because I randomly did a search today on lobular cancer. Best of luck to you and your family.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in Sept 04 with advanced stage Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. I had yearly mamo's and now know that mamo's are great at detecting ductile carcinoma due to the calcification but mamo's are poor at picking up lobular carcinoma. I have two sisters who are getting ready for their yearly mamo's. I have suggested to each of them that they also get an ultrasound, which is good at detecting lobular carcinoma but not good at detecting ductile carcinoma. One of my sister's doctors agrees with that course of action. The other doctor, in another state, has prescribed an MRI instead. Long story short, will an MRI pick up both types of breast cancer? Thanks for your time and effort with this list, I really do appreciate it. Jan M (just finished 7th round of chemo, Taxol, about 1 hour ago, with only 1 treatment left. Looking forward to the short break befor radiation begins).",

      "Content": "Thanks Dr. Leo for your speedy reply. I should have indicated that my concern was for after all my treatments are done, say one year from now for a non cancer related routine blood test. I had many nodes removed bilaterally and was advised to use legs for blood pressure, thighs or butt for needles and feet for IV's. No one advised on what I do for blood draws. Say for a regular checkup for cholesterol or what ever any md down the road might need blood for. Prior to having my port most techs looked at me in horror when I suggested drawing blood from my foot, but can anyone other than an RN or MD access a port? If not, how do people with no \"good arm\" have blood drawn? Also, prior to having the port I did have IV's in foot and that was very painful, even with the emla cream. So, what will I do in the future regarding this, especially if I develop lymphedema? Thanks, Jan",

      "Content": "Hi Shelley, I was diagnosed in September with bilateral breast cancer, so I had no choice but to have double mastectomy. I had that done on October 20th. I was pretty medicated but I do remember laying my arm across my chest just after my surgery at not feeling the warmth of my breasts. It was a strange and sad feeling that I quickly got over considering I was now fighting for my life. I had extensive nodal involvement on both sides and large tumors as well. My first chemo treatment was November 22nd, which was 4 and one half weeks post surgery. I had a port put in a few days before, and because of the bilateral mastectomy, there wasn't really a place to insert the port that wasn't already traumatized from the initial surgery. As a result, even though I've had the port for over two weeks now, the area is bruised and still sore. I went to surgeon for follow up visit yesterday and he said, I'm just taking a longer time than usual to heal, but I did have alot of damage done with the bilateral. So, for you, hopefully the recovery time will be shorter. My first chemo was not good but it wasn't as bad as I had expected. My dad had it alot worse for his renal cell chemo treatments. I felt yucky through Thanksgiving weekend, but feel good this week. I still have my hair, but expect to lose it by Monday the latest, when I have my second round of chemo. I have chemo every other Monday as part of a dose-dense protocol. As far as the emotional roller coaster goes, I'm on it. 99% of the time I'm just moving forward and going with the flow. 1% of the time I am in my shower as the tears roll down my face. I couldn't afford reconstruction and sometimes when I look in the mirror it all comes rushing over me and it is more than I can bare. I don't have this feeling too often because I force myself to move on. I turned 45 after my surgery and before my first chemo. I was going to school part time and working part time so I didn't have health insurance. I hope I was able to help you in some way. Take care,",

      "Content": "Hi I've just read a few posts on radiation tx and I just finished last week. I was dx this past October '04. Had a double MRM. I had 9cm tumor and 16+ nodes on right side, stage 3C and also 12 cm tumor and 18+ nodes on left side, stage 3C. I had dose dense AC/T then a 4 week break and started 7 weeks of rad tx, 5.5 weeks of external with bolus where I was to be hit from 3 angles on both sides from top of each collar bone down to bottom of ribcage and from under each armpit down the side and across the chest, on each side. Plus the standard 1.5 weeks of electron boost to each scar line. Each tx lasted about 40 minutes from when I actually got into the machine and they started coloring. I was to finish rad tx on May 16,2005 but at end of week 5 of tx, a Friday afternoon around 7pm, of course, I developed third degree burns on both collar bones, under both armpits and down the sides and across the upper part of my chest. I had second degree burns along the bottom of my ribcage on both sides. There was oozing and bleeding and I could count 5 layers of missing skin under both arms and across the top of my chest on both sides. It was so bad and painful I was sedated for much of it. I had to be medicated to change my bandages, 5X per day, and to take a shower each day to wash off the dying skin and old medication. It was horrible. Having said that I am grateful that science has made it possible to have treatments for me and I WOULD DO THE RAD. TX AGAIN if I had it all to do over. I need to give myself the best chance I have. I was worried that I might get skin cancer when this was all done, my rad onc. said I had burns of someone who had survived a house fire, it was painful but that it would heal and that I didn't have to worry about skin cancer or any cancer returning to those areas that had been radiated. I don't want to scare anyone but I think it needs to be known that while rad tx are usually a breeze from a pain perspective, sometimes people can have bad reactions. I am fair skinned and 45 years old. My rad onc. said that having chemo of AC/T made my skin more vulnerable and that was why we waited 4 weeks after chemo ended before we began rad tx. I finished my last tx last Wed, June 1st. I have since developed second degree burns on my chest and scar lines. It hurts some, but it isn't intolerable and, I know, it will get better. The worst is behind me and I am just looking to feel better soon. Hope this is helpful, Jan",

Since I had bilateral mast. with nodes removed from both sides I'm concerned about lymphedema.

So, I was just thinking I would leave the port in, even though it still bothers me and it's been three weeks since I had it inserted. If I remove the port, how do I do blood draws that md or health care providers may want with annual check up or for other medical reasons? (Sorry I haven't posted in a bit, I just finished 2nd round of chemo, go every other Monday on dose dense protocol and it really takes it toll on me Tue pm thry Sat am)",

He says I see him 3X per year for first year than 2X per year after that. Follow up care is blood work only. No, PET, CT, bone or MRI scans are done. He says that scans are not typically done for breast cancer and that the blood work and any symptoms I might notice on my own are enough? I'm 45 years old now and how do I know if this pain in my hip is a bone met or the beginning of arthritis?I'm curious as to what other follow up procedures some other oncologists have prescribed.

      "Content": "Hi JJ5, I haven't been to this site in some time now, but I happen to see your post tonight and I wanted to share this with you. My pathology report showed that I had 34 positive lymph nodes. I was so devasted when I read that report. I was diagnosed in between two hurricanes in Sept 2004. One month later, I had a double mod. rad mast. Turns out I had a 12 cm tumor in one breast and a 9 cm tumor in the other. No one thought I had long to live. I went through a full load of treatments and here I am two and a half years later. I have alot of physical limitations in my upper body now as a result of my surgery and radiation burns, but I have come to a leveling off of sorts. I have slowly come to learn what my \"new normal\" is and I hope that in time you will too. I haven't met any other person who had tumors as large as mine and with as many positive nodes, but I'm sure they are out there. MM is right. As time goes by cancer isn't the main focus anymore, at least for me. For the first year or so after my diagnosis I was in cancer world and it was all cancer all the time. I didn't know what else to talk about. Now, I do think about it, as I have physical issues to deal with, but it does seem like it was someone else who went through it. It's kind of fuzzy in spots now. I don't know if I've been of any help or comfort to you. All I can say is hang in there, get the treatment you need and know that one day, down the road, you will find your new normal. Best wishes, JM",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, Glad to hear you are feeling so well after surgery. Good for you. As far as when chemo begins I can only tell you of my experience, I had bilateral MRM on Oct 20, 2004, had surgical port inserted Nov. 18th, (that area is still sore when I move certain ways), and started chemo on Monday Nov. 22. I have chemo every other Monday. So, for me, chemo started about 1 month post op. Not sure what kind of surgery you had but mine was pretty extensive so I needed the 4 weeks to recoup, actually would have preferred more time between the surgery and the port insertion as that area was and still is very bruised. I can't imagine that you would start chemo before January. I hope this was helpful, Jan",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, Glad to hear you are feeling so well after surgery. Good for you. As far as when chemo begins I can only tell you of my experience, I had bilateral MRM on Oct 20, 2004, had surgical port inserted Nov. 18th, (that area is still sore when I move certain ways), and started chemo on Monday Nov. 22. I have chemo every other Monday. So, for me, chemo started about 1 month post op. Not sure what kind of surgery you had but mine was pretty extensive so I needed the 4 weeks to recoup, actually would have preferred more time between the surgery and the port insertion as that area was and still is very bruised. I can't imagine that you would start chemo before January. I hope this was helpful, Jan",

      "Content": "Good morning listmembers, I was just thinking about a passing comment my surgeon made last month when reviewing my pathology report. He said that all of my axillary lymph nodes felt hard, like small jelly beans, where most are usually somewhat squishy. Sine I had 18+/23 on left side and 16+/16 on right I assumed that the hardness was the result of the lymph nodes containing the cancer cells. Does anyone think there is some relevance to hard vs. soft cancerous lymph nodes? Just curious, Jan M",

      "Sample": "My first chemo treatment was November 22nd, which was 4 and one half weeks post surgery. I had a port put in a few days before, and because of the bilateral mastectomy, there wasn't really a place to insert the port that wasn't already traumatized from the initial surgery....I don't have this feeling too often because I force myself to move on. I turned 45 after my surgery and before my first chemo....My surgeon also recommened against reconstruction at the time of my surgery because of the extensive involvement of my cancer. I just started chemo tx yesterday, and I will also need to have radiation to my chest wall....I had a port put in a few days before, and because of the bilateral mastectomy, there wasn't really a place to insert the port that wasn't already traumatized from the initial surgery. As a result, even though I've had the port for over two weeks now, the area is bruised and still sore....I had bilateral lobular carcinoma. My surgeon also recommened against reconstruction at the time of my surgery because of the extensive involvement of my cancer....",
