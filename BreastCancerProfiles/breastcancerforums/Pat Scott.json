      "Content": "Hi, my name is pat. I'm sixty.I was diagnosed the end of may last year,2004.I had a hysterectomy in 1988.It was ductal carcinoma.ES was positive.Stage was 3A my tumor was 9cm.I had a radical mastectomy followed by Chemo, cytoxin and taxoteer. My question is what could happen with out radiation.My surgeon and my oncology Dr.s insisted I have it, but The radiation Dr. after a CT scan said I was not a cantidate.He fears for my skin, I have Lupus, and my heart. He said the way my rib cage is shaped the radiation would hit my heart. So where does this leave me? I see my oncologist in three weeks and he is putting me on tamoxifin (spelling). Am I likely to have a recurance. Waiting for a reply Pat[/quote]",

      "Content": "Thanks Barbara for your reply. My Dr. was also worried about me getting serious burning abd the soars not healing. A simple sunburn caused an awful flare up of the lupus abd moved into my parotid glans and started my sjogrens syndrome. my skin is very sensitive and I know the Rad Dr. had my welfare in mind, he had also consulted his colegues(sp) and my Rheumatologist before he made the decision not to Radiate me. I just wonder how suseptible I am to more cancer without the radiation. Is this a death certificate or what? I don't mind not having it, but where does it leave me? I really appreciate your reply, it validates what my Dr. had told me. Thanks Pat",
