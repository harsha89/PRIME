    "Content": "I know that Tamoxifen is typically perscribed for breast cancer. I will begin this drug shortly however, I have been battling stage 4 ovarian cancer. Mine is a rare form, only in about 2% of patients (stromel cell). They want to begin Tamoxifen upon completion of chemo (5th tomorrow - 1 more to go). I am writing this board to see what the common side effects of this drug will be. Not because I won't take it, just want to be prepared. I think my biggest question is, I lost my hair during chemo, will it grow back if using this drug? If not... I gotta get some wigs!",
