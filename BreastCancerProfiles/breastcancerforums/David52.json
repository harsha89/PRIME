      "Content": "Cinders: I think it should be possible to do yur surgery and get tx recommendations from a large cancer center, and then get the actual treatment at your local cancer center. My treatments were for the most part designed by my doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City (6 hours away), but at least some of my actual treatments were done at home, at our local oncology center. My guess is, where possible, major centers try to work with local ones. Good luck with your tests.....hopefully, the results will be benign so that you don't have to worry about any oncology treatments. Am keeping my fingers crossed for you! Hugs, David",

      "Content": "Niki: I am very sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I am a lymphoma guy, and do not know a lot about breast cancer. Lots of people here do, however, and I am sure you will be hearing from many of them. In the meantime, while it is perfectly natural to be terrified, maintaining a positive attitude is so important. Fortunately, as you go through the process of meeting with your oncologists and nailing down the fundamentals of your treatment plan, the terror you feel now will likely be replaced for the most part by your determination to see this thing through and get to the other side in good health. That is eminently possible these days, and you are young and otherwise in good health I bet. So hang in there, and keep us all posted on how all is going. In the meanwhile, lots of hugs and good karma to you. David",
