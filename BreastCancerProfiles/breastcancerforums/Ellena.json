      "Content": "Hi there All - I had a double mastectomy & immediate reconstruction in May 09 and had suffered with seroma's in back where the latissimus dorsi muscles were removed - after several very traumatic aspirations of the two sites, my surgeon eventually tried a steroid injection into each site and I must say that this has worked a treat !!!! On my front though, above my left 'breast' I've had a hematoma which keeps recurring and is unsightly and painful, preventing me from moving on now... This week he drained it once again and injected steroid into it, unfortunately within 2 days I can see that this is not working as well as on the back. On a positive front though - I was so unsure about having the complete double/double operation and as these are so seldom done, I was not able to contact anyone who had had this procedure..... BUT ..... I can assure anyone who is about to go through it, or thinking of the options.... Go For It !!! I found it to be absolutely wonderful, if that's at all possible... ??? Hope to make some new friends and share all our stories !! Hugs Ellena xxx",
