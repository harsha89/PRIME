    "Content": "Hello everyone, I am new to this site and to the world of cancer, recently diagnosed with breast cancer at age 45. It's very small 1.1mm in size and only in the (R) breast. I have had so many options thrown at me; it's overwhelming. My surgery is set for March 25th (next week) I hope I am making the right decision, I chose bilateral mastectomy they are also talking 2-3 nodes. I was advised I don't have to go this extreme, but I think I just want to be done with this. I don't want to ever deal with breast cancer ever again! I have read a lot of the forums on here and it has put me at ease with my decision. I don't care about loosing the boobs, they are to over rated anyway. LOL I just don't want to revisit this horrible disease ever again. I tested neg for the gene so that helps, but I have read so many articles of the cancer coming back with a vengeance. Ok, well thank you for letting me vent.",
