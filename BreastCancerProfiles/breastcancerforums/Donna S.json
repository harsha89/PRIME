      "Content": "I too am 44 and got my period back one time 15 months after starting chemo. A blood test a few months ago indicated I was not in menopause. They are currently doing clinical trials to determine whether it would benefit premenopausal women more to switch them to Arimidex or Femara after chemically supressing or surgically removing ovaries. For more info on this, go to the breastcancer.org site, it is excellent and gives you updates on everything. Since I have only had one period, my onc is taking a \"wait and see\" approach, that is, I may go into menopause and be able to switch to the newer meds. In any event, he believes that ovarian supression would be of minimal benefit to me, as long as I am on Tamoxifen. This was confirmed by a speciality breast oncologist at the University of PA. In other words, they will know more about whether to force us into menopause and put us on aromitase inhibitors when these studies come back!",
