I visited my onc for a checkup and he told me that even if I am in menopause ( one period six months ago!) he probably would not switch me over to Arimidex because he has seen too many women with joint and muscle pain who then had to be switched back to tamoxifen. Something the drug magazine ads won't tell you... I do feel better knowing that I'm not the only one with achiness in my breast and muscle pain. I think I have to find the perfect bra, maybe that would help.. Donna Macungie, PA See my info above",

      "Content": "I too am 44 and got my period back one time 15 months after starting chemo. A blood test a few months ago indicated I was not in menopause. They are currently doing clinical trials to determine whether it would benefit premenopausal women more to switch them to Arimidex or Femara after chemically supressing or surgically removing ovaries. For more info on this, go to the breastcancer.org site, it is excellent and gives you updates on everything. Since I have only had one period, my onc is taking a \"wait and see\" approach, that is, I may go into menopause and be able to switch to the newer meds. In any event, he believes that ovarian supression would be of minimal benefit to me, as long as I am on Tamoxifen. This was confirmed by a speciality breast oncologist at the University of PA. In other words, they will know more about whether to force us into menopause and put us on aromitase inhibitors when these studies come back!",

      "Content": "I know that the waiting is terrible, but keep in mind that most lumps are benign. If you're only 32, were you nursing over the last few years? I used to have lumps and fluid coming out of the nipple for up to two years after I stopped... Getting it checked out is a good thing. Maybe going to a breast surgeon just to be sure is a good idea even if your PCP says \"it's nothing\". Take it one step at a time, and know that if you need us we're here. I have cysty breasts too, and you have to realize that cysts do NOT turn cancerous.. I'll be praying for you. Donna Age 44 Pennsylvania",

      "Content": "Not sure this is the same thing, but 4-5months after radiation, I experienced shortness of breath when exercising, and I considered myself fairly active. I think it can be fluid retention, too, from the surgical trauma, or just some type of inflammation. ( that's what my radiologist thought) I experienced it again recently, and the doctors are scratching their heads. Heart tests and chest X-rays show nothing. Think about the chemo and surgery and what it can do to a body. I really think there needs to be more in the way of follow-up for survivors! Donna Age 44 Dx'd 10/03 1cm, er/pr pos.
