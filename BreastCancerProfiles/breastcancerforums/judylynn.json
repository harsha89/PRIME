      "Content": "Since I was 18, I've been having tumors removed from my breasts.(59 now) Several were calcifications and were benign. It sounds like you have a good doctor. If he isn't sure what it is, then he needs to find out. I have to say that this is the most frightening thing that can happen to a person, but cancer is treatable. It could turn out to be nothing, but if it's cancer you can fight it. I also have dense breasts and a history of cancer in my family. The density of the breasts makes it harder to tell sometimes what the shadows are. Keep posting and tell me how it goes.",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm Judy, and when I was 18 I began having tumors removed from my breasts. They would show up every few years. In my early 30's I had a hysterctomy, and I always said that was the best surgery I ever had. I felt better and my monthly cycles were done. I had all the children I wanted. I've now had a mastectomy on the right side and I'd like to get the other off too. My insurance considers it a preventative measure and thay won't pay for it. My oncologist wants me to do the BRCA testing, and I haven't been able to afford it so far. The way I have understood it is that it may not make me feel better, but I can plan better as to prevention of cancer recurrence. Plus, it would mostly be for my daughter so she and her doctors could be more vigilant if it runs in our family. The counselor also said that if it's in our family, her insurance will be more likely to pay for her preventative care if the time comes.",

I really don't no about the spot where these calcifications are, but mine always turned out benign. I guess some places can be worse than others, but I think it more depends on the type of cancer should you have that. I have heard of a few cases where people had cancer in both breasts at the same time, but not very often. Just keep in mind that it certainly may not be cancer.",
