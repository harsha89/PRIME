      "Content": "Thanks, David. My BIL has Lupus and he was treated a few hours away and just visited the infusion center for treatment, so I hoping that would be an option. My longstanding PCP just left general practice and joined the only local oncology center, so I would be more than happy to see him locally. I know my current PCP is referring me to a surgeon for a consult regardless of the mammo or ultrasound outcomes, just to be safe, so I need to pick one now. I think I will request one from one of the bigger hospitals. It just feel like it might be weird to have the whole treatment team so far away, if my results aren't benign. It's hard because I have to make these decision as though the answer is cancer, even though the chance is only 20%, because this one decision of selecting the surgeon will determine who I would see after, if it is cancer.",

      "Content": "Next week I will be having a mammo/ultasound on two lumps. My PCP wants to refer me for a surgery consult, as well. While I know that there is an 80% they will not be cancerous, I am someone who prefers to over prepare and to find providers in advance. I live in a rural area, with one local hospital. There is a small cancer center, where I imagine I could have tx, if needed, post surgery. Is that a usual option for rural patients? I would prefer not to have surgery locally, but would't mind going to a cancer center for surgery and tx recommendations and oversight of my care and then having it administered locally. I have no idea if that is realistic or even possible? The closest large hospital is three hours away, which is Fletcher Allen in Burlington, VT, which has abreast cancer care center. If I drive five hours the other way I could reach the Roswell Park. Any insight would be helpful.",
