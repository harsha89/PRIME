    "Content": "I'm sorry that you're scared. Usually, it's nothing but a fatty deposit that just grew a little bit. A biopsy doesn't hurt, at least I didn't think mine did. They often do a local anesthesia to make it more comfortable. That's a pretty accurate time frame for results to come back. As a 21 year old as well, I know how scary it is to have this on your mind. I was diagnosed with Endometrial Adenocarcinoma 2 months ago, and it hasn't gotten any easier to imagine it. I know you're scared, but just remember: there's no sense in worrying about things you can't control. I will be thinking of you, Jennifer, and sending positive vibes your way. Please keep us updated, and if you'd like to talk feel free to send me a PM. You'll be okay, hun. I promise!",
