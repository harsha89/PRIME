      "Content": "Originally Posted by smithy14975 Anyone out there get this kind of bc? It is a tough one. I got it and was misdianosed as mastitus. By the time they figured out what it was I was Stage 3 ++++. It was by the grace of God still localized. Took only 2 months from the time I noticed my Breast getting larger to the time it was Starge 3. I was diagnosed on July 28th 2006 after a couple of months of antibiotics and mammograms / appointments that kept telling me to come back in 6 months. My family history was bad so I kept pursuing it anyway. I was hoping it was not BC but it was. It was IBC which I hadn't heard of before. It was not hormonal and only border line HER2 so Herceptin only worked sort of. The A/C and Taxol did work. I had 8 weekly of Taxol / Herceptin / 2 month bi weekly A/C and then 2 month biweekly Taxol. The last two cycles were dose dense. Then I had surgery and they found no cancer, just calcified stuff that used to be cancer. All nodes were clear by then so they called it surgical remission????? Then I had 30 radiations. Now I am just being watched and have to have a CT scan every 3 months and a blood test too I think. Is that good enough to catch any new development? I am told I have a 50 / 50 chance of long term survival, even with the good turn out so far because IBC is bad and comes back much of the time. I am worried they won't catch it with the CT scan in time if it does come back.",
