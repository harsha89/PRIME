    "Content": "Hello all, My name is Allison and I am a student at James Madison University. I am a dance major and am working on a research project determining whether or not dance therapy is beneficial for cancer patients/survivors. If there is anyone with experience in this area who has information that they would like to share, I would love to talk with you. It is my hope to use dance therapy as an outlet for all populations. I would love to know what you all think. Thank you so much, Allison",
