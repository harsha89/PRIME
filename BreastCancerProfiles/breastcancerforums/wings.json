    "Content": "In December I was told that I had breast cancer and I decided to have surgery. When I came home from the hospital empty-handy with no info on what would have made me more comfortable. Like a camisole (shirt)with pockets for train tubes and a heating pad for muscle cramps. These items would have made my first night home more comfortable. Please share anything that made your recovery easier for you. I am creating a list for a recovery Care Package.",
