      "Content": "I know when they figure out er/pr+ it is based on a percentage of cells not all cells. I am not sure about the HER2, but I believe it is the same way. For example my tumor was 60% er/pr+ so I am considered hormone receptor positive, even if 40% aren't. My doctors said with bigger samples, sometimes pathology changes. Maybe your wifes wasn't really a recurrence but a new primary tumor? Just a thought. Hope she is doing well. -JP",

      "Content": "Hi I am very concerned about an area at the end of my mastectomy scar (near the arm pit). When feeling along the scar, I can feel a hard, bump. The skin covering it looks normal and I am not sure how new it is. The reason is, that area of the incision was very gathered and has recently flattened out. I just finished radiation 5 weeks ago and during that time I didn't want to press or bother the skin much, so I really wasn't feeling around there. Could this possibly be a recurrence so soon after finishing rads with boost to that area, or is it more likely scar tissue? I have an appt with my oncologist next week, but was wondering how common it is to form scar tissue like I am describing after MRM? P.S>I should add that my surgery was in August and Rads started 4 weeks later, I finished them Oct 28th.",
