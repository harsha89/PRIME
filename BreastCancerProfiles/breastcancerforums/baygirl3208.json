      "Content": "Hi I am new to all this. Recently underwent a masectomy and my husband was there by my side for it all. I was told that I will possibly need chemo and had both the in situ or ductal as well as invasive. I just need to vent right now. Me and my husband have a rocky relationship and i am no saint and neither is he. His family hates me and I have no relationship with his family. He tod me that if I am going through chemo when his brother gets married in september then he wont be going he will stay with me. Last night he tells me when he gets in from work on friday that he has to get his measurements done for the wedding. I was very upset as I thought the one who loves you is supposed to be there for you for everything. He tells me that if I have to have chemo for 6 months is he supposed to be there for all of that. Am i wrong to expect that or should i just expect what he said to me that I should grow up and then he hung up. I am heartbroken and do I have too much of an expectation of him.",

      "Content": "Hi i had a masectomy as well and I have been healing now for almost 4 weeks after second surgery.Tried a lumpectomy but margins were not clear so decided to have a masectomy. It is very tiring and I know when i came home as well i was walking around and felt fine but for me I felt that during the first week it is an emotional roller coaster. I try to be strong and then my body told me I wasnt. It is a shock to the system losing something that is associated with your sexuality. I am 35 and was devastaed. How old is your mom if that is ok and has she discussed whether or not she wants reconstruction or just a prosthesis?",
