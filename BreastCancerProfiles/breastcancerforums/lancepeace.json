      "Content": "March 30 2012 (Reuters) - Roche said patients with an aggressive type of breast cancer lived longer after taking its experimental \"armed antibody\" drug without the disease worsening than those on a mix of GlaxoSmithKline drug Tykerb and Roche's Xeloda. The positive results from the first Phase III trial of the medicine - dubbed T-DM1 - clears the way for it to be submitted to European and U.S. authorities for approval this year, boosting prospects for a key asset in the Swiss firm's pipeline. WestLB analyst Oliver Kaemmerer, who sees peak sales potential for T-DM1 of around 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion), said the latest news was clearly positive but it remained to be seen what the overall magnitude of the benefit was in the study. In a brief statement on Friday, Roche revealed only that patients on T-DM1 lived \"significantly longer\" without their disease progressing. Roche has been developing T-DM1 with ImmunoGen as a successor to its blockbuster Herceptin, which is expected to generate sales of around $6 billion this year. A key advantage of T-DM1 over Herceptin is the fact that it causes fewer adverse side effects like hair loss and low white blood cell counts. It combines trastuzumab, an antibody and the active ingredient in Herceptin, with the agent DM1 - a derivative of an extremely powerful type of chemotherapy called maytansine - which is carried directly into cells. As well as having fewer unpleasant side effects, Roche believes its new drug also offers greater convenience, since it is one drug and eliminates the need to administer chemotherapy. Analyst hopes for T-DM1 have been running high, following earlier good results in Phase II tests, and a filing of the product with regulators this year had been widely expected on the back of data from the so-called EMILIA clinical trial. Roche said the EMILIA progression-free survival data would be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, adding that final results for overall survival were not yet mature. Kaemmerer of WestLB believes the full set of results for progression-free survival are likely to be presented at the June 1-5 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, with overall survival results becoming available by 2014.",

      "Content": "Trastuzumab Emtansine Keeps Types Of Breast Cancer In Check 25 Sep 2011 Today, results from the trial of a new investigational medication, trastuzumab emtansine a targeted antibody drug conjugate (known as ADC), have shown that the drug considerably increases the time that advanced HER2-positive breast cancer is kept in check while reducing adverse effects. A Phase II investigation, TDM4450g, in individuals with previously untreated HER2-positive metastatic or advanced breast cancer (mBC), showed that those who received trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) benefited from an extra five months of life, without their illness getting worse when compared to the best standard of care currently. Herceptin® and chemotherapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) revealed an increase from 9.2 months with Herceptin® and chemotherapy, to 14.2 months with T-DM1, HR=0.59. Professor Paul Ellis, Professor of Medical Oncology, Guy's Hospital, explained: \"These data represent an important advance in personalized healthcare for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer .This novel and targeted approach has shown that we are now able to stop the cancer in its tracks while reducing many of the common side effects normally associated with standard chemotherapy treatment.\" Less adverse effects were experienced in those who received T-DM1 in comparison to individuals who received Herceptin® plus chemotherapy, with the rate of adverse effects needing hospitalization (Grade 3 or higher adverse events) reduced by almost half (46.4% with T-DM1 compared to 89.4% with Herceptin® and chemotherapy). T-DM1 is a new investigational drug, known as an antibody drug conjugate or ADC, which contains a chemotherapy agent (maytansine) stably connected to the monoclonal antibody, Herceptin®. The benefit of T-DM1 is that the medication targets and inhibits HER2 signaling and at the same time transfers the chemotherapy directly inside HER2-positive cancer cells. By targeting the chemotherapy to the tumor cells, it avoids several adverse effects usually observed with chemotherapy. On September 25 in Stockholm, Sweden, the information will be presented at the 2011 European Multidisciplinary Cancer Congress and was highlighted by the European Society for Medical Oncology in the official press program for the congress. The Study 137 patients with previously untreated HER2-positive mBC were enrolled in the TDM44500g Phase II, international, multicenter, two-arm, open-label investigation. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and the other Hercepin® plus docetaxel chemotherapy.",

      "Content": "June 9, 2012 Roche's cancer drug franchise is adding a significant new breast cancer treatment to the portfolio. The company's Genentech subsidiary announced last night that the FDA had handed out an approval for pertuzumab, setting the stage for a new combo attack on HER2-positive cases. The drug will be sold as Perjeta. In clinical studies investigators found that pertuzumab added to the pioneering Herceptin (trastuzumab) and chemo extended progression-free survival rates in patients by an average of 6.1 months--with a median PFS rate of 18.5 months versus 12.4 in the Herceptin-plus-chemo-only arm. The drug will be available to patients in two weeks. The approval is particularly noteworthy for several reasons. The OK underscores investigators' growing understanding of targeting cancer from different angles, extending the survival rates of even the sickest patients. Pertuzumab originally failed to impress as a standalone drug, emerging as a blockbuster contender only after it was combined with Herceptin. The approval also highlights the way cancer is being divvied into various subpopulations; about a quarter of all breast cancer cases are HER2-positive. The priority review provided by the FDA underscores the agency's avid interest in accelerating approvals for new cancer drugs that fit these guidelines. The pertuzumab approval also sets the stage for a likely approval of T-DM1, a Roche/ImmunoGen \"armed antibody\" that has also demonstrated impressive PFS rates in a late-stage study. There's no word yet on how much pertuzumab will cost. But with the blockbuster Herceptin earning close to $6 billion a year with a price tag of $54,000, there's likely to be a new round of discussion over how much payers can afford. Analyst estimates for peak sales range from more than $600 million a year to more than a billion dollars annually.

      "Content": "Bone Drug Boosts Breast Cancer Survival Published December 09, 2011 | Associated Press Doctors were mostly hoping to prevent complications and relapses when they gave young women a medicine to keep their bones strong during breast cancer treatment. Seven years later, they found it did more than that: The bone drug improved survival, as much as many chemotherapies do. The study found a 37 percent lower risk of death among women who received the bone drug, Zometa. In absolute terms, it meant that 4 to 5 more women out of every 100 were alive seven years later. It's especially impressive considering that the women took the drug, given as an infusion every six months, for only three years. \"The benefit persists\" long after treatment ends, said study leader Dr. Michael Gnant of Austria's Medical University of Vienna. He presented the research this week at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Zometa (zow-MAY-tuh) should now be offered to all patients like those in this study - younger women forced into early menopause by hormone-blocking cancer treatments, some specialists said. \"It's a new standard of care,\" said Dr. James Ingle, a Mayo Clinic breast specialist who had no role in the study. Bone drugs called bisphosphonates \u2013 sold as Fosamax, Boniva and Actonel \u2013 have long been sold for treating osteoporosis. Those are daily pills. Zometa, made by the Swiss company Novartis AG, is given intravenously to treat cancer that has spread to the bone. Hope that it could do more grew in 2008, when Gnant reported that it lowered the risk of a cancer recurrence in a study of 1,800 premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer. All had surgery followed by hormone blockers, and half also received Zometa. Now, with seven years of follow-up, researchers see that Zometa not only helped keep cancer from coming back, but also improved survival. There were 33 deaths among women given the bone drug and 49 among those not treated with it. That magnitude of benefit is comparable to many chemotherapy treatments. Researchers think because Zometa strengthens bones, it's tougher for cancer to spread there and the drug may also have direct effects against circulating cancer cells or microscopic tumors. Zometa's side effects were mostly fever and bone and joint pain, and doctors saw no cases of jawbone decay, a serious problem long linked to bisphosphonates. Zometa costs more than $1,000 in the U.S. and about half as much in Europe, though the price may drop when its U.S. patent expires in 2013. Novartis helped pay for the study and Gnant consults for the company. The bone drug proved disappointing though in a large study last year in postmenopausal women, who account for three-fourths of all breast cancers. But there was a glimmer of hope in the oldest patients. \"They benefitted substantially as long as they were well past menopause,\" said Dr. Peter Ravdin, director of the breast cancer program at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio, who also had no role in the research. Other studies reported at the conference this week strengthen the view that Zometa works best in women with little estrogen. A consistent picture is emerging, Ravdin said. The cancer conference is sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center. http://www.sabcs.org/PressReleases/index.asp",
