About her port, she wasn't even told the it should be flushed. I tole her about a friend that had one and that it got infected, because she was unable to get it flushed (due to other health isues), and my MIL was very surprised to hear that it should be flushed monthly, when she asked the drs. they told her that it should be flushed, but it was ok to do it every 3-4 mths. Let me tell you I have been very unimpressed by her cancer care, since wshe was uninnsured at the time of her diagnosis, she had to go on indigent care, and I think one of the reasons she had a mastecomy,is they didn't want to pay for the prolonged treatment of trying to rid her of the cancer cells,(just my opinion). Does anyone know if medicare will pay for prothesis? Or for a port removal? Thanks so much for any information, my MIL has no computer, so she has no way to ask these ?'s, and I am not sure if she would anyway, she is very private about these things, and wiol even put herself in joepardy at times.
