    "Content": "Ive copied and pasted this section from my post on the support group & hoping someone can answer a question or 2 . Ive been lurking here for a few months & feel its time to post my story . I have 2 sisters with end stage cancers. 1 has stage 4 metastasized breast cancer . She was first diagnosed about 15 yrs ago with stage 3. The cancer returned around 2009 and had jumped to her bones, lung, skin,spine .she has tumors in her abdomen that are causing alot of pain . she was just released from the hospital with intestinal blockage about 2 weeks ago. their not sure if it was caused by tumors or from pain medication causing constipation. last weekend her feet started swelling and now have started turning black. from everything ive read the swelling of the feet is probably her kidneys or liver are involved. anyone know what could be causing the color change ? she stopped getting chemo about 2 weeks ago and is rapidly going downhill. she's sleeping alot more and very weak. eating has been an issue for awhile now and she's probably down 50-60 pounds . thanks in advance for any help.",
