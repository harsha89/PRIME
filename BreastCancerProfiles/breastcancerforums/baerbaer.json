    "Content": "I was sent for a follow up mammogram last week that showed clusters of calcification on my right breast in 2 areas. They are at 5 and 6 oclock, at the back of the breast on the muscle wall. I was scheduled for a biopsy yesterday, but after almost 2 hours of trying they were unable to get to both of the areas. I was given the choice to biopsy the one they could reach, or elect to have them taken out surgically. I elected to have it taken out. I just wouldn't have trusted the outcome if it had come back negative, and would have worried about the one that wasn't done. I guess they will biopsy what they remove. I'm really scared to say the least. I don't even have a consultation with the surgeon until the 14th, and it has already been stressing me out for 3 weeks. It seems it may be a month before I get in to surgery. If it is cancerous, is that too long to wait? Anyone that has had experience here I would greatly appreciate hearing from. This waiting is killing me. Also, any info on recovery time when they do a removal of the tissue, it will be quite a good size piece, but they said day surgery.",
