      "Content": "they wont biopsy any further now they have done a full lumpectomy. It is very unnerving that my consultant keeps saying that he is confident there is nothing to worry about when i have two inadequate biopsies and a suspicious mamm. I guess that is why I am trying to understand how much importance is put on an \"inadequate\"sample( two of them!) and if whether they didnt find anything suspicious the chance that it would actually be positive. Consultant mentioned this hard area, guess i need to just wait now for the results. many thanks for responding, i feel llike isolated at the moment chrystel x",

      "Content": "I found a hard lump three weeks ago and immediately went to see the consultant at a private clinic. The lump did not move nor was it painful. it is just north of the nipple. He did a FNA and referred me for a Mamm. As I had 6 years ago had a breast reduction he said it was probably scar tissue or a stitch, but I had already had ultrasound 2 years ago and there was no problem in this area at that time. The doctor who performed the ultrasound and looked at the mamm advised that there was indifferent contours to the lump and i should be concerned. She then performed a core biopsy . She said it was not scar tissue Several days later I am advised that both samples did not find any trace of malignency but there they were inadequate samples (c1) and where therefore unreliable I had a lumpectomy on monday. I now have a nasty infection that I am trying to cope with, but it is causing enormous pain as it has engorged the breast and created a sore redness to the skin. I saw the consultant today , for the first time since waking up from the general on monday and he said that the lump looked OK, but there was a hard area can anyone advise me please what a c1 result is and why one gets an inadequate sample? also is there a good possibility of malignency if there is a hard bit in the lump? thank you for any help",
