    "Content": "Many times we forget when we are dealing with our own cancer how much it affects our spouses. When I first saw your topic, I thought you meant support for your spouse as it is often a forgotten subject. I went thorugh breast cancer, bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiation, and am now on the pill Femara that makes you wonder if it is even worth it. My husband was with me when he could be but many times, I wanted him to continue to live life as normally as possible. He still had to go to work, I still wanted him to go out to dinner with our friends or kids when I couldn't. The caregiver is often the forgotten one in these cases and it is really unfortunate. Your husband needs to go to this wedding. It is the right thing to do. If you said he wanted to go to the wedding instead of being with you on your surgery day, I would say maybe that is selfish but Chemo is a long process. It isn't one or two days it is months. Take a deep breath and think about how you would feel if you were in his shoes. Breast cancer isn't a here today, gone tomorrow type of illness and it wears the caregivers down if you don't give them some opportunity to live as normally as possible. Push him on this and you may find yourself alone during all of it and long after and hopefully you don't want that.",
