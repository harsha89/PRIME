      "Content": "Been for mammogram, ultrasound today & had a fine core needle biopsy, I have a 2.5cm lump in left breast, no signs anywhere else from mammogram & ultrasound. It is quite a firm lump with a bit of fluid in it, consultant said it could be benign but more than likely will be cancer, feeling really scared & I have to wait another week for results when I go for my next appointment. Has anyone else been through similar but it's been benign? I am 45 years old.",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa & Marion, Thanks for replying, I spoke to my breast nurse this morning who confirmed that it is cancer, I will find out about treatments tomorrow at my appointment but she thinks I may need a lumpectomy & radiotherapy (no mention of chemo), she said it is hormonal too much estrogen I think she said. I am feeling strangely calm at the moment so I dont think it has hit me yet.she said it is grade 2 & doesn't seem to have spread. Has anyone been through similar & come through the other end ok? Thank Trudi xx",
