    "Content": "I am ER/PR positive HER 2 neu positive, i had postpartum cardiomyopathy which was reversed. However this year i had unstable angina then my heart dilated once again i am under treatment... It reversed so its normal again after 6 months But now I am diagnosed with Breast CA stage Ia. I hope for someone to help me regarding my treatment regimen or direct me to someone who can advice me since Doxorubicin and Epirubicin are contraindicated in my case... And how safe would herceptin be for me aside from it's benefits fir Her2 neu positive patients. I look forward to anybody who can assist me. Thank you.",
