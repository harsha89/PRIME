I am sure there are lots of women out there who would trade me my lower scores, but my onc gave me such encouraging words in January \"I don't think the cancer will reoccur in you\", yet suddenly I am not in the normal range any more and with two with consecutive rises. He told me in my last visit that the blood tests were fine. I only found out of the increasing scores because a friend said I should know my CA 27 29 scores, so I got copies from the clinic. Should I go back and talk to him?",

I have been taking Ca 27 29 blood tests for the last year, every three months and lately the results have been scary! Normal scale is 0-38. I have scored 27, 34,30, 35, and last month- 39!! which is slightly elevated. Does anyone have an opinion about these scores? My onc says they are within \"stable\" area. I'm still scared.",
