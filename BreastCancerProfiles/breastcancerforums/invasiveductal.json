      "Content": "Natalie, I have been where you are at emotionally at the end of November in 2014. My first reaction was weirdly a more of a flush ( just my face turned red as the oncologist was announcing what I had already resigned on accepting as malignant) slash palpitating heart racing but not so much fear. I went through weird stages of wanting to accept defeat before even starting due to the chemotherapy fears and were it not for my fiance Id probably not have been able to come as far as I did in terms of being treated. In that regard, I have researched almost daily regarding nutrition and cancer and I think I am getting better at weeding out the unnecessary info and the more relevant info. First I bought a whole bunch of supplements but now I limit the supplement intake to CoQ10 ( to hopefully prevent doxorobucin's heart damage), Milk Thistle ( to help with liver function) and Echinacea ( possibly helping with immunity). I will occasionally add supplements as triple gingseng or kelp or Vit B6 or 12s here and there but I dont take those as religiously as the first 3. I also bought two packets of smth called immunocal that is supposed to help raising internal glutathione levels but I have been slacking off recently unlike the initial stage. Right now I am trying to follow a bit of intermittent fasting especially before chemo sessions after reading up on a study by USC's professor in regards to self protective capabilities of normal cells when going into starvation mode of 3~5 days which may help with chemos side effects. I am typically a fairly emotionless person and not until recently have I been overly affected by the side effects but switching to target therapy and docetaxel combo has had its crumbling effects and put me in a super depressed state compared to the doxorobucin cyclophosphamide cycle. Take one day at a time and having at least one person close enough to be able to share things helps. I noticed that after awhile you notice who can handle the info and who cannot. And it helps to know.",
