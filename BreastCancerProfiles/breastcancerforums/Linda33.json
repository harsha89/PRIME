    "Content": "So so sorry to read your post. A few things you said reminded me of my mams battle. She also had Copd buy has lung cancer primarily. The tiredness was from not enough oxygen her organs were working extra hard because of this. She also had swelling and painful legs and this was caused by blood clots. Everyone is different though. Could you go to her next app with her and wrote down a list of questions? It's such a tough time for you and your family. Try get as much support from friends family and her medicall team. The main thing in my experience is to make sure her pain is under control and also my mams metal health was quite poor so the team helped her with by giving some counselling and Meds also. I couldn't say how long or how will it go I can only relay my mams story. She was diagnosed very late and did not have treatment. She chose quality of quantity and the chemo offered would have only given her an extra month or so according to the doctors. She was mostly pain free at the end and at her request went into a hospice. They kept her very very comfortable right up until the end. Sorry ment to say the oxygen really helped my mam and gave her some relief from shortness of breath. Has you Mam refused treatment altogether. Big hugs to you. Xx",
