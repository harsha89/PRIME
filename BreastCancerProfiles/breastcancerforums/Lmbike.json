      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Happy New Year, I have a question which I am sure most have experienced. The gland under my left breast seems to be inflamed. I had a mammogram a few months ago which was unremarkable. I am a 34B so I don't believe it was even filmed. Best wishes and thank you for you help. Lori",

I have an appointment with a surgery tomorrow and I guess he will determine what to do biosy ... Today I had echo-stress test and the tech was able to see the mass. She didn't want to speculate on what it was but I thought that was interesting.",
