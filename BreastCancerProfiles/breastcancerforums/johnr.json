    "Content": "Hi, won't comment to much on the list but as a carer the key role and hardest is to respect the wishes of the patient and understanding where they set the boundaries is important. Attending appointments and listening and taking notes so that you can both discuss what you heard as its easy to miss things or miss-interpret. What are the treatment options and why are you proposing a particular one, the patient should always have the final say as they will have to sign the consent form and if possible it should be an informed choice. Care during treatment is key, so having meals pre-prepared in the freezer, and the list goes on, I am sure others will be along to share their thoughts John",
