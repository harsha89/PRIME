      "Content": "Dead man walking, Oh it deff hurts.. Unfortunately when I was diagnosed I was laid off my job and couldn't afford the Cobra. Surgery was recommended but I had no means to pay for it. It's gotten to the point now where I get awful pains in my leg and have drop foot. It's difficult to get into a comfortable position at all times. It's to the point i can't get relief no matter what I do and I am on some heavy narcotics that no longer work. I want off these meds and the problem corrected. Since I now have insurance, I am getting the ball moving on surgery. It just takes time cause my insurance makes you try so many different things before they will pay for it even though I have already done them prior. I am getting the disc replaced and a fusion. I can only pray that it works.. Even if it doesn't take away all the pain, if it can get it down significantly, I will be more then greatful ♡ Thank goodness you were able to get it corrected!!! What you went through sounds AWFUL.",

I have a herniated disc at my l5 S1 that is impinging on my nerve root and my symptoms in the first few years were exactly like yours. They are much worse now as time has passed and I have gotten older. I am to the point where I am looking in to my options for surgery. I am not saying this is what is for sure causing your back symptoms as I am no Dr but I figured I would throw the possibility out there.",
