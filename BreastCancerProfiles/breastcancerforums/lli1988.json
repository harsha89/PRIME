      "Content": "She is only 65. She is also having to deal with an ulcerated tumor. It has actually broken through the skin of her breast. Liver failure is our biggest concern. Do you know at what point the liver begins to fail? Can the liver be 85,90, etc. percent cancerous and still function? Will liver failure progress quickly?",

      "Content": "my mother in law has breast cancer that has spread to her liver, lungs, spleen. at the time of her scan (6 weeks ago), her liver was about 80% cancerous. she is having nausea and some pain but none of it is consistent. her coloring is off but I wouldn't say she was \"yellow\". She opted not to have treatment so we feel like we don't alot about this disease. Can anyone tell me what symptoms we should be looking for? The oncologist did tell us she would have liver failure eventually. At what point does the liver start failing? Is it normal for the pain to be on again, off again?",
