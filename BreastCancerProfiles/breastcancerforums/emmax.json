    "Content": "hi, my name is Emma. and i recently got told i have breast cancer, i'm currently undergoing a course of chemo to 'shrink it for surgery' i think that's what they said? the thing that i can't deal with is... im 17 years old. i always thought that was too young? i keep breaking down in tears whenever i think about it or feel pain. should it be painful? 'cos it is, quite a lot of the time what are the affects of chemo? i know it sounds.. trivial and unimportant and i may sound shallow but its something that bugs me, with chemo, will i lose my hair? i don't really know what might happen to me? i dont know anyone thats gone through this and i don't want to ask my mum - she's finding it hard to deal with. and when the doctor was explaining everything, i zoned out and was just crying. ): i just can't deal with it",
