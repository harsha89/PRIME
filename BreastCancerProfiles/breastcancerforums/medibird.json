    "Content": "Samantha's Story, diagnosed at 28 Too Young for having a LINK DELETED AS PER FORUM POLICY disease! I just celebrated my 28th Birthday last month. I had just moved back to my home town Banglore to do a Masters in Education. As usual I was making myself ready to sleep by keeping my hands on my chest and almost fall asleep. I suddenly felt like there is a small marble shaped lump on my right breast. I quickly put my hands on my left breast to check if it felt the same. I realized there is no such lump on my left breast. That night I was so worried about my health and fall asleep after praying to god for the same. The next day I discussed about this with my mother, sister and of course to our family doctor. Soon, I was asked to get a mammogram. As I was waiting in the room next to the diagnostic room, 2 other women were waiting for their results after the mammogram. I considered for myself, according to statistics, one of us sitting in that room may have breast cancer disease, and let's face it, it likely won't be me. I was the youngest among the three ladies sitting there. After a couple of days, I was arranged for a biopsy to remove the tumor. A week subsequent, I was going to get my outcomes. I knew it was nothing. I was very happy that on that morning; I got to miss a day of work, and was planning to come home and relaxing! Little did I understand that morning, my life is going to change forever. I cried a lot until I couldn't cry anymore! After one week, I had a lumpectomy and the surgeon removed 3 lymph nodes from my lymph. I quickly made an appointment to glimpse an oncologist at the Regional cancer center in Chennai, an eight hour travel from my hometown Banglore. We discussed my treatments, options and recovery plans. When my oncologist told me I am going to lose my hair in 3 weeks after the first chemotherapy, I decided to take this myself to a great haircut before it's going to lose. I cut it my hair at the maximum, I couldn't proceed any shorter, whereas in a couple of weeks it was going to be nothing. I think I cried a lot even I know it's just hair, but it was my hair! I am very much sure about that, within those 3 weeks of the chemotherapy course, my hair began to fall in chunks. Six rounds of chemotherapy, traveling from Banglore to Chennai and backwards. Now I understand I'm stronger than I thought!. My friends and family were very supportive. I got showered with flowers, get well cards, books, my favorite blankets or throws. There is something about a blanket that makes you seem protected, loved and comfortable. My colleagues brought me a scarf or hat, this way I wouldn't have to buy my own. As a continuation to the chemotherapy, I had radiation therapy: six weeks, five times a week. It has been 2 years, and I wish I could mention here that I have fought well against the breast cancer and it's behind me, but in truth, I'm terrified that the breast cancer will come back!",
