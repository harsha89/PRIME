    "Content": "Hello from Maine...I cannot tell you from my personal experience but my twin sister had breast cancer. She had her mastectomy and tram flap reconstruction at the same time. She has regretted it. The healing process was slow. I worked at an oncologist office for many years and his opinion was to let the mastectomy site heal first then do the reconstruction. Your body can handle only so much trauma. My sister wanted to get all done at once to avoid future surgeries but had to go back for more reconstruction surgery afterall. My best to you.",
