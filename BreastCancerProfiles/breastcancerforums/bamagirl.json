      "Content": "I'm new to the site today, and just returned from my doctor's office. Had a mammo a couple weeks ago and was told today that I have calcifications in the left breast. Can someone tell me what this is? They are scheduling me for a different kind of mammo to follow up. What can I expect to happen regarding the calcifications? Thank you! Tina",

      "Content": "Hi ladies, Thank you for your replies to my post last week. Being able to share your concerns with others who have had the same experiences is such a blessing! I got really frustrated this morning. I had my follow-up mammo scheduled for this morning and when I got there, they said they did NOT have me scheduled and wanted me to wait for three weeks - when I got home I called central scheduling and they were able to re-schedule me for next week. Nancy, in response to your question - I lived in Alabama for 25 years before I moved to Florida in June 2002. I lived in Tuscaloosa for several years when growing up and was able to attend many, many Bama games (this was during the Namath/Stabler era) due to my father's job with the newspaper. I still think there is no other college football except Bama. Thank you again! Tina",
