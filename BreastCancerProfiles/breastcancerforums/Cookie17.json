      "Content": "Due to my metastases of the bones, in layman's terms, bone cancer, which is in most of my bones as one of my secondary cancers, it can make life tough! My bone scan of last year showed up as black areas of my skeleton which was the bone cancer. It does not let you see what is active or what isn't, it just says you have or have had cancer in that area. I cant get rid of it, we have tried radio therapy but there are too many cancer cells floating about to do anything of value. All the radiotherapy can do is try to alleviate the pain that bone cancer can cause. It is not commonly known that bone cancer is the most painful of cancers to have and trust me to get this one as well as my breast (primary) and also in my liver too as a secondary. So therefore, any treatment I am undergoing now is for the cancer in my bones. I have to admit, its not fun, its draining, tiring and so wish at times that I could just take my spine out and put in a new one that would be less painful to deal with. I am on class A drugs to help deal with the pain and yet I think I have plateaued out as the meds no longer seem to be dealing with my pain. I had my palliative care nurse ask how things were going on having upped by MST meds but not a lot has occurred. Its hard to know what to do in situations like this because my body may be now just too use to the slow release morphine and so may have to have things reassessed as it is truly quite a hard thing to deal with when your back is in different forms of discomfort. Dawn, my Sue Ryder nurse has told me to up my amitriptyline to see if I can sleep through the night better and may be it might help ease the back pain. It is a hard road to follow and believe me I would not wish this on my worst enemy whatever they may have done. We all know back pain sucks and is a killer to a lot of people, putting them in painful positions and time off work. When you add bone cancer to that equation, it doubles the pain and your mobility is affected too. I am now on oral morphine as well as MST morphine and the usual pain killers which I take on a daily basis 4 times a day. They try and make my quality of life as normal as they can but with a Stage IV tumour of the breast, it is not easy. But I was diagnosed in 2011 and was given 6 months to live and yet here I am still fighting. So you see ladies and gentlemen, when the going gets tough, please don't give up hope. Fight back, if I can, then I am sure you can too. I am not saying it is easy, it is hard, but you can do it, I can assure you and come out the other side and enjoy your life as best you can. All too soon it will be taken away from you so don't waste a day, make the most of your days and listen to your body and rest when you need to. When the going gets tough, the tough get going!! Hope that makes sense.",

      "Content": "Ladies, who are on this oral chemo, have you had any side effects, contrary to what your Oncologist has warned you about? It happened to me. To begin with I was put on 5mg of Everolimus for about a month and despite hot flushes hotter than usual, there was nothing out of the norm. As my Sue Ryder nurse implied, I was having torrential rain storms, as my hair would get soaking wet from the flushes. So a month later, they put me on 10mg of Everolimus instead. Little did I know what was going to happen. I had been warned of lung scaring, hence why I was given an x-ray as a bench mark, probably tiredness and headaches. But nothing really prepared me for what lay in store. What I actually got was a rash that erupted all over my chest, shoulders and neck and I ended up in A&E whilst they try and find out what was wrong with me. They could not understand what was causing the rash. Oddly enough, the rash was not causing me any grief other than looking ugly and giving me the creeps. So, the Docs at A&E decided to give me antibiotics and fluids. They asked me whilst they gave me full blood check, x-ray and ECG what was new that I had been given and I informed them of the new chemo. They made a note and after 5 hours and 3 lots of antibiotics, I was let home. The rash was like a bad case of acne and was seriously depressing. When I left I went to see a Dr in Duchess of Kent Palliative Care for pain management. As soon as he saw the rash, she knew it was chemo related and suggested I take Zinc to help dry the acne rash up. I have had the sweats from hell, headaches, breathlessness, tiredness, loss of appetite, nauseous, aching limbs, disturbed sleep and there are many more side effects and it was sods law, excuse the French, that I have been getting many less common effects. I got so depressed as I ended up with a mouth full of ulcers which seriously depressed me and even taking the new Bonjella which is a real killer when applied to the ulcer as it stings like you would not believe so rang and spoke with my Breast Care Nurses, Chemo Nurses and finally Oncology to speak with Dr Abbass. He has suggested that I come in and see him earlier than I was due to sort out the side effects and if I stay on the 10mg or not. One good thing he said regarding the rash, was at least the hormone was working - that I found hard to believe. To go through all this, just so the chemo can attack the tumour in my liver. So, still have the rash over my chest because I sweat like no tomorrow from my chest and shoulder areas so this is not helping the rash but still. I have also had headaches, chesty cough, breathlessness, dry skin on my feet and hands, bloody nose and others. The thing is, don't suffer in silence, if something does not feel right then please make a noise and seek help from your Oncologist, GP or Palliative Care Nurse. Don't let them fob you off, stay strong and fight for your own peace of mind. This is the first time that I have had reaction to a chemo drug that has brought me down as much as it has and I don't want to continue in this vain. Good luck",
