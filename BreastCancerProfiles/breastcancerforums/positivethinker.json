      "Content": "Thanks for your suggestions. I will post in the other forums as well. As Tom Petty says, \"The waiting is the hardest part\". I am waiting for oncologist apt to discuss chemo and radiation. Surgeon for breast surgeon and endoscopic apt for rectal probe. Also need to herar what will happen with rectal and what surgeon will do the work. Since the diagnosis, I have worked very hard around my house to re--organize guest bedroom for my sisters arrival, office and made huge piles of items for my neighborhood garage sale in a few weeks. I find keeping myself busy helps. With free time, I tend not to surf the internet and self evaluate my prognosis which is seriously not good. I asked about the correlation between the two cancers breast and rectal.... OB/GYN said that these were not correlated. Breast and ovarian go together and rectal and uterine/bladder go together. The rectal news came as a complete surprise but I must be honest and say that I always felt the breast cancer was in my future. My breasts are huge and have always been large since 8th grade. My mom had lumpectomoy at age 32, 48, 55 and mastectomy at 71. My maternal grandma died of breast cancer at 62 and my maternal aunt had several lumps removed from the age of 40. So the writing was on the wall that it would hit me. I had the BRAC1 exam back in Feb 2014 which came back negative so I did not carry the gene but it still is a higher percentage with family history than others. My chin is up and I thank the welcome from my fellow posters...",

      "Content": "Hello all - I am 53 yr old woman who lives in Florida. I decided to have weight loss surgery and started the preliminary pre screening tests. Sept 11 - I had my first colonoscopy. 1 polyp removed in rectum all colon clean Sept 12 - had my yearly mammogram Sept 15 OB/GYN called and said I needed a biopsy for left breast Sept 17 - Breast biopsy was performed by radiologist Sept 17 PM - Dr wants to see me about path report Sept 19 - Told I have rectal cancer stage 2 and the tumor is in a pretty difficult area. Needless to say I am shocked and upset. I cry all weekend waiting to setup oncologists and scope test. Sept 22 - OB/GYN called and tells me biopsy for breast came back positive for cancer. Not staged yet and apt with surgeon. I cried for about 73 hours straight and now I am ready to face the demons. Meeting with oncologist on OCT 2 and will discuss treatment for breast and rectum. Oct 3 - meet with breast surgeon and will also tell him about rectal. I am getting a bilateral mastectomy since I have a very long family history and a 14 yr child to think about. I wanted weight loss surgery but this is not what I had in mind Now since I have both cancers, I am hoping the drs. play nice together and cooperate with each other. I am wondering what surgery will be done first? How many chemo/radiation treatments did rectal patient get before surgery and how long was it between start of chemo and surgery day? Thanks for your support and suggestions",
