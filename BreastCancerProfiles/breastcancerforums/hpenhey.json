    "Content": "If your mother's cancer is one of the genetic ones it doesn't automatically mean that you will get it. So focus on staying healthy. You are more than the genes you are born with - you are everything you have done since and not done as well. So focus on the good stuff. Prevention - remember this is not just biological but also spiritual, psychological and social, so don't get stuck in the \"what supplements do I need?\" mode. Spiritual: find a form of meditation you like and enjoy and do it at least daily Psychological: focus on becoming flexible, accepting, positive, find a driving meaning in life, and know your values and what gives you quality of life. And go for it. Social: we all need friends and associates to spend time with - look at your network of friends and make sure they are the sort of people you want to be with during the next stage of your life. But from a biological perspective - make sure your thyroid is functioning well. There is a slight difficulty here because most doctors just want to do one test and if that is OK then tell you that it isn't a problem. Explore hypothyroidism forums on the net - but please be sensible and not fall for everything someone says, check out lots of stuff carefully and with good reasoning. Low thyroid lowers your body temperature, which encourages infections and growths which seek to recycle you back to the earth. Mostly the infections are just annoying, but cancer can recycle you back faster. Low thyroid can also give you up to about 50 other symptoms as well, but one of the easiest ways of checking it out is to find out your underarm temperature before you get out of bed in the morning. If it is more than 0.2 below normal then hypothyroidism might be an issue for you. Second supplements: iodine is important in breast cancer - there is a lot of research both on animal models and human which show that breasts like iodine - the body is raided for iodine to set it down during pregnancy which is protective for the rest of a woman's life. Tumours that regress have been shown to have idodine in them and those that continue to grow have none - I just read a medical paper on that a couple of days ago. Doseages should be high in the first instance, as in iodoral. Also selenium, and decent quantities of vitamin D - get your D3 levels checked by your doctor and make sure you get into the highest category, not just into the barely normal. Hope this is helpful go well, Harriet Researcher into health - currently a Research Associate Professor Carer of sister who had cancer but now seems to be free of it",
