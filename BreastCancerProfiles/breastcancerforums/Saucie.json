      "Content": "Hi I'm new to the breast cancer forum. I was wondering if someone can answer my question. Has anyone had problems with working on chest muscles with tissue expanders in place? I heard from 3 people with breast implants that they physician did not recommend working chest muscles. However, my physician said it was okay. I'm not sure if the placement of breast implant and tissue expanders are different.",

I am going through the final stages with expanding my tissue expanders and then radiation will commence. After radiation, surgery of permanent implants will take place.",
