      "Content": "I am 33years old. I have had low platelets (idiopathic) since 2004. They used to average in the low 100's and now average in the 70's with occasional dips into the 30's. Since last year I have been taking b12 shots once a month to assist with a very slight b12 deficiency. Last week was informed that I do have a full form of iron deficiency anemia - something that showed up in part in a bone marrow biopsy last year but now is showing up in my blood iron levels. Now tomorrow I get (hopefully) the full results of my first mammogram. The summary that I got to preview online today has benign and calcifications checked off. Not really scared but definitely am concerned because of the following. On June 6th one of my older sisters who is/was 52 (I am the youngest of 7 kids by ten years with four older sisters and two older brothers) passed away. While her actual passing was not 100% due to the stage 4 breast cancer it was the major part of it (she also had an open breast wound). As I have been organizing and trying to piece together items of hers I have found old mammograms that go back to when she was 45 or so that show benign calcifications - these results seem to be roughly the same until 2009 and then I can't find mammograms from 2010 or 2011 but in 2012 she has/had stage 4. My other sisters as of yet have not had any calcifications found. On my maternal side I have a number of cousins who have had breast cancer one when she was only 32 as well as a few aunts with it and my paternal grandmother also had breast cancer as a contributing factor in her death. Not entirely sure how much of the ?'s I have at the moment are based on the family stuff or not but there is concern. Really hoping that when I get the full results (hoping that they will give them to me) tomorrow it will only say macro-calcification but le sigh... knowing I have the anemias the unknown cause platelet problems as well as borderline/pre type 2 (I take metformin) diabetes and have other menstrual problems can't help but be a bit outta it tonight.",

      "Content": "Thank you Didee. It has been an adventure the past couple months. My sister, from 2006-2009 had mammograms that just had acr category 2, benign, and calcifications then (missing 2010 and 2011 mammograms) by April of 2012 had advanced breast cancer (she did have a major stroke in 2009 which may have contributed somewhere along the lines). Her daughters are only 21 & 19 and it has hit them hard. For me there are just so many questions and not wanting to be in a similar situation where things get dismissed because it \"isn't likely\" - having dealt with unknown cause low platelets, unknown cause menorrhagia, iron deficiency that showed first through bone marrow biopsy (showing as something that had been going on for some time) but only showed up in blood levels this year, and random genetic factors that are inherited not acquired which are rare to have in combination in the same family/person (factor 2, 5, and MTHFR).... it is that concept that sometimes what does or doesn't show may not really be what is happening. Getting used to not being able to know when new things come up is a frustration of mine more than the problems that are going on - if I know something of a cause or possible relationship I can work to adjust things but when I don't know and the doctors either do not share or themselves do not know it takes a few days upon hearing something new to relax back into that \"ignorant bliss\" and positive thinking.",

      "Content": "I will be a lot more on the ball than I have been since about September of last year. After the bone marrow biopsy I just had to take a breather for a bit with health stuff - the funny thing was I stopped being concerned, stopped going to the gym, and stopped looking at the scale and my weight went down lol. I know that there is something not quite right. I know that I am looking forward to the gyn tomorrow and that the appointment ideally will run long because I have over two pages of questions. The rough part is one thing the gyn has wanted to do for a year I can't do because of no money for it (hysteroscopy) and I don't see the $$ being there for it for quite sometime. Everything for me is self-pay out of pocket so in a sense I am really lucky as I don't have a primary I only deal with my specialists, I got to choose the doctors that I wanted (yes did a lot of research before going so $$ wouldn't be wasted), and don't have any of those limitations. In general this makes things tons cheaper than insurance but with a major procedure is where I get stuck - especially one that arguably even with insurance might difficult to prove its need. I tend to believe that I have had it worse (well something worse) in the past because in 2006 and the start of 2007 my hair had been very very thin and there were other issues that seemed to suddenly disappear - a couple are back, luckily not the hair thing as my hair continues to get thicker *smiles*. That is great to hear that you managed to be pushy and insist on answers. Read your bio at the bottom - have they figured out the nodule from May?",

      "Content": "I will be a lot more on the ball than I have been since about September of last year. After the bone marrow biopsy I just had to take a breather for a bit with health stuff - the funny thing was I stopped being concerned, stopped going to the gym, and stopped looking at the scale and my weight went down lol. I know that there is something not quite right. I know that I am looking forward to the gyn tomorrow and that the appointment ideally will run long because I have over two pages of questions. The rough part is one thing the gyn has wanted to do for a year I can't do because of no money for it (hysteroscopy) and I don't see the $$ being there for it for quite sometime. Everything for me is self-pay out of pocket so in a sense I am really lucky as I don't have a primary I only deal with my specialists, I got to choose the doctors that I wanted (yes did a lot of research before going so $$ wouldn't be wasted), and don't have any of those limitations. In general this makes things tons cheaper than insurance but with a major procedure is where I get stuck - especially one that arguably even with insurance might difficult to prove its need. I tend to believe that I have had it worse (well something worse) in the past because in 2006 and the start of 2007 my hair had been very very thin and there were other issues that seemed to suddenly disappear - a couple are back, luckily not the hair thing as my hair continues to get thicker *smiles*. That is great to hear that you managed to be pushy and insist on answers. Read your bio at the bottom - have they figured out the nodule from May?",

      "Content": "I am 33years old. I have had low platelets (idiopathic) since 2004. They used to average in the low 100's and now average in the 70's with occasional dips into the 30's. Since last year I have been taking b12 shots once a month to assist with a very slight b12 deficiency. Last week was informed that I do have a full form of iron deficiency anemia - something that showed up in part in a bone marrow biopsy last year but now is showing up in my blood iron levels. Now tomorrow I get (hopefully) the full results of my first mammogram. The summary that I got to preview online today has benign and calcifications checked off. Not really scared but definitely am concerned because of the following. On June 6th one of my older sisters who is/was 52 (I am the youngest of 7 kids by ten years with four older sisters and two older brothers) passed away. While her actual passing was not 100% due to the stage 4 breast cancer it was the major part of it (she also had an open breast wound). As I have been organizing and trying to piece together items of hers I have found old mammograms that go back to when she was 45 or so that show benign calcifications - these results seem to be roughly the same until 2009 and then I can't find mammograms from 2010 or 2011 but in 2012 she has/had stage 4. My other sisters as of yet have not had any calcifications found. On my maternal side I have a number of cousins who have had breast cancer one when she was only 32 as well as a few aunts with it and my paternal grandmother also had breast cancer as a contributing factor in her death. Not entirely sure how much of the ?'s I have at the moment are based on the family stuff or not but there is concern. Really hoping that when I get the full results (hoping that they will give them to me) tomorrow it will only say macro-calcification but le sigh... knowing I have the anemias the unknown cause platelet problems as well as borderline/pre type 2 (I take metformin) diabetes and have other menstrual problems can't help but be a bit outta it tonight.",

      "Content": "Thank you Didee. It has been an adventure the past couple months. My sister, from 2006-2009 had mammograms that just had acr category 2, benign, and calcifications then (missing 2010 and 2011 mammograms) by April of 2012 had advanced breast cancer (she did have a major stroke in 2009 which may have contributed somewhere along the lines). Her daughters are only 21 & 19 and it has hit them hard. For me there are just so many questions and not wanting to be in a similar situation where things get dismissed because it \"isn't likely\" - having dealt with unknown cause low platelets, unknown cause menorrhagia, iron deficiency that showed first through bone marrow biopsy (showing as something that had been going on for some time) but only showed up in blood levels this year, and random genetic factors that are inherited not acquired which are rare to have in combination in the same family/person (factor 2, 5, and MTHFR).... it is that concept that sometimes what does or doesn't show may not really be what is happening. Getting used to not being able to know when new things come up is a frustration of mine more than the problems that are going on - if I know something of a cause or possible relationship I can work to adjust things but when I don't know and the doctors either do not share or themselves do not know it takes a few days upon hearing something new to relax back into that \"ignorant bliss\" and positive thinking.",
