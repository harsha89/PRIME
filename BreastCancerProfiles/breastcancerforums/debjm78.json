This partially confuses me but then I am in the learning curve of this all. My sister was put into her final resting place this morning. I keep thinking over her history and the micro-calcifications that in the course of two years (lacking all her medical records some ?'s do exist) turned into Stage 4 for my sister, about the number of cousins I have that have had breast cancer including one when she was in her early 30's, the aunts, and grandmother, and then all the other instances of other forms of cancer in the family. I am not scared or really worried but on top of the anemias, platelet issues, and so forth there is a concern that I would like to develop a plan of action for.",

Since last year I have been taking b12 shots once a month to assist with a very slight b12 deficiency. Last week was informed that I do have a full form of iron deficiency anemia - something that showed up in part in a bone marrow biopsy last year but now is showing up in my blood iron levels. Now tomorrow I get (hopefully) the full results of my first mammogram. The summary that I got to preview online today has benign and calcifications checked off. Not really scared but definitely am concerned because of the following. On June 6th one of my older sisters who is/was 52 (I am the youngest of 7 kids by ten years with four older sisters and two older brothers) passed away. While her actual passing was not 100% due to the stage 4 breast cancer it was the major part of it (she also had an open breast wound). As I have been organizing and trying to piece together items of hers I have found old mammograms that go back to when she was 45 or so that show benign calcifications - these results seem to be roughly the same until 2009 and then I can't find mammograms from 2010 or 2011 but in 2012 she has/had stage 4. My other sisters as of yet have not had any calcifications found. On my maternal side I have a number of cousins who have had breast cancer one when she was only 32 as well as a few aunts with it and my paternal grandmother also had breast cancer as a contributing factor in her death.

After the bone marrow biopsy I just had to take a breather for a bit with health stuff - the funny thing was I stopped being concerned, stopped going to the gym, and stopped looking at the scale and my weight went down lol. I know that there is something not quite right. I know that I am looking forward to the gyn tomorrow and that the appointment ideally will run long because I have over two pages of questions. The rough part is one thing the gyn has wanted to do for a year I can't do because of no money for it (hysteroscopy) and I don't see the $$ being there for it for quite sometime. Everything for me is self-pay out of pocket so in a sense I am really lucky as I don't have a primary I only deal with my specialists, I got to choose the doctors that I wanted (yes did a lot of research before going so $$ wouldn't be wasted), and don't have any of those limitations. In general this makes things tons cheaper than insurance but with a major procedure is where I get stuck - especially one that arguably even with insurance might difficult to prove its need. I tend to believe that I have had it worse (well something worse) in the past because in 2006 and the start of 2007 my hair had been very very thin and there were other issues that seemed to suddenly disappear - a couple are back, luckily not the hair thing as my hair continues to get thicker *smiles*. That is great to hear that you managed to be pushy and insist on answers. Read your bio at the bottom - have they figured out the nodule from May?",

Hoping that my sisters Brac Analysis will suffice because I don't have the $$ for that especially with the other stuff... On July 10th I go in for a uterine/endometrial biopsy along with ultrasounds. Not sure on price but I believe it is affordable. However.... he impressed much more seriously this year than last year that he really wants me to have the Hysteroscopy with DNC. The problem is that the charge is roughly $12,000 with $6,000 upfront. I don't have anywhere near that amount especially since I lost one of my adjunct positions because of the school being made into a new entity. Not sure how I am supposed to come up with the money but with everything that has happened with family I do believe i need to. Le Sigh!",
