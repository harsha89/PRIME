Does she have and is she taking the prescription the doctor gave her? If she is, and it's not working --- call the doctor immediately and get a better drug to help with the nausea. She needs to take them like clockwork starting the day of the infusion. Staying ahead of the nausea is far easier than trying to stop it once it starts. Best of luck and let us know what happens.

      "Content": "Hi again, I'm sorry that you have so much on your plate. I had previously given you an answer about the spot in your lung in a different forum. I don't have personal experience with these tests, as all the info I'm giving is pre-BRAC test era, but have undergone prophylactic removal of my uterus and ovaries to avoid the chance of ovarian cancer. (My Mom passed from ovarian cancer at barely 61 after a 2 1/2 year battle.) One ovary and a hysterectomy when I was 31 and the last ovary in my later 30's, after it had stopped functioning. Nothing cosmetic necessary with that type of surgery and I was done having my children, so no biggie for me. My daughter chooses not to have the BRCA testing done, because she doesn't want to be in your situation of knowing her risks. She has not had ovarian cancer though, so feels okay about not wanting to know. I suspect she's 'cancered out' after losing her Dad. I'm not sure I agree with her. I just hope her doctors stay on top of things, but know that my Mom did her annual pap smears faithfully and that didn't prevent squat for her. My daughter has a two-generation occurrence of breast cancer on her father's side of the family. As for a mastectomy, my best friend and one other woman I know had doubles after finding cancer in one breast. Apparently it was the type likely to recur in the remaining breast, so they both went for a double. Both were done having children and in their mid to late forties. There is no need for you to feel androgynous. Both of the above women had breast reconstruction and my best friend even did the \"nips.\" Hope this gives you a little insight into what others have done, even though it might not exactly parallel your situation.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm sorry about your friend's cancer diagnosis. My response will be in the context of ovarian cancer, as your friend tested positive for those markers. I'm sure others will be in to help you with the breast cancer issues related to these procedures. I had a hysterectomy and one ovary removed at 31. My mom had died from ovarian cancer, so the doc took one ovary that was encapsulated by a cyst. He couldn't justify taking the second ovary at that age -- at that time. (20 years ago) My remaining ovary stopped functioning by the time I was 34, so I hit full blown menopause. I was not tested for my hormone levels until I was 36. They were bad and I've been on replacement therapy ever since. (Which probably won't be happening for your friend if her cancer is estrogen driven.) As far as I'm aware, the ovaries are what controls estrogen production. A couple of years later, I had the remaining ovary removed during exploratory surgery (un-related.) Figured it was good to get it out, just to be on the safe side. Ovarian cancer wasn't pretty and I wanted to reduce my chances in any way I could. The upshot is that I hit menopause early anyway, with leaving one ovary. I've found that this isn't all that unusual. (It also can happen to women undergoing chemotherapy treatment.) Some women don't have any problems going through menopause and other's have the hot flashes, etc. If her Mom has gone through menopause, that can be somewhat of an insight of what to expect. As far as having no more periods due to the uterus being gone? Yipppeeeeee!!!! Hope this helps a little bit. Best of luck to your friend. God bless, PBJ",

      "Content": "Pubmed is well known by the people here. Most have been dealing with cancer for some time. I find your entire demeanor degrading. We aren't here to be your researcher. We point people to where they can find clinical trials or other information. I doubt you'd find the specific information you are looking for on any general cancer forum. Do try and find a breast cancer site, as I'm quite sure there are many of them given the amount of attention that one cancer receives. Our breast cancer forum is slow due to the abundance of pink forums. Pubmed is part of the National Cancer Institute, which is where you will find clinical trials. They are in various stages of recruiting, active, or closed with/without results posted. At the NCI site you can do a filtered search for trials that might apply to your sister. There may be some sites for trial matching, as I participated in one for NSCLC. Generally speaking, clinical trials are geared more for people who have not undergone either extensive chemotherapy or a specific chemo agent. I'd advise against a Phase I or II trial, when there are proven agents available. Many trials take an approved agent and combine it with something different. I've noticed there is a lot of repetition in trials. Get your opinions from the doctors as to what is the best regimen for her. Get a second and third opinion if need be. NCI approved Cancer Centers are scattered across the United States. Search U.S. News and World Report for their annual ranking of hospitals that specialize in cancer. You can find which cancer is the specialty for each of the top cancer centers/hospitals. While I know a few people that were very involved in helping determine treatment, most lay people are not. Do rely on the doctors. We offer layperson support, comfort, and a safe place for patients and their family members to share. We help with some of the day to day issues that arise when someone is in treatment or a shoulder to lean on when scans are due. Family issues are another area that people bring to our site to discuss. People don't feel so alone when they know others have walked in or are walking in their shoes. My advice to you would be to make sure your sister is alright with your zeal for researching her illness and treatments. Oftentimes family members can easily step over the line with intrusive behavior. That's not what most patients need nor desire. Good luck, PBJ",

      "Content": "Hi -- I can't help but to interject a little into this interesting discussion. First and foremost you need to know that I truly believe in the line of the Lord's Prayer that \"thy will be done.\" That being said, God did not place us here without a brain and I'm pretty sure he wants us to use that for thoughtful decisions. Congratulations to both posters on having two precious daughters born to you. For Spiritlead, I have to say that when you choose to have a child, you are responsible to take care of yourself to see to it that you are around to raise that child. For someone so fortunate to have limited and slow growing cancer to not take advantage of appropriate proven treatment flies in the face of logic and responsibility. There are so many who would give their eye-teeth to be in your position and have a very curable cancer in an area with an 85% survival rate. I guess I'm posting this as a caveat to others who may stop by and read your non-traditional choices and embrace them with possible lethal consequences. It goes to the old saying that playing with fire gets you burned. I hope things continue to go well for you on this path, but would encourage you to seek the help of doctor's that God has given curative solutions to. I guess I'm on the same thought track as MyMaria, without being nearly so eloquent. My only real question is did you have a biopsy to get your initial diagnosis? PBJ",

She'd know it, as the drains have to be cleaned and there is training involved. Sadly, once effusion starts, it is usually tied to the cancer. If she's not going to have more treatment, then the effusion will likely continue. My husband had 23 thoracentesis procedures, as he didn't want to do pleurodesis. He continued having thoracentesis until very shortly before he passed, so a good lung specialist should be willing to do this to keep her comfortable. Vee is right -- the weight loss is troubling, especially in light of the fact that she's retaining fluid. My husband would gain a bit because of the effusion, but overall his weight continued to drop. God bless, PBJ",

I was busy raising kids and taking care of my husband, so there was no time to fall apart. It would hit me at odd times and I'd cry some here and there. I never did have a big meltdown and I'm not sure that everyone does. Tera is right. The horrific memories of how they died do calm down as time passes and you begin to remember the good times before the illness. I can't add much to what Tera wisely told you, but if you think a grief support group or therapy would help, then go for it. My daughter is in grief therapy now over the loss of her father. People all grieve differently. There is no right or wrong way. Many hugs, PBJ",
