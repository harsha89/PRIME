    "Content": "I had a brain tumor, but I was treated with tamox. and other breast cancer chemo for a while so I though this might be a good section for my question. I had that stretch of treatment about 10 years ago now. Over the past 5 or 6 years I had noticed my periods were fairly breif. In the last year I noticed them getting shorter and shorter, 1-2 days in the last several months. And now they have stopped all together. I did talk to my doc about this already. I'm just curious, has anyone experenced the same thing? Is it quite common as a long term effect? edit: I've been reading upon early menopause and perimenopause. If it was tat it would take a load off my mind, as the past 2-3 yearshave been nuts with the mood swings. I even went to see a psychiatrist last november. I'll talk to my doc some more.",
