I was in such a panic that I didn't even ask what type of biopsy. Can anyone who's already had a biopsy tell me how much tissue is usually removed and is it painful.

My last mammogram showed that there was a new area of calcifications, close to my chest wall and these are the ones that need further investigation. I find it strange that there is no treatment available to 'get rid' of these calcifications before they develop into something more sinister!! My best friend died of BC and I have other friends/aquaintances who have BC, one friend in particular has had lots of problems and her health is poor from all the medication and chemo she's received.
