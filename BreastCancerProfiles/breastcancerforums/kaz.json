      "Content": "Hi, I'd be greatful for any information anyone can give me regarding the following: I had a mamography on Friday, in fact I had three, very worrying but was told that the results would be sent to my doctor shortly. The same afternoon my doctor phoned me and said that the milcocalcifications (I think that's what she said) have clustered in another part of my breast and that I will be allocated an appointment very soon for a biopsy. I was in such a panic that I didn't even ask what type of biopsy. Can anyone who's already had a biopsy tell me how much tissue is usually removed and is it painful. Has anyone who's been in the same situation as me decided not to go through with a biopsy and if so do you have any regrets etc. Thank you in advance Kaz",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies, its certainly put my mind as ease. I had a phone call this morning from my doctor's surgery to say that I will be having an appointment within the next few days to go for a Core Biopsy. I have had mommograms for several years, six months ago I was told I had calcifications. My last mammogram showed that there was a new area of calcifications, close to my chest wall and these are the ones that need further investigation. I find it strange that there is no treatment available to 'get rid' of these calcifications before they develop into something more sinister!! My best friend died of BC and I have other friends/aquaintances who have BC, one friend in particular has had lots of problems and her health is poor from all the medication and chemo she's received. I will keep you posted on the outcome of my results. A very big thank you once again. I've learned such a lot by reading all your postings and I wish you all very good health Thank you Kaz",

Did you have a biopsy, what type did you have? I am waiting for an appointment for my biopsy, unfortunately I don't know type of biopsy I am going to have yet. Thank you in advance and I hope all is well with you. kaz",
