    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm sorry if this feels a little misplaced, but we're spreading the word that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and that my company, 1-800Free411 is donating $1 for every new caller in October (up to $25,000) and will go to the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund. Please help...we have to make more progress to hit our goal! For all the details and to \"Pass the Ribbon\" about important health information to family and friends, go to www.Free411.com/pink My best wishes to all, Paul",
