    "Content": "My Dad used to be the one who kept me in line, now he is so thin and withered.. to use your word. I can't stand seeing him like this and up until recently I wouldn't want to be around him, because he wasn't himself obviously and I just didn't want to accept that this was my life. I never cried. Today for some reason it hit me. I couldn't stop crying, I felt guilty too before, but it's not that you don't love your mum, you just haven't cried about everyone shows their grief in different ways. Took me a while to figure that one out. Don't bother going to riprap by the way(just saw the post above mine), I looked at it because I'm 16 so I thought it would be good, but no ones' posed on the forums for like a year.",
