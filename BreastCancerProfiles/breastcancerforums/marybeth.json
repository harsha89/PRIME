It took a while but between that WBC shot, chemo and Prednisone to block that nasty reaction, I'll have to wait for next chemo round to see just how chemo alone affects me. Go for blood work Wed so I'll see if that shot did the trick it was supposed to (considering it threw me a whammy). I guess a week post next chemo I'll have a better idea of what my WBC will do on it's own. Just thought I'd check in and thank everyone again for your replies, prayers and thoughts. Praying for all of you on this end too!! MB",

      "Content": "My first chemo was Tues 3/15 and I was feeling great. Yesterday I went for a scheduled Neulasta shot (to promote WBC production before it drops) and within an hour I was rushed to the hosp by ambulance. It came on suddenly - Initially, I felt the bone pain they told me might happen but it was so severe I almost dropped to the floor, then a full body flush, heart racing, very short of breath and very weak. By the time the ambulance got there (6 min) , I had developed severe stomach cramps, gone pale, worse shortness of breath and my heart rate went down to 50 -BP stayed in a normal range. I was in triage when the cramping subsided and I started feeling a little better so they just monitored me for the next hour and 1/2 and then my vitals were normal. So it all straightend itself out without any benedryl etc. The pamphlet I have says Neulasta is made with the E Coli bacteria... I have a call in to the Dr. (they had called ahead that I was coming in by amulance so knew about the reaction) and I want to know what alternative we have. Today I feel crappy but I think that might be the chemo - little shaky, tired, just not well. Does Dr. Jay have any insight and has anyone else out there experienced such a reaction? (I think this is going to be a very long summer for me!) Thanks for any insight you can give. That was REALLY scary! MB",

      "Content": "Hi - Anyone experience this? I am post chemo almost 2 months now and everything is growing back. What I've noticed is tender pimple-like lumps on my head where the hair is starting to grow back and then a day or so later they're gone. Then all of a sudden I got a sty on each eye - one on an upper lid, the other on the lower lid. Just a few days later, my eylashes started coming in. So, I figured this was par for the course as the hairs pop thru. Now, 2 days ago, I found several (like 4 or 5) lumps in my armpit and the hair is just starting to grow there. Nearly paniced as you can well imagine, but they were tender and really felt like a pimple forming under the skin. Then I checked the other arm and lo and behold 2 or 3 of them there. That made me fell better having them pop up under both arms at the same time but then all of a sudden they disappear and now I just noticed they're back and larger under one arm. I'm still figuring hair folicles but I think I'd better have it checked out just in case swollen lymph nodes. Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply. after finding out that sometimes the heart will recover a bit once the offending drug is elimiated, I decided to calm down about it and talk to the Drs. about what it all means to me, and their recommendation for the future. I did not know, however, that Herceptin might be able to be re-introduced. I'll ask about that too. That would be great if the overall benefit is there. Even though my prognosis was good before I even knew about Herceptin, I really want to do anything I can to avoid reoccurance, and Herceptin seemed to be so promising! Thanks again for your response.

      "Content": "this is how I understood my surgery: My surgeon explained to me that during my lumpectomy he tried 3 times for clear margins, unsuccessful. I later had a left mastectomy. When trying for the sentinel node on the lumpectomy, the \"activity\" had died down and difficulty identifying the sentinel so he removed 5 nodes. He said the report said 1-4 were clean, #5 had cancer. My oncologist called it 'microscopic cancer\" in the node when I questioned the extent of cancer in that node. the path report on my lumectomy indicates: Lymph Node (1) designated left sentinel, excision: Negative for malignancy. Then, further down the report, Lymph nodes (4) designated Left, excision: Metastatic ductal carcinoma in one of four identified lymph nodes (1/4) Questions: 1) can cancer skip one thru 4 and get into 5? I thought cancer cells 'drained' in order of 1, 2, 3 etc - ? Or could the cancerouse node actually be #1 since it was hard to locate it during surgery and then 2-4 were clean? 2) does the path report indicate the extent of cancer in the node? it doesn't seem to. I'm wondering what made him think 'microscopic' all I see is \"metastatic\" #)My concern is in removing only 5 nodes and cancer showing in #5, could there be more lymph nodes involved. My surgeon explained that my course of treatment (A/C 4 every other week, then Taxol same) would not change even with more node involvement and so they don't remove additional nodes in order to reduce the chance of lymphedema. Do you concur? Thank you in advance for all your help. This forum helps me to know if I need to ask additional questions of my oncologist! MB",

      "Content": "Hi everyone - things are going prettywell, back to work a few months now. I was on tamoxafin for 3 months, had a trans vag test and it showed an 8mm thickening of the uterine lining. I go for a D&C tomorrow so we'll see what that shows. My chemo ended Aug 23 and my hair, eyebrows, lashes came back very nicely. I have about 2 in. on my head but I've noticed recently that my eyebrows are thinning and it seems my lashes are too and those that are still there are quite shorter than they were. So far seems my head hair is OK. Does tamoxafin, coreg (heart med, my heart's ejection fraction went down with herceptin so discontinued) or maybe even paxil? That's all I'm on. The Doc took me of the tamaoxafin until the D&c results so I'm feeling really \"naked\" not taking anything to ward off the beastly cancer cells. Any thoughts, Dr. Leo and Ladies?",

It took a while but between that WBC shot, chemo and Prednisone to block that nasty reaction, I'll have to wait for next chemo round to see just how chemo alone affects me. Go for blood work Wed so I'll see if that shot did the trick it was supposed to (considering it threw me a whammy). I guess a week post next chemo I'll have a better idea of what my WBC will do on it's own. Just thought I'd check in and thank everyone again for your replies, prayers and thoughts.

      "Content": "Hi Dr. Leo and everyone. I just 10 minutes ago rec'd some bad news and am freaked out but trying to calm down. I have had MUGA scans every 2 months since I started chemo in March. Did 4 rounds A/C and I've done 7 rounds of taxol with herceptin and my MUGA scan results yesterday were not good. I started as a baseline of 56%, then went to 54% and yesterday am down to a 49% ejection fraction. I'll continue with my last rounds of taxol but the oncol nurse just told me \"no more herceptin\". I am one, freaked out that I can't/won't have the protection that I was counting on with Herceptin and wonder what this does to my prognosis?! and two, am concerned that I may have heart damage? I'm to meet with my cardiologist and oncologist within the next few weeks. Any insight or suggestions on questions for my drs? Thanks all! MB",

I see my oncol tomorrow, so will find out about the herceptin. After thinking about it and reading up, seems its better to not continue herceptin rather than risk heart damage. Sort of defeats the purpose of all this ya know? I think b/c I am not or at least WAS not post-meno when all this started, I begin Tamoxafin first and then move to Arimadex....I'll check on that tomorrow.

      "Content": "Hi Diana - I had a left modified mastectomy on 1/14 this year. I was virtually PAIN FREE - honestly! My Dr. supplied me with something called \"On Q pain buster\". You must ask your Dr. about it, I understand some use it, others don't but try to insist if you can. It was a miracle for me. It is an anesthetic that is releaased to the mastectomy site over a period of 4 to 5 days thru a catheter of some sort. The medicine is in a bulb that you carry in a fanny pack type thing. It totally, and I mean totally, numbs the site. By the time the medicine was gone, I was over that hump of screaming pain that I was anticipating and just sore for a few weeks. Totally manageable. I was up moving around in just a few days and was well enough to go out for lunch/dinner within a week. I was in a temporary prosthesis in 8 days. What a miracle to be able to be comfortable when having to experience a mastectomy and deal with the emotional impact of cancer. It tremendously helped my state of mind too. As for chemo, I was originally scheduled for 4 rounds of AC every 2 weeks followed by taxol same but because I had a reaction to another med (not the chemo) I'm now doing it every 3 weeks instead of 2. I have had 3 AC treatments so far and have done amazingly well. I do feel crappy (tired, shaky, lethargic) for 4 to 5 days folowing but it isn't to the point to keep me in bed. week 2 is better and truthfully week 3 is as though chemo never happened. can't tell you about Taxol (yet), that starts in about 6 weeks. I'm scheduled to also do herceptin since I was Her2 + (did you hear about the great results of that study?) weekly for 52 weeks. I am not at all happy with THAT for another year of my life ,but would be foolish not to do it. It may SAVE my life. The results have been very promising to reduce reoccurance. I didn't do reconstruction yet but am planning too. I am planning on implants and actually thinking of removing my other breast too. If you told me I would be thinking this way 6 months ago I'd tell you you were nuts but after reading a lot and talking to my Dr., it's another way to reduce the reoccurrance risk, & I would have double implants (perky again! YEA). I chose not to work thru this so am on disability. I didn't want to be obligated to go into the office if I felt sick and just didn't want to think of work during this and wanted to concentrate on getting better. Many people work and if I wanted to I would do fine. So far, my energy level is pretty good and I feel well a good part of the time. Best of luck to you. Post more questions if you have them! MB",

I was feeling really crappy yesterday and the Dr. office called to tell me that the manufactuer said that my reaction happenes in 1 in 4,000 patients!

As it turns out, Neulasta is a time released drug over a 12 day period so the office had me come in to be checked out and thought that I was feeling some effects of both chemo and the shot.

I'm now on the 6 month plan rather than 4 months. Since I may be having a combined reaction to chemo and the shot, can someone tell me what is 'typically' normal for a chemo reaction and how long you should feel crappy?

      "Content": "My first chemo was Tues 3/15 and I was feeling great. Yesterday I went for a scheduled Neulasta shot (to promote WBC production before it drops) and within an hour I was rushed to the hosp by ambulance. It came on suddenly - Initially, I felt the bone pain they told me might happen but it was so severe I almost dropped to the floor, then a full body flush, heart racing, very short of breath and very weak. By the time the ambulance got there (6 min) , I had developed severe stomach cramps, gone pale, worse shortness of breath and my heart rate went down to 50 -BP stayed in a normal range. I was in triage when the cramping subsided and I started feeling a little better so they just monitored me for the next hour and 1/2 and then my vitals were normal. So it all straightend itself out without any benedryl etc. The pamphlet I have says Neulasta is made with the E Coli bacteria... I have a call in to the Dr. (they had called ahead that I was coming in by amulance so knew about the reaction) and I want to know what alternative we have. Today I feel crappy but I think that might be the chemo - little shaky, tired, just not well. Does Dr. Jay have any insight and has anyone else out there experienced such a reaction? (I think this is going to be a very long summer for me!) Thanks for any insight you can give. That was REALLY scary! MB",

      "Content": "All went well with my left simple mastectomy on 1/14 and on 2/7 was scheduled for my port. The previous week I noticed several symptoms, although did not feel sick, just wasn't 'myself'. First a low grade fever for 3 nights and ONLY at night <101..loss of appetite and an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach that I thought at the time was nerves. But truthfully, couldn't figure why I was so nervous about the port when I had less anxiety going thru a mastectomy! Anyway, then I started to notice that my urine was extremely dark and concentrated and my stool was very light, almost gray. I didn't feel truly sick but mentioned it to my dr. before the surgery and he noted that my skin was yellow. I was jaundiced! Port cancelled and spent 3 days in the hospital with full testing of liver, pancreas, gall bladder etc. CT scans, MRIs and neuclear type testing too. All thank God were negative for cancer, blocked bile ducts, etc and all looked OK. My oncologist visting bedside said that the jaundice could be due to the general anesthesia given me during mastectomy and that my liver had difficutly processing it. Uncommon but it happens. The gastro Dr. concurred and said he's seen it although it happens to about 1 out of 1,000 pts (lucky me) I was told that if that was the case, my billirubin level would peak, and then start to come down which is exactly what it did. I went from 5.6 to 3.4 inside a week and a week later was down to normal at .6....I do not like process of elimination when determining my health but it seems they could have been right on. I had no treatment or meds, so I would think if I had a liver disease or something else going on my levels would not have been back to normal. Since this seems to be an uncommon occurrance, have the Drs seen this type of medical issue or heard of it before? And, what in heaven's name will chemo do to my liver if it couldn't handle general anesthesia? Thanks in advance! MB",

      "Content": "Hi Regi -- Thanks for replying! If you notice, you responded to a post I did over 2 years ago. Here's an update on what when on since then: In Feb of 2006 I decided to have my other breast removed and had tissue expanders place. I did weekly 'expanding\" and in May of 06 I had saline implants done. A few months later I had nipple reconstruction and I actualy have 'projection' as they call it; basically a protruding 'nipple' that amazingly looks real. A few weeks after that I had the areaola tattooed in. I am extremely happy with the results and couldn't have asked for a better outcome. Just 2 weeks ago I had my ovaries removed to reduce the change of ovarian cancer (my cancer was an aggressive ER+) and so since the beginning, when I was diagnosed in Jan of 05 to Feb 08 I have gone through 9 surgeries. (mastecomies, port in, port out, expanders in/out etc etc) A lot to endure, but in the end I am cancer free and thrilled with the results. Tremendous thanks to the care of my surgeon and plastic surgeon's here in Syracuse, NY. Dr. Maini and Dr. Guillermo Quetell. They are wonderful caring Docs! Thanks so much for the reply.",

      "Content": "Hi Melissa! I haven't been on in quite a while and just saw your post. I had a bi lateral mastectomy with tissue expanders and scheduled for permanent implants this Nov 16th. I, too, was told the same by my PS - more natural feel etc. and he gave me much information regarding silicone vs. saline for me to make the 'informed decision'. Well, basically many women who have the unfortunate event of silicone leakage claim to have become sick, sort of an immune system thing. From everything I have read, there is no proof evidence to prove their claim. SO. I tettered back and forth, thinking about it while I had the expanders. Then during treatment it seemed I wasn't expanding much and my PS suspected a leak. Back to surgery to find 2 pinholes at the bottom of each one, they were leaking! (Dr. replace with different expanders and sent back the others to the mfg claiming defect). I have to admit, that experience made my decision. If that were silicone, what could it have been doing to me? I had one leak; I'm not taking any chances with another. It's saline for me. I have to admit that another of my decisions is based on the fact that the claim is (for some of the drugs I am on) that they don't cause joint pain \"there's no evidence\" is the satement I hear time and again. Well, I can see on many other posts, woman after woman has joint pain from drugs that the Dr. claims 'no evidence it causes joint pain'. So even though there is no 'evidence\" that silicone causes problems - why take a chance? Hope this helps! MB",

      "Content": "Roberta, Hi - I too, started my hair loss on day 13. I had already gone out and got my wig so I had my head shaved that day. My hairdresser turned me around from the mirror, buzzed cut me and made sure all the hair went behind me on the floor so I wouldn't see it dropping into my lap. When it was done, she put the wig on me, styled it and off I went. She said \"you go home and when you are ready, take your wig off\". I did just that and it really was not that bad. (Kinda looked like I was in the army LOL) I can't say I didn't cry in the chair a bit, but I will say it was the best thing for me to do. I avoided all that hair falling out on my pillow, on my shoulders etc. Within 4 days I was completely bald but I was already wearing the wig so it wasn't such a big deal. I just finished chemo a week ago today (YEEEAA) and my hair started growing back a few weeks ago. It will take another few months before I go without the wig. The most important part of this is LIKE YOUR WIG. Spend the money if you can to get a decent one that you feel comfortable in. I went to a Hair Replacement Studio that does only replacements and wigs. I go back every couple of months to have it serviced and I don't even remember I'm wearing it most times. It took months but I also did loose my eyelashes and eyebrows but you'd never know. I pencil in the brows and wear eyeliner. No one can tell. I'm always told \"you look great!\" -- AND I am always asked why I didn't loose my hair. People are stunned when I say it's a wig. It's all 'doabable' to look good. If it's important to you to look good during this tough time, take the time to do it and you'll eliminate one of the more stressful times we women go thru when we loose our hair. Then, put it behind you and concentrate on getting better. I hope you are tolerating chemo well. I was one of the lucky ones and didn't feel as some do. I pray you do well during these next few months. Hope I helped. MB",

I did have a 'die' test, and seems the port is still in place and chemo can go in, but a 'sheath'(?) of some sort is preventing a blood return. I understand this is quite common and last chemo vistthey just drew blood from my arm to check my levels. Will see Dr. next week, but the nurse told me that there is a \"medicine\" they can try that is put thru the port to dissolve this sheath. Anyone know anything about it? I only have 6 more chemos, but am doing herceptin till next June so I'll have to have the port replaced I guess if this doesn't work. Any other suggestions to avoid more surgery?

I wanted to let you know, and encourage others who are just going through this, that I have just finished reconstruction with implants. I was dx 2 1/2 years ago Stage II w/ lymph node involvement. A year later I deciced to remove the other breast and do the implant reconstruction. I have no evidence of disease and, although it has been a tough couple of years with many surgeries and having to endure that dreaded chemo, it was all worth it to stay alive and get my life back. As so many have posted, stay positive, know you can do this and if you decide to do reconstruction I hope you are as happy with your results as I am. Both my mastectomy surgeon and plastic surgeons are wonderful doctors. It is important that you trust them. You are putting your life in their hands so find the Dr. you feel comfortable with. I believe it made all the difference in the world. Prayers for everyone! MB",

      "Content": "Hi -- I am a very recently diagnosed BC patient and first time poster. I saw your question about implants and radiation. I too may need radiation following chemo (oncologist appt next week to review pathology report and determinefinal treatment plan). As I understand what I was told, implants MAY not be a reasonable alternative after radiation because the blood supply to the skin may be compromised from the radiation and in stretching the skin to fulfull a 'cup' size the skin may be too thin and split. I have been told by another Dr. that implants would not be out of the question if I opted for a small implant - A or B cup only and therefore a minimum amount of stretching. Don't know if this reasoning is accurate for your situation, but hope the information helps! MB",

      "Content": "I, too, am a member of the paranoid club LOL....however the paranoia paid off for an early dx.. I have a nurse friend that always thought I was a hypocondriac when it came to certain aches/pains/symptoms. I went to the Dr. twice with nipple discharge just 2 months after my yearly mamo. Both times to be told the pathology came back 'clean of cancer cells'. I went back again a few months later after finding what I was absolutely sure was a fibroid in the same breast (had lots of experience with fibroids), but just wanted to be sure. So, the sonogram showed that it actually was only a fibroid. BUT that sonogram also showed a tiny 6mm tumor NEXT TO the fibroid. Dx was Stage II Grrade 3! (one lymph node involved), and mastectomy. My yearly mamogram wasn't scheduled for another 6 months! So much for paranoia. She now tells me \"well you sure showed me!\" and admits she would have probably not gone back after the first 'clean of cancer cells' report. She promises that she will now pay more attention to symptoms and follow up on all of them. I guess it sometimes does take your misfortune to help others. So I say, you go girl and always \"question\" anything ! MB",

      "Content": "Hi everyone! Thought I'd bring everyone up to date since you have all sent good thoughts and prayers for me for my treatment. Have just about sailed thru AC #2 and #3 after that \"Neulasta disaster\" as I call it (I'm the one who had a 1 in 4,000 severe reaction to it and was rushed to the hospital). I have had minimal naseau (thank you God for meds and the fatigue seems to be a week after for me probably due to my hematocrit lower at 32 with some shortness of breath but overall I am doing so well. So in light of not being able to boost my WBC with the shot, my treament plan got changed to AC every 3 weeks and then Taxol for 12 weeks once a week (instead of the original 1 every 2 weeks). This info was relayed to me by the onc nurse. I have not seen my onc since I started chemo (always the NP) since he was out sick the day I was scheduled to see him and now I find out he is 'out for a month'.(sure not happy about that either btw). I will see his associate next week hopefully. Anyway, I have not yet been able to talk to a Dr. about why they'd do a lower dose of taxol every week other than the nurse telling me it would be 'tolerated better' but I'd like some more info and if, b/c of lower dose, would MY side effects be less than dose dense? Has anyone done weekly lower dose taxol? and any thoughts from Dr. Leo? OH and btw, I think my hair is growing back! seems odd still doing AC but the little that WAS left after I shaved it is 'taller' LOL... Sending good thoughts to all going thru this! MB",

During chemo it went down, the lowest to 49% after 6 rounds of Herception. I had to stop Herceptin due to that 49%). Anyway once stopped the EF went up to 52% which isn't too bad, but just this Friday (I still have the MUGA scans every 4 months) it's down to 45%. NOT good at all. The Dr. is 'concerned, but not overly yet\" (doesn't THAT make me feel good) so he increased my heart medicine. I was FREAKED out beyond belief thinking \"cured of cancer and the now cure could kill me\". I am now comitted to walking every day, did a few miles both yesterday and today so far, and watching what I eat. I am hoping that excercise, will strengthen the heart muscle to increase the EF or at worst, keep it where it is. Is it possible to reverse, or at least improve, the damage done by chemo? And, can I still expect to live a long life with a low EF? I feel pretty good considering it all! Pls let me know your thoughts. Thanks for your help. MB",

Well, today was #1 Taxol and did fine with the first pre-meds but crashed on the Benadyrl. BENADRYL of all things! they use that to block reactions, not cause them don't they? What I got was 50mgs thru my port and was told I would probably be tired. Well, I started to get very drowsy then I could feel my heart pumping, then started with the shakes. Felt very nervous, and agitated and started having what I think were panic attacks - a sudden rush of fear. terrible. I sat there thinking this is just too intesnse so got the nurse. They took my bp and good Lord it was 198/98, heart rate was 110. (premed was 135/80 and 85) They flushed me for 1/2 hr.and gave me 1/2mg Ativan. I stared to come down to earth (I couldn't even focus or stand up) and then they started the taxol. You can imagine I was a wreck getting that taxol and they were wachting me like a hawk LOL.... Feel much better now 8 hours later. Can you imagine? breeze thru taxol and react the benadryl - go figure. Wonder if the dose was just too high for me and would have done ok with 25mgs?But they decided I should try Claratin tonight and forget the benedryl for now. and then premed at home the day of taxol with 1 claratin. Hope that works - Any thoughts? Thanks for your support as always...",

      "Content": "I am seriously thinking of having my other breast removed now that I am more informed than I was when I found out I had breast cancer. What I'm planning to do is implants, I do not want to do the tram flap or other procedures. I'm told by my plastic surgeon that the mastecomy should be done at the same time he is placing the expanders and then he would place an expander under the chest muscle on both sides. I would do periodic visits over 6 months and then have the permanent implants placed. For those with experience with reconstruction what are your experiences and advise on removing the other breast and reconstruction? Also a few questions: Saline or gel implants? My Dr. recommended gel (closer to the 'real thing')and gave me tons of information that indicates they have not been able to prove some illnesses developed by women with gels are due to the implants. He feels they are safe but the decision is totally up to me. He had samples of both, and I agree the gels do feel 'normal', but I don't want to jepordize my health. Thoughts? Not that I'm a sissy especially since I got thru a mastectomyand chemo (and know what to expect if I have the other breast removed) but what degree of discomfort should I expect after the placement of the expanders and also how painful during and after those visits to 'pump up'? I don't have a problem putting myself thru this ordeal; My husband assures me this is totally up to me and if I don't feel I want to do it, he is OK with that. But I think psycologically it would be good for both of us. But, I want to make sure we'd be happy with the result. In the end, would they look 'normal' or at least close to it? I keep thinking 'oh I'll have nice perky boobs' LOL but I want to be realistic in my expectations. I need to make an informed decision and that's why I came to you... Any thoughts/advise would be greatly appreciated. As an aside, this is a next step for me in my life and Dr. Leo and you ladies have been there to offer advise and answer my questions from chemo to head shaving. Here I am done with chemo, my hair, eyelashes and brows almost all grown back and I'm moving on. I remember right after my diagnosis thinking \"dear God where will I be in a year?\" Well, here I am almost that year later and moving on with my life. I hope those just learning of their diagnosis/going thru chemo and reading this will be encouraged to know you CAN do this, just hang in there! I truly appreciate everyone's support. Thank you all!

Knock on wood, really no reaction it seems to the taxol! Started the combination of taxol and herceptin yesterday and so far so good. 9 more taxol/herceptin and then they said once the chemo is done we go to herceptin every 3 weeks. Assume it's a higher dose than the weekly - is that tolerated well too? And, I know it cuts down the reoccurance rate by 52% but not sure HOW. Does it actually destroy cancer cells that it 'detects' or does it prevent the 'formation' (for lack of a better word). As always, thanks! MB",

      "Content": "Hi, Dr. Leo may be the one to answer this. As you know from previous posts, after a bad reaction to Neulasta my A/C treament went from every 2 weeks to every 3 so my WBC could rebound on its own. At the same time the Dr. also said when I started taxol it would now be a lower dose every week for 12 weeks as opposed to 4 cycles every 2 weeks. Why not change it to the every 3 week cycle as in A/C? I seem to remember \"tolerated better\" when I asked but have to admit I don't often see my oncologist, mostly the oncol nurse. Anyway, I have completed 5 taxol (last 3 combined with herceptin) and am doing very very well. Absolutely no side effects, except that this week a bit more tired than usual. Probably catching up to me. My hair IS growing back too! YEA. I am just hoping that in having to adjust my treatment plan, that it 'works'. I know that dose dense has been more successful with agressive cancers, but I guess I just had no choice! Is the prognosis much different? Thanks for your response. MB",

Small stuff - teeny headache and shaky legs. I knew this feeling, but couldn't put a finger on it until a little while ago. This is how I feel when I get seasick without the naseau (ok I'm staring to get just a little queasy but will take my med shortly). Will see how the next few days go. since I seem to be \"OK\" in the last 16 hrs is that an indication this is how it will be or can it still get really bad? MB",
