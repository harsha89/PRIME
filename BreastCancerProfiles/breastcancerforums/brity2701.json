    "Content": "Ok so...I found this thing in my breast, lump I suppose back in Nov. I have had two menstrual cycles since then and it has not changed, size, shape, nada. It is not painful. I'm not even sure what possessed me to check my breast since I haven't been very good about monthly exams. I saw a doc at the health dept in Dec and she said it was just the fibrocystic breasts (spell). And to come back in 3 months and if it's still there they will further evaluate it. She said it feels soft and moveable, but I do not feel the same thing. She then pointed out another place on my breast that she said felt the same, but it did not feel the same to me and that place is now gone. I was on my menstrual cycle when I went in to see her. I asked her if it was normal that a cyst remain unchanged for 2 months, and through two periods and her response was well no, but still. She blaimed it on my caffiene intake, which I have been drinking the same amount of caffiene for atleast 10 years and have recently cut back quite a bit. I am only 25 so I realize the odds are in my favor but it's still in the back of my mind all the time. I guess I'm at a loss here. If you (general you) were me, what would you do? My next appt, the 3 months, is Mar 7th. TIA for your responses!",
