      "Content": "Thank you! I do see on the bottom of the paper that the code is BI-RADS: 4 Suspicious Abnormality. So it sounds like it will be b9--at least the odds are good. I think what worried me is the fact so many more appeared between 2004-and now. Thank you for the explanation of the biopsies. I was wondering if it would be a FNA or what and what was the best one for calcifications. It was so nice of you to reply to me. {{HUGS}} I am SO happy to hear you are doing so well after 6 years. More {{HUGS}}",

      "Content": "Clinical: Previous Abnormal Mammogram The tissue of the left breast is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the sensitivity of the mammogram. There is an area of segmental fine calcifications in the left breast at 1 o'clock in the middle depth. Impression: Suspicious of Malignancy-Assessment Complete. The area of segmental calcifications in the left breast at 1 o'clock in the middle depth appears suspicious of malignancy. A biopsy is recommended. The ultrasound paper wasn't included but found a couple of cyst like stuctures (something like that was on the paper) in my left breast and a cyst in the right. Now, can anyone explain the diagnostic mammogram to me? What does \"suspicious of malignancy\" mean? That I might have cancer? Probably have cancer? What kind of biopsy should I be looking to get? I see the surgeon tommorow so I nned advice fast, so I don't go into this blind. TIA",
