    "Content": "New to forum, but I am my mom's caretaker and very worried. She has stage 4 breast cancer and bone Mets. Recently she has not been walking well and horrific pain. The oncologist found that her spine is a mess due to arthritis and most of all the cancer in her vertebrae has caused significant damage. Some is pressing on her spinal chord. Can anyone give me hope? I'm dying inside.",
