    "Content": "I'm a 23 year old woman. I have a moveable lump in my left breast. It's a bit to the left and up a little from the nipple area, but not quite in the underarm area. There is also an area of \"thickening tissue\" as the doc. called it, further up on the same side almost in the armpit, but still on the chest part. The doc. couldn't find the lump when she first checked my breasts. Only after I put her finger right on it could she find it. She said it moves and feels \"almost squishy\". I found it in October. The free clinic (no insurance) told me to wait a month in case it was menstrual cycle related. It was still there, so I went back. I was told I would have a mammogram in 3 weeks. It was supposed to be today, and they cancelled on me. So, I called the hospital, and will be having a diagnostic and ultrasound next Tuesday. The doc. said it was probably due to my caffeine consumption and said it was consistent with fibrocystic condition of the breasts. The problem is, he said the bump could be a lymph node due to the location. I asked if that meant it could be cancer and he said \"Oh yes, but it moves so that's good\" Then he said that he \"wasn't worried at all\" about it. I\"m pretty confused. The lump is around a centimeter or so, moves, feels kind of oval. I found it during a SBE in October. I'm so scared I have cancer. I have never taken birth control or been pregnant. I did smoke for 4 years, quit thank God! I drink occasionally, like maybe once a month I will have one drink or maybe two tops. So, anyone have any advice for me? I can't eat or sleep and cry all the time. I don't have insurance or family. The hospital said that if I do have it, they will pick up most of the bill. I'm so scared that the bump is a lymph node that is cancerous. I know there are women my age with mets, and I'm scared.",
