    "Content": "My sister - who was diagnosed with breast cancer about 10 years ago - has been treated for mets to the bone for 2 years and now, this last January, it was found to be in her spinal fluid. She was receiving treatment for the spinal fluid mets through her spine (injections like an epidural), but the doctors had to stop that as there was too much scar tissue and the chemo was not getting to her head and everywhere it needed to be. She put off the Ommaya Resevoir and was not interested in it for quite some time. She's now become very week and can't walk (her legs are weak); she's vomitting regularly, and is generally in very poor health. The oncologist did more tests and found that the cancer has now spread to her liver too. She's is currently hospitalized and is scheduled to have the Ommaya resevoir put in today. In her condition, I'm finding it hard to believe that the resevoir and more treatment through that is going to be of any benefit for her - she's very sick and it's hard to imagine that she can get through much more. I lost my mother to cancer years ago and am very realistic about the future and don't wish to see her go through all of this just to continue to be misserable. What are the chances that the treatment through the resevoir will improve her symptoms? Can you please tell me what to expect. My gut tells me it won't be long for her, but I'm just looking for an idea of what to realistically expect. Thank you for any info you can give me.",
