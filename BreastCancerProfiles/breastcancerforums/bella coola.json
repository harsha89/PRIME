      "Content": "Hi everyone I'm back from my \"radiation vacation\" For anyone else out there wondering what the effects might be I'll fill you in with my experience. I did not feel ill at all. The first couple of weeks I felt completely normal with no change in energy level. About half way through (20 treatments) I felt sleepy and would take a nap and that would fix me up for anouther couple of hours. I was also not sleeping quite as well at night, I would wake up and read for an hour or two, I read after that this was a possible side effect. The rest of my journey is not finished yet though. My cancer was invasive, I don't know how I could have gotten that confused, but not in my lymph nodes. Since it was a grade 3 cancer and I'm Her2 positive they have decided that it is in my best interest to do chemo. I did the rad/chemo thing backwards- they gave me permission since I already showed up with the horses, they sure try to keep you happy. So I start chemo Dec 6th for 5 1/2 months. Does anyone else know much about Herseptin, I'm only doing a 91/2 week course of this and it is usually taken for a year. They say that this has proven effective in the new studies. Thanks for the replys, Clare",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed w/ stage 1 ductal in situ breast cancer with close margins in late july, I am 40 yrs old in really great shape, and it did not show up on a mammogram. I went through surgery on Sept 5, to clean up the margins and do a sentinal node biopsy. Feel really good. Anyways, I will be going through radiation next month, which I have to travel a great distance to stay for a month of treatment. I was thinking about taking a couple of horses with me to ride and train with a coach while I am there (what I do for a living). It is an opportunity for me that I have wanted to do for a long time, nothing like making something positive come from this. I would greatly appreciate any comments from people who have recieved radiation and the possible side effects that may make it difficult for my \"dream vactation in disquise\" to be possible. - 3wks radiation treatment-small breasts.",
