    "Content": "I'm a 20 yr, 2x breast cancer survivor. Does anybody have 30 yrs survivorship? I realize I've learned alot about survivorship in the past twenty years and wonder what a 30yr survivor knows. I set up a blog for people with more than 10yrs survivorship to see if there are any lessons to learn. Or does anyone know of a site that lists lessons learned from long time survivors? thanks.",
