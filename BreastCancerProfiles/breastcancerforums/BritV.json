      "Content": "Originally Posted by The Best Around I was researching into the gene about a family that has had a history of breast/ovarian cancer. My wife is 26. On her dad's side of the family, multiple people have had these cancers. However, neither of her parents have had cancer in this area. Does she have the BRCA gene? The one where you have a 50%-85% of developing one of these cancers? Thanks. There really is no way to know. My family had a very strong history. My mother died at age 38 from breast cancer, her mother, my grandmother also died at 44. There is also history on my fathers side. I was diagnosed in 2011 and tested for the gene, but it was negative. The probability that she has it is pretty low. But, she could take the test. Knowledge is power!",
