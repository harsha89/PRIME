      "Content": "Hi Ladyblue, I am very sorry to hear of your diagnosis but you have come to the right place to get help and support from others who are going through similar experiences. Hopefully, we can all get through things together. I know very little about your particular cancer, other than that it is a breast cancer. I do see that yyou have visited the BC Forum on this site, which is the right place to get answers from others fighting the same disease. You may want to consider starting your own post there so you can maintain a running chronicle of your journey, some find that helpful. I wish you well and good luck with your treatments, Laadyblue. Please don't hesitate to reach out and we will be here and do the best we can to help. Good health, kermica",

In order for us to be helpful, it is very useful to know the type of cancer your Mom has, can you tell us that? It also sounds like you should speak with her care team directly to get more facts about what can be done to help your Mom fight. A month sounds like a long time to wait if the cancer is treatable. If it isn't, which could be the case, then you need to know this so that you can do everything possible to make your mother comfortable. I will be sending good thoughts and prayers your way and wish that I had more useful information for you at this point. Contact her doctor's office, with her permission, and they should be willing to tell you what you need to know. Then, come back to us and we will do everything in our power to be helpful.

I had 40 radiation treatments to my groin area and experienced quire a bit of redness, irritation and discomfort as the treatments went on. Your skin does recover with time after treatment is finished, though some discoloration or dryness may linger for quite a while. I found that using a 99.9% pure aloe gel provided some comfort during that time, you may want to give it a try. My RO nurse was the one who suggested it. I hope things get better for you, good luck.

      "Content": "Hi Pat and welcome to our little community of travelers. Sorry you find yourself here but it is a good place to spend time if you are dealing with cancer. Regarding yur question, there are two schools of thought, for sure. It seems that radiologists and surgeons sometimes take the position that they have \"gotten it all\" and so don't recommend chemo as part of an everall treatment plan. Oncologists, generally, tend to think that overkill is a good thing and will recommend chemo just in case there are a few cancer cells still in your body. their thinking is that killing them now will do more to make the possibility of a return minimal than not doing the chemo. Because my cancer is slow growing, I have chosen to wait until the disease is more advanced before getting chemo but my disease is very different from yours. If you are still uncertain, I would recommend that you consider a third opinion from a National Cancer Institute certified comprehensive cancer treatment center. They are located throughout the country and a list of them can be found here: http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/canc...ters-list.html I am no expert regarding BC but do think another of discussion of how chemo might enhance the possibility of long term remission is probably worth your timee. Good luck with everything. Good health, kermica",

My friend knows about my lymphoma and has asked me for help in understanding the situation and what they should expect. I do know that she is staged as 3c. My question is this: what additional information should I be asking for in order to be of help to my friend and his wife?

July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc, have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer. Surgery scheduled for 7/12. September 2018 - biopsy of mass in nose shows transformed DLBCL throughout. Assessing options for this negative development. October 2018 - started 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP. Goal is to get to full remission to open up other options. February/March 2019 - PET shows four hot spots following R-CHOP. referred to Dana Farber for stem cell transplant. Pre testing all good, accepted for Auto Transplant. Will begin inpatient process about April 1.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, my friend's sister in law got back to me and told me that the diagnosis is Stage 3C Invasive Ductal Carcinoma with lymph node involvement. Based on my reading, it sounds like they are in for a tough fight with about 50/50 odds of winning. I know every case is different, depends on lots of factors, etc...but am trying to validate the information that I have so, does that sound about right? The mastectomy is done, I am not sure if the ovaries were taken at the same time. Radiation scheduled to start in about a week, assume chemo would come later, yes? Thanks for any information, the husband of the patient has asked me for reassurances that everything will work out and I am trying to get reality dialed in so that I know how to proceed with him. Good health, kermica",

      "Content": "Hi yellowrose, I am very sorry that you have found yourself in this situation. All of us here understand how very scary it is to be told that you are probably facing cancer. I went three weeks from being told lymphoma when I woke up from my biopsy to confirmation from my surgeon. It was a trip to hades I hope to never repeat. What you are feeling is normal. Up and down, hope and despair, defiance and fear are all part of the waiting time and many of us will tell you that the waiting time is the worst time of all. There are many caring and knowledgable people here who can help you with answers and support as you go through this. Please also remember that a diagnosis of cancer is not a death sentence. Many cancers are survivable and many are curable. Until you know what you are facing specifically try to relax, stay away from internet searches for answers and try to spend your time doing things that you enjoy. This can help to take your mind off things while you wait to see the doctor. Have you visited the breast cancer forum on this site? There are stories from many, many women who are dealing with what you are facing. I am sure they can help you with this phase of things. You can reach it by clicking here: http://www.cancerforums.net/forums/1...t-Cancer-Forum or from our main forum page. I wish only good fortune as you go through this, yellowrose. Think about bringing your family into things, they will be one of your most important support nets as you make this journey. Good helath, kermica",

I just wanted to say hello and that you are doing the right thing by following up on your mammogram. All of us here who have been diagnosed understand the stress and fear that are always part of that time when you are waiting and worried because a doctor has indicated a possibility of cancer. Try to spend your time doing things that you love, whatever they may be, and stay away from the internet. Until one has a definitive diagnosis, spending time with Dr. Google will only increase your fear and uncertainty. Finally, be aware that many who come here undiagnosed happily leave after finding out that they do not have cancer. May you be one of those fortunate folks. Good health, kermica",

      "Content": "Hi yellowrose, I am very sorry that you have found yourself in this situation. All of us here understand how very scary it is to be told that you are probably facing cancer. I went three weeks from being told lymphoma when I woke up from my biopsy to confirmation from my surgeon. It was a trip to hades I hope to never repeat. What you are feeling is normal. Up and down, hope and despair, defiance and fear are all part of the waiting time and many of us will tell you that the waiting time is the worst time of all. There are many caring and knowledgable people here who can help you with answers and support as you go through this. Please also remember that a diagnosis of cancer is not a death sentence. Many cancers are survivable and many are curable. Until you know what you are facing specifically try to relax, stay away from internet searches for answers and try to spend your time doing things that you enjoy. This can help to take your mind off things while you wait to see the doctor. Have you visited the breast cancer forum on this site? There are stories from many, many women who are dealing with what you are facing. I am sure they can help you with this phase of things. You can reach it by clicking here: http://www.cancerforums.net/forums/1...t-Cancer-Forum or from our main forum page. I wish only good fortune as you go through this, yellowrose. Think about bringing your family into things, they will be one of your most important support nets as you make this journey. Good helath, kermica",

Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosed September 2012. Mohs surgical excision 09/2012. Successful, clean edges all around. Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation.

You should visit our Breast Cancer Forum where you will find many caring folks who are in the same kind of fight your Mom is and they can provide information, support and advice as she makes this journey. i read about graviola fruit , that it cures cancer Regarding graviola fruit, I am sorry to tell you that this will not cure your mother. It may not hurt her but it will not cure her. To date, there has been some positive results from laboratory and mouse testing but there is no scientific proof that this is the way to go. Another thing to remember is that the seed of the soursop tree contains neurotoxins that can hurt. Be careful with this path. It is in your best interest to get a second opinion of the tissue samples derived from your Mom's upcoming biopsy. That can never hurt, especially if you can have that opinion rendered by a major cancer research center. Good luck to your Mom and I hope the biopsy is uneventful, as it should be...
