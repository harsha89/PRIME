      "Content": "Hi, Has anyone heard from their oncologists regarding the recently completed studies regarding herceptin? Mine just called me and I have an appointment to see her on June 6th. I am in remission -- so I will have to decide if I want to try this as a protective measure................ I don't have details as of yet. i think she would have like to have us there now (she is 3 hours away) We own our own business (I run it) My hubby works for the city -- it is Memorial Day weekend/graduation/plus we are getting ready for a sale.... I think since I am in remission that it is OK to wait until the 6th. Just curious to see if anyone else is looking at herceptin. thanks Debbie",

I qualified for a year of herceptin and finished that in May -- technically it isn't chemo but my insurance company called it chemo and I figure they are paying for it so they can call it whatever they want. I didn't really have any side effects (other than sever leg cramps - cramps in the upper thighs -- my onc wasn't really sure that they were only being caused from the herceptin -- but about 6 weeks after I was all done getting herceptin I had no more leg cramps. It is a long time to be continuing treatment -- but as a her2+ patient I felt that it was worth it. Good Luck",

A friend of mine is also doing herceptin (her treatments are weekly where as mine are every 3 weeks) and she is bruising as well. They are monitoring my blood counts closely and so far everything is staying within normal range. I will mention this to my onc and take it from there. Thanks for your response. Debbie",
