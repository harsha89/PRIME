    "Content": "JM -- your situation is similar to mine, but not exact. My tumor was in my left breast, ended up to be about 7cm in size, and I had 20 out of 22 positive nodes. I also had numerous kinds of cancer -- predominently invasive lobular, but also DCIS, invasive ductal, and Paget's disease. My tumor(s) were categorized as being very aggressive. Good news is that I wasn't HER/2 positive and I was ER/PR positive. Because lobular has a high rate of recurrence in the other breast, I chose to have my right breast also removed. I was 44 yrs old at the time of my diagnosis. We are also similar in what the doctor told me were my chances of survival. She told me that I have a 20% chance of living 2 years. After I spent a year doing treatments, I found out that she meant 2 years from diagnosis and not end of treatment, which ticked me off greatly. I think I have a good idea of what you are going through and how scary it is to hear those words. However, after surgery, 6 months of chemo, then radiation and Tamoxifen, I have been cancer-free for almost 4 years and plan to go on for many, many more. I beat their odds and I'm proud of that. And as I said, will continue to. The goal as I see it is to stay alive long enough to see the cure for this! The good news with taking Tamoxifen is that it works great for 5 years and then you go on to Femara for another five. Those two combinations have had great success. My doctor defines post-menopausal as being without a period for 1 year. I'm not sure how that would relate to having had a hysterectomy, but I was pre-menopausal prior to chemo, have both of my ovaries, and chemo put me into menopause. She considers me to be post-menopausal. So even though you have one ovary doesn't necessarily mean that it is producing estrogen, but they should be able to do a test to find that out. Hang in there! I won't tell you to not think about those stats because I know that you will -- and will always, although it does lessen with time. Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help you.
