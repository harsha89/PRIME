      "Content": "It is not so terribly unreasonable to have the onoco give us options on are care. I went to Vanderbilt, one of the top clinics in bc cancer treatment. I had two nodes postive, they left it up to me to do A/C plus taxol or no taxol. At that time, three plus years ago there was only a few studies in and one of them in CA showed better luck without doing the taxol. I didn't do taxol, do take tamoxifen not sure after five years if I will stress my body with taking anything else. I eat very healthy, excercise, keep my weight down do not eat red meat, no dairy, no white sugar, take herbs and vitamins etc. All you can do is pray for the right answer. Linda",

It is also painful, bras hurt, plus I have fluid in my breast that seems to move around. Nipple area becomes very hard after a day of work. If anyone has any idea what to do about any of this let me know. Maybe you have a seroma in the area? If so it does generally go away so they say.

This of course is not for everyone but husband had prostate cancer right after I finished treatment and there is a lot of proof diet plays a large part in that cancer and bc is not to different.

I am at Sara Cannon these days due to Vanderbilt no longer taking my insurance. I was so sad to leave that great center but the bc center at Sara Cannon is likewise excellent, remember Minnie Pearl, she left all of her money for the hospital and cancer treatment in Nashville. I asked my onco there about plant estrogen, she said we know so little. We do know studies on prostate cancer show diet plays a large part in pervention and probably control of. Husband had psa of 60 advanced prostate cancer so that is where we started a long long study on diet and life style. I felt what was good for the grander might be good for the goose. By the way I had two nodes postive and a very aggressive cancer so I too don't want to mess around and take a chance on eating meat, fat, and dairy. Read Jane Plant book. I have no finicial interest in the book or anything else regarding bc. I just want Elton and I to be together many more years we have racked up 43 the first of Sept. I have no money interest in soy beans but then I don't in much of anything but I do have to pay Dr bills. Linda",

New tests predict lymph nodes immune cells almost perfectly predict clinical outcome of who will need a more aggressive treatment. Is the immune system the answer to cancer? The alternative Drs have said so for years. If these folks would get their heads together maybe we would find a cure for cancer. Someday chemo will be looked at like witch oil but in the mean time might be necessary. I watched my father-in-law die of stomach cancer many years ago, he refused surgery, took chemo. Chemo did kill him the VA Dr told the family they knew he was going to die so they just thought they would see how much chemo he could stand. It was terrible thank heavens I do feel we have come a very very long way from those days. This man fought for four years overseas in world war 11 he deserved better then that. Ask questions trust no one to your health but yourself, if you are happy with your treatments go for it full steam ahead and don't look back. Eat right keep that immune system strong, be happy, angry is hard on the immune sysytem. Laugh a lot and mean it. I'm generally on CSN and we discuss many many things and keep a very open mind. Lets clean up our air, water, and soil. Remember when Isreal stopped all pesticides their cancer rate was cut in half. God Bless Linda",

He is a mighty strong, well conditioned man my bet is his immune sysytem is tops! I wear a yellow bracklet that says Livestrong, he has the ear of the president so maybe he will raise money for finding a cure and more important why people are getting cancer at the rate we are. I also was the luck of the draw and had nine aunts so you figure! Susan Love in her book memtions we should be studing diet starting in our childhood, fats concern her. All of this needs studying not more chemo! If Lance lived because of chemo why did Jane Plants cancer come back four times, she was told nothing more could be done for her but more chemo so she could live a bit longer. She changed her diet etc and is alive many years later. I have no answers for this but we need to find a reason for cancer. The people in Africa do not have cancer but on rare occasions. Is it their diet, the fact they are backwards and don't have pesticide, excercise more, beats me but wish someone would study that also. Blessed Day Linda",

Also put a lot of aloe vera on, if you don't have a plant you can buy the stems in most health food stores. Just cut them open and use the juice. Keep it in the refri, one stems last a long time, you will be done and healed before it is gone. Don't buy the cream as there are other things in it besides aloe.

I have a great deal of bone loss and arimidex causes bone loss. I do not wish to take anymore drugs then necessary and had I taken arimidex I would need bone builder for sure. Tamoxifen at least does not cause that in fact the drug was first used to rebuild bone. I did ask about Arimidex but my onoc said after five years there still might be many things show up yet unknown about arimidex after all it takes many years for cancer to show up in different forms. In the end I decided to stick to the old tried and true tamoxifen sides effects and all. Both by the way cause a increase in blood clots. I had some hot flashes but probably no more then women my age have off and on anyhow. It is a personal decission but eating and living a healthy life style may go as far keeping us cancer free as drugs but I chose to do both at this time. Onoc said in five years she would put me on a different drug but rather sure I will past on any drugs at that time. I had two lyump nodes, lumpectomy, chemo and radiation , then tamoxifen for five years that will have to be enough unless something shows up. Good luck on whatever you decide on. Linda",
