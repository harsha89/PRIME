    "Content": "My wife was recently discovered with metastised breast cancer. She had mets in pretty much all her body including the brain. She is Her++ so was put on femara and whole brain radiation therapy. During the therapy she was on steroids. That finished end November and we are due for a crucial review next week to see impact of radiation as well as the hormone therapy I.e the femara. My wife was in good spirits and had displayed high energy levels. In the last 15 days she has started feeling nausea and taken a dislike to food in general. She does eat but it's a struggle. What can this be attributed to ? The femara or the radiation or both. Is it indicative of anything?",
