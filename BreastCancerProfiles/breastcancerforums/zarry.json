    "Content": "Hello, I just signed up for this fourm becuase I am afraid and unsure, and need some advice. I'm a 20 year-old female student who is overall fairly healthy. A little over a year ago I noticed that one of my nipples had inverted. At first, I thought it was the new bras I had started wearing becuase it happened around the same time I got them. But now it hasn't gone away, and I'm starting to worry about it. Even when I'm freezing cold, it dosn't un-invert. I've tried checking myself for lumps, but every time I do I don't recall which ones were there before and which one's wern't. I know it's normal to have some lumps. When I check under my arms (although I don't know if I check the right spots) it seems normal. So, I'd just like to know, is an inverted nipple reason enough to visit the hospital? And if so, what sort of tests to they perform to check for breast cancer? I'm afraid, please, help me... Edit: To my knowledge, there is no history of breast cancer in my family, but I've heard that dosn't really make a difference...",
