    "Content": "Kimmy, I'm a 66 yr old woman who had right breast cancer (invasive lobular) and had 4 rounds of neoadjuvant chemo (before my surgery to shrink the cancer to be able to get clean margins, which the surgeon did get); I needed 12 Neupogen shots (given in my belly, did not hurt) over the course of the chemo, because the chemo crashed my white blood cells so drastically the first round that I ended up in hospital with pneumonia (worst 4 days of my life). I had absolutely no problem with any bone pain reaction from the Neupogen injections or any other side effects that I noticed. Just found your post, so it may be too late to help you with your situation, if not, however, I'd ask for Neupogen instead of the Neulasta. Wishing you an easier & complete recovery.",
