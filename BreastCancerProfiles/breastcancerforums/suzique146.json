      "Content": ":cry: i just hqad surgery thursday on my left breast. a calcium lump that they told me that day was cancer. i thought since they got it that that was it but when i went the next day to my doctor and asked her when i should come back she said i won't see her now i need a team of doctors. i was floored! i guess i figured i could never get anthing like this (stupid i guess) but now i am in a panic. i can't really find any information on this type of cancer or what i might be facing. i win't know until thursday what stage it is but while i am waiting i find it hard to think of anything else but the cancer and can't stop crying. i am 50 and my dad's mother had breast cancer but i don't know what kind nor does anyone else on that side of the family. has anyone else had this type of cancer out there and if so can you give me an idea on what i might expect?",

      "Content": "I am going to the doctor tomorrow at 2:15. My orginal appointment was thursday but they called me today and want me to come in early. Which had freaked me out but like my husband says they most likely know everyone freaks out and they want to get them in as soon as possible, at least I hope that is the reason. thank you for replying so quick you have given me a ray of sunshine.",
