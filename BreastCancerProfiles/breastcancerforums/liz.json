    "Content": "After having a lump I found in my breast removed, I found out this week that I have lobular breast cancer. I'm scheduled for an additional ultrasound after an MRI for a \"questionable\" spot. My surgeon says he'll be doing a lumpectomy if nothing else shows up with sentinel lobe biopsy. I'm experiencing alot of feelings right now - feeling sorry for myself, mad, depression and crying for no reason. Has anyone else gone throug this and what should I expect? Thanks alot for everyone's help. Liz",
