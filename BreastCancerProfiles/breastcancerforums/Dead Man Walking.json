      "Content": "So, I have had some pains in my lower back, for a very, very long time. I just thought it was me getting older, or maybe that I was out of shape...until I had MORE pain after running on the treadmill at the gym. It's lower back and then around the hips, sort of, and it's like an unclosed bracelet: doesn't hit the front or groin area at all. However, I kept going to the gym anyway because of diet and exercise . It doesn't sometimes hurt or hurt when I do X....I notice it from morning to night. Bingo!! Textbook classic herniated disc symptoms. 1. Pain increasing with age. 2. More pain after hard impact running. 3. Refusing to stop an activity that causes pain??? 4. Pain related to exact activity or movement direction. 5. Pain is acute when it's there. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and have never had medical training, but I do have a 6\" long scar at the base of my spine that was once a 6\" deep hole that would accommodate the full length and diameter of a beer can. Had my surgery on my 40th birthday in 1989. L4-L5 decomp Get thee to an orthopedist, and IIRC you need a hi-rez MRI for a conclusive diagnosis. The good news is that these days herniated discs are normally done with a 1\" incision and laparoscopic microsurgical techniques. If, however, all that high impact activity has progressed from the nerves to the cartilage or bones, then open surgery may be required. As far as cancer concerns are concerned, I have no idea or experience whatsoever. I'm only here by default after being diagnosed with terminal leukemia and surviving a full year.",

That's the Trifecta: Symptoms, Diagnosis, Permanent Cure. You got the symptoms and diagnosis, and your herniation must not hurt nearly as much as mine did. My whole body would spasm when the nerve was compressed, and send me into a Grand Mal seizure that required a knockout dose of Demerol to stop. My hospital bed would start rolling around the room if all 4 wheels weren't locked. And squishy: You got classic symptoms, and you got no appointment YET for an ortho consult and an MRI.

      "Content": "So, I have had some pains in my lower back, for a very, very long time. I just thought it was me getting older, or maybe that I was out of shape...until I had MORE pain after running on the treadmill at the gym. It's lower back and then around the hips, sort of, and it's like an unclosed bracelet: doesn't hit the front or groin area at all. However, I kept going to the gym anyway because of diet and exercise . It doesn't sometimes hurt or hurt when I do X....I notice it from morning to night. Bingo!! Textbook classic herniated disc symptoms. 1. Pain increasing with age. 2. More pain after hard impact running. 3. Refusing to stop an activity that causes pain??? 4. Pain related to exact activity or movement direction. 5. Pain is acute when it's there. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and have never had medical training, but I do have a 6\" long scar at the base of my spine that was once a 6\" deep hole that would accommodate the full length and diameter of a beer can. Had my surgery on my 40th birthday in 1989. L4-L5 decomp Get thee to an orthopedist, and IIRC you need a hi-rez MRI for a conclusive diagnosis. The good news is that these days herniated discs are normally done with a 1\" incision and laparoscopic microsurgical techniques. If, however, all that high impact activity has progressed from the nerves to the cartilage or bones, then open surgery may be required. As far as cancer concerns are concerned, I have no idea or experience whatsoever. I'm only here by default after being diagnosed with terminal leukemia and surviving a full year.",
