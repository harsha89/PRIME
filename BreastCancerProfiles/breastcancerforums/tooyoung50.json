      "Content": "I am 29 years old, and both of my Grandmother's had breast cancer, along with other Aunts on each side of my family. Every year when I go for my annual check up, I ask the Dr. when I should have a mammogram. They always tell me 40. Sometimes I feel like they are just rushing me in and out of my appointment. Does anyone have any advice, or agree with what the Doctors are telling me.",

      "Content": "This might seem like a vague post, but I am new to cancer and want to help out my Mom. Her best friend has fought breast cancer over the past 8 years. It seemed to be under control, until a recent trip to the Doctor's. They told my Mom's best friend that her breast cancer was back and that it spread to her liver and through out her lower extremities. My Mom's friend is 50 years old and a tough cookie. She will not go into specifics, and the problem is that I do not want my Mom to be caught off guard. What should my Mom expect with a type of cancer like this. I know that every situation is different, but I wanted to get an idea, so I can know where my Mother's friend stands. She will not be going through regular chemo. She told my Mom that she would just be taking pills and staying at home. She said that the pills will make her weak and sick. Any advice??",

      "Content": "Jim thank you for your quick reply. The only thing she told my Mom about the pills, is that she is happy that she will not have to loose her hair again. She has also been talking in the sense that she is happy with her life and has accomplished everything that she has wanted to do. I just feel awful. She has four kids, and she and my Mother call each other Lucy and Ethel.......it just came back so sudden!",
