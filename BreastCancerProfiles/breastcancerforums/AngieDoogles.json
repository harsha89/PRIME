      "Content": "Thank you very VERY much for your response. I was reading http://cancerforums.net/about5111.html&highlight=pagets, another thread on this forum, about Paget's disease and from what it said, the prognosis didn't sound very good. It said five year survival rates (when a lump is present) are between 20 and 60 percent. Are these accurate figures? Also, what are some suggestions for making her more comfortable and making this process easier? I know she will need button up shirts after the surgery, but are there other little things like that to help? She is a very independent person so I don't want to do too much, but at the same time, I want her to know that we are here and we care and are willing to help in any way possible. My siblings and I are already planning a spa day to help her relax, but there's so much more I'd like to do. I will keep you updated on her progress, but there isn't a lot of information since she hasn't seen a surgeon yet. We really only have the diagnosis for now, but she has a doctor's appointment today (to get a referral). Again, thanks for your response.",

      "Content": "My mother (52) was diagnosed with Paget's breast cancer last Thursday. The news was obviously devastating to my mother, my four siblings, my husband and me. We are still trying to process and adapt to this situation. I had actually never heard of this type of cancer before, but I've since done quite a bit of online research. Still, no matter how much I research the facts and information, knowing what to do and how to best support my mother during this difficult time isn't really something a normal website can tell me. That's why I came here. If you have ANY advice on how to make this easier for my mother I would be grateful beyond words. I feel like anything I say to her would sound cliche and I don't want my words to be empty. I want to show her that we are here for her no matter what, but I don't want her to know how incredibly scared I am. I try to stay positive as much as possible, but I'm having such a hard time focusing on the present and not worrying about the future. I know that many of you have survived this awful disease or that you are currently battling it, so you would understand more than anyone. Are there things people say that you would rather not hear, even if their intentions are good? What is helpful, what is hurtful? Thank you so much for taking the time to read and I appreciate any response you may give.",
