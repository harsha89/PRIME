      "Content": "marybeth: Quick intro: I'm an evidence-based medical researcher specializing in women's health, especially breast cancer treatment and prevention (on which I'm currently writing a book), and I author and run the widely cited evidence-based Breast Cancer Watch http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com site providing best evidence guidelines on breast cancer treatment, and to which I have just posted a comprehensive systematic review and critical appraisal of the state-of-the-art of breast cancer therapy (in both the non-metastatic and metastatic settings) as of Aug/2005, which also updates the latest official NCCN guidelines. I cover there the latest findings on the issue of cardiotoxicity with respect to doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and trastuzumab (Herceptin), so here's a more or less brief summary (fuller discsussion with supporting studies and their links given on my site): There are two issues to separate: (1) doxorubicin-induce cardiotoxicity and (2) trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity. ((1) doxorubicin-induce cardiotoxicity: One widely noted clinical limitation with doxorubicin is induced cardiotoxicity. There are two viable ways to address this issue. (a) epirubicin (Ellence) at doses equivalent to doxorubicin has been shown to be as efficacious as doxorubicin but less toxic than doxorubicin (study of Findlay & Walker-Dilks) and represents a viable alternate with no major compromise. Also Buzdar in another study found that an epirubicin-containing regimen when administered with concurrent trastuzumab resulted in a 65% pathologic complete response (pCR) rate with no cardiotoxicity in the form of clinical congestive heart failure; they used the triplet trastuzumab (Herceptin) + paclitaxel (Taxol) + epirubicin (Ellence). (b) Numerous studies, mostly recently by Kim et al. in 2005 on the \"Modulation by Melatonin of the Cardiotoxic and Antitumor Activities of Adriamycin\" have shown that given melatonin's oncolytic activity (on this see my discussion of melatonin on my companion Breast Cancer Prevention Watch http://brcaprevention.evidencewatch.com/ site), the combination of adriamycin + melatonin improved the antitumor activity of adriamycin, as indicated by an increase in the number of long-term survivors as well as decreases in body-weight losses resulting from adriamycin treatment, suggesting that melatonin not only protects against adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity but also enhances its antitumor activity and further suggesting that a melatonin and adriamycin combination represents a potentially useful regimen for the treatment of human neoplasms, by virtue of the fact that it allows the use of lower doses of adriamycin, thereby avoiding the toxic side effects associated with this drug. The appropriate therapeutic schedule of melatonin for this use is 20mg/daily, as confirmed in the supporting studies. 2) trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity Yossef & Links establsihed that trastuzumab-induced cardiac dysfunction appears to be qualitatively different than anthracycline (doxorubicin) cardiotoxicity, as it is not cumulative dose-dependent, often improving after treatment withdrawal and allowing for re-treatment, and a drug holiday and re-presentation approach, as pointed out in another response to this posting, is indeed a viable option. Hope this helps. Constantine",

      "Content": "Liza: I'm an evidence-based medical researcher specializing in women's health issues, especially breast cancer. It sounds like you got some good advice in this forum's feedback. All I'm going to do is try to clarify a bit further some of the issues your problem brings up, and at the end suggest one promising option for you. (1) Re Suppression of Ovarian Function: Your oncologist seems to be referring to something called suppression of ovarian function (SOF), sometimes also known as ovarian ablation/suppression (OA/OS), which refers the induction of ovarian failure - namely, the reduction or elimination of estrogen production - without regard to technique used to accomplish that. Indeed, back in history, the first adjuvant treatment for breast cancer studied in clinical trials involving premenopausal women was exactly this suppression of ovarian function. Now, the term ovarian ablation typically refers specifically either to oophorectomy (surgical) or ovarian irradiation (radiotherapeutic), while the term medical ovarian suppression (MOS) indicates the use of certain agents to suppress estrogen production, the most widely used called LHRH (Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone) analogs like Goserelin (Zoladex). However, medical ovarian suppression can also be a consequence - intended or not - of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy which may result in primary ovarian failure. It is well established now that chemotherapy can unpredictably induce amenorrhea and ovarian failure as a side effect of toxicity on the ovaries in a drug-, dose-, and patient age-dependent fashion, and this is called CRA (Chemotherapy-Related Amenorrhea). From a recently posted systematic review of mine on breast cancer on my evidence-based Breast Cancer Watch http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com site, we know that CRA on an average affects about 68% of women treated with CMF (cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy, where 10%?33% of such CMF-treated women get CRA after a single cycle, 33%?81% after six cycles, and 61%?95% after 12 cycles. And even though such induced amenorrhea is seen most often with CMF chemotherapy, other regimens can and do produce it in lesser percentages. So the AC regimen (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) causes CRA in 43% of women (again in a dose- and age-dependent fashion). And we also know that the addition of a taxane (paclitaxel, docetaxel) to the regimen increases the likelihood of developing such chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Now, although the odds of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CRA) are relatively high, not all women undergoing various chemo regimens are affected and so it still is prudent - as several others in feedback suggested - to check this out for confirmation or disconfirmation and so know whether your dealing with CRA or a true menopausal state. (2) Re Alprostadil: Alprostadil is a vasoactive prostaglandin agent and actually has been used successfully in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction, originally by inconvenient injection, but now by topical cream/gel (Alprox) application or TD (transdermal) patch. On the basis of methodologically weak evidence from two early uncontrolled studies alprostadil has been suggested for relief of certain vaginal/clitoral symptoms of FSD (female sexual dysfunction) However, we know from a systematic review of FSD therapies and the treatment of vaginal atrophy recently completed for Canadian and New Zealand based guidelines groups in which I participated, a partial summary of whose findings are on my evidence-based Menopause Watch Http://menopause.evidencewatch.com site, that a later well controlled study by Padma-Natyhan and co-researchers done in 2003 decisively demonstrated that responses of subjects using the cream were not different from those of subjects on a placebo cream, and on the basis of this finding, FDA approval will not be forthcoming, as also suggested correctly in Leo's response. Our review did find however several effective therapy options, and one is Replens: Replens is a vaginal moisturizer (non-prescription, over-the-counter) and several well controlled studies have confirmed that it is actually equivalent in benefit to that provided by vaginal estrogen creams, with equivalent improvement of vaginal itching, irritation, and dyspareunia. Although there are other options to pursue, recommendations are to first try an effective vaginal moisturizer. Hopefully, after negotiating some administrative hurdles, I will be posting the full findings of the evidence-based guidelines and systematic review on FSD to my site within the very near future (linked from the main portal, Evidencewatch at http://evidencewatch.com Hope this helps, or at least clarifies some matters.

      "Content": "MiaNC: As this is my first posting, I'll briefly introduce myself: I'm an evidence-based medical researcher specializing in women's health (I'm currently writing a book on breast cancer treatment and prevention), and I author and run the widely cited Evidencewatch portal (http://evidencewatch.com), providing best evidence guidelines and state-of-the-art research commentaries, and which includes the sister sites (links found on main page, on right) Breast Cancer Watch, IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer) Watch, Menopause Watch, Osteoporosis Watch, among others. On my Breast Cancer Prevention Watch site (http://brcaprevention.evidencewatch.com) I review the latest findings on radiation-induced dermatitis, and you can check out that coverage which has all the techie medical references, but I'll summarize the findings right here for you in more or less plain English: Lots of agents have been proposed and tested for both symptomatic care of radiation-induced dermatitis and for potential protective activity against induced skin toxicities. Aloe vera gel, a therapy commonly used to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis and related skin toxicity, has been rigorously evaluated by Williams et al who found that aloe vera exhibited no protective effect for those receiving breast irradiation, although it could provide mild symptomatic relief after the development of dermatitis. There is one FDA-approved preparation called Biafine (Medix Pharmaceuticals), a wound-healing (prescription) product from France but studies by Fisher et al. comparing Biafine with best supportive care, which consisted of Aquaphor and aloe vera, in women receiving breast irradiation, found no statistical difference in skin toxicity between those receiving Biafine and those treated with best supportive care. Now, topical steroids are commonly used to treat radiation-induced skin inflammation and dermatitis and studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the corticosteroid cream mometasone furoate (MMF) (a prescription product) as a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention: it significantly decreased acute radiation dermatitis compared with emollient cream alone. One nonsteroid topical agent for the prevention of acute dermatitis during adjuvant radiotherapy for breast carcinoma is the natural agent, calendula cream, and Pommier et al. compared the effectiveness of calendula with that of trolamine (considered in many institutions to be the reference topical agent), finding that calendula was highly effective for the prevention of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher, proposing it for patients undergoing postoperative irradiation for breast cancer. Finally there is an excellent review comissioned last year by the National Breast Cancer Centre (the leading breast cancer organization in Australia) called \"Skin Care during Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer\" which found that moisturisers containing the ingredients sucralfate or hyaluronic acid were superior to those not containing one of those active ingredients, in reducing the severity of skin lesions and promoting healing of dry desquamation. It's available on my Breast Cancer Prevention Watch site as a PDF you can download. Hope this helps. Constantine",

      "Content": "It is indeed a reasonable choice in many cases and as I document on the Breast Cancer Watch site, in certain populations (premenopausal women with axilliary lymph node positive breast carcinoma for example, as studied by Bang et al., as well as other distinct subgroups that have been identified) it matched the efficacy of an anthracycycline-containing regimen like AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide).

      "Content": "The scenario you describe: falling CBCs and especially depressed WBC - assuming that there is not a clinical presentation of dominant impact on RBCs which would suggest anemia - may be a manifestation of a common hematologic side effect of chemotherapy called NEUTROPENIA. In this context, neutropenia is a chemotherapy-induced deficiency of white blood cells (via neutrophils, which make up over half of all white blood cells, hence the name neutropenia). The immediate motivated action is to raise the issue of early neutropenia with her oncologist who can pursue relevant laboratory tests to confirm or reject this diagnosis. More elderly patients are at increased risk of neutropenia, and it is especially associated with taxane therapy, namely either paclitaxel (Taxol) or docetaxel (Taxotere), and studies suggest a somewhat higher likelihood with docetaxel, although it is observed with either taxane to different degrees, and other chemotherapeutic agents and regimens, like anthracycline-based therapy (Adriamycin for example) as well as CMF regimens, may also induced neutropenia. Because neutropenia represents a compromise to immune system function, especially as to fighting potential infections, it's primary danger is the possible development - not assured, but possible - into FEBRILE NEUTROPENIA, a potentially life-threatening septic condition. The mainstay of neutropenia treatment - if indeed this is confirmed - is PEGFILGRASTIM (NEULASTA) therapy, which increases WBC/neurophil levels and therefore reduces risk of infection, and has proven remarkably effective in such cases. There is more (technical) coverage of neutropenia and its treatment on my web site (see below). __________________________________________________ ___ Constantine Kaniklidis Medical Researcher in EBM (Evidence-based Medicine) http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com [email protected]",
