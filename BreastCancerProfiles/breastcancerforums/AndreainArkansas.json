    "Content": "I had DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in Feb 2008 found during a precautionary double mastectomy (I have a rare genetic disorder called Cowden Syndrome that causes breast cancer 25-50% of the time). I did have reconstruction and the pain lessened after my implants were put in. Except during what would be my monthly period (I had my uterus removed in 2009 for cancer risk but still have an ovary) I have horrible pains. Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope with it? Tylenol doesn't help but aspirin causes stomach problems. Thank you for any advice",
