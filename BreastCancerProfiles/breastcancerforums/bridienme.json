    "Content": "Good evening everyone. Got diagnosed today with grade 3 breast cancer. I have been booked for a mastectomy on October 26th which is a month away. I was very surprised at the length of time to wait for surgery, is this a normal wait? I should have asked at the time but I was in shock I guess. Hope I can get some responses to compare waiting times. xx",
