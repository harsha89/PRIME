    "Content": "Greetings One of my close friends is getting a breast removed today, and the other removed after chemo. I would like to buy her a gift certificate to an online retailer for a swimsuit and/or bras for her post surgical body. Does anybody have any recommendations? Thanks very much. Regards, travelfairy PS - Is sad, I was on this site last year when my mom had cancer of the esophagus, now I've had 2 friends with cancer diagnoses in 6 months since she passed. I guess I'll be on here for a while.",
