I am very sorry to hear your situation, all I can say is in my case similar to your's i went to the doctors hospital and told them i need it to apply for financial aid, some people call it medicare or medical. I know the city i live in also has medical aid. And maybe your city does two. Anyways don't give up my heart goes out to you and were there is a will there is a way. Financial Help from the government try there",
