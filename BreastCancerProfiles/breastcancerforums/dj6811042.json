    "Content": "We just celebrated my wife's 45th birthday. She is a metastatic cancer patient, a mom of three little girls. Her body condition is weakening. I am worried that we might not be together for her birthday next year. Here I am soliciting a successful story from anybody that is willing to help us. My wife was diagnosed with advanced invasive breast cancer four years ago. During these four years, we have tried countless numbers of treatment, chemo, radiation, surgery, herbs, sea weeds, reishi, ginseng, organic juices. Some of them had helped other patients recover, but none of them seems to work well on my wife. Her cancer still spread everywhere in her body. My oncologist explained \"Cancers are heterogeneous, one treatment does not work the same way on different patients, even if the patients have same kind of cancer.\" Is it possible that the cancer treatment successful rates depend on the CAUSE of cancer? Possible but no conclusion yet. But my wife does not have another 10 years for them to find the conclusion or solution, therefore, I decided to ask for help on internet. My wife drank tremendous amount of milk (regular, not organic) during her three pregnancies. In those periods, she consumed an average of two gallons of milk per week. Even during regular times, she drank at least one gallon per week. She did that for the 16 years before she was diagnosed with cancer (1989 - 2005). During these 16 years, she has accumulated huge amount of IGF-1 hormone in her body, through the consumption of milk. (There are some studies showing that people drink milk with IGF-1 tend to have high level of IGF-1 in their bodies.) Therefore, we have a suspicion that milk might (only might) have played a role in my wife's tumor. Next, what I am trying to do is to find if there are any similar SUCCESSFUL cases, in other words, cases that meet the following conditions: 1. Patient drank lots of milk before diagnosed with cancer 2. Diagnosed with ADVANCED breast cancer 3. Treatments are successful, patient is now \"cancer free\" (forgive us for non precise terms) If any therapy works in cases like this, we believe there could be a chance that it works in my wife's case too. Then we might be able to find a potential solution to my wife's cancer. Please feel free to forward this message to your friends if you think your friends might have a story to tell us. I understand that IGF-1 has been discussed for decade with controversial conclusions. Please note that I am not accusing milk of anything. My point is very simple - to see if anybody has a similar case and is willing to share her/his stories with us. If you intend to discuss the roles of milk in breast cancer, please do not join this discussion. Please also note that we have tried a lot of expensive treatments, but none of them seems to work very well. We are almost broke and do not have that much money to try expensive treatment any more. We are simply looking for somebody that has survived breast cancer and is willing to share her successful story to save my wife's life.",
