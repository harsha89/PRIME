      "Content": "My mum was diagnosed with a recurrence of hormone based breast cancer in April. It spread to her lung which is made more hard as she has Copd.This cancer is so hard to watch she's getting weaker everyday. Feels so swollen she can't walk, barely the strength to stand. Now in a wheelchair most of the time. I wonder how the cancer has made her this way. Why does cancer effect her in such a way that she can't even stand. She's not on chemotherapy as she's too weak what is making her so weak. The steroids ? She couldn't really get about even before the steroids. they have her on anti hormone treatment to try to slow things down. The bouts of pneumonia are getting more regular. It's as if her personality has Changed too she's so mean all the time to my dad, snappy all the time he's doing everything for her. Treats him like crap. And there's the drinking the endless drinking. Baileys at 11am wine all day is really getting too much. Falling asleep on and off all day not sleeping at night. Waking up ravenous wanting to eat all the time. The drinking cannot be good for the cancer. I wish she would move more. Or at least try to. Every small knock is like agony for her. With huge bruises from the slightest bump. She says she's not in pain where her tumour is but is basically screaming in pain constantly with the swollen feet and bruises. This can't be normal for a cancer patient? I wonder constantly How long will she have what will happen at the end. Sorry for the ramble need someone to talk to and understand. I love my mum so much is it normal to get annoyed with her at times.",

      "Content": "HI Thank you for your kind words. I am not sure the exact type of steroids she is on, but they are strong. Along with sleeping tablets and the anti hormone treatment. She hasn't been offered anything else. She did have two rounds of Chemo and was far to ill to cope, due to her COPD so she's not having any other treatments. The most frustrating thing is we don't know if its working. She has a Macmillian nurse who I might try to speak to about her general health and drinking. I live 300 miles away from her which Isn't easy I see her as often as I can. It shocked me this weekend when she was staying with us just how bad she was. No-one has had the courage to talk to her doctors I feel she drinks to numb how she's feeling.",
