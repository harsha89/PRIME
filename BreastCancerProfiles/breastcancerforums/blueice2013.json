      "Content": "I just had a unilateral mastectomy due to recent diagnosis for breast cancer (DCIS grade 3 with less than 1mm micro-invasion, 5 lymph nodes removed and tested negative, 0/5, BRAC 1 and 2 gene tested negative). The oncologist said I do not need chemo or radiation, but want me to take Tamoxifen for at least 5 years. Now I am very struggling on whether to take it or not. I really need other patients' help on deciding if I should take Tamoxifen or not. The only reason that I don't want to take the Tamoxifen is because I am scared about getting the possibility of having endometrial cancer, sometimes, my endometrial thickness is already a concern by the radiologist, thus I am desperately hoping to seek real-life experiences and advice from anyone here who has already gone through this. My questions are: If you have taken Tamoxifen for years, have you suffered from any significant side effects (particularly uterine or endometrial cancer)? If you had opted not to take Tamoxifen years ago, do you still think it's a good decision or a decision you regret about now? Your views and advice are greatly appreciated!",

I am thinking to just take some alternative naturopathic products (such as DIM, I3C and Calcium-D-Glucarate), rather than Tamoxifen or chemo, for prevention from recurrence of breast cancer in the future. But I am unsure and also concerned about if these products (DIM, I3C and Calcium-D-Glucarate) are really useful and effective or not. Would those who did take these alternative products for years share their experiences with me? This would be a huge help to me in making this tough decision. Thank you so much in advance.",

      "Content": "Additionally, I am making appointments with my onc and gyncologic doctors on these questions. But I am now very concerned if my body (and potential cancer cells) would become resistant to Tamoxifen if I am on and off Tamox, although not frequently . In other words, I have to skip Tamoxifen for a while for various reasons now, and in a few months or a year, I plan to take it again. So, if I am on and off like this, would the effect of Tamoxifen be discounted substantially due to my body's resistance? Can anybody share your experiences or studies that you know on this issue? By the way, I am 45 years old, diagnosed with DCIS stage 0-1a. I had mastectomy in Sept. last year. No chemo so far.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed as DCIS and had Mastectomy in Sept. last year. I had taken Tamoxifen between Oct. 2013 and January this year. Only about two weeks ago, I stopped Tamoxifen because I found a 7cm ovarian cyst through ultrasound. I did some google-searches and discovered some important recent studies consistently finding that the pre-menopause women with breast cancer and ER+ (just like me) have 50-81% of chance to develop an ovarian cyst after taking Tamoxifen. So, after consulting with my Oncologists and Gyn (2 of them agreed for me to stop Tamoxifen and 2 others against it), I decided to stop Tamoxifen. Based on your experiences, did you have similar problems in developing an ovarian cyst with Tamoxifen? Did the cyst go away by itself after you stop Tamoxifen? Moreover, if I take out the cyst by surgery and then start taking Tamoxifen again, will I see some new cysts pop up in the future? I very much appreciate it if you could share your experiences with me on what you went through on this and what advice you may provide to help me make a right decision. Thank you so much in advance!",

Should I be worried about it (that is, what kind of problems may it cause to my body and health?) In particular, will I suffer some terrible gynecological problems from not having menstrual period? I am 45 years old now. If I stop Tamoxifen, would my menstrual cycle return to my normal level as a result of my stopping Tamoxifen? If I keep Tamoxifen on and off, would it adversely affect my health? If you have any experiences or lessons on these questions, I would greatly appreciate any advice you may have for me or simply sharing your story with me! Thanks in advance",
