      "Content": "Hi ladies, I send hugs and blessings to all of us who are BC sisters. I will be done with my chemo on June 6, 2005 YIPEE -(12 consecutive taxols prior was 4/A/C dose dense)and have had a visit with a reconstructive plastic surgeon to see if I would be a candidate for implants or what my options can be. I still need to complete 35 rounds of radiation yet, but I am forever researching my options. What a shame to find out that I was not told of the microvascular damages that the rads. do to your lungs, heart, etc. and since I had chose a lumpectomy (recommended to me by breast surgeon) that my chances of infection due to microvascular and germs left behind are high for implant. Ofcourse I want my \"girls\" to be as perfect as can be, but now I see I have maybe three choices. #1. Implant, and very possible infection maybe treated with antibiotics, and or removal of implant and try again. #2. Mastectomy with implant and NO chance(or minute) of recurring cancer to that breast. #3. See how the lump. breast looks after rads. and have healthy breast lifted and reduced to match rad. breast. I certainly now wish that a BC person or my own doctors would have expressed the whole line of \"what if's\" down to the final stage before I chose to have lumpectomy. Seem's the damages of rads. is and will continue to be thru-out my life cycle. And all microvascular. (Inside) So what am I looking for? Anyone with information of what they choose from lumpectomy stand point. And what it took to get them there. The doctor I saw is an artist in her work, but has caustioned me that implants with lump. do pose a higher risk of infection. Also I am not looking to become Dolly Parton lol, I just want the \"look of cancer\" gone and feel femimine again. Now I am a loose 36C (lol) who knows what the lump. breast will be when done with rads. maybe a firmer B - sure wouldn't mind being a small D since I am 5'10\" and after dieting and excersise I will be back to my 160 lbs.-now 171 lbs. So ladies??? What have you done? I appreciate any information. And if you've gotten this far, GOD BLESS ya's!!! God bless all. Peace, happiness, hugs and continue to let the sunshine in!!! Annie S.
