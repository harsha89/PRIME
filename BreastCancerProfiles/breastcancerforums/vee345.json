      "Content": "Thank you for the advice, pbj11 and Cindy. We contacted her doctor and got a different prescription, but it doesn't seem to be working either. She's taking them as the directions say, but she's beeing vomiting a lot, so maybe they aren't staying down long enough to have an effect...? Or should she try another medication? I'm worried she's getting dehydrated. Thanks, Vee",

      "Content": "Vee (another Vee!), I thought I had already logged on and thanked you for your advice and the links! I'm so sorry for taking forever to say thanks. The ginger helped my friend out tremendously. Her stomach can still get pretty iffy at times, but it's much, much better than before since we've gotten her ginger candies to suck on. Again, I'm sorry in the delay. Thank you so much for your help! Vee",

      "Content": "My friend went in for her second round of chemotherapy today, and already the nausea and vomiting are bad again. I've been making sure she's been following the directions when taking the anti-nausea drugs, and I even double-checked with the nurse today when I took her to chemo, but they haven't been helping. This is the fourth medication she's tried, and none of them have seemed to help settle her stomach. Is there anything else out there she can try or should we start looking into things like acupuncture? I don't know what to do at this point, she's been feeling so miserable. If anyone has any input or advice, we would really appreciate it. Bless everyone here. Vee",

She's already taking ginger caps, and they seem to help for the mild/moderate queasiness, and I'll see if I can convince her to try the sea bands tomorrow. Hadn't even thought of that. Thanks again! I hope you're doing well. Vee",

From everything I've read and heard, it isn't normal to be this sick after the first time. She's on cytoxan and taxotere. If anyone has any idea on why she's getting so sick or any tips to help with the nausea, we would really appreciate it. It's tough to see her feel so bad. Thanks, Vee",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the information! It was really helpful! I talked with the insurance, and fortunately it looks like it will work out. As for the regimen change, her doctor just said that it calls for more aggressive treatment than he thought, but he gave no other explanation. She's fairly overwhelmed at the moment so she's letting him leave it at that, I just wanted to check to see if that's more than what is usually necessary for stage I since we don't want her to feel worse than she has to. I guess three times a week is normal, then. I know each person is different, but if she has it three times a week, every three weeks, is it likely that she will be able to work on the weeks she has chemotherapy scheduled? Will she feel too bad or will it take up a lot of time on the days she will be receiving it? I know on the first day they told her to expect to be there for around six hours. Will the next time be shorter? Sorry for all of the questions, we're just very concerned about what's going on. Thanks for reading and you all are in our prayers. Looking through the topics on this board and the answers I've gotten have helped so much.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for all of your help, parkermd. We're very glad that it was caught so early and that she'll be okay once all of this is done, but we still want to make this time as easy as possible for her, and from what we've heard, this regimen can knock you down pretty quick. It's a comfort to know that she should be able to recover fairly quickly once this is over, and that she'll be able to work for some or most of the time. Thank you again. God bless.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was pointed in this direction by pbj11. My friend was recently diagnosed with stage I breast cancer, and she's undergoing a single mastectomy. She's 26 and would like to have reconstruction done, but getting her insurance company to cover the complete cost is proving to be difficult. They should cover it, right? And if not, does anyone have any suggestions of other venues would could contact about this? Also, she's scheduled to have chemotherapy three times a week, every three weeks. Does this seem excessive? Originally her doctor scheduled her for once a week, every three weeks, but then he changed it to this. Is that a normal chemo regimen? The drug is called Cytoxan, I believe. Thanks for reading. God bless everyone here.",
