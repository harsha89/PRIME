She's taking them as the directions say, but she's beeing vomiting a lot, so maybe they aren't staying down long enough to have an effect...? Or should she try another medication? I'm worried she's getting dehydrated. Thanks, Vee",

This is the fourth medication she's tried, and none of them have seemed to help settle her stomach.

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was pointed in this direction by pbj11. My friend was recently diagnosed with stage I breast cancer, and she's undergoing a single mastectomy. She's 26 and would like to have reconstruction done, but getting her insurance company to cover the complete cost is proving to be difficult. They should cover it, right? And if not, does anyone have any suggestions of other venues would could contact about this? Also, she's scheduled to have chemotherapy three times a week, every three weeks. Does this seem excessive? Originally her doctor scheduled her for once a week, every three weeks, but then he changed it to this. Is that a normal chemo regimen? The drug is called Cytoxan, I believe. Thanks for reading. God bless everyone here.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the information! It was really helpful! I talked with the insurance, and fortunately it looks like it will work out. As for the regimen change, her doctor just said that it calls for more aggressive treatment than he thought, but he gave no other explanation. She's fairly overwhelmed at the moment so she's letting him leave it at that, I just wanted to check to see if that's more than what is usually necessary for stage I since we don't want her to feel worse than she has to. I guess three times a week is normal, then. I know each person is different, but if she has it three times a week, every three weeks, is it likely that she will be able to work on the weeks she has chemotherapy scheduled? Will she feel too bad or will it take up a lot of time on the days she will be receiving it? I know on the first day they told her to expect to be there for around six hours. Will the next time be shorter? Sorry for all of the questions, we're just very concerned about what's going on. Thanks for reading and you all are in our prayers. Looking through the topics on this board and the answers I've gotten have helped so much.",
