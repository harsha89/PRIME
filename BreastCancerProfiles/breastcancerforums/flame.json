      "Content": "I am 40 years old and found a lump and started having pain in my left breast last year, eventually a mammogram showed many cysts, the largest of which was drained. I was also experiencing nipple discharge from the same breast, this tested positive for blood so i had a total duct removal 3 weeks ago. My post op follow up isn't till the 7th April and I will then get my biopsy results. My question is this.... if the results were bad would they contact me to go back sooner or is this wait normal anyway, I just don't want to get it in my head that everything must be fine and then be in for a shock. Anybodys experiences would be most helpful. Thanks in advance Maggi x",

      "Content": "Sorry didn't update sooner...... Results were clear but some ducts were left behind and operation had to be repeated, the leaking has stopped sort of.. I do still get some discharge but not liquid like anymore so I'm not really concerned. Just not been well in myself for getting on a couple of years now so just awaiting Haematologist referal to get to the bottom of some blood results that were a bit off course.. (Just posted in Multiple Myeloma forum) Like you I would rather be prepared for worst outcome then there are no nasty shocks.... We all deal with stress in different ways. How did you go on? Hope everything went ok. Maggi x",
