      "Content": "Hi: Just discovered this forum today. How are you doing with the fatigue issue? My CanCare support kept telling me, radiation, compared to chemo, was like a walk in the park. She must have gone to a different park down a different path from me. I have had a hard time with everything, chemo, radiation, etc. Finished radiation 3 weeks ago and I am so tired I can barely move, plus pain (left over also from lymph node removal 3-1/2 months ago), lots of swelling, etc. Hope you completely recovered by now, I keep on hoping...... All the best M.R.",

      "Content": "Hi: I am new to this forum. I am 77 years old, stage IIB, HER pos. breast cancer. 6 months chemo, plus Hercepin, lumpectomy and lymph node removal (no further cancer was found). This was followed by 6-1/2 weeks of radiation and now I am continuing with Herceptin every 3 weeks. Here are my problems - surgery was 3-1/2 months ago, radiaton finished 3 weeks ago, I am still having considerable pain, like a burning sensation under arm, lots of swelling, still lots of redness. I am using Aquaphor and pure aloe vera, plus 2-3 times a day Lidocaine. Very, very weak from the ordeal. On top of it all I have been having almost consistent pain from the port inserted to facilitate IV. Dr. doesn't seem to have an answer to the consistent pain, except to mumble \"well, everybody is different\". Only one of the oncology nurses is willing to put IV into my port, the rest hide, if possible. Has anyone out there had pain that long and is it ever going to end? Problems and pain with port? Appreciate your reply. Thanks, M.R.",
