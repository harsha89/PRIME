      "Content": "I have been investigated for Hereditary Breast Cancer following the death of our mother and the diagnosis of my sister some 25 and 17 years ago respectively. I have been having Mammograms for in excess of 14 years and decided 3 years ago that I wanted to be tested for the genetic connections with this disease. However, I was advised that my mothers cancer was 'age' related and my sister's was a common form of cancer and that it was unlikely that I would be a carrier. Since I provided 'other' family members information and there cancer's, albeit, they were men, they did try to obtain samples of their cancer's, but to no avail. They will offer Bowel screening later this year. As I am 50 later this year, I was not selected for my usual annual mammogram and I queried this with the hospital, only to be told that I would now be joining the 3 yearly breast screening clinic and wouldn't be called until 2012. I insisted that this was not acceptable because I would be prepared to have a double mastectomy if necessary because the fear of getting Breast Cancer was damaging me psycologically and I am not coping with this hanging over me. They refused on the grounds that the BRCA1 test is too expensive, based on the family history available. However, following my recent meeting with the consultant, Bazaarly, she has referred me to a plastic surgeon with a view to having a 'selective breast tissue removal operation' costing possibly 10-20 times more money, putting me through invasive surgery and quite possibly for nothing. Whilst all this has been going on, my sister has since found out that she has 'Secondary Breast Cancer' in the Clavical Lymph Gland and we are awaiting what they propose to offer in the way of treatment. Surely prevention is better than cure. They must have spent more money on the counselling sessions that I have required, which could have been spent of the blood test 10 years ago and all this could have been behind me? This is the UK NHS system affter all!!! Typically English!",

      "Content": "Hi Jeniffer1, Hereditary Breast cancer means just that! If your Parents or siblings haven't had it then it's unlikely that you will. Firstly, stop worrying. Nothing constructive came out of worrying. You can be proactive by carrying out the usual self examinations to get to know your body and see your GP if you are concerned about anything unusual. I come from a family with a wide variety of cancer's from both the male and female species. I keep my thoughts in proportion and carry out the self checks for peace of mind each month and have had regular mammograms because of both my mother and sister having had Breast cancer. Unfortunately, my sister's Breast cancer has returned and further investigations are being carried out. Hope this alleviates any concerns you may have.",

      "Content": "My sister aged 52 has today been advised that she has Metastatic Adenocarcinoma which they believe is linked to her Breast Cancer 16 years ago. She had a Lymphoma and a lumpectomy operation at that time and the measurements advised now for this are 14mm x 10mm x 6mm. Shortly prior to Christmas (2009) she had been experiencing a painful area in the clavical? ( front, lower left side of her neck) which seemed to be slightly swollen), this went down but returned more painfully after Christmas and she sought advice from the GP. Based on her previous history he referred her for x-ray's, blood tests and as silly as it seemed an ultra sound scan of her stomach! Followed by a further Ultra sound scan of her neck. The results proved inconclusive so she was referred to an Ear, Nose & Throat specialist who then put her forward for a CT Scan and a biopsy, and they would see her in clinic 2 weeks later for results. Again, based on her history, the results came back (not good) was what she was advised, but inconclusive. They booked her in for an operation to have the lump removed which has been done, but they have also located another lump the other side, and she would be seen back in clinic again, 2 weeks later. That was today. All they have said is that it looks like Metastatic adenocarcinoma and other words used were 'Extracapsular extension', 'Immunoreactive', ER & HMFG2, and negative. Not necessarily in that order, because all became a blur, information overload, shock etc. I have researched the definitions but don't want to add 2+2 to get 8. She will now be referred back to her original consultant from 16 years ago which will be another 2 weeks to wait, in the meantime, her mind in working overtime and she is experiencing nightmares and can't sleep. No one has told her what to expect, what the next stage is likely to be, what treatment, if any, is planned, nothing. Please, can anyone help me with how this can be connected to her Breast Cancer 16 years ago, unless of course, it's classed as a Secondary Cancer, in which case, can you please tell me the implications of this as well? What could be the prognosis? We are in England and I don't live 'normal hours'. Very anxious",

My sister has got an appointment for next Wednesday having been referred back to her original Breast Cancer consultant but she has had to push for an earlier one because they were offering her one 2-3 weeks time. My sister is doing everything at 100mph in her head but we are trying to get her to slow down and keep things in proportion. We can only give her information in 'bitesize' chunks because she would just not cope. How do people cope with this condition? I will keep posting updates as I find websites like this very useful and any suggestions or support would be gratefully received.",

      "Content": "Hi Jim, Today has been a more positive day. We have spoken at length and I have suggested she write down all the questions that pop into her head about her condition. What can she expect, what will the treatment involve etc and we have made a good start with that in order for her to take this to her appointment next week. It has been quite theraputic in a weird sort of a way because she is feeling more organised and prepared to plan. She has never been one for tea and sympathy because as she puts it, she'll crumble and go to pieces. She needs to think positive and to be as proactive as possible. Its funny that you mentioned the video diary of her life because when she was 50 years old, 2 yrs ago for her birthday, I had designed a folder similar to that of 'This is your Life' on UK TV with Eammon Andrews many years ago. I had designed a page for each year of her life, including photographs starting from 3 months old when she was christened. She was amazed and loved it, and we had the pleasure of re-kindling all those childhood memories when she sat turning the pages (priceless). I have spoken to some of our friends and we are going to plan a sponsored walk for her to raise funds in order that we can send her to a 'dream destination' arranged around her treatment once we know what that is likely to be and we will get all her work colleagues involved in it also. We're also trying to re-arrange her working day so that she isn't left to her thoughts on her own when going home to her empty apartment. Her boss has (so far) been very supportive and I suspect her will continue to do so. You have had this disease with you for many years and you remain so positive which is a good thing. I really appreciate all the good work you have done around this forum, as I am sure others do also. Your comments are inspiring for the unfortunate ones of us who find ourselves thrown into this position, unawares of what lies ahead. My sister's current goal is to go to Egypt in May obviously subject to her treatment, we shall have to see. This was booked last year before any of this came to light and her second goal is to be around for her only Grand son whose 4yrs old. We have always respected how precious life is following the loss of our brother aged 20yrs (died in Road Collision) some 26years ago but nothing can prepare you for this. But we must continue to be positive and enjoy everyday. No one say's it will be easy and we're not through the shock stage yet but whatever we face, we will face it together. Goodnight and god bless. You will be in my prayers. Rachael",
