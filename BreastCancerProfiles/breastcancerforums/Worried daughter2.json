    "Content": "This week, during a 4 month post op (recently recieved a liver transplant) follow up, a CT chest scan showed \"Asymmetric density in the retroareolar region of the left breast [a breast malignancy needs to be excluded-recommend workup].\" Not sure what to think about this? Just had yearly diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound 1 month ago. The mammogram was fine and left breast u/s shows \"a stable 1cm nodule in the retroareolar left breast since 2008\", which has been known about. Could something of changed in the last month??? Could the anti rejection meds cause the \"stable nodule\" to progress??? I am really surprised that the chest CT picked up something on the breast, especially multiple Chest CT scans have been done since 2008 and other than the breast mammogram and breast u/s, the prior chest CT scans never mentioned it...is that common??? Again, I am a bit surprised because the retroareolar nodule has been present since 2008 and its been stable since. Should there be a followup with breast doctor???",
