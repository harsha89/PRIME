    "Content": "I'm Amanda and I'm 18. About a year ago I had a bit of a scare when I found a lump on my left breast. I had it checked and it was just a calcium deposit. I was relieved to say the least. Since then, my doctor advised me to come in every month so she could do a breast exam since I wasn't too comfortable doing it myself, for fear I didn't know exactly what I was doing. I'm overweight and I'm a smoker, plus I've had a number of other health problems so she felt it was best. A little over a week ago I went in for another breast exam and my doctor found two new lumps on my right breast. Right after she told me I wasn't too concerned because I expected her to tell me it was another few calcium deposits. Instead, she told me that they didn't feel right at all and that I should go in for testing. Literally the day after I was in for an ultrasound and got those results five days later. They were inconclusive, and I was then set up for a biopsy. I had the biopsy yesterday which was weird. I was shaking like crazy for some reason. I heard it's very uncommon for people my age to have breast cancer, but I'm assuming theres still a chance. So far, I'm taking it well. It hasn't really hit me that cancer might be a possibility. I'm curious as to how other people handled the news either when they found out they might have cancer, or when they found out they did have cancer.",
