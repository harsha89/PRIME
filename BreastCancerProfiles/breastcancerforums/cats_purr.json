    "Content": "My pathology report said I have vascular invasion. I am node negative, ER/PR - and HER/neu -. The tumor was about 1 cm. I am worried about the \"vasuclar invasion\". What does this mean for my prognosis? I have read a lot of differing opinions on the net. I am meeting with an oncologist next week to get started on chemo and rads, but want to know if anyone out there knows about this. Thanks. \"Worried in VA\"",
