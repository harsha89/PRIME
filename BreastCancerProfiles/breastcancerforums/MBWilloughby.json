    "Content": "Does anyone have experience with Tykerb + Xeloda treatments? I'm looking for info for my mom. Details are: 62 yrs old, diagnosed w/ breast cancer in March 2006, HER2+, ER/PR-, multiple lymph nodes involved. She had ACT chemo, then chest radiation. BC metastacized to brain in October 2006. Radiosurgery removed 2.5cm tumor successfully, then she had 50 WBR treatments. She was on Herceptin + Taxotere chemo from Jan 2007 - November 2007. Diagnosed with 3 new brain mets on 12/8/07 - two tumors in cerebellum and one in left parietal area. Had gamma knife on one tumor in cerebellum 12/19/07 but two remain untreated. We have seen minimal improvement since gamma knife. She could be candidate for cyber knife in ~4 more weeks and/or Tykerb + Xeloda chemo. We are struggling with QUALITY of life vs QUANTITY of life questions. In addition to the cancer, she suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression. Is Tykerb + Xeloda helping anyone in similar situation? How bad are the side effects?",
