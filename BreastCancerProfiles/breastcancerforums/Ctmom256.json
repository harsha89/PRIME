Before the technician scanned the nodule she spent quite a while taking measurements in the area where my axillary lymph node would be. Is that protocol or did the mammogram show a problem there as well. No one would tell me anything and I don't meet with the surgeon for another week and a half. They just said it is a 2.5 cm solid nodule. Thanks for any input!",
