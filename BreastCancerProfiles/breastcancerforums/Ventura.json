    "Content": "Hi, My 65 yo Mom recently (10/4/10) had an abnormal mammogram and ultrasound so they decided to do a biopsy and we were told it wasn't cancer. Fast forward to now...and she had another abnormal mammogram and ultrasound so they decide to do an excisional biopsy. Well, while we were at the hospital they told us that back in October they didn't do a biopsy but rather a cyst aspiration. Which I guess is not the same as a biopsy. Anyway, from what I've read...it's extremely rare for a postmenopausal woman to have cysts. So what exactly did they aspire back in October? And why didn't they just do an excisional biopsy back then? I don't know if this abnormality is the same as the one she had in October. We should have the biopsy results on Monday. From what I've read any abnormality in a postmenopausal woman should be assumed to be cancer until proven otherwise, so why do the aspiration in the first place. Something just doesn't make sense. Should I be seeking a different hospital/specialist? Sorry if I'm rambling...just want to make sure my Mom is in the best hands possible. Thanks for your help!",
