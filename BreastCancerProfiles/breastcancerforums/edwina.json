    "Content": "Can anyone tell me a bit about the seriousness of my mum's cancer in her right breast. Last week I lost my 68 year old dad to bowel cancer and then I know find out my 67 year old mum has two 5mm tumours in her right breast. She said that when they did the biopsy a couple of months ago she thought she saw the stuff in the needle they were sucking out go back down the needle at one stage which makes you wonder if that alone will cause the cancer cells to know spread. After that they did radiotherapy, and now two months after the biopsy they are this week doing surgery to remove them and check the lymph nodes. Her sister died of this disease after a long battle, and now my mum. How does this affect my chances of being another statistic? How are her chances if these tumours arfe only 5mm each? Is it not dangerous cutting etc in that the cancers may now spread? I am going to lose both my parents at this rate to cancers at a relatively young age. I am currently 48.",
