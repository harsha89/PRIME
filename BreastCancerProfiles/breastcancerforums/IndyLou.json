      "Content": "Hello, all- While I've participated on these boards for a while--primarily as a cancer survivor who tries to give encouragement to others--I heard today of a friend of ours who's been battling metastatic breast cancer for several years now, has been admitted to in-home hospice care. I know that a few months ago, they discovered that this beast had reached her brain. They tried several chemo/targeted therapies, and then finally radiation. She just doesn't seem to have responded very well, and as of a few weeks ago, her physical (and perhaps emotional) state has taken a decided turn to the south. She has complained of \"just not feeling well\" or \"feeling tired.\" This post is really just me venting a little, as I usually try to stay so positive with people I've known with cancer, but this woman seems different. No treatment seems to have worked with her, and I'm most saddened by the family she'll be leaving behind. She's only in her 40's, but has sons in middle and high school. Her husband is a pillar of strength, but this just seems way too early. I wondered if anyone here can speak to this type of cancer, and why it might not be treatable. I saw her in church recently, and she still seemed like she was managing as well as she could, still able to walk and talk with people. Also, if she's reached this point to be admitted to hospice care such as this, how long could she possibly have? Is palliative care still given while under hospice care? Thanks for your thoughts.",

      "Content": "Hello, concerned- Speaking as a former cancer patient, I would imagine that it's almost MORE difficult being a caregiver at times, because you're thrown into a situation where you have to interpret the patient, interpret what the medical team is doing/saying, and you're on the outside looking in. What may be perfectly rational and obvious to you, might be vague and irrational to the patient. You have to play part psychologist, advocate, nurse, friend, servant, coach, and perhaps many other roles in your position. I'd like to speak to your questions about the medical team. I believe it should be led by a primary oncologist--someone that you see, or will see regularly during the work-up, treatments, and follow-up appointments. That oncologist should be assisted by some good nurses, and quality office staff really help in terms of appointments and billing issues. While that oncologist should serve as a primary contact, they may be assisted by other doctors: geneticists, hematologists, dietitians, pain management specialists, etc. Above all, I think the cancer care team should approach the patient holistically. They should be open about questions that the patient and their caregiver have, and should give you options for treatment (assuming options exist.) My oncologist even said that \"not treating my cancer was an option,\" but one he advised against. I think they should be relatively up-front about the prognosis, and certainly about any side effects from the chemo. Immediately following my diagnosis, my wife wanted me to explore all kinds of cancer treatment centers, trying to seek out \"the best.\" This was even prior to my first meeting with my radiologist. We had a vacation planned down in Mexico, and I asked the ENT who gave me my diagnosis what I should do about the vacation, if anything. He told me, \"enjoy yourself!\" My wife and I met with my radiologist upon my return. He spent a sufficient amount of time with us, answering our questions, talking about outcomes, next steps, etc. While I didn't fully appreciate what 35 days of radiation meant at the time, I would learn a lot about my disease in the days and weeks to come. I have no doubt that you'll learn much more about your family member's breast cancer, too. Needless to say, I was very comfortable with the initial meeting with my radiologist, and both my wife and I agreed that no further exploration was needed. If you're in the US, there are many top-notch cancer centers from which to choose, but there are really good regional and local centers as well. For \"basic\" or \"common\" cancers, especially those not in late-stages, I don't think people need to search for the \"best\" centers. Most of them follow basic national cancer protocols for treatment anyway. In cases of rare, or more complex and aggressive cancers, you might want a treatment center that participates in clinical trials. That might be necessary in case your patient doesn't respond to treatment, or has a recurrence following their treatment. Information is powerful, both as a cancer patient and caregiver. I would advise to get your information from trusted sources, rather than searching high and low on Google. You have a specific diagnosis, as opposed to some vague symptoms, so your knowledge-gathering can be more targeted. Best wishes to you on this journey.",

      "Content": "Hello, Mari- I am in the US, and my knowledge is more limited of EU facilities. To be honest, I was referred to my ENT and radiation oncologist by my primary care physician. The cancer center was part of a hospital approximately an 8-minute drive from my house. My wife and I met with the radiation oncologist, and were pleased with the information he gave us. He was very forthcoming, and we agreed that it did not make sense to seek other cancer experts. As I said in my original answer, most of the cancer centers in the US follow established protocols for most \"common\" cancers. I think the difference between centers is the experience of the doctors and medical staffs, and their ability to treat patients and anticipate their holistic needs. One thing you might look for are cancer hospitals that participate in clinical trials. I know that pharmaceutical companies that sponsor trials evaluate clinical sites quite extensively, to ensure they follow established treatment guidelines. I'm not suggesting that you should influence your relative to participate in a clinical trial, only that if the cancer center chosen had clinical experience, they might be considered \"better.\" Again, I'm not entirely sure if there are any limitations on the hospitals, treatments, or doctors you may choose. If you have the choice, consider phoning their offices for an initial consultation. Have some questions in advance--consider those posted at the following location: https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast...st-cancer.html I wish you and your relative a successful journey. Please don't hesitate to check back in with us.",

      "Content": "My mother in-law was treated for breast cancer over 7 years ago, and is enjoying a very healthy life post-cancer. It is true however, that the treatments (chemo) were very toxic, and neuropathy in her extremities was excruciating. Part of that was on her--she neglected her pain medication for fear of \"becoming addicted,\" and she readily admits to it now. Otherwise, she's recovered quite well, and enjoys her family and especially her grandchildren. You present a scenario where you \"feel\" fine walking into that hospital, and you wonder why you would willfully accept a poisonous cocktail of chemotherapy. The truth is, your feeling fine is relative to the deadly cancer growing inside you. Six months from now, if untreated, the cancer could grow progressively larger and metastasize throughout your body. Your chances of survival if left untreated may grown significantly smaller, and future treatments might not help. Your best chances to eradicate this beast will occur if you treat early, as opposed to waiting. You don't want to have to explain to your young children that you can't be around for them because you chose not to be treated.",
