    "Content": "I just received my dx yesterday but this site has been a favorite, for many reasons, for quite a while. http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/int...other-products It is run by Sloan Kettering and has a huge database of various herbs and supplements and lists the research studies that have been done and I was amazed by how many have been done. I just bought some bitter melon b/c of what I read on there and will be sharing that info with my doc, Didee. Each citation will also tell you if there are any known interactions or contraindications for using with chemo drugs or other therapies.",
