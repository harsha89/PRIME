      "Content": "Hello, Patricia -- Many of us here on the pancreatic cancer forum have written so many times about our own losses that we get worn out. Forgive us for not responding to you -- you need support, not silence. Your mother is facing the end of her days. Losing her now, after a lifetime of her support for you, is hard to bear. All of us on this forum have lost - or are losing - someone very dear to us. It's no exaggeration when I say that no matter how we prepare, how much we think we know about \"the end\" or about God or about life, my brother's death (and my mother's just 10 months before) was a sharp knife which pierced my heart and ripped it wide open. There were times I thought I couldn't stand one more moment. Then it passes. Later, when you think you've comes to terms with all of it, have sobbed your last tears, repeated your sad story over and over to anyone who will listen, it stops. And when you least expect it, when you're shopping or watching a tape or eating a pizza, grief comes again like a terrorist, sneaking up on you, rolling over you, paralyzing you with pain so sharp you almost bleed with the savagery of it. Then it passes again. I don't know your mother. You didn't know my brother. None of us knows anything about the loved ones who are the subject of this forum, but it's your loss that I am writing about -- your sadness, your grief, your terror at losing her, and finally, your inability to stop what's happening. I will ask you to check out a posting that I wrote some time ago entitled: \"The End -- Thoughts on A Loved One's Dying.\" It may help during this time. Please know that we've all been there. We have been so very, very busy with details and then too overwhelmed to move. We have hugged and kissed and then have then been unable to speak. We have read stories, sung hymns, recited poetry, all hoping that he/she would hear, and the softness of a familiar voice would heal or help or stop what we knew to be inevitable. As my brother began to slip away I told him I would grab him by the heels and pull him back if I thought I had the power. I never did. We are all thinking about you in Texas. Find comfort in the community of strangers. Sincerely, Big Sister",

      "Content": "Hello, All -- I am a transplant from the pancreatic cancer forum and very aware of the value of these online support communities. Having said that --- one of my best friends was diagnosed yesterday with early stage cancer in her left breast. She will have a lumpectomy, lymph node biopsy and then radiation following surgery. There is history of breast cancer in her family with no survivors. My question to you all: What does a good friend say/do at the outset of such a diagnosis? After the surgery? Later? to a wonderful woman who believes she is facing a death sentence from this cancer? Do I rush in with casseroles? Do I pen small words of encouragement? Do I send flowers? All? None? I will, of course, refer her to this site as your stories are very encouraging, but I need a plan for myself that will be helpful to her over the next few months. Thanks. Big Sister",
