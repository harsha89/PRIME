      "Content": "Hi, I am a 55 yo 1.5 years out from bilateral mastectomy(one side prophylactically) for Stage 1 min invasive ductal Ca with neg sentinal node and neg 9 other nodes. I had 4 rounds of cytoxan and adriamycin and 10 months of Tamoxifen(this was discontinued at 10 months because of severe leg cramps). I was then switched over to Arimidex that I have been on for 3 months now. I was premenapausal at diagnosis but went into menopause after chemo. I had a pelvic ultrasound after being on Tamoxifen for 6 months which was negative for uterine lining problems. I had a follow up U/S today (off Tamoxifen for about 3 months now) which show nothing in my uterus but showed multiple ovarian cysts(7- that were small(largest was 8mm) on one ovary only. My oncologists states that this is not a side effect of the Arimidex but I am concerned because I was unaware that being more than a year post menopausal that I should develop multiple ovarian cysts. Do you have an thoughts or recommendations other than repeat U/S in 3 months?",
