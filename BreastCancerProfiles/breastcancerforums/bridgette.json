It just hurts so bad that the soreness is on my mind every minute of the day. It just feels like there is something in there. Bridgette",

      "Content": "I need to know of any signs of breast cancer besides a lump? I am 31 years old and for the past two weeks I have been experiencing pain in my right breast. I thought it would have went away by now but it hasn't. I'm experiencing a pain and soreness on the top part of my right breast in the area right below my arm pit. I don't feel any lump but I haven't really did a good check because to be honest with you, I am scared to death to check. Is there any other signs and is breast pain and soreness one of the signs?
