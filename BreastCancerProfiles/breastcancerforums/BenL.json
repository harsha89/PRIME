      "Content": "Hello. My girlfriend, Audrey, of 10 months has had two lumpectomies: Left (Her2 +) 8mm lump removed 2012; Right (Her2 tripple) removed March 2015. A genetic testing confirmed that she has a genetic mutation. She is considered stage 1. Audrey is 42 and in excellent health. She is a vegetarian. She hikes, kayaks, bikes. She is an athlete. We are in love. I have two daughters from a previous marriage. We want to marry. Audrey is very concerned about the side effects of conventional treatment. Since the discovery of her first lump in 2012, aside from conventional imaging diagnostics and surgery, she has elected to adopt a supplement, herb, and diet based treatment protocol. Audrey is very smart. She has a big heart, loves nature and animals. She is extremely distrusting of conventional treatment due to reports of side effects: sickness and disease coming from chemotherapy and radiation. She is constantly researching alternative methods. Occasionally getting advice. She has been met, unfortunately, with mostly unsympathetic and often condescending attitudes from most of her Conventional/Western doctors. Is there anyone out there who has done extensive research and comparison of conventional treatment (chemo, Herceptin, and radiation) versus Alternative/Complimentary treatment, or who knows of someone who has? The survival rates and statistics of these comparisons are what she seeks. Audrey is obsessed with details, percentages and statistics. Other than some books, articles, google searches and words of wisdom from doctors, I have no other real data for Audrey. My own (uneducated) common sense tells me that if, after the first lump removed in 2012, that if her diet and herb treatment was successful, the second (new, non-recurring) lump would not have resulted. We managed to find with a doctor who mentioned that there are trials presently underway and close to FDA approval that might pave the way for Conventional treatment of Herceptin without chemotherapy. But, Audrey is frightened by various articles indicating that even without chemotherapy, Herceptic, alone, has damaging side effects. Again, out of ignorance, I just don't know what to say or offer her. My gut is, along side her continuing supplements and diet (which seem to be a good idea for anyone - all of us - as a means to boost our immune system and, otherwise, stay healthy) is to find an oncologist in whom we trust, and go from there. I am very grateful for your thoughts. Warmly, Ben",
