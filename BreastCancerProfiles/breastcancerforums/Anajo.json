      "Content": "Doctors are not experts in all fields. My surgeon could not even come close to answering specific questions related to breast cancer that my oncologist could. After my mastectomy I woke up with a numb tongue. My surgeon claimed that it was due to a vitamin B12 deficiency and that it couldn't possibly have anything to do with the operation. I then contacted the anesthesiologist who sent me to an ear, nose and throat docter; he said that the tube had moved during surgery and was resting on a tongue nerve. Anyway, the point is that if you have a question, you have to go to the correct specialist. Surgeons are great at surgery, but they don't know a whole lot about other areas of medicine.[/url][/b]",

      "Content": "My surgeon removed my port at his office. It only took about 10 minutes. I must say, though, that it hurt A LOT! with about 5 needle insertions to numb the area. Once I was numbed it was OK. I would have preferred that he used some kind of sedative or topical cream like Lidocaine before the needle insertions. Anyway, it was a simple procedure. My skin had grown to it after 6 months and that was the most difficult part.",
