    "Content": "Hello everyone Recently my very incredible mom actually step mom has been told that her breast cancer that she had beaten last April had spread to the sacks of her lungs .She was placed on an oral chemo in late Feb or early March . on top of the cancer she also has only 1 and a half functioning lungs her right side being the weaker lung and she has copd . In June we found out that the oral chemo did not work and she was started on a new IV chemo . and they placed a tap into her right lung to help drain the extra fluids they also did a procedure that involved using a talc based product that helps to fuse the sacks to the lung so that fluid and cells can't gain access into the actual lung .Seems to be working since they are removing 100cc or so every 5 to 6 days instead of every other day . I am kinda being kept in the dark about all of this she is an amazing lady who has beaten multible myloma and breast cancer once already . I was just wondering has anyone heard of the success rates on this new talc procedure sorry I do not really know that actual name . I am not really allowed to ask about her treatments or discuss anyone else I know batteling this illness because they don't want to hear any negitive or other peoples storys . Sorry I am rambling but I have lost 6 memebers of my family in the past 12 years to this illness and I hate seeing her fight this again .. I am worried that she is worse than they are telling me . any advice or info on Met breast cancer would be greatly appreciated .her breast cancer was triple negitive when she was first diagnosed and she ended up allergic to the chemos she was given so she just had radiation ..Thank you all I think just think it felt better getting all that off my chest .",
