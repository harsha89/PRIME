    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with recurrent BC after 17 yrs in Dec '03. Had mast/chemo/radiation in '86. Biopsy in Jan '04 from neck lymph nodes revealed that it was recurrent BC (same cancer as in '86). The PET scan showed the cancer to be in most of her bones and showed her spleen to be enlarged (which is what made her go to the doctors initially because she could feel it). The scan did not show the cancer to be in the spleen - just enlarged. She had four or five treatments of taxotere (once q three wks) and was rescanned. Scans showed very little improvement but neither had it spread any place else. She had one large (800 rads) dose of radiation to her hip in May. Her spleen did decrease in size while doing the taxotere. Her last taxotere treatment was in April. She didn't have any treatment again until July and that was Xeloda (2 wks on, 1 wk off). Her red count and platelet count dropped so doc stopped Xeloda after three rounds. Finished last round Sept 2. Was transfused q two weeks for seven wks. Her spleen is HUGE. She is now getting only Aredia (q monthly) and Aranesp (biweekly). The Aranesp has stablized her red count (11 last week) and platelets (77,000 last wk) although still low are higher for her than they've been in four months. My mom has decided to stop treatment except for the Aredia and Aranesp. Curious as to what your opinion would be for her. She's otherwise a healthy 63 year old lady who was very active and takes no meds even now. She has the same oncologist as she did 17 yrs ago, and he's wonderful. Said the next chemo he would try would be Navelbine but in Sept said the risks because of her counts (6-8 red count, 25,000-38,000 platelets) were high. My mom wanted quality not quantity of life. In September he told her she had weeks to a few months to live. We are approaching that timeframe and she's feeling pretty good - has her energy back, just got back from a ten day trip to see her mom and siblings and is virtually (knock on wood) pain free. Suggestions? Thank you Kathy",
