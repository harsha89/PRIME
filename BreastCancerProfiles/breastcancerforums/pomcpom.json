    "Content": "Hello...I have had multiple biopsies..all benign up to this point..Recently I had a 6 mth follow up...once complete the nurse came over and said looks fine come back in 6 mths...then my breast specialist physician (his nurse)called me and said he wanted to see me..I asked y as the radiologist said everything was fine till March...I asked her to please be sure he really needed to see me as it was far away and i have little ones and if it was just for him to tell me the same thing the radiologist said then can we skip it. So she said that she would check with him...2 weeks passed I heard nothing and forgot about it...then she calls and says he wants to see you...i say why again for same reasons..she said it was a birad 3 and hyperechoic and that he wanted to check me out and review the films again etc...everything i have read online says birad 3 is barely used any more and no reason for a dr visit at least for 6 mths... copy of report...any translation of this line would be helpful: \"the lesion was described as discordant with the pathology result\" but it doesnt seem like an issue if the radiologist said come back in 6 mths...any input would be so appreciated thank you and have a great day .",
