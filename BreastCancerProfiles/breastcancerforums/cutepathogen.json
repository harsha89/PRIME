    "Content": "We have a family member diagnosed with a stage 3 breast cancer (ductal carinoma in both breasts that has metastasized to the armpits lymph nodes). We got her an appointment with Dr. Mahmoud El-Tamer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. What is the likely prognosis of the case with the treatment at MSKCC? Opinions and information about the treatment options would be appreciated. Does anyone have an experience with Dr. El-Tamer?",
