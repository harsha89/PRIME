    "Content": "I was diagnosede with Lobular carcinoma in situ after having two sets of mammograms done. Then a breas biosophy was done, and I was told I have LCIS AND CALCIUM DESPOSITS. My mom and grandmother both had breast cancer, so since that a mri was done on my breast to take a better look at the calcium despoists. I will be seeing my doctor this Friday for results. He already told me he will take me to surgery to remove the LCIS but I don't know what will be done about the calcium deposits yet? Is is the norm to go to surgergy to remove LCIS????
