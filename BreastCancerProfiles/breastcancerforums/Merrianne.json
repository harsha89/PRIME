      "Content": "Hey girl. Power to the women. It is so amazing, and you will see, if your mother and yourself already have a good connection, which it seems you do...... this will only make you more strong and an incredible alliance towards the \"stupid cow\" called cancer. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, 6 years ago. I was on an international road tour, my mother didn't want to tell me. she knew what I would do. So, when I came off the road for a 2 week hiatus, she told me. She had known for two months. So, after I had a fit for her waiting so long to tell me, I resigned from my position, and found a nice 2-bedroom apt for us. My parents have been divorced since I was 7. So it has always been she and I. Not sure if you are familiar with the song by Helen Reddy \"You and Me Against the World\". That is our song. She went through 5 surgeries, a mastectomy, 6 months of chemo, she brought home every three weeks, followed by 6 months of radiation. she has been clean for 6 years. She went in for her check-up, last week. He cancer marker has remained at 36 since the treatment. It was at 550 on this last Friday. You will find out about the markers and such as you go along. But, needless to say, more than likely we are in for a new battle. We cried, we laughed, we are mad, and now, I am ready to help her fight again. There is no controlling the emotions you both will be feeling, but the most important thing is to remain a support for each other. My mom kept getting confused with all the research. So that is where I came into being the most help. I would read and read and read, and then explain to her what I had found. also, it helped with knowing and expressing questions to the dr. / oncologist. It is soooo much to wrap your head around , DO NOT get discouraged. My mom, bless her heart, her mind was so blown, as well as my own, but I was able to step up and be the strong one, ask the questions my mom didn't want to think about much less ask. So remember, at 35 to begin having your own breast exams, as well as giving yourself your own exams, and keep in mind you mother will be going through all kinds of changes with the therapy she will be doing, she may not always be herself, but you can and will be her support. I did attend a few meetings for cancer support groups, and found that is does help. But I found jut researching and reading as much as possible throught out, helped me to come to terms with it, and to explain to other family members, and well wishers. Please feel free to email me, and keep in contact with me. I am 35 years old, married 3 years ago, and have an incredible 15 month old son. With her counts coming back as they did Friday, she will go in for her PET scan on Wednesday, and I will return with her to her oncologist on Friday 7/28 to see where we are, and what will need to be done, if anything. Don't lose faith, and Live Strong! Best to you both.......... Merrianne",
