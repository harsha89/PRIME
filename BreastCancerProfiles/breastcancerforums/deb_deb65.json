    "Content": "I recently had my yearly check up and a lump was discovered. After a mammogram and a breast ultrasound, i was told it was a calcification. My doctor said good news and that was that. Now i am reading more about this and i am finding that maybe more should be done. Maybe a biopsy, or more tests. Anyone know more about calcifications? Should i leave it be as my doctor suggested or get a second opinion?",
