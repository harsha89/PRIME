      "Content": "I had breast cancer that was stage 2b, it hit my lymph nodes. I had chemo and then radiation. I thought I beat it. I always had back pain after the chemo and was told that its normal usually from the chemo I kept complaining they took an xray and said that I had degenerative joint disease in the back and the cartilidge wore away. SO they gave me pain meds and that was that. Well I had a double mastectomy, reconstruction a tram flap surgery a hernia repair and then I had a stent put in my chest because all my veins collapsed and angio plasty. After all that one morning I woke and could barely walk I went to the hospital in pain and couldnt walk well they did a scan and they found my worst nightmare. I had incurable bone cancer and a fractured femur it spread from my back to my left hip to my left femur and knee and there was a lesion on my rib. I was devastated. I still am. I had radiation and a rod put into my left leg to support it. I lost weight Im 106 pounds this is so devastating to me I have happy marriage and 3 kids and 2 dogs. All my dreams are gone I wanted to move to new house with my husband we put that on hold and now his job is shaky they may lay him off in the spring. I cry all the time. I had radiation again and now I need chemo for 6 months Ive had 3 treatments so far. I go this friday for my fourth. I sit in bed everyday because the doctors are worried I may need a knee replacement and a hip replacement. IM SO DEVASTATED.. I think about dying all the time and even got my will redone. Im scared to die. I dont want to lose my kids or the love of my life my husband we have been together for 12 years. I have 2 kids from my first marriage and 1 4 year old boy with him. I cant imagine dying and leaving them behind. SO its a very sad thing Im young Im 40 now Ive been fighting this since 2003 ... Life has a way of changing on you and what you thought would happen doesnt and the worst part about it is Im afraid to let go. My little 4 year old wouldnt understand,.. Im terminal now. Its scary",

Now Im scared Im already in pain from taxotere and bone cancer and I have a rod in my leg and Im so scared I have enough pain right now with taxotere. And all that Ive been through the ol' double mastectomies and the reconstruction and the hernia repair due to the tram flap surgery and of course the nice rod in my leg ,, so Im not looking forward to more pain and the rules with pain meds are incredible for people that have legitimate pain. Its a 30 day wait, and Im always running out because my pain surpasses my script and now they gave me more and its worse because if I go off of them (norco ) I go through horrible withdrawels. Its horrible. Im also on pain patches. They do nothing as far as Im concerned. But anyway I am so scared because Im running out of pain meds and the nurse said dont worry we will give you a script and thats not the problem the problem is the pharmacy rules.

I wish I just could use an aspirin but it doesnt quite work. I dont know anymore I get tired of the run around I get the script and cant get the meds I need so badly for pain its sort of unreal in a way I know people abuse meds but I have real pain.

Also with my 3 kids Im always in bed I feel so bad for them because they basically already lost their mom. You are so lucky in alot of ways I know bi polar isnt fun for you but its better than cancer. I keep acting like Im already dead I have problems with pain killers they perscribe Norco for me but I have to take alot for it to work and I dont want to change meds because these work better than anything ive tried however I run out alot and I go through a horrible withdrawel and sometimes I have to get a script and pay out of pocket its like 360 bucks ,,, Im low again on pain pills so I wont make it to later next month and its frustrating. Its the only thing that makes me feel better somewhat. Have you been given anything for Pain?",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer that was stage 2b, it hit my lymph nodes. I had chemo and then radiation. I thought I beat it. I always had back pain after the chemo and was told that its normal usually from the chemo I kept complaining they took an xray and said that I had degenerative joint disease in the back and the cartilidge wore away. SO they gave me pain meds and that was that. Well I had a double mastectomy, reconstruction a tram flap surgery a hernia repair and then I had a stent put in my chest because all my veins collapsed and angio plasty. After all that one morning I woke and could barely walk I went to the hospital in pain and couldnt walk well they did a scan and they found my worst nightmare. I had incurable bone cancer and a fractured femur it spread from my back to my left hip to my left femur and knee and there was a lesion on my rib. I was devastated. I still am. I had radiation and a rod put into my left leg to support it. I lost weight Im 106 pounds this is so devastating to me I have happy marriage and 3 kids and 2 dogs. All my dreams are gone I wanted to move to new house with my husband we put that on hold and now his job is shaky they may lay him off in the spring. I cry all the time. I had radiation again and now I need chemo for 6 months Ive had 3 treatments so far. I go this friday for my fourth. I sit in bed everyday because the doctors are worried I may need a knee replacement and a hip replacement. IM SO DEVASTATED.. I think about dying all the time and even got my will redone.

I am terminal and Ive had lets see Expanders in and out , double mastectomy , then implants saline and then my right breast got infected and I had to get a tram flap which caused a hernia so I needed that repaired then I needed a stent in my chest and an angioplasty and then to top in off I had a fractured femur so I needed a rod put into my leg, SO after all that I had radiation twice and chemo now twice I have 6 months of it left and Im miserable with my boob job to be honest I had the nipples done but they look different because one boob is a tram and the other is an implant one is hard the other more realistic. One is bigger and higher than the other and they both have scars going across so its a mess. Im a nightmare my husband doesnt come near me and I can understand why, he never likes fake boobs so I guess these are a turn off especially since they dont look real.Now its a constant reminder of what I went through and after all of that Im dying anyway, its sad..

      "Content": "Hi Lisa I thought I was a cancer survivor. I was diagnosed with stage 2b and had a double mastectomy with reconstruction I had lymph nodes involved. My name is Regina I am also happily married I have been together with my hubby for 12 years and have 3 kids 2 from my first husband and 1 from my second huband. SO I have alot at stake. I had my surgery in 2003 after my baby was born. I thought I beat this I had chemo and radiation and reconstruction. Then I always had a pain in my lower back and was told it was Joint disease from the chemo. Well It was my worst fear after suffering a fractured femur I was diagnosed with incurable bone cancer. It had spread to my lower back , my left hip my left femur and left knee and left rib. Its like everywhere I went back for radiation until they couldnt radiate anymore and now im on 6 months of chemo. I may need a knee replacement and a hip replacement. SO Im scared it will never go away and Im only 40, and look young. I am so sad about it I cry alot I think about dying everyday and all my future plans have been put on hold. Like moving to a house of out own and just a whole new life.. everything stops. Life as I knew it is different. Nothing happens between my husband and I because Im always sick and very skinny. I dont feel the same Im always in bed. My mom who is 76 does my laundry and walks my dogs and takes care of my 4 year old. SO you are not the only one. I wish you luck and I pray that it doesnt spread for u. Its a nightmare. Anyway good luck if you have questions Im your girl.",
