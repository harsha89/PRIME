    "Content": "It is nervewracking. I don't think your dr. should have said one word about it being cancer. That was very unprofessional. They found something on my mammogram and sent me a letter wanting further testing. They said in large letters THIS IS NOT CANCER UNTIL THE RADIOLOST LOOKS AT IT. And it turned out to be a calcification. I know something like this causes a lot of anxiety. Try to relax until the results come back. Please keep us posted.",
