      "Content": "I had my left breast removed last November. I delayed going to have a prosthesis as there was still a lot of fluid under the scar (very wobbly like a water bed) and the surgeon assured me this would be absorbed by my body. This seroma did finally go but I'm still swollen and around the scar it feels very hard to the touch. It is also completely numb. I decided this was as good as it would get and so got in touch with the breast care nurse to get measured for a proper prosthesis. She said I should have a flat chest wall and sent me off for a scan. It turns out I have quite a large haematoma under the scar and over the chest wall. The blood has solidified so the nurse said they wouldn't be able to aspirate it unless it started to liquify again, in which case my body would eventually absorb it anyway. She said I could leave it as it is or have a small operation under general anaesthetic, once my chemo has finished, to remove it. She is also going to check with the oncologist in case he wants it out of the way before I start radiotherapy. I would be interested if anyone else has had a similar experience. I've been advised, once chemo and radiotherapy is over, to seriously think about having my other breast removed so I'm wondering if this will happen all over again.",

      "Content": "Please go with your instincts if you have any doubts at all. (Hopefully, though, your mind has been set at rest now you have had the results). I have a family history of breast cancer too. Over the last few years mammograms have shown the area behind my left nipple to be denser and more granulated than the other but I was assured this was just part of 'being me'. It was only when my normally prominent nipple started to pull in little bit when I raised my arm that I felt there was something not right. I had a biopsy done and it was confirmed there was a lobular tumour there. Apparently it was slow growing and I wonder how long it had been there. Anyway, I'm doing well - mastectomy, halfway through chemo and radiotherapy to come - but I have a feeling I could have paid a bit more attention to what my body was telling me a bit sooner.",
