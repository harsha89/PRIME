I have been receiving chemo for lung cancer but also had a tumour in my right breast that unfortunately tests couldn't determine if it was lung cancer spread to breast or whether it was breast cancer. My new oncologist that I saw last week has experience in both lung and breast cancers and although tests are still inconclusive she is of the opinion that I have 2 separate cancers. I am now going to finish up the lung cancer chemo then hopefully have a mastectomy and then go on to have radiotherapy. The tumour in my breast appears to be shrinking with the chemo I am having. so 'confused' is my middle name right now. Shirley",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. Sorry I didn't get back sooner but I seem to get delayed at every step. At the moment there is still no definitive answer to the breast lump. It has been sent off for a second opinion. Because I have been waiting over 4 months for treatment I pushed hard with the path lab to give me their findings. They are saying that the breast lump appears to be lung cancer that has spread. the biopsy has been sent for a second opinion as apparently it is unusual for lung cancer to spread to the breast. Unusual but not unheard of. Trust me! Anyway as I said waiting for 4 months made me far from happy so with the information I had I pushed my lung oncologist to start some chemo. As there is a combo (gemcarbo) that can treat both lung and breast cancer they finally agreed to start the chemo on 15th July. I had 1 lot on 15th and much to my surprise 6 days later I could no longer feel the breast lump. Does chemo work that fast? I had another lot of chemo this week and am due to see a new oncologist on Thursday next week. I still can't feel the breast lump so don't really know what to think right now but I am definitely thinking positive. Can't wait to see the new oncologist for more insight. Oh yes and fortunately up to now no side effects from chemo. Definitely feeling positive Any thoughts from anyon will be gratefully received. Thanks. Shirley",

For 4 months now I was given to believe that I had lung cancer but Monday I had to go for a mammogram due to a lump I had found on my right breast the same side as my lung? Cancer. There was a biopsy done and the latest thinking is that it breast cancer and the lung is breast cancer spread to lung. I find it really difficult to believe that after all the tests I have had done on my lungs and chest they are changing their diagnosis. I haven't yet received chemo or radiotherapy to my lung it was due to start on 15th July but has been cancelled. I really feel that I am being left to rot.
