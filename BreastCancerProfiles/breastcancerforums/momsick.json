      "Content": "my mom just found out yesterday that she had breast cancer. They removed an egg sized tumor from one of her breast monday and she got the news yesterday that it was malignant. She goes to the hospital next wednesday for surgery. They said they were going to remove the lining of her breast and check her lymph nodes to see if the cancer had spread to them yet. Then she has to take twenty some radiation treatments and possibly chemo. By this scenario can anyone tell me if this is bad or have they caught it early enough to get rid of it.

      "Content": "Hey ladies, Haven't been on here in a while. Thought I would update you on my moms condition. We finally talked her into going to lexington, ky to see an oncologist. We loved him. He was very down to earth and straightforward. We said nice to meet you and he said no it's never nice to meet me. He cracked a lot of jokes and pretty much told us how it was. My mom's tumor was 2.7 cm 14 nodes taken out and i think 4 were positive. He said she was a stage 2. She starts chemotherapy april 1st and will do 1 treatment every 3 weeks with the first 2 drugs cytoxin and something else. Then after that he wants to see how she does and 3 weeks after that takes another chemo drug once every 3 weeks 4 times. Then she starts radiation and also taxominofen or maybe some other drug. Can't remember the name of it. I asked about her prognosis. He said without chemo she has a 50 to 60 percent chance of it coming back. With all the treatment 20 to 30 percent chance of it recurring. She also has to have a bone scan to see if it's spread any and an echocardiogram to make sure her heart is strong enough as the chemo weakens the heart some. He said he didn't think it had spread because she wasn't having any bone pain but he wanted to make sure. Any comments or feedback on this. I sure would appreciate it. Good luck to everyone and your prayers are appreciated. Sorry to ramble on so much but you ladies are sure reassuring. Also anyone else on here with the same sort of diagnosis and your success stories would be very helpful to me. Thank you so much.",

I guess it could be severly aggressive, I really don't know. Mom is really worried about losing her hair. I told her to look at the big picture beating this would be well worth losing your hair. Her doctor told her it could grow back a little thicker. He said it does in some people . She was happy to hear that. Thank you for replying. I'd like to hear from some more of you!",
