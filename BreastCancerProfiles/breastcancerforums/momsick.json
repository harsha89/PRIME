      "Content": "my mom just found out yesterday that she had breast cancer. They removed an egg sized tumor from one of her breast monday and she got the news yesterday that it was malignant. She goes to the hospital next wednesday for surgery. They said they were going to remove the lining of her breast and check her lymph nodes to see if the cancer had spread to them yet. Then she has to take twenty some radiation treatments and possibly chemo. By this scenario can anyone tell me if this is bad or have they caught it early enough to get rid of it. Any information would be appreciated. God bless! Shawn",

      "Content": "Hey, just wanted to update all of you on my mom. They went in and took the lining of her breast out and removed lymph nodes. My dad went and talked to the dr. yesterday. Dad said the dr. told him they removed 40 lymph nodes from under her right arm and 8 or 9 of them were positive i guess. 40 lymph nodes? Doesn't sound right to me. She has an appt. with the dr. on the 23 of Feb. I am going with her to get it straight from the dr. myself. I was with her the day of her surgery and couldn't hardly get him to talk to us. I have been trying to get her to go the Lexington, Ky to someone who specializes in this and oncologist. The dr. that is treating her now is just a general surgeon. Mom says she is comfortable with him. I'm trying my best to talk her into this. The plan now is radiation and chemo. Give me some input on this folks. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hey ladies, Haven't been on here in a while. Thought I would update you on my moms condition. We finally talked her into going to lexington, ky to see an oncologist. We loved him. He was very down to earth and straightforward. We said nice to meet you and he said no it's never nice to meet me. He cracked a lot of jokes and pretty much told us how it was. My mom's tumor was 2.7 cm 14 nodes taken out and i think 4 were positive. He said she was a stage 2. She starts chemotherapy april 1st and will do 1 treatment every 3 weeks with the first 2 drugs cytoxin and something else. Then after that he wants to see how she does and 3 weeks after that takes another chemo drug once every 3 weeks 4 times. Then she starts radiation and also taxominofen or maybe some other drug. Can't remember the name of it. I asked about her prognosis. He said without chemo she has a 50 to 60 percent chance of it coming back. With all the treatment 20 to 30 percent chance of it recurring. She also has to have a bone scan to see if it's spread any and an echocardiogram to make sure her heart is strong enough as the chemo weakens the heart some. He said he didn't think it had spread because she wasn't having any bone pain but he wanted to make sure. Any comments or feedback on this. I sure would appreciate it. Good luck to everyone and your prayers are appreciated. Sorry to ramble on so much but you ladies are sure reassuring. Also anyone else on here with the same sort of diagnosis and your success stories would be very helpful to me. Thank you so much.",

      "Content": "They said it was an eggsized tumor. How big is that as far as centimeters. I've found information about 2cm and 5 cm. If it's less than 2, more than 2, less than 5, more than 5. A lot of information to decipher. I don't know if they are going to remove lymph nodes or what. I haven't spoken with the dr. myself so am just going by what i have been told by mom. Does a bigger tumor mean the cancer is worse? It's overwhelming! I guess wednesday will tell us a lot more. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Is it 80 percent? That is really reassuring. The doctor said moms cancer was moderately aggressive. I guess that is good. I guess it could be severly aggressive, I really don't know. Mom is really worried about losing her hair. I told her to look at the big picture beating this would be well worth losing your hair. Her doctor told her it could grow back a little thicker. He said it does in some people . She was happy to hear that. Thank you for replying. I'd like to hear from some more of you!",
