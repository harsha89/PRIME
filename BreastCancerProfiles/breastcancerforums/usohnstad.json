    "Content": "Hi.. I am new to this sight. I am 57 years old and was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2008. I had never missed a mammo but they found a lump that may have been in my breast for years. It was hidden in my lobes. I started out stage 1 on mammo, went to stage 2 with an MRI, and ended up stage 3 after the surgery. My stats are ILC, 2.2 cm, 7+/14 lymph nodes, ER+/PR-/HER- and grade 1. I had my breast removed, completed 4AC, 4Taxol, just finishing radiation, and have started Arimidex. I can not think of anything else. I wake worrying and go to bed worrying. My oncologist gives me a 50% chance. I have a few questions. I can't understand how a 2.2 cm worked it way into 7 lymph nodes, usually I hear of the larger ones getting into this many lymph nodes...is mine a bad thing or is it better that it is small. My surgeon thinks it may have been growing so slowly for years. Also I read on the internet that lobular doesn't respond well to chemo. Does that mean I don't have much of a chance. Thanks to anyone to response...also like to hear some survivor stories...",
