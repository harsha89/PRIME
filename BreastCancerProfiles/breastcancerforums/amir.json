    "Content": "Hi, My mom has advanced breast cancer; and my brother who is a doctor (not an Oncologist) just called me to tell me she might not have more than 3 months left! Of course she has been on chemotherapy, radiation, etc., all of it, for the last 16 months. but do you (the reader) know of any alternative, innovative, unconventional, not widely publicized treatment procedures at this stage of cancer, no matter how radical or where it is offered, that you could tell me or refer me to? If yes, please give the name of the persons or institutions involved in providing such cares? what about their web sites, if any? LINKS please, if you can. I could search online but I would much prefer first hand experiences. I am trying to delay my mom's death even for a few months. I know this may not sound rational but at least I will be learning something. Thanks so much for your help!!",
