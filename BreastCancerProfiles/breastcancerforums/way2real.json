    "Content": "My wife is currently 40 years of age. For 7-8 years She has been battling Stage III, ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. After her initial surgery (right, modified radical mastectomy), chemo and radiation, she was on Tamoxifen for 5 years until recurrence. After chemo again, she was on Arimidex for 2 years (and also a monthly injection to stop her ovaries). Four months ago she had another recurrence (one node, operable). We decided to change her to Faslodex and monitor the node. After three months, the node grew 2mm. Two weeks ago she had a node removed and the pathology came back ER negative, HER2 positive. Her treatment is now Herceptin every three weeks. I have heard of the characteristics of cancer changing. I asked the Doc if ALL of the cancer cells that may be in her body are now ER-/HER2+. He said \"yes, probably\". Should we assume the Doc is correct? What if he is not? It seems logical that she could ALSO have ER+/HER2- cells. If she does have both type of cells couldn't that mean she really did not fail the Arimidex or Faslodex? In light of the new findings, does it make sense now to completely abandon what has worked so well for her? I guess this is the bottom line. Can BC with different characteristics coexist? Or is there some sort of biological mechanism that says \"all cancer cells will now be made ER-/HER2+? Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Mike",
