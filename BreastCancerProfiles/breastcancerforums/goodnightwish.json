    "Content": "Hi, everyone. I think this is the correct forum to post in. I do not have breast cancer, but am a little worried that it could be. I am 23 (very young to be asking, I know) and female. I have been having bad pain in my right breast and right underarm. I've heard that pain isn't a sign of breast cancer, but I've also heard that a lot of ones diagnosed with breast cancer had pain. Anyway, I noticed the pain coming back about two weeks ago. It started with an extremely painful staticky pain in my right underarm radiating through the lower part of my right breast. That lasted for about an hour. Since then I've been getting underarm pain that comes and goes and breast pain. The pain in my breast is in the under part of my right breast and makes my breast hurt when I lay on it. I also have an extremely sore spot in that area, about the four o' clock area. I've heard that bad pain in one particular spot can be a sign of cancer. So my question is, should I be worried and get it checked out? Or am I just crazy? Please help! The worrying is driving me mad. Thank you so much for listening.",
