    "Content": "I am a 31-yr old woman. I have 1 indirect family history of breast cancer (mother's aunt). I had a mammogram/ultra-sound 4 weeks ago for multiple palpable soft lumps (post that month's menstrual cycle). The findings were - multiple benign cysts, BI-RADS 2. After my next cycle, the cyst remains and a new one has appeared (on palpating, feels like the other soft movable lumps). Is there cause for concern? How long do cysts take to disappear?",
