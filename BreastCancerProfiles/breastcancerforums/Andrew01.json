    "Content": "Limited awareness about the causes, symptoms, screening tests, and treatment options for breast cancer has made it one of the most misunderstood diseases today. Over time, a number of myths have come up around this disease. In order to make scientifically correct information available to all, cancer specialists at Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad have debunked some of the most popular breast cancer myths that abound today. \u0095 Breast cancer is mostly genetic This is not true as only 5 to 10 percent of breast cancer cases can be attributed to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Moreover, even those women who have these faulty gene mutations develop breast cancer largely due to poor lifestyle choices such as a smoking, heavy drinking, and lack of physical activity. \u0095 Wearing an underwired bra increases the risk of breast cancer This is one of the most popular myths surrounding breast cancer and has no scientific basis whatsoever. Numerous cancer research studies have conclusively proven that the type of bra a woman wears and its tightness has no relation to risk of breast cancer. \u0095 Women with bigger breasts have a higher breast cancer risk This is untrue as breast cancer risk has no connection to the size of a woman\u0092s breasts. Breast cancer develops in those cells that form the lining of lobules or milk ducts and these cells are present in the same number in every woman despite varying breast sizes. Similarly, getting breast implants does not increase the risk of breast cancer in women. \u0095 A majority of breast lumps are cancerous Contrary to this popular myth, only 20 percent of breast lumps are cancerous. Nonetheless, it would be wise to get any breast lump that you feel checked out by your doctor to rule out the risk of cancer. \u0095 The first sign of breast cancer is a lump As already mentioned, 80 percent of breast lumps are benign. Moreover, nearly 10 percent of breast cancer cases do not involve any lumps at all. Some lesser known symptoms of breast cancer include nipple tenderness, discharge from the nipple, breast pain, change in the shape or size of breast, and redness of breast. To conclude, do not let the above-mentioned breast cancer myths misguide you in your efforts of cancer prevention or screening. Furthermore, these myths do not affect the odds of a woman developing breast cancer in any way and should be disregarded as completely baseless. One of the simplest ways to ensure early detection of breast cancer is by getting regular mammograms done once you have reached the age of forty, as suggested by cancer specialists at Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad.",
