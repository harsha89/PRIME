    "Content": "Diagnosed in 2010 with grade II oestrogen (100%) positive breast cancer I underwent surgery and radiotherapy and now have 3 monthly shots of Zoladex and daily pill Tamoxifen. In Sept 2011 I underwent gene testing to see if I have breast cancer genes, which I have. If I stop Zoladex there is a very good chance of cancer returning. I have made up my mind to have ovaries removed to create permanent oestrogen shutdown as I am 43 years old and Zoladex until the normal menopause does not appeal to me. I have scar tissue due to c section in 2006 and doc has told me that laparascopic removal may not be possible. Since I am going under the knife might it be better to have full hysterectomy and be done with it. Your opinions please.",
