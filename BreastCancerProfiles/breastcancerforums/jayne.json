      "Content": "Hi everyone, If anyone recalls my tumor markers have been steadily rising. Since last year. From 28 to now 120. They were 78 back in November. I had PETS, MRI CT and Bone scan, which showed nothing back in October. Now my onc is ordering the tests all over again. She sees no other reason for the rise other than disease coming back. I do have benign lesions in my liver that have grown, but are benign. She said that could possibly be the cause, she is unsure as she has never had any patients with benign liver growths and markers rising. She rarely does markers, only a handful of patients so she has nothing to go on there. I am scheduling the tests as soon as possible, but wonder if I should be seeing someone else, a major cancer center - just for an opinion. I know I must have asked before, but does anyone have rising markers as high as mine with no evidence of disease? Thanks so much, I am grasping at straws and pulling out my hair. Jayne",

      "Content": "This messge is for Dr. Leo, Dr. Leo, can you offer me any info on this? I was dx with bc in 2001. So far, all ct scans, PETS, etc have been negative. I feel good. However, since the last year and a half my tm's have been slowly rising. They started out at 16 and have now risen to 75 back in August of 2004. I had ovarian cysts which are no longer there after my last pelvic US in November. My onc wants to repeat tm's in February. Could it possibly be the cysts which made them rise? My onc said she will order a bone marrow test if they continue to rise. I know other things cause them to go up, but they have steadily risen over the past year and a half and I have not had any infections etc for that long. Any info on this please ??? Or anyone else on the board I would welcome info shared. Thanks so much Jayne",
