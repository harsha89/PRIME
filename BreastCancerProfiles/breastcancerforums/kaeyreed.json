    "Content": "I had DCIS that was wide spread and had mastectomy. Do not regret it all. I wanted all that stuff gone! Have a friend who also had it. Three lumpectomies and radiation and later mastectomy because of invasive carcinoma. Not saying that all DCIS becomes invasive, I was just not willing to take that chance. My sister died at age 52 of Inflammatory Breast Cancer!",
