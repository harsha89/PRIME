    "Content": "I have severe arthritis like pain that has developed since my last chemo session - Nov 2011. No drugs even touch the pain. It is very difficult to get about and I feel like I am 90 years old. I am halfway thru radiation now and hear that the meds that I will take for 5 years also cause pain. Any suggestions? Anyone else have this problem? The fear of being in pain forever is not good - I am 52. thanks and hugs to all, stefani",
