I would have had everything under then sun to make it go away. Or if it was my love one, i think i'd be making them do the treatments or causing them much guilt for not. YOU sound amazing. You have listened to what SHE wants and you are supporting her anyway. I don't think you are in denial, more self protecting yourself. It also sounds like this is how your mum has made you feel after so many trials and misfortunes she has had with her health. It's ok, to feel like you can't cry. It will come. In it's own time. But please feel your emotions, as you feel them. If you need to rant, then rant- to us here if need be. If you need to cry, then find yourself somewhere comfortable to cry. let it all out. Right now it sounds like you are being strong for your mum also. Your mum sounds like an amazing Mum. She looks towards your future with collage, helps you plan and organise a placement. She wants you to live, and know she was there with you planing it all. Denial is normal, some times takes us longer to face what is happening, I know. But eventually you are forced to see the way things wil be. Just know we are ll here, when the time comes. Write here about anything, if it makes you feel better. Thinking of you, inica",

I would be sure and happy with what they tell you- and if not then get a biopsy. It will help you relax more, if you get it done- especially if they are unsure. 20 is Young- But it also means you are strong and fit and able to beat this thing- if it comes to that! I'm sad that your Husband is fighting his own fight- and I totally understand you feel you can't worry him. Have you got a mother, or mother in-law.? Frinds or someone you can talk about with. As from a Husband's point of view (thanks to matt- my hubbie)- If it is scary news, then let him know. He will hopefuly be able to come back. But at least he will know and share your pain. Pain or worrie devided by 2 or more lessens the amount. Good Luck and we are always here for you.",

But with the scares i get from time to time, like the lup i found under my arm/breast. and future cervical scares- for some reason, i totally freak. This forum has helped me so uch, to overcome those feelings and to help others. I guess till you know excatly what it is and what you'll have to do/ treat.
