    "Content": "Kind of a weird article, but almost makes sense. Can't help but be curious. THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET THAT'S SAVING LIVES By Angie Whitside Sarah Michaels* grew up a worried woman. Her mother had a double mastectomy before she was forty. Her grandmother and one aunt died of breast cancer, and two other aunts and an older sister are breast cancer survivors. Facing the prospect of a preventative mastectomy on her twenty-first birthday was a daunting, if realistic option. As hard as it was for a young woman at the very beginning of her adult life to consider such a drastic measure, the very real possibility of early-onset breast cancer made it something she had to consider. But then one of her doctors suggested a novel, unproven preventative treatment based purely on anecdotal evidence. It was controversial, there had been little, if any, scientific study on the technique, and most physicians dismissed the radical idea as pure fantasy. But Sarah was willing to try anything. \"I didn't want to lose my breasts,\" confessed the lively young woman. \"I mean, I was just old enough to drink. I had just met my future husband. I was in college \u0096 how could I give up my breasts on a possibility? When the doctor suggested doing this, I thought he was crazy, but I was desperate and looking for options. This was one. I took it.\" Five years later, Sarah remains cancer-free. She's also pregnant with her first child, and looks forward to breast-feeding, another factor that has demonstrated a preventative effect against breast cancer. And she swears that this controversial technique is responsible for her lack of the disease \u0096 so far. The treatment? Fellatio. \"I almost fell out of my chair when the doctor recommended it,\" she says, grinning. \"I mean, who would actually consider something like that? It's unreal. But he said that he had been working with breast cancer survivors for over twenty years, and it was something that the ladies whispered about.\" She looks at her embarrassed husband, William, and smiles. \"Luckily I had a very supportive partner.\" As radical as it sounds, the \"fellatio treatment\" has its advocates in oncology circles. For years women as desperate as Sarah for answers to their condition had tried a variety of herbal and vitamin supplements, anti-oxidants, and alternative therapies to keep their cancers at bay. In breast-cancer support groups and internet chat rooms it has been casually mentioned and obliquely referred to as a \"well it can't hurt\" measure in the course of treatment. And some doctors have started to consider the possibility that fellatio, with the swallowing of the male ejaculate, may indeed have some curative properties. \"When you are dealing with a hormone-sensitive cancer like most breast cancers, it's hard to rule anything out that has a potential effect on hormones,\" admits one prominent researcher interviewed for this story, who asked to remain anonymous. \"The hormonal life of a woman and her breasts is a complicated matter. Certainly the introduction of a hormone-rich substance like human semen into the \u0091diet' of an adult woman could have an effect on how her body produces and regulates estrogen and other hormones. Could it be beneficial? The possibility certainly exists.\" Melinda, a 54 year old cancer survivor from Madison, WI, swears by it in her survivor support group. She had a lumpectomy six years ago, and heard about the \"fellatio treatment\" in an internet chat room. Confronted with her own mortality she found it easy to consider. \"It's cheaper than Tomaxifen, and not as bad as chemo or radiation,\" she laughs. \"My husband jokes about sending a bill to our insurance company. The truth is, I have to say that it's worth trying. I wouldn't abandon a real, medically tested treatment for it, of course, but I've talked to a lot of survivors since my surgery, and my own unofficial straw poll shows that the women who did it had a lesser chance of reoccurrence. Completely un-scientific, I know. But I go with what works. And I've just been labeled \u0091cancer free', so I'm not complaining.\" Is there any credible scientific evidence for the phenomenon? One doctor in Britain thinks so. He first came across the idea as an internet hoax, in a famous \"urban legend\" web site made up by a North Carolina State University student in 2003, and widely disseminated as a legitimate news story. But after his original disdain faded, he began to consider the idea more seriously. \"It's long been known that ingesting semen has some curative effect. There's research showing oral delivery of TGFbeta (Transforming Growth Factor Beta), one of the key molecules in semen, can increase the number and activity of \u0091natural killer' cells that are important in recognizing and killing aberrant cells that give rise to tumors. It's been a dirty little secret among cervical and ovarian oncologists for years, now. The idea that it may have a preventative effect for breast cancer is certainly within the realm of reason. But how do you write a grant proposal for something like that to the RCMS?\" Ingesting semen has popped up on the medical radar in other areas, notably as a treatment for depression (in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 31(3): pp. 289-293; June 2002) and as an immuno-enhancer for pregnancy (University of Adelaide study found that \"... oral sex may not only help a woman conceive but may make her pregnancy safer and more successful.\" In particular, regular fellatio resulted in protection against pre-eclampsia. Further, \"The Australian study... claims to have found evidence that regular exposure to semen before pregnancy, especially by mouth, helps her immune system get used to her partner's sperm... the protective effect was strongest if the woman swallowed the semen.\") In addition, fellatio with semen ingestion has been unofficially prescribed as a non-pharmaceutical method of inducing labor, due to the presence of chemicals known as prostaglandins. While intercourse is the usual method of \"hurrying up the baby\", obstetrician John Lamont, of Hamilton, ON, tells his patients that \"prostaglandins are absorbed 10X more efficiently through the gut than through the vaginal mucosa, with respect to semen and labor onset.\" It is even held as a treatment for acne, in some circles. The \"healthful\" properties of semen have long been touted by various occult and mystical movements, from Tantra to Taoist medicine to the ancient Classical world, as a panacea for all matter of ills. There have even been some \"serious\" looks at the subject at various points: In eighteenth century Europe, a German doctor named Schurig in his work Spermatologia, discussed at considerable length the possible medical properties of human semen, giving many prescriptions which contained it. Ancient Vedic texts also promote the practice. But mystic or medical, Sarah isn't asking why. \"I've talked it over with my doctor, my mother, and my husband,\" she says. \"I've done as much research on it as I can. There isn't much out there, by the way. And I've talked to a lot of women \u0091in the club'. As far as I'm concerned, it's part of my prevention regimen. I do it once a day, every day. So far, so good.\" Melinda adds, \"My husband thought I was crazy at first. Not that he was complaining, but it just seemed so weird. I just know that the women who do it, don't have relapses as much as the women who don't. It takes some getting used to at first. You have to treat it like medicine, almost. And I hated the taste, when I first started. But I make him drink pineapple juice every day, now, and it's not so bad.\" Rebecca, a 36 year old survivor, also maintains the practice, although it's more difficult for her. She is neither married nor in a relationship. But when she heard the possibilities, she came up with a strategy. \"I convinced a neighbor of mine to help me out. He's single, as well, though an older gentleman than me. It's a purely \u0091businesslike' relationship, and I know he's not otherwise sexually active. I insisted on a full health report before we began. He's very discreet, very sympathetic \u0096 his wife died of ovarian cancer. And it was with the understanding that if I did enter into a regular relationship, we would stop. It's been a little challenging, but I credit my lack of recurrence partially to the fellatio.\" She feels so passionately about it that she has convinced her younger sister to do it, as well, as a form of prevention. When asked who the \u0091expert' on the subject was, many fingers pointed to a Canadian woman who has haunted breast cancer forums for years advocating the practice. She goes by the on-line name Calypso48, and her \u0091fans' call her Callie. She refused to meet with me for an interview, citing privacy concerns \u0096 she is an elementary school teacher -- but did answer some email questions. Callie recommends the \u0091treatment' at least four or five times a week, preferably on a daily basis. \"The more, the better!\" she insists. Encouraging volume and good dietary health in the male \u0091donor' in question is key, she says. Smoking, heavy indulgence in high-fat foods, and excessive caffeine is discouraged \u0096 but she says that it shouldn't be a barrier. \"Believe it or not, the most common complaint that I've heard is that the men start to feel like it's a chore after a while. What was once an occasional treat is now a daily mandate. Ironically, they start to feel \u0091cheap' and \u0091used' after a while if their wives are too demanding about it. Care should be taken not to damage the frail male ego. Other than that, they tend to be quite supportive. Does she practice what she preaches? \"Definitely! I go down on my man sometimes twice a day. In my opinion, frequency matters. It's not something you can do a couple times a month and expect to get results from, it's a cumulative thing. Volume is also important. I've forbidden him from masturbation, which was a complaint at first, but we've developed a routine over the last twelve years. Once first thing in the morning, and if he's up to it, again right before bed.\" She also claims that no less than five oncologists gave her the unofficial nod. \"I've been in correspondence with breast cancer researchers all over the world. Those who don't write you off as a crackpot and will seriously consider the idea become enthusiastic about it after a while. It's not something they recommend for every patient, but for those women who fit a particular profile, they encourage the practice. Off the record, of course.\" Does Callie have any data to support her claim? \"Only my own knowledge and experience. Anecdotal accounts. I've spoken to thousands of women online, and it's becoming common knowledge that this is a low-cost, low-risk treatment that works. I've taken polls and tried to tabulate data in support of it. That's hard to do without invading their privacy. From what I can tell, a woman who takes this course is about half as likely to develop lumps, and a third less likely to develop a recurrence after surgery, chemo, and radiation. Some poor women in the States say that it's the best preventative they've access to. It certainly isn't a replacement for conventional therapy, but it works, so I'm sticking to it.\" And what about the moral element? \"I'm amazed at the women who balk at the idea. They talk about sin and quote from the Bible or the Koran, but are they really so eager to meet God that they're willing to forgo this simple, painless act? The ones I feel the sorriest for are the girls who have strong religious prohibitions against premarital sex, and aren't married. There isn't much I can say to them, except that a little sin like that is nothing compared to losing your life. But that's just my opinion. My posts get deleted from forums all the time because of religious or \u0091obscenity' objections. The real obscenity is how many women get the disease every year.\" There are other objections, of course: \"The ones who voice a distaste \u0096 no pun intended \u0096 about it for hygienic reasons are likewise short-sited (sic). As long as he's disease-free and washes up regular[ly], what's the problem? I've been set upon by feminists repeatedly who say I'm undermining women's rights and women's respect. They say the whole concept is degrading and undignified. But so is losing your breast, having your hair fall out from radiation, and vomiting all the time. Not to mention death. And, of course, there are lesbians who are in a quandary. I just don't know what to tell them, poor dears.\" Did she have any qualms about the practice? \"When you face the possibility of your own death like that it's a pretty easy decision,\" she relates. \"I mean, maybe it isn't doing anything. Maybe it depends on genetics, or your man's genetics, or the type of cancer you have or something. Until there's more research, we just don't know. \"And there likely won't be any research on fellatio in the United States, now, because of the current [P]resident's flat-headed moral ideals. The oncologists I talk to in the States won't even try to submit a proposal for Federal funding on a basic study, because they are afraid of the political and professional repercussions. The Administration has a vindictive streak, and it will go after scientists that don't tow the line (sic) with their religious beliefs, they say. I mean, if they won't even acknowledge global warming, do you really think they'll fund a \u0091blowjob study'? I'm more hopeful for research to be done in Britain, Europe, Australia and India. But even then you have to breach the social barrier. They're afraid of professional ridicule, like the researchers of who used breast milk to treat prostate cancer. It's a very sensitive subject, and one that can be abused or dismissed out of hand by the ignorant.\" Sarah Michaels is hopeful, though. \"I'd love one day to be vindicated about this. There are times when I feel stupid or silly, or just not in the mood. But then I think about the alternative. I can't even discuss it with a lot of people in my support group. When I did, I've been called a whore and a prostitute and a slut. And I've been happily, ecstatically married for three years now! \"It's not about the sex, and that's what people who hear about it always think: this is some crazy plot by men to get us on our knees. They couldn't be more wrong. It's like the women who quietly donate breast milk to cancer patients. It's not socially acceptable, so people don't talk about it or encourage it. But this, this happens every day all over the world. The fact that something that's good for you is also pleasurable, that's what bugs people. They think medicine should hurt, should be uncomfortable. There's enough pain and agony in this disease \u0096 what my mother and grandmother and aunts went through, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. If this can help prevent that, who could have a problem with that?\" *All names have been changed due to the sensitive nature of the subject and for privacy considerations. -- Angie Whitside, with contributions by A.
