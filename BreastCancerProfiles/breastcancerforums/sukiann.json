    "Content": "Pamela, Hi there, I am new to the group and I just had the same biopsy that you had (mine was a week ago). I wanted to let you know that mine absolutely killed!!!! They kept telling me that it wasn't supposed to but it was horrible. Once that snap went off the pain was just about unbearable. They were aiming for 6 cores but only got 4. They pumped more novacaine or lidicaine of whatever in me but it just didn't help. I so hope I never have to go through that procedure again. I do have breast cancer but I'll do anything but if I have to here that snap one more time. YIKES. So, you are definitely not alone.",
