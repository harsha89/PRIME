    "Content": "Subj: Tarvacin vs. Breast Cancer in Ph1 This is an email exchange of interest to those following breast cancer treatment advances. This involves the progress of the anti-cancer compound Tarvacin (3G4) developed by Dr. Philip Thorpe of UT-SW/Dallas,whose ph1 trial for All-Solid-Tumors expanded to M.D.Anderson on 10-21-05, under the direction of breast cancer oncologist Dr. Nuhad K. Ibrahim. 10-23-05 To: James J. Roberts, Managing Editor/Publisher: www.RobertsReview.com & www.MyCancerNews.com ( [email protected] ) Hi Jim, I?m going to copy you on an email I sent to the Susan Komen Breast Cancer Foundation yesterday regarding Friday?s expansion of the Tarvacin(3G4) ALL-CANCERS trial to M.D.Anderson CC/Houston (http://tinyurl.com/cnytx ). If you?re not aware of Thorpe?s work at UT-SW/Dallas with ?Anti-Phospholipid Therapy? against both Cancer and Viruses, you should watch a webcast tomorrow Oct24 at 1:30pm ET which will feature Dr. Thorpe himself (Peregrine?s shareholder mgt.): Register: http://ir.peregrineinc.com/phoenix.z...ventId=1142944 Future webcasts are listed here: http://ccbn.aol.com/company.asp?tick...36&client=aol# Also, learn more about Atrvacin by reading the iBox section at the top here: http://tinyurl.com/6yz4x As well as a compilation I made of Tarvacin History, Papers, Quotes, etc here: http://tinyurl.com/b9hdq I know you?ve got to be skeptical of this, Jim ? don?t blame you one bit. But, this stuff is real. And it?s going to have a major impact on medical history if these p1 trials for All-Cancers and HepC go as Thorpe believes they will. To say nothing of what the NIAID & US-Army proves with their BioTerrorism and Pandemic testing with Tarvacin. Sincerely, C.J.

Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Hi Patrice, Many new promising developments on the Tarvacin anti-cancer front since May, not the least of which is the announcement yesterday that the All-Solid-Cancers trial has expanded to MDA/Houston, under the direction of Dr. Nuhad K. Ibrahim, Associate Professor, Breast Medical Oncology at MDA, and Coordinator of Breast Cancer Program at UTMB. Dr. Ibrahim's clinical interest is breast oncology and his research interests include breast cancer biology, treatments and outcomes. ?My clinical research focuses on developing new drugs and drug combinations for the treatment of breast cancer.? Dr. Ibrahim?s BIO: http://intmed.utmb.edu/HEMOC/docs/ibrahim.shtm His 29 Papers published: http://tinyurl.com/c8n6g Such a concentration on breast cancer conjures up memory of the 2004 Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation grant of $247k issued to Thorpe Lab member Dr. Xianming Huang to study Tarvacin+Docetaxel combo against Breast Cancer. From the Scientific Abstract of the grant: ?Since 3G4 is already chimerized and close to clinical trials, it should be possible to take the 3G4/Docetaxel combo rapidly into clinical trials in breast cancer patients.? http://www.investorshub.com/boards/r...age_id=7169616 I?ve got to think Dr. Ibraham is aware of the Komen grant for Tarvy+Doce, as well as the 5-2005 Cancer Research article ?Antibody Combined With Cancer Drug Shows Promise Against Breast Tumors? containing this conclusion, ?Mice with human breast tumors treated with 3G4 + Docetaxel had a 93% reduction in overall tumor growth. The injected breast cancer cells also stimulated the growth of tumor colonies in the lungs, and the drug combination reduced the average number of those colonies by 93%, with half of the mice not developing any lung tumors.?. http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/c...es/223516.html Add to that Dr. Thorpe?s repeatedly optimistic words about pre-clinical efficacy and safety, like this 10-25-04: ?OK, this is Tarvacin.. the cleanest tumor vessel marker of which we are aware.. If you look here at the 3G4 slide, you'll see, most remarkably, that it's absolutely chock full with macrophages. Every one of those is a macrophage and there's so many of them that they're beginning to outnumber the tumor cells. So you can see the reaction that's being mounted against the tumor.. And if you take the drugs together (3G4 + Docetaxel), practically none of the Lungs have any sign of disease. It's quite impressive? Pancreatic cancer is a killer.. you see that combination (3G4 + Gemcitabine) has dropped the number of metastases in the liver by, oh, that looks like more than 90% to me.. and that's exactly what we hope to do with humans.. 3G4 combines beautifully with radiation to treat Lung cancer.. here, rodents were infected with Lassa Fever virus, a very lethal virus.. if the animals were getting Tarvacin, half the animals rejected the virus and went on to live normally. That's an extraordinary result, I don't know of any other antiviral agent that is known to protect against Lassa Fever. And we've also shown similar results in cytomegalovirus... at that dose we've never seen any sign of toxicity in mice or monkeys; about 14 species treated with the therapeutic dose. And that's thousands of mice & monkeys. And even if you increase the dose to 10 mg/kg, that's 10x the therapeutic dose.. So the conclusions with Tarvacin are that it has a unique mechanism of action, there's nothing else like it out there; it homes specifically to tumor blood vessels and induces white blood cells to attack the tumor.?

May 15, 2005 http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/c...es/223516.html ?Antibody combined with cancer drug shows promise against breast tumors? DALLAS, May 15 2005: An antibody that targets the blood vessels nourishing tumors significantly reduced breast cancer formation and growth in mice when combined with a current cancer drug, according to researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Their work appears in today's issue [5-15-05] of Cancer Research. \"This antibody could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the drug Docetaxel in breast cancer patients,\" said Dr. Philip Thorpe, professor of pharmacology at UT Southwestern and senior author of the research. \"The combination merits further scrutiny as a potential treatment for human cancer.\" PICTURE OF THORPE IN LAB: ?Dr. Philip Thorpe, professor of pharmacology, and other UT Southwestern researchers, have shown that an antibody that targets blood vessels nourishing tumors significantly reduced breast cancer formation and growth in mice when combined with a current cancer drug.? http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/findfa...,17308,00.html Docetaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for treating breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, but its use in treating other cancers is limited by its toxicity. In their study of mice, Drs. Thorpe and Xianming Huang, assistant professor of pharmacology in the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, found the antibody compound 3G4 was effective as a vascular targeting agent ( VTA ) when used with Docetaxel. VTAs are designed to find and destroy blood vessels within cancerous tumors, cutting off their blood supply. Specifically, mice with human breast tumors treated with 3G4 and Docetaxel had a 93% reduction in overall tumor growth. The injected breast cancer cells also stimulated the growth of tumor colonies in the lungs, and the drug combination reduced the average number of those colonies by 93%, with half of the mice not developing any lung tumors. The combination of 3G4 and Docetaxel was much better than either compound used by itself, Dr. Thorpe said. In mice with breast cancer tumors, growth was suppressed by 50% using 3G4 alone and 70% for Docetaxal alone. The reduction in lung tumor colonies was 82% with 3G4 alone and 78% with Docetaxal alone. Peregrine Pharmaceuticals is developing a version of 3G4 called Tarvacin for cancer treatment and recently received approval from the FDA for a phase I clinical trial. The compound was discovered by Dr. Thorpe's lab, and Peregrine has a sponsored research agreement with UT Southwestern to further develop the drug. \"We are currently investigating whether the enhanced therapeutic efficacy with 3G4 and Docetaxel extends to other tumor models and other conventional therapies,\" Dr. Thorpe said. VTAs like 3G4 target tumor vessels by selectively binding to a certain component in the membranes of endothelial cells that line tumor blood vessels. This component, called an anionic phospholipid, faces the interior of cells in normal blood vessels. In tumor blood vessels, however, changes in the tumor environment cause the phospholipid to flip inside out and be positioned on the external surface. VTAs then can bind to this exposed phospholipid, causing the body's white cells to attack and destroy the vessels feeding the tumor. By targeting receptors unique to tumor vessels, vascular targeting agents kill tumors without causing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. They also reduce the risk of side effects by operating at lower doses than traditional cancer therapies because they are effective without needing to penetrate the innermost layer of a tumor. And, while drug resistance caused by the instability and mutability of cancer cells is a significant problem with conventional therapies that target tumor cells, cells targeted by VTAs do not mutate to become drug resistant, Dr. Thorpe said. Tarvacin itself has shown promise in mice against cancers in the fibrous tissues, brain cancers and Hodgkin's disease. Mary Bennett, a UT Southwestern technician, also contributed to the Cancer Research study. Research was funded by Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, a grant from the Gillson Longenbaugh Foundation and a Specialized Programs of Research Excellence ( SPORE ) grant in lung cancer research through the National Cancer Institute. Further studies are being funded by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.
