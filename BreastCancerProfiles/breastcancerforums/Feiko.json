      "Content": "Dear Reader, Yesterday my girlfriend got diagnosed with breast cancer (3 cm /1,1 inch lump found in breast + unidentifiable spots in arm pit). On Tuesday and Thursday further information will be made available to us regarding the type of cancer and status of the cancer. For now we stay busy with doing research on and reading about breast cancer. At the moment I am experiencing difficulties in finding (trustworthy -> not commercialized) information on what treatment centers are considered leading. I would like to create an overview on what treatment centers are leading and how they differ in their treatment practices in order to make a well thought through decision. If you have any thoughts of knowledge regarding this matter, I would greatly appreciate sharing it. Many thanks in advance. Kind regards, Feiko",
