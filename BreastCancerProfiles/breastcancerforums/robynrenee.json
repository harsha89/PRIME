      "Content": "Aren't you the funny one. It sure is not a laughing matter to those who suffer everyday from dead bone slivers just lifting out of their jaw or a hole that won't heal from an extracted tooth that now opens into the sinus cavity and causes liquid in the mouth to actually run out the nose; not to mention the constant battles with infection on an already depleated immune system from chemo treatments. This is what my sister faces everyday. Insensitive people (perhaps like you?) are most likely the reason Zometa is still available today.",
