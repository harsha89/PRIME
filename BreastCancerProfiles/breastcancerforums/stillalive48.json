      "Content": "hello, let me tell you my story. on july 29, 2007, i, my daughter, and then fiance were in my doctors office when i got the news. i was shocked for about 2 minutes. the doctor asked me if i wanted a lumpectomy or a mascetomy. i looked down and told her: i don't have very much can you save what i have. from that point on i knew that i could get through this. i have not cryed, been down in the dumps, or felt sorry for myself. my faith in god is very strong. every thing in life has a purpose and reason. i know that god knew this was going to happen before i was born. i want to be like job in the bible. what ever comes my way, be it good or bad, i will never lose faith. i know that god loves me and has my back. how yor attitude about life and the disease is, is how it will reflect the way you heal. anyway, i worked all the way up until august 13, 2007. on august 14, 2007, i went in for a lumpectormy, before surgery, i was cracking jokes with the nurse. she was so suprised. she said that i was the first patient she had seen that came in smiling. crying and feeling sorry won't help the situation. i just gave it all up to god. when i went to get prepped for my surgery, my doctor told me how proud she is of me being in good spirits. after i came out of surgery, i went back to my room. there, my now husband {we were married on august 6, 2007} best friend, and her sister were there when i woke up. i was still trying to crack jokes, but i went right back to sleep. the doctor said i did real good. the next day, they fed me and sent me home at 8:00 a.m. ever since then i have been mainly in good spirits. i cryed only once and that was because i had to go get some button down shirts because i can't use my left arm that much. any way, after i got home, i went to bed. all of a sudden, my right leg started cramping, and my left upper arm was in so much pain. i called the nurse and she told me i was dyhydrated. so i drank a lot of water, then i felt better. so i guess that was god's way of saying i should have stayed in the house. ever since then i have been drinking a lot of water, resting, trying to eat right. watching tv., excercising, and staying happy. i watch a lot of funny movies. laughter is a great healing medicine. but the best medicine in the world is praying and talking to jesus. well my sistas be strong, keep a positive attitude god loves you, and there is always somebody out there who is worst off than you",

      "Content": "Good day all. My name is still alive48. And yes I am still alive. I give God all the glory and all the praise. I wrote to you a couple of days ago telling about how I'm dealing with breast cancer. Well today I went to the doctor and she told me that I am cancer free. I was so elated. I still have to wear my drainage bag a couple of days more. But I would rather have that than to have cancer. I still have to go to chemotharaphy, but God brought me through this, I know in my heart He is going to bring me through this next phase as well. I tell you ladies this. Prayer and faith goes a long ways. Your attitude about life and the things that happen in your life play a big role on how things will turn out for you. If it's not your time, then your not going anywhere because God has a plan for you. Keep your heads up, have a positive attitude about every thing. For those of you who have not read the bible read about Job. God is my first hero, Job is my second. Halleluah. Have a blessed and wonderful day.",
