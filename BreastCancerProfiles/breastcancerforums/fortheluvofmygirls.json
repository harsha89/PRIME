      "Content": "I'm new and I first have to say thank you for this site!! I've looked at a few others and they were very impersonal and I felt like I was in a crowded waiting room with the Dr on the golf course! I've read a lot of these post and it has been a comfort as well as a great source of information. I have a list of questions to ask my oncologist thanks to all of you. I don't know all the signature questions you like to have because I have been diagnosed with DCIS but I don't know much more than that at this time. So I'm 40 premenopausal and I just had a surgery to remove two supposed cyst and one was a non cancerous tumor and the other was a high risk lesion with cancerous signs. Since both have been successfully removed I don't have cancer just high risk at this time. My question is.... I don't have a family history as I don't know mother or fathers history. All I have is one sister and she had ovarian cancer at the age of 28 and colon cancer at the age of 38. Should I be worried about the gene mutation and have the BRCA test done or am I worrying too much? I have two girls 18 and 19. I'm more worried for them without a family history to go on. any thoughts would be appreciated and again thanks for the site!",

      "Content": "A couple months ago I noticed a lump in my breast. I immediately went to the dr and had a mamogram and an ultrasound. They found a what they thought was a cyst to add to the one I had had for years. Since this was my second I decided to have them removed. They did the surgery on January 25 and I was suprised at the outcome of the result. The first that I had been told for several years was a common cyst (just stop caffeine intake and you'll be fine, you know cuz you're a girl) was a tumor. The new lump was an atypical ductal carsonoma in situ that had begun to show cancerous signs. But the good new they said is that they are out and you dont have a family history of breast cancer so......... hmmm.... I never knew my biological family so besides my sister didn't know family history so I just went on down the list and wrote none none none on all the family history (you know to save time on paperwork...) So because I am only 40 and premenopausal and the lesion had become cancerous they mentioned the brca test. I thought I didn't want to know.... but I have two girls 18 and 19.... so I call my sister and she tells me that on top of the colon cancer she had at the age of 38 she had ovarian cancer at the age of 28 or so...... So now I'm thinking oh [emailÂ protected]%t! I mentioned the test and said I hadn't decided yet so she told me to think long and hard about the decision to have it done. That was a week ago. I decided today to have the test done so if my girls need to be tested they can and will be able to take any precautions necessary. After scheduling the test today my first call was to my sister to ask if she wanted me to tell her the results when they came back. Her answer was \"I've already had the test done. I'm positive!\" So what have we learned......? one- if you don't know your family history put unknown or something other than no. two - although I love my only sister dearly she can be a pain in MY colon area..... three my head is flying in so many different directions now I don't know what to do or think. Oh yeah and four- of the six girls that my daugher hangs out with at college not one knows how to do a self breast exam. interesting couple months, eh?",
