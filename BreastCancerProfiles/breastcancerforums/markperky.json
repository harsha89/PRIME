    "Content": "My wife Tracey (51 years old) was diagnosed with triple negative grade 3 breast cancer. She had a cancer of 22mm and 1 lymph node removed by surgery in February. Unfortunately they found cancer cells in the lymph node. She was referred to The Christie Cancer Hospital in Manchester UK after the results from her operation. She starts 18 weeks of Chemo on 31st March followed by surgery to remove all remaining lymph nodes in her armpit, then Radiotherapy on her armpit and neck. Is there anyone else on the forum that has had the same treatment who can give me a bit of information on what I should expect in the future. I am actually awaiting treatment for my cancer from the same hospital following my Prostate removal last September. Mark",
