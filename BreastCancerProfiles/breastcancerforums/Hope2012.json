      "Content": "From what I read about \"spiculated\", it doesn't equate to cancer. \"appears somewhat\" sounds far from conclusive as well. I've read that in many cases, with the compression spot imaging it won't show up at all. I was told I had a \"possible melanotic lesion\" in my eye from my doctor with a referral to an ophthalmologist. Long story short I worried myself sick over it for 3 months....that's when it was removed and biopsied and it came back negative for cancer. It's impossible not to worry I know, but try not to let it overrun your thoughts..... I'm so sorry to hear about your husband's battle....this is the last thing you need right now!",

      "Content": "It's more than OK to post here....we are here to support not only cancer patients, but friends and family who need a place to come for support. You say you don't know what to do or say, but from what you typed out, it seems you are doing a great job. I think it's great you are going to be her chemo buddy! As far as what to say, in time you will find your 'comfort' place in all of that. You know your friend better than anyone here, so only you can decide what's ok to talk about and what's not ok. I read a quote once that said something like \"If you are my friend then walk with me, not in front of me\". Just be there with her...be open to true heart to hearts....where the biggest fears and tears can flow in comfort. Reassure her that you want to help out in any way you can, and ask her what it is you can do. Tell her that no request is too big or small...and if you are prepared to be there for her then follow through. Even though you are nervous about what could happen, just maybe imagine what it would be like for her if she was alone. In time it's not the bad event that will have meaning...simply being there is what you'll carry forward with you. Being a friend doesn't always mean having to DO something....sometimes simply being there is whats needed. I wish you and your friend luck...and please stick around and let us know how things are going. If you need a place to vent or ask advice, this is the place to do it.",

      "Content": "Hello Natalie I'm so sorry you've needed to seek us out on the web but I'm glad you have found us. Getting this kind of news is always so hard and you have to know that all you are feeling right now is normal. Doctors can be so focussed on the condition and not necessarily how it affects you emotionally. Where I live in Canada there are some specific local services that help both patient and families with this kind of news. They concentrate on your emotional well being. You may want to see if there is anything like that in your area. Cancer support groups are very specific to how this news affects you and everyone around you. Also, check with your oncologist about anxiety medications that may help you sleep. Seeing a counsellor or therapist can also be very helpful. The \"stigma\" of seeing one (you know...that they are for crazy people) shouldn't keep you from seeing one...they can be very helpful. I hope you can find some help in all you are going through. My thoughts are with you as you navigate through this entire process.",
