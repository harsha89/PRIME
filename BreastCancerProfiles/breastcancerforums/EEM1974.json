    "Content": "Hi Mary I am sorry, I have come in probably way too late into the forum to give you a speedy answer, but I know here in the UK my mum saw a breast surgeon at the point of her diagnosis, even though she did not have surgery. It was known before her appointment that she had breast cancer. I am guessing that your appointment is a general appointment with the surgeon, perhaps to schedule in your biopsy, but also to go through options with you depending on the outcome of your biopsy. I pray everything was okay with your tests and that you are fine. Beth x",
