A scary development: I saw the onk yesterday about the shingles, and she found a lump in one of my lymph nodes under my arm. It is small--about the size of a pea--and it is very hard and mobile. It freaked me out, but she said that it is probably a reaction to the shingles, and not cancer. I am seeing her in two weeks to check it out again. My question: is it normal to have lymph node swelling with shingles?",

      "Content": "Hello ! I finished chemo (dose dense AC then Taxol) about five weeks ago, and I am still have severe pain in my arms and legs. This pain started at the end of my treatment. Strangely, it is my upper arms and legs that hurt, not my hands and feet. The pain is in my bones and joints, but also in my muscles. It is a constant (not throbbing or shooting) kind of pain. My left arm hurts the most, though my breast cancer was on the right. I am taking Motrin and Vicodin and Neurontin. They help some, but not enough. My question is: when will the pain stop? why does it seem to be getting worse now, even though I'm through with chemo? Also, I start radiation tomorrow morning. Will the radiation make this pain worse?",

I'm also having some vision problems that come and go, and they think this also indicates that I'm still reacting to chemo. And personally, I can't imagine that the radiation is helping, either (today is rad 13 of 33) . I am distressed to learn that Arimidex (which they're putting me on next) makes your joints ache too.

Here it is, now nearly ten weeks since finishing chemo and I am still in the same kind of pain with no good solution. So sorry to hear that you are too! Like you, Carole, the terrible pain in my bones and muscles in my arms and legs can wake me up, and then I am often freezing cold in my limbs and can't get warm--strange because I also have vicious hot-flashes all the time. I have steady pain in my limbs and back all the time, but sometimes it shoots down my arms, or into my knees. When it does, it hurts enough to make me cry out. Pain meds are all I can do. I was on huge doses of Neurontin too, but I finally had to stop because it was giving me migraines. I don't think it helped too much anyway. Exercise doesn't take it away at all, though I find that it hurts less while i am exercising, so that is a small help. I have decided that I won't take Arimidex or Tamoxifen since bone pain is a major \"side effect\" I'd rather risk less treatment and feel like a woman who is in her forties instead of taking all the drugs and feeling like I'm 90.

I have steady pain in my limbs and back all the time, but sometimes it shoots down my arms, or into my knees. When it does, it hurts enough to make me cry out. Pain meds are all I can do. I was on huge doses of Neurontin too, but I finally had to stop because it was giving me migraines. I don't think it helped too much anyway. Exercise doesn't take it away at all, though I find that it hurts less while i am exercising, so that is a small help. I have decided that I won't take Arimidex or Tamoxifen since bone pain is a major \"side effect\" I'd rather risk less treatment and feel like a woman who is in her forties instead of taking all the drugs and feeling like I'm 90.

      "Content": "Hello ! I finished chemo (dose dense AC then Taxol) about five weeks ago, and I am still have severe pain in my arms and legs. This pain started at the end of my treatment. Strangely, it is my upper arms and legs that hurt, not my hands and feet. The pain is in my bones and joints, but also in my muscles. It is a constant (not throbbing or shooting) kind of pain. My left arm hurts the most, though my breast cancer was on the right. I am taking Motrin and Vicodin and Neurontin. They help some, but not enough. My question is: when will the pain stop? why does it seem to be getting worse now, even though I'm through with chemo? Also, I start radiation tomorrow morning. Will the radiation make this pain worse?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. I finally saw the onk, and everyone seems to agree that this is Taxol pain even though it has been more than seven weeks since my last infusion. I'm also having some vision problems that come and go, and they think this also indicates that I'm still reacting to chemo. And personally, I can't imagine that the radiation is helping, either (today is rad 13 of 33) . I am distressed to learn that Arimidex (which they're putting me on next) makes your joints ache too. Am I going to feel like this for five years? I feel like an old lady shuffling around in my bedroom slippers with achy knees and elbows...!",
