    "Content": "I'm not sure how active this board might be anymore, but in my search for some answers and/or understanding, I came across your stories and struggles and draw courage from you all.  You have already helped me, but if anyone has information to any of my questions, I'd be very grateful.    About 6 years ago my mom (62 years old now) was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Mastectomy, chemotherapy...  remission for 5 years.  About a year ago she was experiencing some cognitive difficulties, mixing up words, forgetting things, etc.  Metastatic brain tumor...  brain surgery...  it grows back in the void left from the surgery and it's in the in brain fluid...  full brain radiation hasn't shrunk it and now the diagnosis is probably CM, pending spinal taps...  My question(s)...  does anyone know if the prognosis is affected by how quickly the CM is found and treatment begun?  Common sense would obviously say that it would help, but with what I've been reading on the board I'm wondering if it is an unwinnable fight, regardless...  My mom's not experienced any of the muscle weakness, leg failure, blurred vision, or any of the symptoms that seem to be associated with later stages...  does this give her a better chance to beat this cancer?  Can she beat this cancer?  Everything I read looks so bleak...  is there hope?   Have people overcome CM?  ",
