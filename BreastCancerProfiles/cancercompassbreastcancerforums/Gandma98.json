      "Content": "I have breast cancer, have received 3 chemo treatments....and have been very sick. I do not want to continue with the treatments. I had all of the scans after my surgery in Oct/04 and everything was clear..Ive read that chemo can also cause a recurrence ??? My oncologists says I'm setting myself up for failure. My lymph nodes were involved. I believe that quality & not just quantity of LIFE counts. I could not be around my 3 grandchildren when my blood counts was down that was very difficult for me....Is there anyone that has refused chemo & dealt with nutrition & prayer. Please advise. May God bless us everyone who has this awful disease.",
