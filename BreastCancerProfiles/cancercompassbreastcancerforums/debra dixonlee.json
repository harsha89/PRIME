    "Content": "I had a mastectomy about 2 years ago.  Six months ago, I saw a small lump under my arm.  It was biopsied and nothing was found.  The same lump grew in size.  Yesterday, it was diagnosed as malignant cancer cells.  I will have to have it removed and radiation to make sure the lumps don't re-appear---I hope.",
