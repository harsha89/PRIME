      "Content": "The question PGJudy raises re why some tumors are removed and some are not is a very important one.  The reality is quite of mix of reasons, and it is critical for any patient to understandy those reasons and see the value that they may or may not have. Some of the reasons are simple: the doctor is just not skilled enough to remove the tumors and/or cannot remove all of them. In that case, you need a review by a very skilled and experienced surgeon, not the first impression by one surgeon. Next might be the general health of the patient, which can alos be 'confused' with the age of the patient.  Some doctors just do not think that the patient will survive and/or recover from the surgery.  Very individual situation, and one which much be discussed opening; another opinion might help. Third, and perhaps the most important, is that some doctors are just not up to date on the potential treatments for patients with metastatic disease, and somehow think that if the cancer has moved from its initial site, then there is no help or even hope of extension of life.  I am most knowledge about kidney cancer, having had a STage IV diagnosis 13 years ago, with a softball sized tumor and 100s of lung mets.  There are doctors who would not have given me surgery, especially as there was but one potential treatment for metastatic kidney cancer at the time.  I would have been sent home to die, with the ill-informed doctor thinking that the chance of recovery with the one treatment being too small to be helpful to me. AGain, that was 13 years ago, and I am free of kidney cancer, take no meds and haven't since sept of 2004.  BUT, sadly, there are doctors today who have the notion that metastatic disease can't be treated, thus, no reason to remove the primary tumor.  Plenty of studies indicate that this is helpful to the patient in general, and moreover, now there are 10 more treatments to help against metastatic disease. With other cancers, there are likely similar ill-informed doctors, working in the past, ignoring the latest improvements, and not willing to address their own lack of experience or lack of education.  You will have to take an active role to determine if there is a reason for 'unnecessary' surgery, or if this is just a  personal bias on the part of the doctor. We all know people who found a better treatment by seeking greater expertise.  It is very easy for a doctor to say that something cannot be done, but you need to ask for some study that he relies on in making this decision and a review of the information that he has about the patient, how it relates to the study--and what other studies might also say. Some years ago, I took all the studies that were older than 10 years, and set them aside, remembering that a study from 2005 is from data gathered from 1998-2003 or so, and then not published until 2005.  That would not include any improvements in the last 10-12 years....Much info is on the internet, and places like Mayo Clinic or Medscape are reliable.  If they want to sell you some oil, special 'secret' treatment, just ignore those.",

      "Content": "I know that there are people who will give 'blistering\" responses, having had a few myself when I have asked for evidence of the claims which they have made.  None of us want to deal with the tough realities of cancer, and wish for simple answers.  Sadly, there are none. I did read a bit of your previous comments, and know that your older daughter had a very sudden and large tumor.  Really shocking to her, and to all of you, I am sure.  The most important thing that you might be able to do is to listen to her, and let her know that you would like to protect and help her--and that she probably feels the same way about you.   I also have had breast cancer, probably could have caught it sooner, but am doing well, and age 68, assume that I will be taking Letrozole for another five years.  No chemo was necessary for me, but I am on a 6 month mammogram schedule so as to catch anything new.  My own daughters would likely not want to tell me all the details of their own ailments at times, trying to 'save' me from the worry--but that's what we do! I hope that you and your daugther can support each other through all of this.  And if you can reach out to www.smartpatients.com , you may find a far more welcoming site that you have found so far.  I am on the kidney cancer site, but not on the BC site, but love the kidney cancer people.",

      "Content": "I see that you daughter really does want you involved in this, but may not understand how to deal with it.  Perhaps she perceives your questions as unsettling to her desire not to think about the scary parts of the diagnosis.  Curious how you are able to get her reports, but she does not???  It is important to know what is going on in the reports and to understand the thinking that makes the 'no treatment' approach reasonable.  I would not find it reasonable, but if she has other health problems, there might be more to it.   Must tell you that the first person I saw about my breast cancer, post a biopsy and pathology, that the doctor did not seem to have read any of it.  Yet his advice was to 'go get your breast removed and come back to me\".  Not what I wanted to hear, esp since the surgeon he was to send me to was an abdominal specialist!  From there I was able to go back to Medicare, but until that kicked in, I paid for a second opinion at a cancer center in LA, and spent 45 minutes with that doctor.  World of difference! Do get ALL the reports and the test results, if at all possible.  Somehow having everything in writing makes it more real, but more manageable.  Also might point up the differences.  There are more good resources for breast cancer, but the field is changing so rapidly, that the PA and 'stability\" might be old school approach.   Find out exactly what kind of breast cancer, and if there was a biopsy and a pathology to indicate whether or not is is responsive to hormone inhibitors, as is the case with mine.  That is quite a different disease than 'triple-negative', which my sister in law has been working with for about 7 years.   Good luck, and thanks for risking her upset to help her.  Sounds like it really opened a door for both of you.

      "Content": "It is obvious that your doctors had not been following your mother properly, as evidenced by the inability to diagnose the coughing problem which led to the vocal cord paralysis!  Then to tell her that not being able to sleep due to pain and the fluid around her lungs and heart were not anything to be concerned about is really crazy.   At this point, you need to gather ALL her records, and see exactly what the diagnosis procedures have been, what was found in the fluid, and exactly what kind of breast cancer and/or nonsmall cell cancer it is.  Breast cancer has changed dramatically in the last ten years, and you need to know if the kind of breast cancer she had previously--at a fairly young age--is the same kind as now. For example, my own breast cancer is driven by too many hormones of particular level, and is called a ER+, PR+, neuHER- breast cancer.  I take hormone inhibitors against its return.  A friend's breast cancer is call triple negative, ER-, PR-, HER-.  It has required radiation and chemotherapy, and is monitored more closely than mine, as they are VERY different. You need to get this information sorted out right now, as all of this affects the treatment options.  Can you reach out to a breast cancer center, one which specializes the rarer types?   You are right to note that they did tests without getting anywhere.  AGain, get all those records, those tests, and start to get a sense of what they know--and what they do not.  She might benefit from having bone strengtheners, which can make the bones less susceptible to the cancer, for example. Lots of good resources on the web specifically http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types Good luck with this and get onto these breast cancer forums.",
