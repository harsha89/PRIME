      "Content": "My mother is 57 years old and she has stage 4 breast cancer that also occupies her lungs, liver and now her spine and brain.  She has been taking chemo for almost 3 years and just completed a round of radiation.  I keep hearing about cesium chloride but I am scared of it also.  We are running out of options.  Please let me know if anyone has any experience with this.",

      "Content": "I still don't know.  We are pretty much in the same boat.  We have done a little more research and we actually spoke to a woman in Texas who used the Cesium Chloride and her tumors have shrunk almost 70% after 7 weeks of using this.  She was also given the same timeline as our mother's.  My mother was told this week that she should not survive until September.  She still feels fairly well but she is also VERY tired and is out of Chemo options and radiation.  At this point, I am wishing that she might just try it.  I feel like, if it worked for even one person, it might be worth trying at this point.  It is taken orally mixed with grapefruit juice and aloe vera and this is done in combination with a fairly strict diet.  It all seems a little wierd to me too.  Who knows...I hope to hear more and I have 2 more phone numbers of people who have experience with this.  I'll keep you posted. I'll add you to my prayers as well.  Thanks for responding!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for this information.  I am sorry to say that my mother passed away two weeks ago after a very sudden quick decline.  She was an amazing inspiration to me and hundreds of friends and family members.  She never complained a single day and she fought a great fight for two and a half years.  She is now watching over me and my family from the loving embrace of the Lord.  I am thankful for every day that I shared with her and I will cherish her memory every day. I will continue to prayf or you and others that I have met through this site. Take care! ",
