      "Content": "Rick123, I'm sorry to hear your wife at such a young age has been diagnosed with LC.  Hope she is continuing to do well and glad she has no outward symptoms.   My mum is 56 and originally had breast cancer 5 years ago for which she had a double mastec followed with chemo and radiotherapy plus herceptin injections.  She was cancer free up until the beginning of this year when in January it was confirmed that she had a brain tumour which was removed with surgery and then subsequently treated with cyberknife radiotherapy to the area.  All her scans since had been coming up clear until about three weeks ago when she started to become very poorly, nausea, vomiting, loss of sight in her left eye, numbness in the right side of her face including her gums and the tips of her left fingers.  She has extreme pain in her left leg and bad headaches.  She is very unsteady on her feet as well.  She tends to muddle up words but does correct herself soon after she realises what she's said.  We experienced some personality change after the initial surgery too, mum's normally very nice and easy going and afterwards she became very direct and cutting but that could also be to do with dealing with so much I guess but definitely not like her old self.   After complaining to her Macmillan nurses for about two weeks (we live in the UK) they decided to send her for an MRI.  We were told in the consultation that the reason CM wasn't picked up in previous scans is because the disease is at cellular level and not a visible tumour but the MRI shows up the CM as bright patches and that's how they have diagnosed it.  We were told at best 1 year at worst it could be weeks.  This was last Wednesday.  Mum's been referred to a hospice who is dealing with all her pain relief needs at the moment but she hasn't been admitted so far.  Mum is taking dexamethasone (steroid), anti sickness tablets (cyclizine and ondansetron) and oramorph (for pain).  One quick note about oramoph, my mum was advised to go straight in with a tablespoon dose when she was initially given it, DO NOT DO THIS, it will make you sick as a tolerance has not been built up yet, she was supposed to start with half a teaspoon and if she was still in pain another half a teaspoon, this relaxes her, gets rid of feelings of anxiety and takes off the pain for a time.   They've just upped her steroid intake from 8m to 16mg as her symptoms haven't really gotten any better.  We are hoping that the increase means her vision gets better and the pain in her leg and headaches improve.  Hospice think that the CM has gone to her spinal column hence the constant leg pain so are arranging another MRI to confirm and then radiotherapy to get rid of the pain hopefully.  Mum has been offered chemo tablets and herceptin injections too but has been too unwell to have her pre checks for this done so far (needs to be able to stand on her own to have weight done, blood taken, ECG etc) so we are hoping we can get her fitter for that to start asap.  She was offered full brain radiotherapy but she doesn't want to spend her last months too unwell to do anything because of treatment so it's more about pain management and quality of life right now.  I'm trying to give her all organic foods but she's also eating what she fancies too so is having treats like cake while she's still got her appetite.  She'd lost quite a bit of weight before she started on the steroids due to being sick for a couple of weeks prior to diagnosis.   Keeping our fingers crossed and keeping positive that these last months (we hope) will be as pain free for her as possible.  All seems quite grim I know but we are determined to enjoy the time we have left.  Best of luck to everyone and all my positive thoughts go to anyone going through this, it's a hard time.",
