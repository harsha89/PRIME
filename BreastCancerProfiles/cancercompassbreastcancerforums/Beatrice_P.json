    "Content": "Dear Maria, I read with interest and hope your message posted 7/3/04. I had breast cancer in 2002 with lymph node involvement and had mastectomy and reconstruction. Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with metastesis of the liver and am starting on Taxotere and oral Xeloda. I am exhausted, tired all the time and pray that this treatment will help. I am only 57 years old. You mentioned CTCA - can you tell me what that is? Any information will be greatly appreciated. God Bless, Betty",
