      "Content": "I was diagnosed with metastatic carcinoma . After they removed the lymph nodes under my arm , they sent him to pathology . I was told it was likely leukemia or lymphoma . My mammogram was clear BIRADS to , normal . After pathology , they decided it might be breast cancer . After an MRI with contrast they found tumors in both breasts . Now they say it is not metastatic , but they will not take metastatic off of my chart ? I chose not to do chemo or the hormone pills . I see my oncologist every six months . My fatigue is coming back very strongly , I fear the cancer has came back . Time will tell . There's really no one to talk to , no one really wants to hear about it . It can make you feel isolated , that's why I like these message boards because we're all in the same boat no matter what we choose to do about it .",

      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy. I didn't do chemo or the pills. I tried the pills but they messed up my depression medications and I was on the verge of being committed. I chose sanity over cure. It is very unpopular but my family totally support me so I just live and know it was my choice. I thought I might lose my oncologist but he kept me. He is sweet and tho his choice would be different he still gives me great care.",

      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy but no chemo or hormone blockers. My oncologist tried very hard to make me do chemo, even called my husband. He wanted to extend my days, I wanted quality. I am now almost a year post mastectomy, the extreme fatigue is returning. I had a clear PET in my January. I am just living the best I can. Since they consider me cured due to the PET scan I still work but sleep or lay and watch a movie if up to it. Mostly all my energy is required to do my 40 hour week. Just hanging in there and like the song says, live like you were dying.....live with nonregrets...well I do regret or sometimes hate work cause that energy should be saved for my grandkids. My husband thinks the money does more for them atvleast I feel he thinks that. I know he does not understand the fatigue cause it did get better. For a few months but it is returning strong now.",
