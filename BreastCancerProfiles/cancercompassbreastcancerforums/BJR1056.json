      "Content": "Do you have a regular physician?  If so, go see him/her.  See if you can get an MRI.  If you don't have a regular doctor, then go see a different doctor.  Don't give up.  In the meantime, you might consider seeing a qualified acupuncturist - a good one might be able to help with the pain and tell whether you have any toxicity (disease) in your body.",

      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Triple negative Stage 1 Invasive Ductal/Medullary Carcinoma.  I had a lumpectomy with 3 nodes removed.  The nodes came back negative and I had clear margins.  Medically, I am considered \"cured.\"  I feel good and am otherwise a healthy 57 year old woman.  My oncologist has nevertheless recommended that before I do radiation therapy I do a 22 week very agressive chemotherapy regime.  My statistics show a 22% change of recurrence in ten years without chemo, and a 13% chance of recurrence with chemo.  All my instincts tell me not to do the chemo.  Does anyone have any thoughts to offer?  Is that 9% decrease in chance recurrence enough to warrant undergoing chemo at this time?  I'm okay with radiation.  I just don't think given the cons of chemo, that I should do it.  I welcome any input.",
