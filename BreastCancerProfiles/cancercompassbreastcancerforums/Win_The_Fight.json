I had a double complete mastectomy with the usual rounds of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemo and radiation. My breast re-construction failed.  Then after 18 months of chemical menopause, my periods returned, so I had my ovaries removed and was put on aromitase inhibitors. My tumor blood work was fine in Feb. of this year, then two weeks they were measured again and found to be 135.  Quite a jump from normal.  So I did the round of CT and bone scans yesterday to find out I had mets to the bones in 4 spots and also a very large 3\" aggressive lesion on my liver. The doc. wants to biopsy the liver due to the aggressiveness of it.  Also will set up radiation for the bones and put me on chemo again and either Tykerb or Herceptin, depending upon the results of the biopsy.  He did mention doing an embolism to the liver (cutting of the blood supply to that one part) to make that part of the liver die off.  Your liver one of the organs that can regenerate itself, (along with your skin). I thought I had this thing licked.  It's so disappointing to get these results.  My husband is devastated.  I am 46yo with 5 children ages 6-16 and we have no family that can help now or when I die. So, I am not as young as you, but still have a young family - and I can relate.   Hi, I read your story and I two do have breast cancer that spread to my liver. In 2003 I had five spots on my liver and they gave me 6 months to live, it is 2007 and I am still alive.The doctors don't know and you should not give up I have friends with the same diagnoses and they took their chemo and they were find, My advise to you is don't give up fight for your children, they need you, that is what I am doing and I don't mension the C word ever, and I say I am going to get my medicine. When I had the 5 tumors in my liver what worked for me is Navilbine and Herceptin, It killed them all, for about a year and a half and it slowly came back. I do have to go back to chemo because my tumor in my liver is bigger it is 6cm and my liver specialist told me to go get my treatment and then, he can shrink the tumor in my liver with the chemo embolizationin my liver. Hang in there , you will be fine.                                     I will remember you in my prayers                                                   Mary ",

You all are very courageous people. I to can relate to you all I have been battleing breast cancer for Five years, which has spread to my liver. My last chemo treatments where Navilbine and Herceptin. When I started out I had Five spots in my liver and now I am down to One left a this one just won't go away. My doctor told me just recently that the Herceptin stopped working so they took me off it, and they want to do and Liver Biopsy of to take the tumor out of my liver. I am really scarde to let them touch the tumor, for It has been there for Two years and never spread to any other parts of my body. I am afraid if they touch it they will spread the cells to others parts of my body, Is this true. Can someone who had a similar experience write me back to let me know will the cells spread if I let them do a biopsy or take the tumor out. My oncologist will not put me on any treatments until he gets a tissue sample. Any help on this matter. They never gave me a liver biopsy when they first saw it in my liver. Now they want a biopsy before he gives me more chemo to kill this last tumor. Does this biopsy spread cancer cells to other parts of your body? Win The Fight",

      "Content": "Hi, It's Mary again, I want to Thank Sis and Iris D for responding to my message. It's been almost a year since then and they did the biopsy and I was fine. I have recently gone on the protocal drug Tykerb and Xeloda and did really well with it for about 6months and the tumor started to grow again. The doctors want to do chemo embolization to my liver to kill the tumor, which I will have soon. Has anyone every had this and has it helped? Also can anyone recomend a natural doctor who is good. And has anyone had Carbo and Gemzar for breast cancer that spread to the liver and did It help, that is my other option. The doctors tell me I am a bit different case to only have breast cancer and for this long to only spread to my liver, is there anyone who has had this for 7years and it only spread to your liver?                             Mary",

I thought I read you were Her2 Postitive and it's overexpressing, that's what I am and I was on Herceptin since 2003, and it stopped working on me,  and I was Proges neg. and Estrogen neg. and they put me on the drug. and it kept me alive. I just recently went on the new Tykerb drug and it worked for me, but usually they put you on Herceptin first, I would get a second opion.                    Good Luck and hang in there                          Mary  ",

She is on Xloda and Tykerb it hasn't done anything for her so she stopped the regiment, we are trying another, but don't give up i have heard good things about the combo. We are using natural and modern medicine and that combo is working she looks and feels great and to look at her you would never know what is going on inside her body.   Hi, I read your message, It great your mom is feeling better I two went on Tykerb and Xeloda and it did nothing for me. Actually it spread from my liver to my lymth nodes. So they are going to try Gemsar and Carbo. Has anyone been on this and does it work. Also can you tell me what your mom is on now and also the natural approach, of what she is on. My liver specialist want to go in with chem-embolozation to kill the tumor in my liver and then use Gemsar and Carbo to treat the lymth nodes. Has anyone been on either treatment? And how well do they work,.                                                 Mary   ",
