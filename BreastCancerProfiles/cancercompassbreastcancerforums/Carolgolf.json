I was started on armidex 3 months ago, my bones became glass with terrible pain, I have developed a rigid tendon in my hand making it difficult to hold anything. I had nausea,joint PAIN, tendon pain in my affected arm, swelling in both arms and leg, could hardly get around in my home. Now i have been switched to aromasin, the symptoms are returning starting with the hot prickly skin and swelling,,nausea, and joint discomfort. I am at the point of saying no more drugs, i want to function and be my active self . i have had 37 rad trts. My dr. states he will put me on tamoxifin if this one effects me. I feel like a guinea pig for cancer. I was on HRT prior to all of this, due to a hysterectomy. I wish I had more answers.",

I was diagnosed, had lumpectomy, had a lymph dissection of 6, 2 tiny lymphs positive, had 14 more removed. no further detection. The trt for me was decided, radiation and oral estrogen blocker. All along this process I did not want radiation, I wanted my breast removed. I was told there is no statics showing a better outcome one way or the other. To this day, I would still have my breast removed than take radiation..too late for me now. If you do have the radiation, be sure to check around for the newest equipment and who is monitoring your trts. When a person is hit with the word cancer, we often surrender to the physican for the best trt for us. Think it through, go for the second opinion. carolgolf",

She did not have any of this prior to breast cancer diagonsis? Was she on hormonal replacement therapy prior to her diagonsis? If so may I ask for how long? And is her cancer positive for estrogen, progestrone? I really would be camping on the phone to get the monitor results and get into see the neurologist. Please stay in touch.

Stated myomin acts as an inhibitor of aromisin, this does not sound like a treatment of choice. Myomin is suppose to balance out estrogen to decrease cystic fibroids. I did not find anything stating to assist in treatment of breast cancer. Did not state a blocker of estrogen or blocker in breast tissue. Did mention decrease in the bad estrogen, in turn elevating good estrogen. Did i not read the correct info or not enough?? My I ask what you were told the action is of myomin?? thanks carolgolf",

At least there is no edema in my arm, I find exercising twice daily with 3 lb. weights helps alot on keeping the swelling away. I hope all goes well for you, we are leaving for several weeks, however I am taking my laptop. Will try to stay in connect. I have scheduled an appt. with a naturalist, in Ohio, will be of interest to hear her take on all of this. My body still feels like a toxic waste dump. Yesterday in the clinic, I talked to a lady who's husband is an oceanographer, she said they will not eat anything that comes from the bottom such as shrimp,lobster, oysters,etc. What does that say about our enviorment?? Hope all gets better for you and all. Next we write, maybe we will have great news to share, that is my prayer. Will check this site peroidically, so post your news. carolgolf PS.

Thank goodness for friends, so supportive but devastating to me.I have noticed increase thrist and have gained four pounds in 3 days, nausea is constant and getting worse. I have never taken anything other than allergy pills, HRT and vitamins. Couldn't take birth control when I was young, had my tubes liagated when 27. If I get any answers I will post them. I WANT MY LIFE BACK. I am exploring going the natural route. One thing to watch is your cholestrol, Mine shot up with the estrogen blockers. Of course the Dr. wanted to add another pill, I said no. I changed my diet, started taking a rice bran protein drink every morning and had a recheck after 90 days, I lowered it 50 points and have lost 19 lbs until a few days ago. I had water retention with the other 2 estrogen blockers. So I will let you know what goes tues. carolgolf",

The hot flashes are miserable, some fatigue. but I am able to function socially which I couldn't with the other two. I was on HRT for ten years before being diagnosed last Nov.

I went today for a second opinion, first he didnot want to believe the side effects I had then he wants me to have chemo. I have had my checkup with success, no cancer showed. so why would I want to do chemo almost a year after surgery. If he can show me I have a cancer cell then I would consider..Treatment is a personal choice..Like taking all those meds last winter, I felt I went thru hell with the side effects,then the doctors say I can't tolerate them and said they only gave me a 5% less chance of cancer return. I went thru hell for 5%...Now this Dr. Named off some other oral blockers and wanted to know if they were offered to me, I asked what the side effects were and he named off the ones I had already experienced.haha I just laughed at him..I told him I feel like a $*%!* guinea pig in all of this...So it is up to you to decide upon your treatment. I want quality life, over my husband helping me from chair to bed to car to doctors...let me know what you decide....carol g.",
