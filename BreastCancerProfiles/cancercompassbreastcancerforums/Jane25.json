      "Content": "I am not sure where you live, but click on the following link to maybe find an anastasia location near you.  There was a counter at my local mall.  http://www.anastasia.net/  The beauticians will shape your brow now, and then you can buy a kit with stencils.  They teach you everything you need to know to have great looking eyebrows.  I suggest you do it before they fall out.  I still use it today after my eyebrow have come back.  Even during chemo, I got great compliments on my eyebrows!!!!!  Check it out.  Another thing that helped me was a book called JUST A LUMP IN THE ROAD... By Debbie Leifert.  Hope this helps!  ",
