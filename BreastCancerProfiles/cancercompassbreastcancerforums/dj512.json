      "Content": "I am relatively new to BC. Dx'd in July 2015, surgery August 2015 (lumpectomy), chemo: 12 infusions of Taxol tolerated well, followed by 4 of AC, tolerated pretty well. Worked throughout. Approximately 20 days missed work, including 2 surgeries (one a breast reduction) and chemo. Now undergoing 30 radiation treatments. Began Anastrozole end of Feb., 3 weeks after last chemo per md's instructions. I've maintained a positive outlook, and done my best to conquer the fear of the dx. After all, it can only impede recovery. So far, so good on Anastrozole, but concerned hair will be thinner than before. Guess I will need to find a new hair style and a really good stylist. 1/2 was through radiation. I have always been an exercise and health enthusiast, and had planned on beginning my exercise regimen again after radiation. (Get up at 4am to get radiation before work.). After reading 4 pages of comment here, think I should begin exercise right away. May go by a good bicycle this weekend and an indoor stationary bike, as well. I believe that exercise can keep many aches and pains away. It certainly helps keep weight under control. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I'm much more concerned with a cancer dx than other issues. The information you shared about your experiences has been very helpful, much more so than drug company literature. Thank you for your help and your honesty. Here's to wiping out Cancer forever. dj 60 yo Stage II, 3 lymph nodes involved tumor ++,-",

      "Content": "I normally have a pretty even disposition, but since beginning Arimidex my temper is shorter and I am more easily annoyed. Other than that, the side effects haven't been too bad. I do get tired earlier in the evenings, but I'm not certain if that is because radiation only ended in 4/8.",
