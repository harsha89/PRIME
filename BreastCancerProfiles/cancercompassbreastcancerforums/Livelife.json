    "Content": "I had my pre-surgery appointment today. Things got complicated. My C-125 is 44. I have two small solid tumors and two cysts in the only ovary I have. I am 33 and still single. Basically, I just want my obgyn doctor to take a tissue out and when I wake up, they can tell me if it is cancer or not. Then I will make decision such as freeze my eggs, etc\u2026 But doctor insist I have to trust him to make the right decision for everything. So if it is suspicious (just suspicious, may not be cancer), he will take my ovary out at the time. And if it is cancers, he does not think they will freeze my eggs anyway. But I also read on the internet, that for very early stage of cancer, they maybe able to preserve part of ovary. But my doctor says it is not good. He will take the whole things out. I do not feel comfortable about this. And I ask him if all the doctors will do the same, can a doctor just take a tissue out. But indicated most or all of the doctors will do the same as he will do. I also read on the internet, that, maybe a specialized oncologist will be a better choose than obgyn doctor. So I am having a second thought on my surgery, and I can make decision to cancel or continues the surgery at 7/26 by this Friday. He also says it is all my decisions. He can choose conservative methods just close watching the growth of the tumor and the blood test level. So I do not know what to do, if I should choose conservative waiting, or choose an oncologist to do the surgery or just let him do the surgery. So for all of you who had ovarian problems. Does the doctor just take it out at the time of your first lapo, or take sample tissue out first to determine the cancer stage. And have secondary major surgeries and other treatments later? Thanks. Best wishes to all of you.",
