    "Content": "i am a nurse and have seen great reconstruction surgery. It reassured me for all time that if I had to have both breasts removed that I would be ok. When teaching nursing the student nurses would be envious of the flat tummy and wonderful looking breasts that one of our plastic surgeons created. None of us wished for cancer of course but if we were to have it, we felt reassured we would at least look better than we did before. My son Mark has liver mets and has survived now almost 4 years after being told he would die in three months or less. Quality of life...we work on it every day. check his blog...google cancer the last adventure to read about what Mark experiences. Maybe it will cheer you and give you hope. Betty",
