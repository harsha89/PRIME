      "Content": "A few patients have an allergic reaction to Herceptin. I'm so glad they found something to ease her symptons because I believe the Herceptin is very important. I finished mine a year ago, but I still have the runny nose that started with my treatment. (I am cancer free so far.) On a whim, while I was plugged into to the IV treatment, I read the very tiny print insert for the drug. Imagine my surprise that it was made from Chinese hamster ovarian cells! Who among us has ever touched the ovaries of a Chinese hamster to discover if we have an allergic reaction?  Good luck to your mother!",

One lady in my support group mentioned cutting the pill (man, it is tiny though) in half and taking 2 does AM & PM helped her. I've started doing more with Omega 3 (fish oil) & glucosamine chondroitin recently. Don't know if it will help, but at least I feel pro-active!  Anyone tried this approach?  Laura",

      "Content": "I think it amazed me how much I cared about the hair loss. I felt I had to keep a \"stiff upper lip\" about it. Mine (down to my  waist) was gone by the start of the 3rd treatment.  There is a cetain power in cutting it yourself, instead of letting it fall out. Plus who wants that all over your face, pillow, car, etc.? I did 3 hair cuts, each one shorter than te last. I couldn't stand the scratchness of my wig, so I use bandanas and then just went bald. They people at my office were great & I only covered up when we had visitors. My only bad moment was scaring a little kid at the grocery store. Suggestions: Call the the American Cancer Soc. in your area. They gave me a free wig, stand, and little hats. They have a catalog that if full of neat things. They may have a \"phone buddy\" you can call too. Also, check to see if they do a \"Look Good Feel Better\" Program. It made a big difference for me sitting in a room with 20 other bald women, trying on make up, playing with wigs and scarves and just SHARING. It was great! http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ESN/content/ESN_3_1X_Look_Good My hair grew back in curly and fairly quickly - maybe 8-10 months. Good luck to you.  ",
