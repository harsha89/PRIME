    "Content": "This tumor has been growing very slowly for about 3 years. I already had a bi-lateral mastectomy. The tumor was removed 4 times already, keeps coming back. I have been on a very strict diet, tried everything on this earth. I am very discouraged. I am thinking of trying MMS with DMSO topically, a little afraid to take internally. Does any one know a reliable source that can give me guidence. My funds are very low! I will forever thankful. God Bless, Marie",
