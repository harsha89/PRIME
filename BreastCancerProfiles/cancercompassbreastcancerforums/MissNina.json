      "Content": "My darling Emily and dear friend,  I didn't look for cancer it found me for some reason? As it did us? No \"cancer\" is what we claim sister. AMEN That is and will always be our claim for one another. I believed the test when it said no cancer in the body. Let's hold on to a good report. God is still in the blessing business...Don't lose faith no matter what it looks like. Remembering you sisters in my prayers. We do not know God's will for our lives let us pray his will... Also be willing to accept whatever his will is for our lives he knows what's best. I learned to trust God... I leaned on him everyday and still do. Follow the doctor's instructions. Trust me it was hard for me too. I didnt want to do any of it but I went through trusting in God to help the doctors in my care. He did everything I asked him to do...Still holding on to God's unchanging hands. That's who saw me through everything. . . My prayers and my cry to God. No other help I know...sister there will be sometimes where no one can identify with you and what you're going through but him...I am a living witness.  I am at the end of this November will be a year for me. Just went through this treatment. With the help of the Lord Jesus Christ. This too shall pass. Are you a true believer? Trust him he won't let you down. He said he would never leave us or forsake us. Everyday my prayer to God lord you said. He watches over his word and he hasten to perform it. He moves quickly.  We have to hold on to faith. That's all we have and that is enough... Find comfort in the word of God. All I know sister I pray it strengthen you and my dear sister.God bless you both and family. ",

I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma last year. Chemo was first 8 cycles to shrink the size was 2cm. Surgery was radical mastectomy with \"sentinel lymph node biopsy\". Followed by recent radiation therapy treatments 30 were recommended. Nothing can prepare you for the treatment or the pain. Everyone is hopeful in giving you their advice during your treatment. I think they treat a patient as a number of treatments. I went through this whole process following my doctors orders.  They don't tell you much about coping but, can suggest groups.  My focus has been my constant prayers to God before hospital. My constant prayers with the doctor or nurse providing personal care. That they are compassionate and not the ones who didn't want to be at work. Or in the wrong profession. So far my faith has strengthened me and got me through this process. I am still recovering from the radiation burns to my chest. Don't want to frighten you here but you must go through. Some things that no one can prepare you for. Oh they will tell you this will happen or that may happen. Ask questions like are you going to continue radiation when the skin breaks? So you can brace yourself and get those answers. Don't be afraid to get a understanding of everything. Be an advocate for your care. Eat a good healthy diet. I didn't use metal forks and spoons during chemo mostly. Never got sick took vitamins, calcium, vitamin E, Fish Oil 3 times. It helped me use the restroom regular and a stool softner. I wanted that stuff out of my body. It went in and it had to come out somewhere. I drank lots of water the night before or day before. Any treatment to ensure my body was hydrated. Eat a healthly snack while on chemo usually and radiation treatment. Made sure I ate a healthly or light breakfast and lunch. While going through this stuff didn't miss any meals. I ate whatever my appetite had a taste for. Or I couldn't eat food. Listen to your body for the side effects of chemo therapy too. I couldnt take Zofran had a headache for two days. I refused it everytime and you have to watch what they are giving you. They kept trying to give me the Zofran even after I told them couldn't take it. You have to pay attention to your body and the causes and effects of medication. I read the labels warning and side effects for the signs of such. Believe me had all the doubts of chemo, and did not want to do radiation. I cried everytime. If this is your plan you want to do what is right for you. I know it is hard to grasp but they do know many cases before you. You are not alone in this fight. Radiation is worser than chemo if you ask me.  Chemo was a breeze compared to the outcome of radiation. I am at home now recovering from it. I am 53 years of age you can do this. Which one are you doing first chemo or radiation. I am not sure what you mean here. God bless you sister you are added to my prayer list.",
