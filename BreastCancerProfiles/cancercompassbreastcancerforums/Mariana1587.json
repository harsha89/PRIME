    "Content": "Dear Sir/Madam, I would greatly appreciate receiving your advice concerning a matter of vital importance to me. I am a 61 old woman who has undergone a double mastectomy 6 months ago, with simultaneous breast reconstruction using the expander technique. Right from the beginning I had huge problems with limph accumulation at the mastectomy sites ( even if no nodes removed). Drains have been removed very quickly after the operation ( 2 days afterward), so that the fluid continued to accumulate in my breasts. After about 3 weeks, the plastic surgeon has made a drainage and removed about 600-700ml from my right breast and about 300 ml from my left breast. Afterwards, things went for the better and the expanders were inflated to the final size( 600ml). Three weeks after finishing the expansion, I noticed a small bruise along the scar of my right breast, which the doctor considered to be irrelevant. After a short travel by plane , the bruised region just burst out \u2013 a small hole appeared along the scar and a huge amount of limph was discharged ( about 250 ml). The surgeon cut off the area in question , but the new wound does not heal \u2013 the scar is dark purple and the hoes of the sutures are open.Every 3 days a have a new discharge of fluid through a small hole at one of the suture points. The amount ofÂ  each discharge is 200-250 ml. I am wearing a compression bra and limited activity to the minimum, but the discharges have continued for 3 weeks. Is it possible that should be limphedema? If so, what can I do? Thanking you in advance, Mariana",
