    "Content": "My husband started chemo (Taxotere) a week ago today.  He has developed water blisters between his toes and on his heels.  He is finding this very painful.  He is also swollen in the knees, feet and ankles. I understand this drug is used quite often for Breat Ca my husband has Stage IV Lung they say this is a second line chemo.  From what I have read you can lose you finger and toe nails, I was just wondering if anybody has or knows of anyone that has experienced this same side effect and what you did to relieve the pain.  He is soaking his feet in epsom salts 2-3 times a day and is on Dilaudid for pain.  This doesn't seem to be enough. Please help if you can. Thank you Gayle & Lorne ",
