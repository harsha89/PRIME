    "Content": "I'm 42 and have had 2 normal mammograms in the past. However, last week I had my 3rd mammogram and received this finding, \"There are calcifications with regional distribution seen in the posterior upper outer quadrant of the right breast.\" From what I've read, regional distribution is most likely benign, but I've seen a couple websites quote 20% and 26% chance of malignancy. I'm trying to find a document that gives the chance of malignancy for NEW calcifications. These were not there last year, which has me very concerned that I'm in that 20-26%. Thanks in advanced.",
