    "Content": "Hello. I am brand-new to the site, and just noticed your post and it struck me. My husband is stage IV and has matasteces in numerous places throughout his body from an esophageal cancer first discovered two years ago. He has been in hosp. for a month from a bowel obstruction caused by two of the tumors. It's a dreadful thing and we are getting through it one day at  time. However, what struck me was your story about the dog........It sounds to me as though your doggie was definitely heaven-sent. I have a min-pin that I got about four years ago, she was  gift from my husband. I was not even a dog person when I got that dog, but I fell in love with her instantly. This dog was definitely sent by heaven---she and faith/prayer keep me sane. She's always there when I go home at nite to sit with me through my crying spells.  When my husband was home and had to be in bed, she crawled up there in the bed beside him, just as quiet as a mouse and would stay for hours and hours during the day offering him comfort. I wish they had hospitals with \"pet wings\" where those of us who have pets could keep them with us, I  believe that would contribute a lot to healing/well-being.  My prayers go out to you that you will beat this thing. muffins momma.",
