    "Content": "Sometimes the toughest part about being a survivor is that everyone is happy and wants you to celebrate your survival and go on with your life - but you still have a challenging aftermath - no matter what kind of cancer or treatment you had.  I understand your pain.  I had cervical cancer w/surgery, chemo and radiation - while two of my closest friends had breast cancer at the same time. One had little pain, the other has a lot of pain still - including the stabbing thing you describe. I still have challenges and the best way I can handle it is to stay as positive as possible, and also find lots of distractions - dramas on TV, books, things that help keep my mind off pain. Wishing you the best! You are not alone! ",
