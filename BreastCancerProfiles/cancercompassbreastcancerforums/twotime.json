    "Content": "I noticed a red spot about the size of a thumb on right breast along with a lump under the spot.  2 days later noticed slight dimpling.  Saw my dr, she did ultra sound in her office.  Could see the lump on ultra sound.  She said she did not like the look of it and has scheduled a mamogram, ultra sound with core bisopy.  Sent me right away, but the center did not accept my insurance.  Now scheduled for this Thursday.  Has anyone else had these symptoms and what were the results?  ",
