    "Content": "Susan, Yes, I saw a book at Barnes and Nobles written by a Female Dr. It was very thick. I didn't buy the book, but sat down and skimmed through it. She recommends 200-400 mg of Guaifenesin twice daily. I have fibromyalgia, and am also a nurse. I was somewhat skeptical. The Dr. that wrote it said it has helped her significantly as she suffers with it also. I have started taking it. For me I see no change yet, but I have only taken it for a few weeks. I wish I could recall the title, it had to do with treating fibromyalgia, or questions about it. I hope this helps a little. I'll keep you in my prayers, Taffy W",
