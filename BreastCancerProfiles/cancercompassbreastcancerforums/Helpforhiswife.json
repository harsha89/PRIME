      "Content": "I was estrogen positive, I had a hysterectomy do to too much estrogen, I was 30, I'm 50 now, I have always had dense breast, I chose the double mastectomy, one doc fought me to remove normal breast, well that breast had lobular carcinoma larger then the invasive ductal.. Not in nodes.. I knew I would have problems, I had one of the highest triggers, I started my period early..in 5 th grade.. I do not want to take tamaxifen..I'm scared to take it?? I already suffer migraines... If I have have my ovary removed then would I still have to take it? Is it more of a cancer Theraphy? So it does not metastasize... My estrogen percentage was 95% and he said normal is in their 20.., so help, do I really have to take the hormone Theraphy if I don't have ovarys??? Ps, I said I had hysterectomy, of course they left them in.. I'm waiting braca results, and DNA testings, nobody had breast cancer, however, there where a lot of stomach cancers in my fathers side, and they are glandular cancers.. I'm happy that I had braca as I have adult daughters who have never had mammograms, too young.. Well know that I was DX, they can? I never took birth control pills as they gave me migraines, so I never had any additional hormones, other then what I make?",

      "Content": "Hi, thank you so much for your encouraging words, my step mother had bone cancer and was given 4 months.. She died and so did my dad, so my brother had nobody and moved close to me, he said those exact words.. I had mastectomy Friday, home sat, they took 5 nodes out, I see oncologist tue...the anger is all behind me, this sounds strange, but I had a lot unrelated drama prior, and I was allowing others people, their lives and choices to interfere in my peace... Now it's healing, resting, my drains, trying to keep them clean, and not in the way...your so right, I'm alive, this chapter is over, and as I turn the page, I'll see what my oncology fate is... Oh, so moving, I was very pleased I had more range of motion, I imagined,,I have to take the pain pills every four hours round the clock,, I took a four hour nap, missed a dose, and wow, when I'm awake so stiff...so lifting my arms now, won't hurt or break stitches..? you said you broke through scare tissue, how long after did you developed scar tissue? I'm running a low grade temp, just 99, I see PS tomorrow for wound care, I'm on antibiotics,,I'm doing breathing exercises, it's 104 today and a spare the air day, thanks again..helpful words, best wishes!!!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your words, I'm 14 days away now, and I think the anger has passed, you where so right, Christian music, my bible, people who just delivered very sweet gifts, that have walked this journey, or somebody close to them had, and they knew exactly what I needed post op. I'm still scared, I'm having genetic testing next week, I have a very bad UTI, I may have a stone, if that's the case? Surgery can't be done until this UTI clears... There is a helpful book out the silver lining, that I found very comforting, a nurse who experiences BC, her journey, but suggestions really good one on what to bring and have ready, before and after... I'm still dealing with major mood swings, my poor husband, I just stay in my room where I find comfort a silence for prayer, then I come our and enjoy my family... Cancer sucks, all of it, my husband had it, it's a terrible beautiful journey...I say beautiful as people come in to your lives, some help, some you want to distance yourself from because they are toxic and you can't take their energy. Thank you for your comments and help, it's wonderful to have a place to vent that understands..xo",

      "Content": "Two years ago my husband had EC, it was caught very early, he had the radical surgery, but then he contacted something called Guillian barret syndrome...it was a very hard two years he was on a vent, he came home with a tracheostomy, needles to say, he is doing great, vent and trache are gone, his weight went from 135 to 195....however his GBS, left him paralyzed at knee caps down, so he can't drive, but other then that, he is doing fabulous. Now I've been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma...my surgery is within a couple of weeks...I'm going through all emotions, anger as the one for today, as I handle everything, finances, cobra, and his overbearing family, I guess this is my cancer, and I want his family to respect my privacy, as when their son was sick, I honored everything he wanted. And they where very involved I'm very private, I asked them just to give me the month to recover, and I did not want them here, but despite what I said, they demanded they are coming... I have all arrangements made to have my husband cared for, while I'm recovering,,,cooks, house cleaners, people who will drive us. We belong to a large supportive church.. Please help, how do I keep his family away.. They make me very nervous . Every part of me wants to unleash all of my anger on them, as we can't control cancer, but to me, I just want a peaceful recovery...I'm only 50 we have adult daughters, and I just don't want them around.. Is this wrong??",
