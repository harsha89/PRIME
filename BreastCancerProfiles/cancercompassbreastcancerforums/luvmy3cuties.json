Um... I'm no expert, but that doesn't sound good!  The last CT scan I had showed that the largest spot on my liver was down to 2 cm after 4 chemo treatments.  I kind of blacked out there after he said that about maintaining quality of life stuff and wasn't able to focus on what else he was saying!!  Chemo brain not included - just absolute shock!!  He's never been anything but positive and now this?  Anyone have any idea what he could have meant by that - I'm scared to call back and ask!!!  Also, any ideas on the single vs. double mastectomy would be appreciated. Sorry to hear about what you are going thru.  I was Dx'd in 12/03 (age 38) with stage II breast CA of R breast.  I had just weaned my third child from nursing.  My OB found the lump.  Since I have no family history of any cancer, or other risk factors, I assumed it was probably a clogged milk duct.  Within 3 days, I had my first mammo, U/S and lumpectomy.  The tumor was ER/PR +, Her2 Nue -.  Had 2+ nodes.  Had mod. rad. mast. followed by dose-dense ACT chemo, then radiation.  Started on Tamoxifen.  1/05 I had genetic testing which revealred NO BRACA I or II gene.  I do not have a family Hx of any CA.  11/05, I was Dx's w/L breast CA.  This time the tumor was ER/PR -.  They didn't couldn't find the CA in the tissue post mast., so they didn't test Her2 (I'm sure it was +).  I had a L breast mod. rad. mast.  Onc. thought the Tamoxifen \"jump started\" the second CA, so she put me on lupron inj. every 4 weeks.  Once I went into chemical menapause, the stopped the tamoxifen and started me on Arimedex.  8/08, I felt a lump on my L breast/chest area.  It was a 1 cm tumor that grew in the residual breast tissue.  ER/PR- and Her2Nue 3+.  I am now on chemo every 3 weeks (Carboplatin & Taxotere), plus Herceptin.  So... that's my history.  I live in CT, but called a naturapathic physician (he's a MD) in MA.  Had a tel. consult with him re: suppliments.  I'm in the process of talking to my onc. about them.  She is leary, as I'm on chemo, but there are some I can take.  I still am waiting for approval from ins. co. to have a ton of bldwork that this MA doc ordered, before I start the Rx.  He wants a baseline, then is able to check to see how my body is responding to the suppliments.  In my case (3 cancers in 4 1/2 years) tells me that conventional medicine is not the end-all.  My body needs more help.  Obvioulsy, there is something nothing working right.  I'm sharing this with you, as I think you might want to consider complimentary Rx.  Of course, your onc. should be made aware of any suppliments you take, while on traditional meds.  Check out http://www.lexingtonnaturalhealth.com for more info on natural treatments.  Re: the comment your doc made about looking to maintain a good quality of life, he is going on the assumption that there is no cure w/stage IV breast CA.  As you heard from others, there are many women living w/stage IV for many years.  I've heard from/and read about people who have gone the natural route, and though the doc doesn't say they're cured, they report they're in permanent remission.  Not a bad place to be, huh?  Wishing you well!   ~Rose",
