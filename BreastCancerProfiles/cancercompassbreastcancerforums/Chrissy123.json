      "Content": "The MRI that I had required an IV. This involves a slight pinching , but not bad at all. If your mom is super sensitive to pain, she can get a perscription for lanocaine (sp?) ointment and apply this prior to the procedure. Another woman having MRI at same time, had taken a sedative, Atavan, prior to her MRI because she was concerned about the confinement of the machine. She didn't care what they did!! I am not familiar with PET scan.",

      "Content": "Sandy and Becky, thank you so much for your replies. I cannot believe how the stress of this test has taken over my every thought. I seem more concerned about this than what is to come during the next day surgery. Sandy, I called my doctor and told him about the lidocaine and he thought it was a good idea. Is it a perscription ointment? And as you said Becky, he told me the lidacaine shot would not really help and was just as uncomfortable. I think he said I would get four shots of this dye. I hope they are quick...How long did this process take? thanks again for your help.",

      "Content": "I survived the sentinel node test, and thanks to all of your support, it was not bad at all. The atavan and lidocain cream certainly helped. Needle pricks were short and did not even feel any burning. Was surprised that the doctor doing the injections said he had never seen anyone with this cream! Surgery is over and looking forward to the next step in this journey.",
