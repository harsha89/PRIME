    "Content": "Hi Tx Cowgirl, I have a couple questions for you. Were you on anything before the Aromasin, and if so what? I have just swtiched from Tamoxifen (4yrs) to Aromasin (3 weeks now) and am hoping to lose the 10 pounds I gained, maybe sleep again, and have less hot flashes. I am only 53, and have the typical menopausal stuff going on. The drugs seem to accentuate the symptoms. If you have good results maybe I can have them too. You have given me hope again that I can and will be \"normal\" again. On 3/8/2009 tx Cowgirl wrote: Thank you for your response. I have now been on aromasin for over 2 years and am happy to report that the only side effect I have is occasional hot flashes. I am back to my old self, lost the weight, and feeling great! Joint/foot pain is gone and I can do what I want to do! We all just need to stay aware of what drugs can do to our bodies. Blessings to you! Tx Cowgirl",
