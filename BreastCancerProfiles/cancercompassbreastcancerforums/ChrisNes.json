      "Content": " I went in on 2/14/13 and had a mammogram. 3 hours after my mammogram I was called by the imaging dept. in the city nearest me. They said I had a lesion next the pectoral-muscle and it is 9mm that I have to come in to get another Mammogram and maybe a ultrasound.  On 2/12/13 I went to an orthopedic doctor who took a x-ray of my hip that has been causing me problems. I have been told for years that it is bursitis. This doctor told me I have maybe bone spurs that are rubbing on the muscle on the outside of my right hip. He took x-rays and saw something he didn't know what it was. He said hip fracture, tumor, or maybe a bone defect. He ordered a bone scan.  I went in to the hospital for the bone scan and the breast mammogram on Wednesday.  The Mammogram showed a 11mm by 6mm lesion in my right breast. Then I went for my bone scan, I had to have an injection of some type of safe radiation into my vein and had to drink a lot of water. The scan showed a very bright white spot in the hip area where I am having the pain. A radiologist is to read this and then get the report to my doctor by the 25th. I was informed that my doctor is on some type of administrative leave and nobody knows when he will be back.  I then was told I have to go back up stairs for an ultrasound. The teck-persons doing the ultra sound could not find the lesion. They called the doctor in to do the scan and she couldn't find the lesion either. They said I have dense breasts and the lesion is close to my peck-muscle. They then got a mammogram from 2009 and said that there was no lesion on that mammogram so now I have to go back to the hospital on the 28th and have a ultrasound guided biopsy of the breast lesion. I don't know how they are going to do that because they couldn't find the lesion when they used the ultrasound.  I am really worried here.  My sister died of breast cancer in 1985 she was 32 and I was 19. It was offal. When my sister was 29 they removed a breast and part of her armpit and did not get all of the cancer. The cancer spread to her bones, brain, it went all over and was a terrible way to die.  I don't know if I have cancer. The hip scan and the mammogram have me worried.  Does anyone have any information they can offer.  I don't even know what the 11mm by 6mm means, is that the length and the width of the lesion? Is it the diameter and depth of the lesion in my breast? When I looked at the mammogram it looked like a cluster. There was no pea-shaped image on the mammogram. It looked like an ink splatter with no defined shape. They said it was a tough lesion because it is so close to the muscle tissue. It could not be felt by the doctor on exam.  I had a breast exam twice last year by an OBGYN and a PA and neither of them felt anything. The doctor who did the ultrasound couldn't feel anything either.  Any information would be greatly appreciated. I know I have 7 days to hopefully find out something after the biopsy but any information would be great.  If this is cancer and it has gone into my bones...what are my chances?  Thank You, Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I don't know how to start this. I did not have my breast biopsy today. I went in to the clinic. I got all the information. The doctor and the 2 nurses talked to me and told me what to expect. They showed me the lesion on my mammograms. I got on the table put my boob through the hole. There was a lot of stretching my boob a lot of squeezing my boob. A lot of pain every time they adjusted and re-adjusted everything. It was an hour of being uncomfortable. Every time they tried to get the lesion to show up it did not work, OMGosh! So they took me into the room with the stand up mammogram and took a few shots after a lot of squeezing and there was the lesion. This time the doctor said it was an 11.4mm by a 6.3mm. Then they put me in a room while 2 radiologists looked at my mammogram. two doctors came back with two nurse s. They said that the lesion is not a cyst, and it does not look like cancer. They said that they cant find it when I lay down on the boob table. They said that they will monitor it, that I am to come back in 6 months to see if there is any growth. Boy was my estranged husband pissed. (He wants me out of the house but not if I have cancer or something like that.) Oh they also told me to stop looking at articles I find on the internet. I am to go back in on August 1st and they say if there is any growth they will biopsy it that day. HOW are they going to biopsy it in August when they cant biopsy it now??? It is right next to my pectoral muscle and they cant see it when I lay down and cant get at it. WTHeck??? My husband is pissed he wants me to go see another doctor. I hope he has the money to pay for all of this because I don't. OMGosh...any body have any advice?",
