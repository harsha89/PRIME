    "Content": "Hi,  My mother-in-law was just diagnosed with Glioblastoma. All I know is that the doctor said she has the \"most aggressive form\" of brain cancer and has given her 2 week to 2 months to live. Her tumor is in her speech center and is affecting her though process more than her actual speech. So we can't communicate well.  I am trying to help my wife and the rest of the family cope with this - to do what ever we can do in the short time we have. I am also trying to find out what to expect over the next couple of weeks. So that we are all prepared. Can anyone help, please, tell me the best things to do with such short time?!?!? She was first symptomatic 2 months ago, but we had no idea until a couple of days ago what we were dealing with. The doctors misdiagnosed badly at first, so we never thought death was eminent. I guess I am not really sure what I am asking, other than for help and advice. Christmas is really hard.",
