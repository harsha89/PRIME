      "Content": "hi there! I am on aromasin since august 20 of this year and the pain you're experiencing i have it too. I used to take arimidex and the bone pain is too much so i asked my oncologist to switch me to aromasin. I wanted to try aromasin and see if i will have less pain but unfortuantely it is the same if not more. They all have the same chemical composition, arimidex, aromasin and femera so the side effects are the same. I take gabapentin and vicodin to help me with the pain and i try to walk everyday and keep moving because it helps. Our journey is long and hard but we can all help each other.",
