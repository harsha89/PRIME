      "Content": "Hi Susier. I think the reg. protocol for aromatase inhibitors is 5 yrs.  I think they leave some of us on it who have had a recurrence. I feel like a guinea pig cuz they don't have any case studies of women who have been on it 10 yrs.+ ... I guess we are the living case studies without being in a control group! Sorry to hear about your sister. I can only imagine how scary it must be for you now. I look at the meds as insurance and I want to have as much insurance as I can. Which one are you taking now and for how long? Yeah, I know what you mean about chemo...I too was premenopausal the 1st time. I was 41 and breastfeeding my 2 yr. old daughter when I found the lump!  And after surgery I started chemo & it knocked me right in menopause. Whoa....intense when it's chemically induced!",

      "Content": "I am a 2-time breast cancer survivor: 1st time in 1989 with mastectomy & 6 mos. chemo.  The 2nd time was in 2003 (14 yrs. later) this time I had 8 mos. chemo & 6 wks. radiation. Then the hormone therapy started: started with Femara but after a few yrs. I couldn't tolerate side effects so switched to Aromasin. This drug seeems to have less side effects for me and my life has improved.  I have now been on hormone therapy for 8 yrs.!  My oncologist says he is leaving me on it indefinitely since I had the recurrence in 2003.  The main complaints I have about Aromasin are: some joint pain (but not all the time), dry eyes, skin, etc., & thinning hair. I have been on it so long that there are certainly other side effects but I have just gotten used to them and try not to dwell on the negative. As long as I can function, go on walks, take TaiChi classes & study languages then I feel lucky to be where I am.  Another good thing about Aromasin is that it finally has a generic version called Exemastane, so now it is very inexpensive.  I am not sure if this drug is compatible with your needs but you can certainly ask your oncologist.  Hope this helps!  Good Luck,  Hadia",

      "Content": "Hi Susier. I can only speak from my own experience with Aromasin. I have been taking aromatase inhibitors for 8 yrs. now and my oncologist plans to leave me on them indefinitely. I started out taking Femara and stuck with it 2 yrs. but I had so much joint pain it was hard to walk, especially painful in hip joints. So I asked to switch to a different one and he put me on Aromasin. Honestly, after over 5 yrs., I have become accostomed to it since I know it's for the long haul. I am stiff in the a.m.'s but that is partly due to arthritis. Once I start moving it gets better. I do not have the severe hip joint pain anymore. I can go on hour walks feeling great. My hair has thinned somewhat but I use Nioxin shampoo & conditioner which has helped. My skin is dry & more wrinkled than before but that's the result of no estrogen for so long. I am 64 now anyway. I had breast cancer in 1989, had a mastectomy & 6 mos. of chemo but never took anything after that. So for 14 yrs. I was fine until it came back in 2003. Then I had 8 mos. of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation, & have been on aromatse inhibitors ever since. I feel fortunate to have estrogen receptor positive BC because if it's estrogen negative there are no meds! So I try to make the most of life, I take taichi 2 x week, go for walks & try to keep a positive attitude   Hope this helps! Hadia",

      "Content": "Hello.  I have been taking the other aromatase inhibitor Femara for 4 yrs. and also experience many of the same symptoms as you are having.  I have 2 ideas for you instead of pain meds. 1. Physical therapy in water, specifically in a heated pool 2. Acupuncture I have found acupuncture helps and that means frequent treatments, maybe weekly for awhile and then bi-monthly.  Most insurances now cover acupuncture or if yours does not maybe you can find a foundation that funds cancer patients' alternative therapies.  I refuse to take pain meds as I don't want to tax my liver anymore than it's already been due to so much chemo.   I hope this info helps you a little.  I am just thankful that I am still here after having breast cancer twice (1st time in 1989) Reoccurence in 2003 with mets to the sternum. Femara seems to be working for me and I'm living with the side effects!  Good luck.  Hadia  ",

      "Content": "Hi Kitty, Thanks for replying to my previous message. How long have you been taking Femara? I understand you are having some of the same side effects as I am. Mine seem to be getting worse and I don't know what remedies there are left that I haven't tried. What have you been doing to alleviate some of the pain? I'm just not the type who can take advil or ibuprofin daily since I don't think it's good for you plus it doesn't help much anyway! Glad you haven't experienced weight gain! My cholesterol went up & my oncologist looked it up & said that's another side effect of Femara! So I started eating oatmeal & taking Red Rice Yeast tablets & it went down 30 pts.! Hope to hear from you and wish you well. Hadia",

      "Content": "Dear Leila, Thanks for replying to my message, you're such a good writer! I know what you mean by feeling like a real old lady!!! I feel like this every day & I'm 58. Now my knees are all stiff & sore every second! It's awfully uncomfortable & I walk & move like I'm 95! After taking Femara for 1 1/2 yrs. and knowing I still have 3 1/2 yrs. left it makes me wonder what it'll be like as time progresses. I tried taking advil, etc. but it doesn't help at all and I don't want to take heavy drugs like vicodin cuz they make me feel sick. I was hoping that acupuncture & chiropractic would help but they really don't; of course when you take another pill every day it just keeps accumulating in your body anyway. You are such a great inspiration to me with your traveling and dancing...that's what will keep you young! I know you are disappointed about your hair but there are so many lessons to be learned from this dis-ease!!! (you can always put on a wig for a special occasion). With your sense of adventure, traveling and dancing it sounds like you know what makes life fun and interesting. I've gained about 15 lbs. since being on Femara & it's so depressing but then I think how thankful I am to be alive & I try to accept it and stay positive. Both my kids have moved out & are in college & I have \"empty nest\" now as well as having been a single mom for the last 16 years. It's not easy trying to date at my age cuz most men my age are looking to date women in their 30's & 40's! Oh well, with no estrogen I hardly care most of the time! Hope to hear from you Leila, enjoy each day...that's why it's called the present! Hadia",

      "Content": "Hi Maryla Thanks for replying to my femara msg. After hearing my complaints about a yr. ago my oncologist wanted to switch me to aromasin but i decided to stay with femara after reading about both side effects. I am curious to hear how it is for you on the aromasin, i hope some of the negative side effects from femara subside. You know what i think? That all these estrogen blocker drugs must do almost the same thing! It only makes sense that without any estrogen our bodies undergo tremendous changes. The lower back pain is really bad, in fact when i get up after sitting i can't even straighten up for awhile. I must look like i am 90 yrs. old & i am only 58! I had to sell my men's cruiser bike cuz my hip joints hurt so bad that i can't even lift my leg over the bar to get on the bike anymore! Well, enough of my complaints. I'd like to stay in touch with you and hear if the new meds are any better with less negative side effects. Best wishes for healing, hadia",

      "Content": "Hi Carmela, I have been taking femara for almost 2 yrs. (I'm 58)& must say that the side effects have gotten worse with time. My main problems are: joint, muscle & bone pain. Also I have weight gain, depression, fatigue & stiffness. I have tried chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy & massage. I found that swimming in a warm pool helps a little since it's non weight bearing. Massage helps relieve symptoms for a short time. My knees got so stiff in the joints that I had trouble walkimg & my rt. knee actually went out & now I need knee surgery with a torn meniscus. I think we are guinea pigs with these aromatase inhibitor drugs. But since I've had breast cancer twice with mets to sternum bone in '03 I will continue taking femara cuz I'm scared not to.

      "Content": "  On 1/29/2007 Kimarie wrote: Hello, first timer.  I am doing a clinical study for the drug Femara.  I am two years out since finding breast cancer.  Had partial masectomy, did 4 rounds chemo 6 1/2 weeks radiation, 1 year of tamoxifin.  Been on Femara for 6 weeks.  I am 47.  Chemo put me in menapause.  Question?  Some days I feel like strangleing somebody, some days I just cry.  Sometimes I am so mad, I hate myself.  I think my emotional roller coaster is going to drive me crazy.  Sound familiar, let me know. Hello Kimarie, I have been taking Femara almost 3 yrs. now. I had a reoccurence of breast cancer after 14 yrs.!  In 1989 I had BC & had a mastectomy, reconstruction & 6 mos. chemo. It also put me in menopause at 41 yrs. Then I didn't take any drugs after that and was ok for 14 yrs. until 2003. I found a small bump near my sternum & yes, it was BC again - a tumor near my implant and it had also spread to my sternum bone.  So I went thru 8 mos. of chemo & 6 wks. radiation. Then I started taking Femara (both times the BC was estrogen positive.)  I have many side effects from Femara: bone pain, joint pain, lower back pain, weight gain, and lots more wrinkles then ever, plus it made my cholesterol go up!  (I am now 59).   At first my oncologist was going to put me on it for 5 yrs. but now he said he's leaving me on it indefinitely since it's keeping the cancer away. I was surprised when he said that but then again, I do want to stay on it if it keeps me safe. Of course I know there are no guarantees with this disease but at least Femara is what we have now to help us.  As far as the side effects you are having now, all I can say is that they probably will subside as your body readjusts  to the drug. But also be prepared for new ones to pop up ... I also have been taking Fosamax to prevent osteoporosis (it's a once a week pill with no side effects) and trying to exercise more which helps with the stiffness I seem to have all the time. But overall, even tho the side effects aren't pleasant, I am still here !!!!!  I hope I have helped you a little bit. Do write back if you'd like.    Hadia",
