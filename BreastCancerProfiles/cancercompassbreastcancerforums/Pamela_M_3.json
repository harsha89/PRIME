    "Content": "Good afternoon, please accept my heartfelt thoughts as you go through the initial stages of grieving. On 11-29-04 I lost my beloved wife Pamela to breast cancer; she was a 24 year survivor when the cancer came back in '01. They gave her 24 months to live and she lasted 44, enjoyed some quality along the way with the exception of the last two months. Then on December 22 of the same year I lost my mother to lung cancer that she fought for 13 months; talk about a double whammy blow to the system. There is not much one can say about losing a loved one other than the fact that time does indeed heal wounds; your inner strength will guide you; try meditation, try hypnosis but most of all turn your fear and anxiety into power; when you do this it will no longer hold anything over you; accept that Mom is no longer in the earthly world but resting peacefully with no more bone pain and nomore wondering what will happen next. Have peace of mind in knowing that she is in a better place and as I write this message she is looking after you. Stay strong, cry, laugh and remember the memories for they will be with you forever. I spent the first 90 days compiling a memorial book in honor of Pam and Mom, acknowledging the people that made a difference in their plights, it is a healthy thing to do. I wish you the best of all the best and look forward to your response. Chris",
