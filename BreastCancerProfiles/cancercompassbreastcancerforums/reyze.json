      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2006, I began chemo (doxorubican, 5FU and taxotere) in March 2006 and had my last treatment in July 2006.  I only have a few sparse hairs on my head and my hair has not regrown.  I don't understand this since I had very very thick curly hair.  I have used Nioxin and am now using Rogaine in an attempt to get hair.  My body hair, eyebrows and eyelashes only have sparse hair also.  Do you have any suggestions or help? I miss my hair. Please help.",

I am wondering if it has anything to do with the Arimidex that I am now taking.  Are you taking anything now? I take 20mg of  tamoxifen everyday.",
