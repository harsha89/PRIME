My dr has given me Aqua4 with lidocain and suggested using a combination of water, salt and baking soda to use on my open sores - however, this doesn't seem to be working very well - and I can't stand to touch the area to put on the lidocain compound. I also have very large breasts - had a mastectomy on the right side in June of 07 and have one more week of radiation to go to complete the 34 sessions. They have moved the radiation site in closer to the actual scar tissue, but the open sores are located under neath the flap of skin left for reconstruction. My questions are: 1. where did you get the products? 2. Is there one you feel works better than the others? (I'm leaning toward the spray since I wouldn't have to rub anything on the area), 3. How long did it take your sores to heal? Mine are open sores with white skin around it and gooey in appearance - also has an odor - I'm thinking because they are beneath the skin fold, it will take longer to heal...? I also have a really red burn on my neck where they were targeting lymph nodes which has a sore area - although not the same in appearance as the ones on my breast - which is incredibly burned. I appreciate your willingness to share and any advice will be greatly appreciated! Denia/Texas Denia, I have products left over, the Cool Magic Gel Pads (dressings) and the Domeboro Soaks.The items that are sterile. They are in individual sterile packages and you can even show them to your Radiation Oncologist before using them for his approval. The RadiaKlenz Spray, of course cannot be shared. I put in my original message how to obtain them. The Cool Magic Gel Pads were from my hospital and I also ordered them online. The RadiaKlenz can be ordered online also. The Domeboro Soaks can be purchased at a regular pharmacy. Walgreens didn't have it, but overnighted it for me. My Radiation (36) Treatments were from 10/31/07 and last was 12/24/07. I was not completely healed and was able to return to work on 2/11/08. Since I am an RN, I couldn't be in the \"hospital setting\" with open burns. If you would like to privately e-mail me, I will go back into your question and privately send you my e-mail address. i really hope this helps you. God Bless You & You Are In My Prayers, Jeanie",

      "Content": "I started Radiation Treatments for Bilateral Breast Cancer on 10/31/07 and finished on 12/24/07, after 36 treatments. I developed SEVERE Radiation Burns, due to the fact of having such large breasts. I would like to share with all of you the best treatments I have found. I have 3 products that have really helped me in this long ordeal, that is still not over. 1) RadiaKlenz by the Carrington Company - Dermal Wound Cleanser. It is a spray bottle. 2) Domeboro Soaks - Aluminum Acetate Astringent Solution. I was doing them 3 to 4 times a day. 3) Cool Magic Gel Sheets - by MPM Medical Inc. (Web Site: www.mpmmedicalinc.com) Phone: 1-800-232-5512. I have had 2 different sizes, 3 3/4\" x 3 3/4\" and 6\" x 8\". They can be left on up to 3 days, but I had to change mine daily. If these items only help 1 person, then it was worth the time to share them. I am also a Registered Nurse, 30 years in June, but it is quite different when YOU are the patient. PLEASE contact me if there are ANY questions I can answer for you. Jeanie    ",

Thank you for sharing your care during your radiation treatments. I was instructed also by my radiation oncologist, and used: Banana Boat Aloe Vera Gel 4x day from the start of my radiation treatments, which I did. I want everyone to know that MOST patients do not have severe radiation burns that I had. My problem with the radiation burns was very much due to having such large breasts and folds in the tissues. I do not want my experience to hinder anyone from deciding to receive radiation treatments. I wanted to help obese patients such as myself, if they find themselves experiencing these same issues, where they can seek treatment.  ",

I am 73 years young, living with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) and on oxygen 24/7.   Seven years ago I had a double mastectomy.  The cancer was only in the right breast but it opted to have both removed.  All the lymph nodes under the right arm were removed and all free of cancer.   Fortunately I did not suffer with lymphedema of that arm but do have a problem under the arm in the area of the surgery.   It is tender all the time to the extent that seams in clothing irritate me.   Also when I try to exervise that arm it feels as if something is pulling when I extend the arm up.    I have checked and despite the fact that it feels \"raw\", there is not a mark to be seen.     I also have arthritis in both shoulders and between the arthritis and this \"whatever\" under the right arm, I am not able to do much.     I am interested in finding out if anyone else has had this problem. I  appreciate any help that might be offered.   Thank you so much and everyone have a blessed day :-). Joan Hi! My suggestion, from past experience, is to ask your physician for an (OT), Occupational Therapy Consult. They will then evaluate you, and if it is something they can help you with, or suggest another modality. The OT therapist was extremely helpful to me, in a similar situation. I know everyone is not the same, but it is certainly worth a try. Best of Luck to you, Jeanie  ",
