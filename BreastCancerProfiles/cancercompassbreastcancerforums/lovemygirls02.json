      "Content": "Hello, my name is Michelle and I am a 42 year old married mother of two one almost eight and one almost two.  I originally had breast cancer in 2004 and it has come back in may of 2007.   I chose alternative treatment up until my last scan in October where it has spread all over including my liver and lungs.  I am getting chemotherapy once a week Taxol and once a month  I get Aredia.  I get treatments every Tuesday and I am doing well with them.  I would love to hear from anyone who has had success in shrinking cancer in liver and lungs.I just finished my fifth chemo treatment last Tuesday.
