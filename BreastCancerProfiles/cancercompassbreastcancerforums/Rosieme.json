      "Content": "Please let's be responsible in our answers to others; your experience may not be mine. There is also no way to predict how any one person will react to treatments. Radiation was a breeze for me, but then I think the radiologist I had was exceptional! He listened to all my complaints seriously, and never once suggested that treatment had nothing to do with what I was experiencing! In fact, after complaining to my Oncologist for months that chemo (Taxol to be exact) was making me Very sick, more than I thought I should have been feeling, my radiologist took me seriously and found an 8cm abcess in my lung - he in fact saved my life. My Oncologist insisted it was unheard of and that at their hospital (Sloan Kettering) they hadn't seen this in 25 years. I changed Oncologists! To say the only reaction you will have is this or that is to deny that people have strong reactions, while others have none from the same treatment. Arimidex made me so sick, the pain in my joints crippled me taking almost a year to recover from. I changed to Tamoxifen and I haven't had any strong reactions to it, but I also haven't been symptom free. The symptoms for me are tolerablem while for someone else they might not be. I find it difficult to clean the house, unless I am almost in the nude, because I am soaked by the time i finish the task. I am very angry at the entertainers that stand up on stage with no hair, or climbed mountains suggesting that you need to get through the treatments with a positive attitude, and then you too will go back to your old life and can even climb mountains. No one(other than on these message boards) reports the symptoms that stop them from leading the life they once had. Doctors are too quick to say well you aren't getting any younger, except it wasn't until going through all these treatments that any of these symptoms. were present. It is difficult with some symptoms to explain to another how things have changed - since on Tamoxifin I feel more sensitive. Other symptoms like the numbness in my fingers and toes from the Taxol and and numbness under my arm and in the upper part of my arm from surgery, have been more problematic. Tired all the time is the worst of all the symptoms. Yes some people climb moutains, and some people aren't as lucky. Ask every question you have to as many people as you want, until you get an answer that satisfies you! No question is too small! Don't let anyone tell say you will breeze through anything just because they did, or that you will just have some hot flashes. It is very important that we start to support one another and as a united group educate the medical community that vague responses and telling us we aren't getting younger, or it has nothing to do with treatment just will not be tolerated! One good question was asked here, what scares you about the radiation, no one can be helpful without understanding what your fears are. I understand your fears may be very vague that it is hard to explain. Try sitting down and writing every emotion that comes to your mind when you think of radiation, and perhaps that will spark a question about your fears - if the fears aren't clear to you yet. Here is were everyone says, but you are alive! That is the best news, but quality of life is also important! To be guilted into feeling you shouldn't complain, is rubbish! Pain, inability to do simple household chores etc. are not as bad as being dead, but they aren't to be pushed to the side as not important! You are lucky, you are alive, and of course we are all thankful for that - being alive, we also want to enjoy the simple things in life. We are anything but prepared for what we may not have after they finish saving our lives and that causes a great deal of emotional pain. I wish you the very best!!!!!!!! I wish us all the very best!!!!!! Remember, if we don't stand tall and united we will be alone - together we have real strength!",

      "Content": "Hi Deborah! My name is Ricki! I too am post treatment for breast cancer, with many complications from all the treatments, making it difficult not to think about my situation, since my toes are numb and hurt (try that), I drop things all the time, since my fingers are also numb (I actually made a typo and wrote dumb, instead of numb). I m telling you some of my symptoms just to say it is next to impossible not to think! How long ago did you take anti-depressants. There are so many on the market now that increase your serotonin level. Serotonin helps to increase everyone's sense of well being. It is a natural substance in your body. In essence, you shouldn't even know you are taking it, except when you notice you get through some difficult moment that you know would have been very difficult to deal with in the past. Serotonin drugs are all a little different. Some can make you a little sleepy and others can make you a little hyper, but usually people find one that works for them. It does not make you feel numb or as if you have no feelings. I used to be very anti-drugs, I have reconsidered and find that I actually can better deal with my feelings when my feelings aren't out of control. Another drug that can be very helpful are anti-anxiety medication -used only when needed. It allows one to be calm enough to think things through without fogging your thoughts. It is up to you, and I am not telling you you should be taking any medication! You need to do what feels right to you! I am sharing my experience, knowing that anti-depressants should not make you feel numb! I am sorry this is so much more difficult for you! It is hard enough to handle ones illness without also having to worry about bringing in money and making sure you have coverage! Think about the possibilities of other treatments such as accupucture, hypnosis etc. as ways to control some of your feelings of anxiety,if you don't want to use medication. I hate to see you suffer more than you have to! I wish you the very best! I hope that you can find some peace, it is the least you deserve!",
