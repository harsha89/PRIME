      "Content": "Hi. I found PRMA because I live in Texas. I was going to look into the place in New Orleans but since this one was so close I looked into it. I was extremely happy with my choice. Dr. Nastala was my doctor. I had a double mastectomy and DIEP Flap surgery. I am a higher BMI (37) and this was a huge success. I had no issues. The staff and hospital were excellent. I highley recommend PRMA.",
