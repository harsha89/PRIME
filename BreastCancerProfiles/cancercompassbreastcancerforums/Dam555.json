      "Content": "my wife, 45yo was diagnosed with MBC the end of January, the tumors er very ER+ and for two months were shrinking. This week we were stunned to find that the liver tumors that had shrunk had greatly increased. Our Oncologist is unable to get us in an Avastin trial even though he was one of the pioneers in its use in breast cancers. He has enrolled us in a Phase1 Study with Sutent and Taxol. Sutent is supposed to work very much like Avastin and has beeb a miracle in Renal and certain resistant GI cancers. Can anyone tell me more about Sutent and it's effect on breast cancer by it's self. Thanks, Don",
