      "Content": "Hi Talk to your Doctor. I had a recurrence on same side and I was told that if I was going to have it again, the same side is the best place, as it has not spread. It just meant for me that they did not get all the cancer cells at the time of the operation. I go for regular check ups and my general health is good. The Doctor is the only one who can give you the answer. Good Luck Yvonne",

      "Content": "Hi I am sorry to hear of your news, but by no means give up. I had stage III breast cancer 5 years ago and had a recurrance last year. I am hopeful that it is finally gone and I take Arimidex every day. I go for check ups every 3 months, which sometimes includes various scans. I am in good health other than that and I lead a normal life. Be positive & supportive for your Mother. Sometimes treatment can be uncomfortable but do what the Doctors tell you, ask them questions, if you want to know more. The doctors are the only ones who can give you the advice for your particular case. Everyone is different and what may have been experienced by someone else does not mean that the same thing will happen to your Mother. What I learn't is that there are different types of cancer and different treatments/responses within the topic of breast cancer. On a personal level set yourself & your Mother goals and if you do not achieve them - look at the fun you have trying. I ride horses and take part in local dressage competitions. I am by no means a good rider and sometimes I look at the younger people and think I am quite mad for trying - but I enjoy it, I don't care what people think, I am alive to enjoy, I probably have a greater appreciation of life than they do. Don't think about how much time is left, that way you will lose it. Plan your holidays, days out etc, live for today & tomorrow, don't hang about waiting for something to happen, get out there and defy all - LIVE. Good luck in your journey with your Mother, I am sure it will all turn out OK.",
