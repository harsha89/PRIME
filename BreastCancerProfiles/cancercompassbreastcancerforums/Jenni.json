    "Content": "I have been having pomidrinate drips every three months for osteoporosis caused by a complete hysteromectomy at age 32 to elimate estrogen to reduce chances of recurring breast cancer - estrogen positive. My doctor specifically said that my drip was to take THREE HOURS, and it always has. Yesterday, the nurse accidently fed the drip too fast and it took less than ONE HOUR. She admitted her mistake and apologized, but would not say what kind of side effects may occur because of the speed drip. I feel AWFUL today. Do I need to get a urine test to see if my kidneys have been damaged? Do I need to tell my doctor? Any advice?",
