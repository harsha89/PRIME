      "Content": "I am a stage IV with metastistis to my lungs.  The oncologist told me to go ahead and try whatever I want.  I also am HER-2 positive and Herceptin resistant. I have just started on Escozine, a blue scorpion venom.  See Medolife.com .  It is totally natural but is currently seeking FDA approval here in the US and a patent is currently pending.  After two weeks, I have 3 flags removed from my blood work and my WBC have come up .3 points.  This is the first sign of anything positive I have had for over two years. I am on disability so I was blessed to have several people come to me to sponsor my venom payment since insurance doesn't cover it.  I also checked it out very well and could not find any negative statistical information anywhere.  So far I'm a believer!  Good Luck and God Bless.  ",
