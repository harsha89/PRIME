    "Content": "I wanted to respond to your message because I too was in a similar situation. I felt so overwhelmed and didn't know anyone else that had gone through what I was doing. My father was diagnosed with Small Cell Lung Cancer in March of 2002, the same day my grandmother died! It was advanced when they found it. He went through very harsh chemo and radiation (also preventative radiation to the brain). He had his ups and downs but had a strong spirit and wanted to fight it all. In the meantime, my mother who was always the one taking care of her mother, my dad and everyone else was diagnosed with primary liver cancer in January of 2003. Surgery wasn't an option because of how much of her liver was affected. Tried chemo ablation but it was too harsh. While all this was going on, my dad went into \"remission\" for about 2 months, but by March it had metastisized and he starting going through chemo again. My mom only lived for 4 months and died on my son's 11th birthday. It was such a helpless feeling to watch her go that fast! I was devastated! While all this was going on I had to go part-time with my job to help with my parents and eventually didn't work at all when my mom died, because my sister and I were the ones taking care of my dad. My mom had hospice for only 2 weeks. My dad did o.k. but went through one chemo drug after another and it kept spreading. 6 weeks after my mom died, my 45 year old sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer! She is divorced and lives out of town, but I was trying to go there when she would get her chemo (every 3 weeks) to help out with her kids etc. Talk about a nightmare. I have 2 kids of my own and the emotional, financial, and daily stress was insane. My dad then died 1 year after my mom in July of 2004. My sister and I had to hire help so someone could be with him 24 hrs a day. Between the 2 of us we took shifts with the nurses so we were there everyday. He lived 2 1/2 years, partly due to the fact that he felt he was going to \"beat it\" and didn't want to leave us alone after the death of my mother...my mom and dad BOTH died at age 70 years 7 months to the day of their birthdays. They even died at the same time in the afternoon. Really a coincidence huh? My mom's death was just shocking since she was the vibrant one, never smoked,drank, always lived a healthly clean life. My dad was living on borrowed time, because all the dr's said they gave him 9 mos. to a year to live and with sc lung cancer he was a fighter to live 2 1/2 years. All of this has changed my entire life and now my sister is in remission, but I continually wonder what will happen to her and don't know if I could bear another cancer death in my family, not to mention my own health and feel that a cancer diagnosis is inevitable! I know about your feelings of anger, depression and why me? I can't wait to ask God why he chose to have both parents and a sister have cancer at the same time! Why did everyone have to die from cancer??? I continually am in shock over having to deal with all this in my 30's when all my friends will be dealing with this when they're in their 60's!!! I feel like our family life was robbed of having the grandparents around to be with the children and I feel permanently changed. My outlook on life is definitely different now! You do end up NOT taking life for granted but it is a bittersweet lesson for sure. Please contact me if you want to talk more. I found it very difficult to find anyone that understands and has gone through the same ordeal. I can only hope with time some of the pain will heal.",
