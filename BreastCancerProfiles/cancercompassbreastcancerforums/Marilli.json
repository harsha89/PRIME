      "Content": " This is from  a newsletter I got from  Cancer Compass  - here it is:Study Finds Sugar Supports Metastasis May 8, 2007 SAN DIEGO -- U.S. scientists have discovered targeting a sugar that supports blood vessel growth might inhibit cancer. In a study that could point to new therapies to prevent metastasis, University of California-San Diego researchers note solid tumors need a network of blood vessels, or vasculature, to metastasize. The researchers, led by Professor Jeffrey Esko, discovered modifying the action of heparan sulfate uniquely impacted the tumor vasculature, and in doing so, altered the growth rate of tumors prepared from lung carcinoma cells in mice. \"An important finding was that, not only could we inhibit the growth of tumors in these mice, but that other systems that rely on endothelial growth, such as the reproductive system and wound healing, remained robust,\" said Dr. Mark Fuster, the study's first author. \"If novel drugs can be developed to target tumor heparan sulfate, we might be able to make a leap in cancer-fighting therapies ...\" The findings are published in the current on-line issue of the Journal of Cell Biology.
