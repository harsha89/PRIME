    "Content": "Hi everyone, I found this site accidentally when googling change in body odor and cancer. I had a ct scan done and they found my right ovary is 3 x's bigger than it should be and I have nodules on it ranging in different sizes. I'm scheduled for a pelvic ultrasound at the end of this month. But the reason I'm writing this is that I have had a change in my body odor. I noticed it a couple of weeks ago. I haven't changed anything that I use in terms of laundry detergent, soap or deodorant. I'm nervous about being diagnosed with ovarian cancer and checked to see if there is a connection between cancer and body odor or change in urination because that's also changed. Reading what everyone has said about this change in the body makes me feel like there may be a possible cancer diagnosis in my future. It makes me feel better, like I'm not crazy, that there are other people experiencing the same thing as me. I wish you all the best in your recovery from this ugly menace called cancer..",
