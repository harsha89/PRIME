A small tumor grew along my incision after my mastectomy and from there it broke out on my skin when the mastectomy had taken place, it was little red marks that looked like little pimples.  That was 2 years ago, had radiation and different kinds of chemo for the past year but nothing really getting rid of it.  It is very burny and itchy.  ",
