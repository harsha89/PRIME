I also have a very large seroma in that breast.  They have drained fluid out of it several times....  As you say, all of this is a small price to pay for our life.....  I am mostly concerned about the redness of the surgery area and the warmness....   ",

I took it less than three months and I could not get out of bed in the mornings, my hands were like claws, my feet hurt so bad that I had a hard time walking.  My bones all hurt so bad...  My doctor told me I was so wrong not to take it, but I had to quit or I would of been in a wheel chair... It was pure poison to me.  Now after several years, I have several autoimmune diseases and I was told that they could be from taking the arimidex.   ",

I cannot get it to clear up.   My doctor said that it is a yeast infection, but nothing will clear it up...  Has anyone else ever had this happen?   I need help and I am not sure where to turn...  Please help me...",

I blame it all on the radiation burns. Yes, I had it five days a week.  The last seven were extra strong ones.   The sad is, I was dumb, I knew nothing about cancer, radiation or anything like this.  I would strongly recomend anyone going through cancer, to do a lot of research before making a final decision on your treatments.",
