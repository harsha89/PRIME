    "Content": "My name is Cherie and I have been diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma.   After a lumpectomy on September 7th of a supposedly benign tumor, my surgeon said, \u201cWe have no idea what this is\u201d and sent a sample to  Vanderbilt University. The tumor was, in fact, not benign, but a malignant. The pathology report included a diagnosis of metaplastic breast cancer. I searched for a pathologist to verify the diagnosis, and Dr. Paul Rosen in New York agreed to analyze a sample. He confirmed the diagnosis, and I have been pursuing treatment options since receiving his confirmation at the beginning of October.   So far, I have had a PET scan and met with an oncologist and a plastic surgeon. The PET scan indicates that the cancer might have spread to my lungs. The oncologist recommends a radical mastectomy, followed by 24 weeks of chemotherapy, approximately 3 times per week, and 7 weeks of daily radiation. Surgery hasn\u2019t been scheduled, and no plan for pursuing these treatments has been made. Despite this, I am being proactive about learning what I can and being vigilant about getting responses and information from the medical community.   I have an appointment with a team of 3 doctors on October 28th. I\u2019ll be meeting with an oncologist, a surgeon, and a radiologist at that time. I hope these doctors recommend a treatment plan that we can implement soon, which could be completely different from the one I outlined above, and give me a prognosis. So far, doctors have told me very little, and I only know as much as I do about this disease because of the information I\u2019ve found on my own.   I will continue to share any information I learn, in the hopes that it will benefit others. I live alone and am disabled . I have 2 daughters, both of whom live in different towns and are trying to help me.   No doctors want to talk to me because they are trying to study this disease because they have no information and are researching it. It feels like they are intimidated by it. I\u2019ve had the lump 4-5 years and have been misdiagnosed, so I know I am limited with time.",
