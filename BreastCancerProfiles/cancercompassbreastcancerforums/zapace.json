    "Content": "Fortunately, my biopsy was benign. This is the only board that I find where I can post my question.  I had this procedure one month ago and during the past two weeks whenever I make a quick turn in a certain direction, I have a pain.  A friend of mine told me that I had scar tissue.  Is this something that goes away in time.  I plan to contact my physician, but it would put my mind to rest if I knew something about this.  I cannot find any information to help me.  I hope that this is an appropriate place to submit my post.",
