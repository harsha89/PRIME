    "Content": "I dont think you are crazy at all. I am in a very similar dilemma, its is wrecking havock with me internally, cause my gut is telling me something aint right at all, and two specialists refuse to do a biopsy of the tissue to be sure. I am backed into a corner,,,,I demanded a biopsy, I am 37, still breastfeeding my 3 year old girl. I have a lumpy/dimpled area under my left breast, and it shows up on CT scan. But 2 mammograms and ultrasounds are inconclusive and say it looks normal. Yet they can feel it, and it causes chest pain. I cannot have an MRI cause of my pacemaker. And to make me more anxious, there is breast cancer in my family. So I feel defeated, and have to accept what the specialists say,,he plainly told me the other week, that he can almost guarentee me I dont have breast cancer........I was boiling, I could have punched him, cause he cannot say that for sure....do they think they are GOD or something>>I wish you luck,, and hope you are ok. and find the help you deserve. I cannot believe what I am going through with this, I just cannot believe they take that risk.....",
