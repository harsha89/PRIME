    "Content": "I am sorry that you are feeling so worried about your current problem.  Having close relatives with symptoms like your own are reason enough to be worried, & most people would be. although my breast issues were a little different to yours, I know what it is like to have been basically brushed aside when seeking reasons for your concerns.  Can I suggest that if possible, is there another GP you could possibly try to see.  sometimes a different person may take your concerns on board a little differently & may offer you something different to ease your mind. My initial GP told me that the lump i was feeling was nothing more than dense tissue-not the 1.9cm that was found 3 months later when I had seen another GP who followed through with my concerns & had tests ordered, & didnt question the thought of something more sinister although I was only just 32 at the time. If you doubt a Drs decision, always feel free to seek a second opinion.  I did & it no doubt saved my life as it was 10 years ago since my first cancer.  Just a thought..",
