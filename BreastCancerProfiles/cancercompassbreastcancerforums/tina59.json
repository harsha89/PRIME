    "Content": "Hi Dgirl, Sorry to hear about your mum. You ask if there are any stage IV breast cancer survivors through alternative treatments. Yes, I am one... When diagnosed, I had the primary tumor surgically removed, and decided to say no to chemo and radiation (diffcult decision, but I couldn't do it to my body). I went to an alternative clinic in Denmark, where I received a non-toxic treatment called oncothermia on my metastases along with mistletoe injections and various alternative biological treatments (Rehatron, hyperphoton), and was taught how to eat food which has healing properties. Today I take only Low Dose Naltrexone, mistletoe injections and alpha lipoic acid. I have turned 90% vegetarian. I exercise daily. Most of my metastases are gone now, my tumor marker CA-15-3 is normal, I feel terrific, and I thank the Universe! I would always encourage other patients to take charge and go the alternative route. I can recommend Janet Plant's books. Tina Â ",
