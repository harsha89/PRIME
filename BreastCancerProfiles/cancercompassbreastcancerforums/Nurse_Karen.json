    "Content": "I am an oncology nurse and nurse educator who developed primary peritoneal cancer last year.  I went through chemotherapy and it caused all my hair to fall out.  I can tell you that when I was faced with this one year ago, I ordered a very nice synthetic wig from Germany.  It was worth every penny I paid for it ($495) - it had a  lightweight mesh  base, was extremely easy to take care of, and nice style.  As my hair started falling out, I had my head shaved.  It was something that I felt I was in control of and did not have to suffer watching clumps of hair fall out in my pillow and sink. I was very self conscious about it but went on and produced a educational DVD for my nursing students wearing my wig.   I understand how important hair is to a person's self esteem and pray that I won't lose it again.  My hair came back in 2 shades of gray (it wasn't before) but that can always be changed.  It took 8 months for my hair to grow back to a comfortable length, but I took off my wig 5 months after the chemo ended.   Good luck with your treatment - just remember that you are a beautiful person.  ",
