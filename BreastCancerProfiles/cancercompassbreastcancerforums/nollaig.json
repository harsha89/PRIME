    "Content": "Hello, I used 99.9% Aloe Vera Gel immediately after radiation and after a shower etc.  My skin did get red towards the end of treatment but I did not experience any pain.  It is now 6 months since I ended treatment (30) and my skin is soft and normal and all pigmentation is gone.  I too was treated for left breast cancer.",
