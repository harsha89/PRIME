    "Content": "I'm having 1st surgery for invasive ductal carcinoma tomarrow.  I have had a spinal fusion 8 yrs. ago and have a \"pain specialist\" prescribe pain relief since.  I'm maintaining a 150 mg. doseage of morphine per day for 1 yr.  Since my diagnosis/which now includes bone met.  I have been told I will not get any more pain relief meds.  The pain in my hip and ribs has come to crawling to the toilet, screaming in agony, and the urge to take every old rx in the house.  My \"pain specialist\" the minute he found out about the cancer literally turned me over to the \"other doc's\".  The cancer doc's don't seem to hear that the pain is almost too much to take.  \"Your doseage of daily morphine should be adequate\".  Who are they kidding?  They aren't the ones who can't take a step because of the pain in my hip or the horse kicking me in the ribs when I breathe too deep.  If this is going to get worse I suppose I WILL find a way to get \"illegal\" drugs.  Is there an answer?  Where does one turn?  I took alot of pain meds after my back surgery but took myself off them when I felt I could handle the pain.  Believe me it was not an easy thing to do but felt  the effects of the drugs were worse than the pain.  I stayed off all pain meds for over 1 1/2 years until I blew another disc under my fusion.  I'm so afraid that it will get worse,  read about bone metastis and can look forward to very little help from them.  Someone please help.",
