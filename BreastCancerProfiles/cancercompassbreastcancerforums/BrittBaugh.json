      "Content": "Hi Karen, I live 5 hours away which isn't ideal for this time but i'm hoping i will be able to work with my boss so i can travel home on weekends. Luckily she has great friends and my dad has been wonderful through this all. I told her she's taken care of me for 24 years - the least i can do is take care of her :) She hasn't started any treatments yet - she leaves tomorrow for MD Anderson. They want her to be there for a full week, so i'm sure when she returns home we will know what to do. Thank you for leading me in the direct of the Susan G. Komen Forums - i will for sure be looking into those. Thank You very much for the prayers. Sincerely, Brittany",

      "Content": "While i was home for Christmas we recieved a call from the doctor - my mom was diagnosed with Stage IV Breast Cancer. It's spread to her bones (spine, upper arms, collar bone, pelvis) and her liver. We had no clue...she had been sick since the summer - started with the small town doctor and he passed her on through the chain. She lost 15 lbs, had fevers for a month straight, and hurt all over. But noone could figure it out. They just knew something was wrong. Finally the kidney specialist sent her to the breast surgeron and that is who finally figured it out. This is still all new and i've been reading about it as much as I can. I don't know what I need to do to help her. I live 5 hours away and want to be there as much as possible. She hasn't started any treatment as of now and is still working. (she's a high school science teacher). The good news is she got into MD Anderson in TX and leaves on Jan 12th for her initial appt. What can I do as a daughter for her? My dad who is ubber stressed, and my two younger brothers? It's hard imagining my life without my mom and any inspiration would be great.",
