    "Content": "To babyboomer1977, I am presently stage 4 with metastatic breast cancer to the bones.  I was on Tomaxafin for about three years, when I was rediagnosed with breast cancer to the bone, and also went from HER2- to HER2+.  I tried Arimidex, and could not tolerate it at all.  However, I am now taking Femara, and able to tolerate this very well, with the only side effect I notice is weight gain.  Thank goodness for stretch pants.  I went from refusing chemo in 09' because I didn't want to loose my long hair, to being bald and gratefull to be alive.  Try listening to meditation frequencies, available on You Tube, Delta and 528 are the ones I like best.)  Be positive, your mind is a powerful healing agent.  Whatever life has in store for each of us, live your life, don't just survive.  I was told by one doctor (whom I no longer see) back in Sept.2012 that my cancer is incurable and I am going to die.  I had been in intensive care for 7 days and the cancer center for 5 more.  He told me to go home and get my things in order.  The day after I came home I got my pantry in order by going grocery shopping with my son.  It is 7 months since that day, and yes some days are not very productive.  I write a lot of poems, and paint with water colors.  What has been taken away from me in my previous enjoyable activities, has opened up new opportunities to expand and appreciate.  If I were you, I would ask to try another monocolodial med.  There are new medications coming out all the time, so be positive, no matter what your future holds, for eveyday is anewday.  ",
