    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 1 year now.  I do not have \"bone\" pain but I am not sure what that is.  I got some bad fish and quit taking my coctail of vitamins for 4 days and my hands hurt like crazy.  Felt like my tendons were on fire.  I went right back on my vitamin coctail adn within a week my hands no longer hurt.  If any one wants what I take I will be happy to tell you, I just have to go and look at my bottles.  I got the vitamin idea from breastcancer.org people.   However I am so tired all the time.  I get up do some chores and after 3 hours I need a nap! I nap and I am still tired.  Anyone know a remedy for this?    I have a woman I know who's husband was an oncologist she had lobular like me and has lived 18 years.  Her husband says that the tamoxifin and arimidex kept her going along with other chemo drugs.  Sadly she is now dying but she had 18 years got to see her grandchildren.  ",
