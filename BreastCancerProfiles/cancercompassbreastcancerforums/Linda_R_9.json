    "Content": "I have read your reply and am very interested in your recommendation of an ND. I have completed chemo and last week antibody (maintenance) IVs since the cancer is incurable. Next check up is in mid-July. Since the cancer is in my lymph system I feel very strongly about nutrition, supplements, etc. but am having a hard time finding a regimen -- there is so much info and so many supplements I can decide what is best for me. My question would be how to go about finding a doctor I can trust and feel he is doing best for me? Congratulations and continued good health to you. Linda",
