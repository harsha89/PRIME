    "Content": " About the CT scan you are referring to: Did your doctor give you a PT  or pet scan before doing surgery?  This scan goes over all of your body to scanning for cancer elsewhere in the body.  My oncologist wouldn't proceed without it being done.  It is fairly expensive, but well worth it.  It is also a fairly new machine.  I also had a lumpectomy that had not reached the nodes yet.  Every time I have a new pain I wonder if the cancer has spread. I am 51.  I have had cysts all of my adult life.  I did take hormone therapy and I am hormone possative taking Femara.  I recently went in for a colonoscopy and had two polyps removed. It is not that I want my history out there but if it will help..........  clynnof",
