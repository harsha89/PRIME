    "Content": "Hi. I'm sorry to hear about what your going through. My sisters and I just went through this. My mom had breast cancer in 2007. She was cancer free until 2014 where it spread to her pituitary gland. She had surgury and spread to moe parts of her brain. She just passed away in February at 55 yrs old. But her cancer although spread to her brain was actually still breast cancer because that's where it originated from. But back in October 2015 when Drs told us nothing else they can do it tore our hearts. Just be strong for your mom. That's all you can do. Enjoy your time with her.",
