      "Content": "Lee Ann ~ My wife, Diane, had stage 3 IBC determined approx. 3 years ago. Over a 3-month time period, we worked with a ND in Texas. 3 months later, the tumor changed its pattern of development, and was threatening to erupt through the surface of her breast. Now in a \"crisis management\" situation, she had a MRM and entered into the chemo/radiation protocol. During the intervening 3-month period, however, the advice and products from Gary resulted in the cancer being downgraded to a stage 2 intraductal carcinoma at time of surgery. We are now in contact with Gary again, since her cancer has metastasized twice since then. I just connected with this site, and will be checking with CTCA to determine if they have any experience with what he has proposed for use now. The primary product he has recommended is Poly-MVA (plus some supplements). From what I have gathered in my research, this is a product which is classified as an LAPD. I don't have all my notes with me, so I can't explain what the acronym stands for. However, there are some websites that have proven informative to me. I haven't received any info yet from CTCA, as to whether they have any experience with this, or other products in this category. I believe there is effective help to help beat this. From what Diane tells me, the most important aspect to her battle has been my continued support. If my experience is any indication, you also have a battle ahead of you; but it is worth fighting. We're still fighting, and I'll be including you and yours in our prayers. Hope this helps a bit. Lew (& Diane) W.",
