      "Content": "I am 50 y/o woman.  Family Hx of breast cancer.  4 yrs ago had microcalcifications, grouped, in my mammo...told to repeat in 6 months.  4 yrs later, no I did not f/u as I should have, I have felt thickening in my breasts, and little nodules.  I also have a weird, different, body odor.  Went today for mammo screening.  I looked at the pics, they are white, severely dense tissue.  Still awaiting report, but how could they see anything with such dense breast tissue?  No matter what the report says, I am going to want additional studies done.  What do you recommend. Thanks for your input.",
