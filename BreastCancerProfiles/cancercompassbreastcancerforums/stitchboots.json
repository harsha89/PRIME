      "Content": "Hi, I am experiences something similar. I was diagnosed with breast cancer August 2013. I finished 12 months of different treatments October 2014. Last week I was sent by my oncologist to have blood tests and two ultrasounds. One on my thyroid and one on my pelvic area. Since January I have been swollen around my neck and collarbone and it is getting worse. It is also very itchy at times, so gets red too. I have been getting a few headaches too. I was feeling good in myself too and getting on with life, but I feel tired all the time and feel like I am going to get a cold, but it isn't a cold. I will see my oncologist Tuesday 14 April for all of my results. So hopefully everything is ok.",

Being positive, chin up and just take whatever you go through, one day at a time. It is scary, scary of the unknown. I went through twelve months of treatment, chemo, radiation and herceptin. Now on Tamoxifen for the last 18 months. I wish you all the best",

      "Content": "Hi, I was just wondering if anyone on here can help me. I was diagnosed with breast cancer Aug 2013. I finished 12 months of treatment October 2014. I have been taking tamoxifen for 13 months now. I went for a routine pelvic and vaginal probe ultrasound in April. Thickening showed up. I have been told that they are sure nothing like Cancer has shown up, but I have been referred to a gynaecologist. I have not had a period since October 2013 and have had spotting on and off since January. I know that I do not feel right and have discomfort in my abdominal area. Should I be worried. Has anyone else gone through the same thing",

I was watching it with my youngest daughter who was 13 at the time. At the time our girl cat was all of a sudden always sleeping in my daughter's room, very out of character and the boy cat always in my oldest daughter's room, same thing. The cats would suddenly not come anywhere near me. Until I started having chemo they stayed away.",
