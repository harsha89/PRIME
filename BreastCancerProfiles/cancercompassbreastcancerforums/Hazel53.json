      "Content": "Hello there. Sorry to hear about your hands and feet.  I took Femara for 4 months and have swollen hands. It is six weeks since stopping and I still have painful swollen fingers.  What I have found useful is wear woolen gloves to bed and keep hands warm.  The fluid in the hands have to go somewhere so I swing my arms around.  Found warm showers and warm water good at relieving some of the pain. Movement and warm are too.  I am looking for a cure too....",

      "Content": "Hello Marjen   I was on femara for 4 months and then the claw hands started.  Pills diddn't take the pain away so I stopped the Femara.  I sleep each night with wrist splints  on.  This allows me to sleep at night and there is slight discomfort in the morning.  One year later I still struggle with fine motor skills like doing up my bras and doing up necklaces.  The cold weather aggravates the condition. I decided not to take painkillers etc longterm because I haven't found them to be helpful.  I recommend the wrist splints when sleeping.  At least I get my sleep!  My hands hurt when I am driving too.   ",

I was on Femara for 4 months until I developed severe pain in fingers.  They swell up at night and in claw like position.  6 months later they are still sore.  I sleep with a proper ortho paedic wrist splint on both hands.  This minimizes the pain and allows me to sleep all night..... All the best to you.Mary",
