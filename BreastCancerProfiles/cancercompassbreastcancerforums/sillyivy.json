    "Content": "You know, if you go to the doctor, it may turn out that it is not breast cancer at all? Sometimes, if your breasts are still developing, some lumps can occur. But the white discharge and lumps on both breasts could be something else.   Please do go see the doctor. You can do this confidentially, without anybody knowing. And then, if worse comes, you can tell your family when you are ready. Plus, the earlier a disease is discovered, the better you can cure it.   Be strong. It will all be ok.",
