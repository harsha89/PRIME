      "Content": "I would like to alert everyone to some wonderful new technology that is going to help women of all ages, particularly women under 40, with early detection. The technology is FDA approved to \"Perform and Document the Clinical Breast Exam\" and it is up to four (4) times more sensitive that the human touch. Please support this fantastic new technology so we can all benefit from having a regular \"SureTouch\" exam. http://suretouch.com.au Many thanks for your kind support Jennifer     ",
