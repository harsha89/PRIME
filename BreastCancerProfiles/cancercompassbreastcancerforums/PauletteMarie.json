I was encouraged to have have my ovaries removed and a a masectony and had expanders put in. Its been 3 weeks and i stll can not use my arms and um in incredicle pain. I was on percocet the first week. My ps now doesnt want to prescribe pain meds n says i need to go to pain management but cant get in till march. I dont have an appt til feb 19 with my primary. The ps has been waiting on the ine nipple to determine uf its still a scab or necrotic. This has been weekly. I go to roswell cancer institutue and he wasnt my original ps as she had brojen her wrist 2 weeks prior. Each week Â i get new instructiond, different time ranges etc. My concern is i was very active, worj full time with kuds and niw i cant move. Im in tears everyday with amount of pain im in. I sleep only hours in and off, eat ince a day if i can keep it in me. All i can do is sit all day. The pain is incredicle as i have nothing to take. Is this normal or in my head?? I am goun to the er tonight. I need some relief even its for a few hours.",
