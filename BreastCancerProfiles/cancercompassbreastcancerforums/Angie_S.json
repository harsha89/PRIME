    "Content": "Hi Holly, it is not uncommon to experience depression and anxiety when facing cancer of any kind. It is perfectly normal. I do suggest you discuss these feelings with your physician and maybe they can refer you to a good support group as well as give you some medication to help you get through...You may note all you need is someone to talk to about this...Do it, don't go it alone...that will not be a good idea! Take care, God Bless and my prayers are with you...Sincerely, Angie",
