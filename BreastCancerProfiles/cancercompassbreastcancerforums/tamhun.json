      "Content": "Hi, I'm Tammy. 51 yrs old. Diagnosed9-07. Invasive lobular cancer. i.5 cn. No nodes. Lumpectomty and radiation. was put on tamoxifen . Developed a rash and awful side effects. (terrible mood swings, crying all the time, anxiety) they put me on arimidex with monthly lupron shots(pre menopausal) Not long after...bad joint pain, trigger finger in both thumbs and pinkies. I felt 80 years old.My hair got crappy, and so did my skin.And then, my insurance decided not to cover my arimidex. I went off of it for a month, and lo and behold...i could bend my thumb again!My oncologist sent me to a hand surgeon, who of course told me I needed surgery on both hands because they were already locked.I told him about the research that I read, and he basically told me that there are millions of women on arimidex, and the majority of people who have trigger finger are diabetic or obese, i'm neither, and he can kiss my butt.I'm truly thinking about stopping arimidex. My gut tells me that it's too new and the side effects just aren't worth it. I had a hysterectomy last year. How much estrogen can i have???Ladies....Our Drs arent listening to us! My internist agrees with me. arimidex causes bone loss, high blood pressure, inflammation...who knows what else! Phen Phen was all the rage until they found out it messed up your heart.I don't know, gals I think I'm done with this med.",

      "Content": "Â Hi, It was suggested by my oncologist that I have this test done. My insurance would cover some of it, but my part would be $1,000.00. Since I had so many other medical bills, i decided not to have it done. I asked the nurse if it would help me in any way, and she said no, but it would help your daughters. Since cancer is an issue in my family, I think it's a no brainer that they are at a higher risk than some others. It's ridiculous that they charge so much for a test. they should accept what the insurance pays and be happy.",
