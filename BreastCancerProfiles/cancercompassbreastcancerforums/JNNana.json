      "Content": "This past Friday went in for follow up from findings on annual mammogram. They did a diagnostic mammogram after a few images Dr. came in and explained the findings and their concerns.Â  He advised biopsy and took me over to the stereotactic biopsy room to show me the equipment they would use. One of my questions is should I stick with this smaller hospital for biopsy or should I go to where I would want to be seen if this has to go further than biopsy? Thanks",
