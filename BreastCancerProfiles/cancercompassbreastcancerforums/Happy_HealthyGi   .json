    "Content": "OMG I recommend this book to everyone and I post about it everywhere. I loved this book so much that I bought TEN copies to hand out to friends and family.  Wanna hear a scary 'Big Brother' story?? Last night I was up to 3 am posting messages on i village message boards about cancer support. I talk about this book and the book 'World without cancer, the story of b17, and I was quoting from Ty's book a LOT, I was a typing fool last night. I was trying so hard to get some of the TRUTH about cancer treatments out there, and this morning, I got an email from i village stating that my posts were deleted due to SPAM..yeah spam!! Oh and I was telling people about the web site cancertutor and a few people had posted 'scared and feeling alone' and I posted to them ( there is no way to send a private message, you have to post) I posed to them some info and my personal email address, I guess that is also considered 'spam' on there web site. How sad...or is that more scary than sad??  I wrote them back saying 'thank you for letting me know that big brother is alive and well'  My posts are very personal, they are not spam, in everyone I start out saying that I watched my mom battle cancer TWICE and in that time I have done a lot of cancer research.  Ok thanks for listening to me vent :)",
