There are a lot of imposters out there who don't know what their doing just to make money off of your illness. I see one in Charlotte, NC. He has my own regimen of diet & supplements. You could call him & ask about a referral in your location. His name is Dr. William Pearce, 704-225-3382 or consult CTCA for one. Combined medicine is becoming popular. I have been under the care of an ND for about a year for my stage 3 Breast Cancer and am doing absolutely wonderful. I also do follow up tests & examines with my oncologist. I have to avoid sugar, which keeps cancer cells growing. This includes pasta, breads...etc.  My supplements for Cancer keep it in remission. This doctor has a track record of patients being 10-20 years out, whereas traditional meds alone are 2-4 yrs. out. I figured what have I got to lose!! It wasn't easy making this decision, but am glad I did. I have lots info. on my illness & how far I have come in a year, but there's not room for all of it. I am a miracle, took chemo, 8 treatments,  but refused radiation. Have not regretted the decision either. Feel free to contact me. Hope everything turns out well for you.  Take care of yourself, would love to hear from you Beverly, (Tumor)    Hi Beverly, I am replying to an old message...I am wondering if you would still recommend Dr. Pearce or anyone else in the Charlotte, nc area for Vitamin C infusions for cancer Thank you Deborah",
