    "Content": "I don't know anything about inflammatory breast cancer but I went to the Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, IL for ductal cancer with invasion and it was the best experience of my life. I highly recommend CTCA for anyone with a cancer diagnosis. You can call the CTCA and talk to an oncology information specialist free, and then make a decision as to whether to take your mother there. If I read/hear of any info on inflammatory breast cancer, I'll pass it on. Good luck.",
