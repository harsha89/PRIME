      "Content": "In 2005 I had bilateral bc which included left breast with lympth node involvement and right breast with very small cancer site.  Had only chemo because I came down with diabetic neuropathy.  Too sick to have radiation.  This year came down with very small new cancer site in right breast.  Had three lumpectomies.  Am going to have radiation on new site.  Can anyone relate to multiple bc sites?  I am 77 years.Thanks!  shana",

      "Content": "Hi: I am 75 yrs. old in the New York City area with stage 2; considered healthy by doctors. It was suggested by a medical oncologist to have dose dense chemo and another medical oncologist to have ac or cmf. I am trying to make a decision at this time. Would appreciate those women over 60+ who are contemplating having dose dense chemo or have had it to write to me. Am interested in how you fared during that experience, how you handled side effects and if you are finished how do you feel now. Looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you. Shirley",
