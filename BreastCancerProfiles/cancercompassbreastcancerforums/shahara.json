My question to you is your cancer metastatic?  It's hard to tell by your statement.  If it's not metastatic you really need to consult another oncologist.  In treatment of cancer Always seek out more than one opinion.  As for AI Anastrozole the shelf life in your body on an active pill differs from the effects.  If you are not experiencing the symptoms and have developed new ones, You need to consult your DR.  However, damage caused by this drug with some of the effects are relieved in weeks or months.  However, bone and other issues can be a lifetime.  Some people come to a full peak of withdrawal which is the toughest in the first month.    Again see a Dr as cancer is not a sniffle or a common cold.",
