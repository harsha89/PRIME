      "Content": "Hi  A quick intro and history,  I live in Australia, im 40, diagnoses late Oct, lumpectomy plus sentinal node biopsy 26th Nov. 2nd operation to clear the margins 19th December and told on Friday all clear. Results 1.2mm low grade with no lymph involvement.  YAY!  Hormone receptive positive.     Suggested treatment, radiation and then Tamoxifen or obalation of ovaries and 5 years on aromadix (sp) maybe called different in the USA.  They have left the choice of chemo up to me.     My question to you wise ones is that my bc is only very weakly positive to estrogen and strongly postive to progesteron.  So I am confused as to why the drugs prescribed are aimed at lowering my estrogen levels.  Should they not be trying to lower my progesterone levels.  or am I confused about the whole thing.   ALSO with others experience would you be not having the chemo or would you go for the whoe shebang. Waiting responses in ancticipation. Lyn     ",

      "Content": "oncrx thanks for quick response.  This is exactly what im needing.  I had know idea that the meds are aimed at blocking receptors.  I wonder why the docs give me the impression they are trying to lower my estrogen levels then. would that be the aromadex(?sp) used post menopausal.   Also after reading other messages can anyone enlighten me on where to find info on  Glyconutrients!!!  and also very curious about a drug called Laetrille/Vit B17. Thanks again lyn  ",
