I developed SEVERE Radiation Burns, due to the fact of having such large breasts. I would like to share with all of you the best treatments I have found. I have 3 products that have really helped me in this long ordeal, that is still not over. 1) RadiaKlenz by the Carrington Company - Dermal Wound Cleanser. It is a spray bottle. 2) Domeboro Soaks - Aluminum Acetate Astringent Solution. I was doing them 3 to 4 times a day. 3) Cool Magic Gel Sheets - by MPM Medical Inc. (Web Site: www.mpmmedicalinc.com ) Phone: 1-800-232-5512. I have had 2 different sizes, 3 3/4\" x 3 3/4\" and 6\" x 8\". They can be left on up to 3 days, but I had to change mine daily. If these items only help 1 person, then it was worth the time to share them. I am also a Registered Nurse, 30 years in June, but it is quite different when YOU are the patient. PLEASE contact me if there are ANY questions I can answer for you. Jeanie     Thank you Jeanie.I am suffering with severe radiation burns for I to have large breasts. I will try your remedies. how long does it take to heal when it is 2nd, 3rd degree?",
