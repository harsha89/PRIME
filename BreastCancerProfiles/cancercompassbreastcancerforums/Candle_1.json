    "Content": "I was diagnosed in 2004 for breast cancer. I had a double mastectomy in July, 2004. They removed 18 lymph nodes and they were all clean. I underwent 3 rounds of Chemo and was diagnosed with breast cancer mets to bone in the neck. I underwent 28 rounds of radiation and was put on hormone therapy. I take a shot of Zolodex each month to shut down my ovaries and Tamoxifen to get the rest of it. I also am on Zometa to strengthen the bones. I went in for my routine Pet Scan and find that it is back. I'm open to any suggestions for options in treatment. I'm also looking for people who have been to Cancer Treament Centers of America and what their experience was. Has anyone used a Dr. Ketterl. The name was given to me by a Dr. My cancer is very aggressive and I need somebody to help me get aggressive back. I, like most peoples messages I've read, do not feel the doctors keep you very informed.",
