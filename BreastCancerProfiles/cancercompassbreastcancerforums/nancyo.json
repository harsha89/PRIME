    "Content": "My husband had a port put in a couple of months ago. It was an easy surgery and all went well for 2 rounds of chemo. Last week he was scheduled for a CT and we noticed a spot that looked infected. Sure enough, it was and had to be removed yesterday. Because of his type of chemo, they will put another in in a couple of weeks. My advice is to keep a good watch on it. It is going to be red, but if it changes at all or if you get a fever or shakey, call your doctor.  It is so much easier than an IV each time, and if you ask they will freeze or numb the spot and you won't feel them access it at all.  Good luck, stay positive.",
