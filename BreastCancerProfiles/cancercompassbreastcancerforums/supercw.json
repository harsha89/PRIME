      "Content": "I am reaching out in hopes that my story will inspire you. My stage iv diagnosis came in May of this year with no family history which came as a huge shock. It was even more shocking when my scans four months later revealed that I resolved it all! As an avid user of Snapchat I changed many women's opinions that the app is just for teens to sext each other and shared my entire story which you can now see as a quick video on YouTube. This is meant to inspire women I hope you can take a look and share. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBYpjVcj0aw&feature=yout Bless, cw",
