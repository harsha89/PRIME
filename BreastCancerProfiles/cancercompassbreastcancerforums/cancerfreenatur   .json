I have conquered my own breast cancer by building my immune system and removing parasites and toxins. It was a long process and took alot of work, but I have been extremely healthy the entire time. I suggest Dr. CLark's \"Cure for all CAncers\" and Dr. Shulze \"THe INcurables\". I would be happy to send you the story of what I have done. --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

I am 73 years young, living with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) and on oxygen 24/7.   Seven years ago I had a double mastectomy.  The cancer was only in the right breast but it opted to have both removed.  All the lymph nodes under the right arm were removed and all free of cancer.   Fortunately I did not suffer with lymphedema of that arm but do have a problem under the arm in the area of the surgery.   It is tender all the time to the extent that seams in clothing irritate me.   Also when I try to exervise that arm it feels as if something is pulling when I extend the arm up.    I have checked and despite the fact that it feels \"raw\", there is not a mark to be seen.     I also have arthritis in both shoulders and between the arthritis and this \"whatever\" under the right arm, I am not able to do much.     I am interested in finding out if anyone else has had this problem. I  appreciate any help that might be offered.   Thank you so much and everyone have a blessed day :-). Joan I would not let them give me a mastectomy, only a lumpectomy and would let them remove only the lymph nodes that were cancerous. There are lymph vessels just under the skin and others that are deep. Starting at the wrist and moving up the arm, light skin brushing with soap and water and a soft brush is very beneficial, as is light massage, (4 0z. pressure, check on a mail scale). For the deep vessels, exercise is good and there will be a pulling. Your body will grow new vessels with these two approaches.I would be happy to share my book showing what I do. --Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed.
