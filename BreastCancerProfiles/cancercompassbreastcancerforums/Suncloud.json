    "Content": "My sister lives in Pa. and had radiation twice a day for five days.  That was the first time I ever heard of it.  But my sister was a Stage 1 and she had that test that predicts (I don't know rate of accuracy) if it will come  back or not and it was so low that they didn't even consider chemotherapy...just hormone medication.  So far, so good.  What she won't do and I think should be done, is go for a consultation to one of the biggest institutions, dep on where you live:  Sloan Kettering in NY, Johns Hopkins in Md. Anderson in Texas...it's worth the running around for copies of your lab and xrays and the expense and the travel....On the other hand...maybe that's not what I would do....I would have double mastectomies knowing myself...I'd be paranoid that it would come back...    ",
