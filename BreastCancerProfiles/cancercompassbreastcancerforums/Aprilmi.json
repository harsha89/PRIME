      "Content": "I have the results of my mammo, it came back clear. Since my dr hasn't called about the results of my us I am guesing nothing showed up. I really don't have many options. I have an HMO so I'm pretty much stuck with my dr. If I want to see another dr I have to switch my pcp. Which is something I am considering, my dr is somewhere around 80 yrs old. But I am not sure what to do so I have't done anything. I guess I'm waiting to become so disfigured that someone has to order an MRI for me and figure out what is going on. The dimpling is \"growing\" (for lack of a better word\". But because it is located on the underside it is not obvious unless you know where to look and have adequete light. Right next to that is where you can \"see\" the lump. With my age and the location of it most likely it is benign so I am trying to be at peace with the waiting. But it's not easy. But I'm hanging in there. April",

      "Content": "I have a lump on my left breast that is visible. It is right off of a \"dimple\" that my dr said was \"nothing\". My under arm is also swollen. My question is I can SEE the lump, but I can't \"find\" it when I do an exam. Has anyone ever heard of this? I am unsure what to do since I can not feel it. I'm only 36. Should I wait a few months? By the way, had hyster so I do not experience monthly cycles anymore. Any advise would be greatly appreciated!! April",
