    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2B breast cancer in September 2009.  Had a lumpectomy and 14 lymph nodes removed.  Have had four rounds of adriamycin and cytoxin and 37 radiation treatments.  Finshed all that in March 2009. Have been on tamoxifen since March 2009. Have a lot joint pain, especially in my hips and legs as well as leg cramps. Also very swollen under my armpit and in my breast and down my side as well as very sore.  Doctor feels like it is from radiation.  Has anyone else out there had this problem?",
