      "Content": "6 months ago I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer related to Her-2 overexpression. I also had 3 small spots in my liver which were thought to be benign. I finished 16 rounds of chemo and am now on maintenance Herceptin every 3 weeks. I had another CT recently and the liver spots have gotten smaller. Now my Dr. thinks they are probably cancer. He will be getting a PET scan after my mastectomy next week to see if the liver spots are indeed cancerous. He said I will be on Herceptin indefinately now and may need other additional chemo. I wonder what my prognosis is now. Prior to the liver problem, my chance for remission was 75%. My oncologist thought that perhaps I wouldn't benefit from the mastectomy now. Does this mean that my prognosis is very poor? He wanted to focus on the liver right now....I wanted to get rid of the breast cancer as planned.....my surgery is in 5 days. Would a mastectomy now be futile?",

      "Content": "Dear Leah, Thank you for responding to my message concerning breast and liver cancer. I will also keep your mother in my prayers. Did she have another cancer first or was only the liver involved? I guess surgery for liver cancer is usually unsucessful per my oncologist and breast surgeon. I will be having a PET scan done within the next couple of weeks to confirm if it is truly cancer in the liver or something benign. If it is cancer, the doctor said I will need more chemo to put it into remission. Good luck, Terry",
