    "Content": "Hello, I am a stage IV breast cancer survivor, recently dignosed in March with a small chest wall tumor, on chemo since May only to take a PET scan in Oct that showed that it had spread to my liver. I was first diagnosed with breast cancer and had a lumpectomy in March of 2000. I was cancer free until Sept of 2002 when i had another malignant tumor removed from my neck (a lymph node). I remained cancer free until March of this year. I'm scared this time. It seemed easier when they could remove the cancer. Chemo was more \"bearable\" when I knew it was only for 6 months.The fact that my Dr says now I am to take chemo indefinitely suddenly seems to terrify me. Â I am a strong faith walker and truly believe in the healing powers of Jesus, so I am in constant prayer. God assures me that I don't have to be afraid and I reach for him everyday. I joined this group because I need to talk to someone who understands what I am feeling, because out of all the support I have, none of them have been thru this and can truly understand my pain, emotional or physical. Is there anyone out there who understands? If so please let's help each other find the Joy in the Lord and make each other laugh, because I don't want to cry anymore.",
