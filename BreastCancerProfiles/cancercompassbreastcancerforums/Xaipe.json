    "Content": "Hi: I am 46 years old and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 11/2003. Went through the surgery, rounds of chemo and radiation. Started on Arimidex, but in Aug 2005, CT scan showed spread to the liver. I am on Xeloda now and desperately trying to not get back on additional chemotherapies, since I had a rough time with them before.. Can anyone give me some insights as to the prognosis or other treatments (even interested in alternative medicine)... Thanks so much...",
