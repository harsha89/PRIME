    "Content": "Hello Elaine, I read your post and could relate to just about all of it. I had a double mastectomy April 19 and from everybody says, I am doing wonderful and they couldn't tell looking at me that I had that done.  I had cancer in my right breast and decided I wanted to have both removed for precautions.  I haven't experienced as much pain from the surgery itself, as much as I have having the tissue extenders in.  Like you, I have a very strong belief and faith in Christ, and it has only been thru Him that I feel that I have done so well in the recovery.  Besides feeling the discomfort from the tissue extenders, I do have a pain in the right arm when I stretch it out. They took lymphnodes to check, so I am thinking that is why the arm is that way. I have found that it helps stretching it while in the shower.  I, too, am a grandmother of  a 6 year old and it breaks my heart not being able to play ball with him right now. But,... Please take care in your recovery and God Bless you. Deb H.  ",
