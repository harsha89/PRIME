    "Content": "This may be a bit long. I have dense breast tissue.  I found a lump in my left breast very close to my armpit. Saw my primary care doc who couldn't feel it even though my husband can. He ordered an ultrasound which was negative but the radiologist wanted me to have a diagnostic mammo since I was due in for one in Feb. Also negative. My mother and sister both diagnosed with with breast cancer at 60. I'm 58. I've had 2 breast biopsies for suspicious sites in right breast and one benign tumor in left removed 15 years ago. I've made an appt. with breast surgeon for second opinion. Anything else I should be doing? ",
