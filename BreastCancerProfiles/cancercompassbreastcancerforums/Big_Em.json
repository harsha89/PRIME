Thanks I just started chemo yesterday, one of the drugs was Taxol, and the other one is carboplatin.  I will let you know if I feel any pain from it.  I hope you start feeling better soon. Thanks   I received Taxol, Carboplatin,( I think 8 treatments) plus 30 some radiation treatment  for stage 3A lung cancer.  Am now on Tarceva (a maintenenace druge) for a year which should end sometime around mid-June.  I started having neuropathy in my feet (a tingling, numbness) almost from the beginning of treatments.  Continues to get worse and is  now in my hands.  All fingers are numb and extreme pain when palms of fingers are suddenly bumped against something.  Discomfort is so bad in my feet at night that interrupts my sleep.  Am on two medications for this condition.  Neurontin for the neuropathy in both hands and feet.  Have been on this for going on 3 weeks now (I just \"toughed\" out the discomfort until I couldn't stand it any longer and then the doctor heard me and prescribed this medication.  You can see by the dates about  a year.   Did prescribe a sleep enhanser Restirol for resulting sleeplessness.  That helps somewhat but still don't get a full night's sleep.  Don't mean to discourage you .... just thought it might be helpful for you to know my experiences.  I have read that neuropathy untreated can result in   permanent damage to cells.    Emmelene .    ",
