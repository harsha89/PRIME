    "Content": "If you are fighting cancer, it is very important to be very strict about every food item that you put in your mouth.

Fruit and vegetables that strengthen the body in order to kill cancerous cells and those that feed cancer cells sugar, white flour, coffee, tea, and chocolate. Cancer killing foods: Dark leafy greens are one of the most powerful foods for anyone fighting cancer: spinach, lettuce, and broccoli sprouts, broccoli and parsley. Foods also rich in carotenoids ( powerful antioxidants) are carrots, avocado, watermelon and cherries are packed with nutrients that have an amazing healing effect on the body.
