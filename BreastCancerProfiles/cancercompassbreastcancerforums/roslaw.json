      "Content": "Today is the first time I've really looked at the side effects of Arimidex. I've been taking this drug for nearly 5 months and hadn't realised how slowly it's been creeping up on me, the debilitating effects. All the while I've been aware of the more painful joints, knew that could happen; also been more tearful, not like my normal self. But the lower back ache so many of you have mentioned has been a revelation - I wondered how I could have woken up with it one morning when I'd been fine the day before and now I'm constantly in pain. I'm also constantly tired but can't sleep, my shoulders, neck and head feel like they're in a vice, being squeezed tight. I've gone from full-time work to 3 days, and now will soon be going down to 2 days and I'm still exhausted. I don't feel depressed, but I don't feel like socialising much, so perhaps low grade depression is there. It's been really helpful reading these posts, because I can see I'm not alone with this drugs unwanted effects. I'm too anxious about recurrence of cancer to stop taking Arimidex, but with such a long way to go (4 and 1/2 years) I sure don't want it to get worse. I've just stopped taking Topamax to supposedly counteract the Arimidex, but found it maximised nearly every adverse effect except the migraines. I wonder how doctors would feel if they tried out these drugs instead of just dispensing them with a patronising pat on the head? (I used to be a nurse)",
