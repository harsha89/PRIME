I underwent total mastectomy last september, 2002, had finished 6 cycles of chemo therapy then had radiation. As of now, I am on arimedex. I just want to meet or hear from other cancer survivors most especially their experiences and also advises on foods which I am not supposed to take. Any topic regarding breast cancer will interest me. I will be happy to receive more informations and meet new friends through this.",
