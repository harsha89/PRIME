      "Content": "Hello everyone, I was on Tamoxifin for 2 years, then ny doctor said that when I had my blood work done, one of my blood reults was low. He the switched me to Aromasin,  i was on that for 1 week when I broke out all over my face. I was itching all over my body, skin was dry, and face was swollen. I paid $90 for a 3 month supply. I then went back to the doctor a week later and he prescribed me Arimidex that also cost me $90 for a 3 month supply. I am now experiencing nausea, and depending on what i eat that day, my face is breaking out again. As far as the body pain, fatigue, and other symptoms, I also experince them, but I also have Fibromyalgia, so I was already having all those problems. It is becomming so stressful. I also am experiencng depression. My husband lost his job in October, so I am working long hours because we have a 10 year old and a 19 year old in college. I am a mail carrier, and delivering mail is becomming very hard for me. Too tired to cook, clean, and just living my everyday life. Please give me some inspiration.",

It's not easy - ya gotta work at it, make sure to stick to a regimen faithfully, eat good food choices, take your supplements, and do some research, but it certainly is doable.  My estradiol was up over 30 - after 6 months on my own regimen without any prescription drugs it was  down below 5, and my cancer is in remission. I've published my regimen on my blog - you are welcome to take a look at it. I can't guarantee that it is exactly what YOU will need, but as I also was taking into account fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease (arthritis), I can say that there are a lot of powerhouse supplements, herbs and foods that can not only decrease your estrogen availability, but also provide the nutrients you need to get relief from the FMS. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers (If you want to read my story: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor ) The very most important elements are selenium, grape seed extract, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese and vitamin D3.  Make sure you are getting plenty of essential fatty acids (I used the conjugated linoleic acid with the grape seed extract and red wine as a kind of triple whammy - but you still need plenty of omega 3, 6, and 9's.) I tried to choose inexpensive supplements that would cover a multitude of areas - both natural aromatase inhibitors and estrogen blockers, really strong OPC's (oligo proanthocyanidins) and other anti-oxidative compounds because I was also actively fighting cancer.  You might not need all of these if you don't have active cells, but I think in terms of the FMS almost everything that I put in my regimen has a component for either rebuilding nerve and muscle function and detoxifying the body, and it sounds like you sure could use that about now. Also, have you had your thyroid looked at?  Many of the world's leading FMS researchers agree that this is a metabolic problem - many are looking specifically at the thyroid for answers. They are finding that many people with FMS are not getting enough free T-3 thyroid hormone, even if they are taking a synthetic thyroid drug. I had been on Synthroid and then Levoxyl for years, but it wasn't until I switched to natural thyroid hormone that my T3 levels started normalizing, and I started feeling much better - even more so than the improvement I had seen after I started my anti-estrogen regimen. Feel free to let me know if you have questions.  My email address is at the top of my blog page.  I wish you the best of success in getting your life back to at least some semblance of normaSincerely, Tre Thank you for the information, I will definitly look into that.",

I am now 3 months behind my last chemo treatment, finished radiation Feb. 18, and I havent had another period. My oncologist said I might start again some day, but my gynecologist did bloodwork and said my ovaries are not working at all.  Regardless, I am having my ovaries removed next week, so I wont have another period.  Did you ask your oncologist about that? It sounds very uncommon to me, but it may not mean much, who knows? Hello, I had already been done with chemo for 2 years when my period came. I did consult my oncologist, and he said he never had any of his patients experience that. That was the only period I had. I have not had a period since I finished chemo in December 2006.",

I was flowing that heavy. I was experiencing dizzy spells and nausea. I ended up in urgent care. After the doctor ran my blood and did other tests, I was told that I was dehydrated, my iron was low, and fatigued, and my blood was low from flowing so heavy. My Oncologists said in all his years he had never known anyone to have a period after chemo. It was the worst 10 days ever, has anyone else ever experinced this?",

Hi, I am sorry to hear that. I did not have that type of cancer, but I did do the Taxol treayment. I had the masectomy on my right side, so they could not do the chemo on that side. They had to use my left side, but I have very small veins, so every chemo session it was hell for me. They suggested getting the port, but I refused. As far as the Taxol, the pain was unbearabel The body aches were murder and I ended up with Narapathy, don't know if I spelled that right :). My feet hurt so bad, I wore houseshoes and sandals for about 5 months, in the rain and all. Just having the sheets from my bed touching my feet was painful. The pain in my feet lasted for about 1 1/2. I pray for u and hope that you will get through it, good luck.",
