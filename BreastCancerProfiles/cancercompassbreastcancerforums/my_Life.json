      "Content": "Thanks, I have done a lot  of reading the past few days. as well as alot of appt. for BC. I have seen a great oncology that gave me  a BRAC test to see if i'm a carrier of this gene mutation. I would like it to come back neg. but my track records don't look that good. I have a great family support and am lucky to have great friends in my life. I have two daughter so that why I think i'm so scared I want them to see me strong and a fighter at all times. My husband is always telling me that I can do this. I have an MRI planed as soon as I get my period. My father died of cancer. My great grandmother died of BC and my grand mother of stomch cancer but when she was in her 50's she had ovarian cancer. I wish I would have had this information earlier I would have been tested years ago. I come from a family of all girls there are 17 girl in the family from my sister to all my cousins. who are all getting checked out because I have BC. I really never knew alot about my family History. But i do now. I think the scarey part of all this is that i don't now why i had a mamagram done. all I remember is that my Dr. always said early detection is the best. So I call the office and had the set me up for an appt. I think I just wanted to get out of work that day.....Glad I did. My Dr's are sending me to Stanford for more testing because of the different type's of tumors and cancers that run in my family. I like the Dr's that I have seen and they are very helpful do you think i need to get a second opinion. Everything you have said to me they are doing I wanted to have the surgery right away but the oncology said no that I needed to have an MRI just to ckeck the right breast. So i'm having to wait until the first week of Aug. for my surgery. I just want the cancer out of me I'm scared that it will spread to the rest of my body. But on the other hand I don't know how long I have had BC for. well I'm just waiting to go to the plastic serg. 1 more time to discuss thing to make sure what i want. And the oncology office to see how the MRI come out that appt. should be coming up soon i get my period middle of my week. In the back of my mind I think I should just have both breast removed to be safe. what do you think....  Thank you alot (my name is)   Hope                  ",

      "Content": "Hello i'm 36 year old and i have breast cancer. I'm not sure what to do. (scared) i have went to alot of doctors and i'm numb. Can't believe this is happening to me. I have a brain tumor that i found out about when i  was 28. I have been dealing with that just don't know what to do with this now. I don't understand why i know that i need to be positive about this but  i'm just scared i've nerver had to deal with cancer. My father passed away of gbm-4 brain tumor. Is there question i need to ask. I want a mastectomy. I have 15 to 20 masses in my left breast they did a biopsy on 6 and 4 came back positive for cancer. Any suggestions would help. My life.

      "Content": "What is DIEP surgery. Why do they say it is better then TRAM surgery. I think that reading different site makes me wounder if the surgery that i want is the best. I always take my Husband or my Father in-law with me to my Appt. My mother lives way out but will come stay with me for 2 weeks after the surgery. I try not to think of BC or that BRAC test but I 'm only lieing to my self. I can't get it off my mind I've had so many very bad headaches because of it. I try to read all the BC sites I can. So that when I go to the Dr's I can understand better. But some times the sites scare me too. Is there anything I can do so that I won't have this on my mind day in and day out. I also want to thank you for all the great word of Hope that you give to me. I know I'm not the only one but I SURE DO FEEL LIKE IT. p.s. How are you doing. Thanks Hope,       ",
