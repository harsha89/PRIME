    "Content": "I have been taken aramasin for the past year after a trial on femara and before that 5 years on tamoxofin...I tolerated the tomoxofin very well, but had a hugh jump in my cholesteral levels on femara...so we switched to aramasin and I never felt worse or older- However, my biggest concern is my mental acuity and judgement. I have gotten into 2 car accidents in the past year which is very atypical for me and my joint pain! I am thinking of discontinuing and going natural but need to discuss this with my oncologist and with a naturopath friend...Has any else found that the drug affects their ability to concentrate..",
