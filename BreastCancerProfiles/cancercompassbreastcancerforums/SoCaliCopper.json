      "Content": "Hi, recently my wife and i had a beautiful girl, she is now 4 months old.  Approx a week after my wife gave birth, she noticed a small lump in her left breast, directly to the left of her nipple.  We thought maybe it was some type of infection or blocked milk duct,as did the doctors, took medication, but it did not clear up.  My wife then recieved an ultrasound, and then one 6 weeks later.  It was some type of organized growth, and had grown from approx 2.3 to 3.3 cent in that time.  Today, we went into the general surgion and he advised they need to do a biopsy and have placed her into a category 4, which he said meant she has a 75 percent chance it is not cancer, and a 25 percent chance it is.  I am scared to death, and really I dont know what to do.  I am trying to stay strong and when she cries on my shoulder I just tell her it's not cancer, and that I would go to Vegas and bet all of my money with those odds.......but I am up now, cannot go to sleep, and am breaking down.  Can anyone help me and give me advice? I am 26, my wife 29, and Im not ready to lose her.... ",

      "Content": "Ok, well not much has changed right now.  We are kind of in a holding pattern.... The insurance is what is driving me nuts now.  PPO, HMO, wrong health providers, wrong doctors, didnt get a primary care's referrals for outside medical groups specialists......I tell you, I never knew what is was like to deal with the medical nightmare........  On Tuesday she has and ultrasound biopsy, and then a week later we go in and speak with a doc about the results......I bet that day will either be one of the best days of my life, or the absolute worst...... My attitude has always been expect the worst, hope for the best.....  Thanks again to all who have posted a response...... It helps tremendously...   JOSH",

      "Content": "Well we had the biopsy on Tuesday, yesterday, at 9 in the morning.  My wife did a really good job, the only thing that I have a question about now is that their was a ton of fluid in the location of the lump.... I mean a ton....she continued to leak later in the day out of the entry point.  So they showed me the little pieces of the tumor that they took out ( the little son of a offensive word removed ) and now it is being sent to the lab for analysis.  If anyone reads this post and has had breast cancer or knows someone who has, was their tumor close to the surface of the breast, or was it hiding a little ways behind the breast tissue?  My wife's is right on the surface.......   Anyways thanks!
