    "Content": "If you\u2019re stopping conventional treatments for cancer then why not try some alternative treatments instead.  They are likely to have very mild side effects and to prolong your life.  I did some research online for a friend.  I emailed some cancer sites and I was recommended the spice extract curcumin as it targets breast cancer in different ways.  It causes programmed cell death and mitochondrial damage but only in breast cancer cells.  It can also stop the cells dividing, inhibit the pathway involved in metastasis, and slow down the development of cancer stem cells.",
