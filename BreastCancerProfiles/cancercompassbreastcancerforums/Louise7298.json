    "Content": "So here I sit after 4 years on armidex. This is my second breast cancer. Had first one 13 years ago. Took Tamoxifen for 3 1/2 years. Could not stand the side effects but hung on as long as a could. Tried Femara after that. Wow...that was worse. The second cancer came 4 years ago. Went on armidex and life was never the same. As everyone says you feel old really fast. Couldn't do anything fun anymore. I retired early because my job(social worker) required home visits and couldn't climb the stairs any longer. My doctor said he would hope I could tolerate the med for at least 3 years. I did that. But this last year has been awful. I also have lymphodema in one arm. The attack of the joints, bones and every part of my body finally got to me. Took alleve for the swelling until I couldn't take enough to be comfortable. Luckly my doctor said quality of life is more important than anything else. I finally made the decision 3 weeks ago to stop taking it. Think it will take time to feel better but I am hopeful and happier now that I can look forward to the summer without the pain. Even if it only improves a little it is better than what it had become. I had almost all the side effects.....joint pain, swelling, tired, dry mouth, headaches and forget sleeping. I have high clolestrol and high blood pressure because I am always in pain. There are more but I choose to forget them. I am not afraid of what lies ahead. No one really knows, do they? So I will enjoy retirment with my husband, play with the grandkids and enjoy our beach house. Going to Bermuda in the Spring. Decided a low key vacation would be just what I need. My mental state is what I was concerned about and maybe it's all in my head but I can smile now. So I say to all of you decide for yourself. The doctors aren't the ones who can't get up from a chair and can barely walk. They aren't the ones who can't sleep, who have hot flashes so bad that they take your breath away, who want to climb back in bed but know the pain when you try to get up and the list is endless. So with Spring arriving lets all do whatever we can to just feel better, physically and emotionally. Hang in there folks life will get better.",
