No there was no uptake last time",

All her yearly PET SCans have been Normal since.  The current PET report mentions teh following: 8.0 mCi of 18F-Fdg was USED for PET/CT Scan. SUV were Calculated based on Body Weight. Comparisn with previous report showed following:  -A small left level II lymph node (In the neck) is detected which is unchanged in size and morphology since the previous study, but shows uptake of FGD (SUVmax:6.7). Sclerotic Lesions are seen in D6 and L3 vertebral bodies which shows no metabolic activity and are unchanged. What does this mean ? Should I be worried ? What steps do I need to take?",
