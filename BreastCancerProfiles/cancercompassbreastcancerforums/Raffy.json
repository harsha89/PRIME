    "Content": "It has been 3 and a half years since I began my Arimidex. I, too, have had joint pain, muscle pain, sadness, weird crying spells, forgetting words and thinning hair.  I even got out the wigs that I wore during Chemotherapy.  I've been using Rogaine. (my dermatologist told me to use the men's version, but check with your doctor...it may depend on your age.) Rogaine seems to be filling in some of the bald spots on top rather well, but my endocrinologist thinks my problems are pretty much all linked to the lack of any estrogen in my system....which unfortunately is the reason for the Arimidex.  My oncologist is reassuring in that he says that none of this is permanent.  However, I am doing whatever I can to keep those hair follicles alive. :-) Trust me, you are not alone in these concerns.  I've been to a lot of doctors to make sure that there was nothing wrong (outside of the Arimidex symptoms).  That is why I ended up at the endocrinologist.  A low functioning thyroid runs in my family and I thought all of this might be due to that, but he says it's probably my lack of estrogen that is causing it. Hang in there.  It all beats having cancer again.",
