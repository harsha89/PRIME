    "Content": "Hi Julia, I just joined this forum today and have read all your posts.  My mother in law was suffering from primary breast cancer about 9 yrs ago and its reappeared in the metastatic form.  Since last year she's taken chemotherapy, radiation and all possible treatments.  Unlike you she's h-receptor negative so the doctors cannot start her on hormonal therapy.  By now her cancer has metastized to the lungs, bones and just yesterday we got to know that now it s spread to her liver.  She is very weak now and is suffering from a complete loss of appetite and nauseous feeling.  She was being treated for her bone metastasis and taking biphosphonate injections which have a mild side effect of nausea and loss of appetite.  But this was over 3-4 weeks back.  Recently her condition has worsened and she just feels like throwing up whatevr she eats.  I just wanted to understand from you if this is typical of the liver metastasis or is this special in her case and might be because of the medicines.  Could you help me out with what food agrees and is good for her.  It is very heartening to read your posts and see how you have coped with your cancer and you really have given me hope.  We really love her a lot and can't see her go through this pain.  At the same time I have no idea how I can help her and make things better for her.  I don't want to be a trouble to her at this point.  I know i will not be able to experience the pain and emotions she is going through but i want to know what i can do.  Also can u help me with any treeatment that helped you out so that we can talk to our doctors about it. Thanks a lot, Kavita    ",
