    "Content": "Hi Annie, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom's advanced cancer. You'll probably never know why your mother wasn't able to face her diagnosis, as each person handles stress, and even death, differently. I just joined this website, because my mother was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, and she had a similar experience ( knowing about the tumor for several months until it started to hurt ). Because of her age ( 91! ), the doctors decided to do the mastectomy followed by radiation, without chemo.They have done 25 treatments. Her skin is raw and bleeding, but the doctor's respone is to \"press on\". She wants to stop the treatment, since the pain is too much. The only suggestion I can offer is to attend a support group, so that you be a support for your mom. I know it's hard and very frustrating. It's OK to be angry as well, but it would be good to keep venting your anger to an understanding friend, group, counselor, or a church minister. That way you can cherish the time you have together.Â  I'll keep you in my prayers...Maureen",
