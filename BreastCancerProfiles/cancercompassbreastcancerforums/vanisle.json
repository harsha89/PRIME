Some tech read my CT wrong and concluded the cancer was growing. My Onco was retiring end of Sept. so, she put me on pills - chemo pills. I can't remember the name and not in a place to access it right now. They started me on 3 large caplets and 2 small. 14 days on, 7 days off. Next 14 days they increased the dosage. I had no side effects from the first 14 days. As the next 14 progressed, it became unbearable to walk. My feet were (are) like major sunburn and then my fingertips became super sore, then palms turned red in blotches. At least 3 trips to the bathroom daily with all night stomach cramps. I feel like all I want is my bed! My first IV chemo for the BC was a breeze. They collapsed part of my right lung with the radiation. Before I started these pills, I felt great. A little tired at times but stressed for other reasons. On Sunday, I'm supposed to go for my third round of what I refer to as my poison pills. I can't do this! They told me that I will be on these pills for the rest of my life or until I say I've had enough. They also do a CT scan every 3 months which has been happening for just a couple months short of two years now. I've had two PET scans also. Ideas anyone?",

This is the type of cancer that the herceptin works on.  I was to receive the pills also but insurance would not authorize them..  One is Zeloda and the other is Tykerb.  Now that I know what the awful side effects are for these pills, which is what I have heard from many  patients on these pills, I am glad I havent had to endure the side effects from taking them.  Instead though my only option was to be given more stronger chemo to try and shrink the one tumor in my right lung that is trying to do me in.  I have been fighting since 2001..and it has been a long journey.  I consider myself a veteran survivor!!  Best of wishes to you.. I am so sorry for what you are going through. I can tell that tou live in the USA since your med. ins. wont pay for the pills. I am from Canada. We pay a low monthly premium which for me, means my Zeloda is paid for. It is given two weeks at a time and one week off. I see my doctor during my week off and get a new prescription which is simpy filled and handed to me at the Hospital Pharmacy. I pay nothing. In my first cycle, the drug was fine. second cycle I had terriblr trouble but I blame myself for part of that. The hosp. gives a printout along with 2 sheets of the really importAnt stuff to know. It never ocurred to me to get out the other papers until I was already finished cycle 2 and back at the doctor. It does not say in bold print that if you begin to go through what I went through, to STOP taking the pills immediately. I really believed I just had to tough it through and my body would adjust. It doesn't work that way. It meant the dosage was too high for me. I was taken off for a month and then put on a lower dose than I first had. All seems to be going well this time. They will increase it slightly in about two weeks but, they say they will never put it as high as my troubled time. I have to take it or the rest of my life or until I say no more. I am stage IV. I'm a little off track with some meanings. I don't know what er/pr neg. is. I am HER 2 triple negative. There is a chance I will go for clinical testing - biopsies in a couple of months as long as this drug is working. I have a CT scan every 3 months. Next one is Jan. 27. Apparently there is no funding ??? to aid me even once they do the biopsies but the benefits are that maybe I can be of help to someone down the road and they may be able to give me a more exact chemo by knowing exactly what kind of cancer I have through the biopsies ( rather than an educated guess). The flip side is, if they get funding within two yrs. then my testing will be complete and I will be ready if they find a cure or at the very least, a longer lasting medication. I finally got brave enough to ask the dreaded \"how long\" question but all they say is that they don't know. It's my understanding that there are countries with cures. Even for us. I don't understand the lack of sharing this information country to country. Health and compassion should lead the way.",

You are very loving and caring and I truly appreciate what you have to say. I have kept your post for future reference. I have to be careful with what I do right now. They should let me know in a couple of months if I am selected to do the POG test. The rules are very strict and it is for British Columbians only. I can only have been on the capecetabine or they won't let me test. It's NOT the Capecetabine (Xolda (sp)is another name for it) itself, but I can only have one kind of treatment before doing the POG. If they have to change my treatment, I cannot do the testing. They have me on a very low dose. Today is day 14 which means I get 7 days off starting after dinner. ??. I have been on this dose for two cycles now and all is fine. I know though that in a week from tomorrow, the dose will be slightly higher. To the best of my knowledge, I am still asymptomatic and I hope that continues. New CT scan Jan. 27. As I said, I kept your post and will look at your references anyway. Today was supposed to be a start eating super well day but it didn't work like that. Tomorrow will though. I saw so many people walking today - men in particular. Was wishing I was out there too. People do need to believe you and me when we say - exercise. When I am super tired, I get up,and do stuff. It makes a huge difference. Blessings to you.",

I don't believe you will know without tests. I Thought everything was wonderful. Now on Friday I am going to see how bad things are and if there is a course of treatment.

My Onco did not tell me the radiation collapsed my lung and as stated, it was my GP who explained the medical jargon telling me what happened. Now, I have gone 3 months without treatment on an Onco's advice. CT scan last Friday shows slow growth in the right lung and one nodule in my left lung is smaller! I am advised to do nothing until my next CT scan in Sept. unless I am symptomatic (coughing, difficulty breathing or swallowing). I have a problem with anxiety. Generally, my breathing is fine. When I get up tight, I get sore shoulders and chest and I can realize that breathing difficulties can and do occur at that time. But - i spent time today making a couple of batches of jam and then dinner and by cleanup time, I felt tired and winded. I don't do any exercise and I am 40 pounds over weight. I truly don't know how I am supposed to know if that is cancer difficulty or out of shape difficulty. How does a person know the difference.

      "Content": "Hi, Nice of you to respond. Quite some time has passed since then. I think I've had almost every scan going for this area and anything near by.. CT, Nuclear, PET. The PET found a missed lump but they feel the chemo will kill it. I had my second round of chemo yesterday. So far my treatments have been good. Two more of this kind ( red devil some ppl. Call it) and then four of the next and on to radiation. The only thing that hit hard and really hard was Neupogen. It was un-expected because the brief description said it could create alower back ache that lasted about a day. It did say sometimes it could be more severe and it was so severe I had to go to hospital for the pain. I did not know until the next day that it was what was responsible. No one at our local hospital knew either but I was not dealing with an oncologist. We have such a great team in the area I live. I stayed over night in the hospital but only because it was already so late and I was getting a portacath put in that next morning. You are right. I had a single mastectomy with 11 lymph nodes removed - four of which were cancerous. There is a brand new book out regarding breast cancer and it's written by a nurse from Florida. The book is called THE SILVER LINING. By Hollye Jacobs. She writes of her experiences with breast cancer and has been a great help to me. She has allayed my fears in many cases and boosted my hopes. It's nice to read about a personal experience so when questions arise there is likely an ans. at your finger tips. I was really down for a few days but her book brought me back. MRI's are not given in Canada as often as they appear to be in the USA. Regular mammogram did miss my lumps. Diagnostic mammogram at the hospital picked up 2 and ultra sound picked up the third.",

So i text her said sorry to hear about the news and hope she was ok, she text back and said she didnt want ANYONE else to know at all and that it was very bad and the doctor said she was looking into have both breasts removed. Meanwhile i have family at the doctors we both attend and i know its wrong but as we were suspicious i asked if he knew anything, he said she had not been into see the Doc for weeks, and he checked the records(yes i know its illegal and gosh we were worried that she was lying) but said nothing was on her records at all about testing,treatment or drugs. well we heard nothing at all from any of the family, we have seen her around, she looks well, no hair loss, no illness whatsover,she looks healthy.meanwh \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://healthy.meanwh \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">healthy.meanwh ile she had a new boyfriend she is bragging all over FB about how happy she is and all the sex she is getting!!, and how he has helped her past a rough time! Past?? it is only 3 months since she was so ill, she is saying how she is over the bad times?? No one went to the hospital with her and she was just dropped off saying to pick her up as she didnt want to upset anyone, so no witnesses to the Chemo treatment. she is wearing T-shits and no marks on her arms from needles etc i have lost my Dad to lung cancer and the thought of her lying is disgusting! am i missing something and just being nasty? i have no idea what its like to go through something like that but it seems too over with too quick! Also she was going through a bad time as she still lives at home with the parents and i dont think they liked the new boy friend and had awful arguments with them over it, but now its all lovely dovey between  them so it seems the ilness helped(bad thing to say i know) which also makes me suspicious. can some one spreadsome light on this? ie:do doctors have the medical records from the hospital? are you always ill with Chemo? Worried AuntyI was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly two years ago. My surgeon told me I had a very aggressive form of BC but also, the most common. Your MD is the first person you see when you either find your own lump or if it's found on a mammogram. Then your MD sets up an appt. with a surgeon who tells you if you can get by with a lumpectomy or if you need a mastectomy. They do like to get to the cancer ASAP. I had a single mastectomy. I had to go through a healing time after surgery. I was at least a month before chemo started. After surgery, I was sent to an Oncologist at the Cancer Clinic. I live in Canada so things may be a little bit different here. I live in a small city (100,000) so, i have to go to the next biggest city to see an Oncologist. The Onco, decides the course of action for chemo and also decides if radiation is also necessary. Because my cancer was so aggressive, I had chemo every two weeks for a total of 8 times. Not all chemo is the same. Chemo is hard on the body. I was never sick with chemo but I was given really good, very expensive anti nausea meds. Chemo is hard on white blood counts so, i had to have Neupogen shots (self administered) for 6 days following chemo and that medicine was difficult for me. I had a lot of pain from it but many people do not. All these meds are extremely expensive. We are fortunate to have the medical plans we do. I paid the first $100.00 and all the rest was covered. So, your niece would have required a lot of money unless her parents are very well off. I don't know about your costs for things like surgery. Again, in Canada, those costs are covered. Chemo makes a person super tired. I am not a person to nap but, during chemo, for as much as I fought it, I would fall asleep for an hour or so daily. All that said, I have two childhood friends who also had breast cancer. The first one had a lumpectomy only and was put on estrogen pills for her recovery. The second was told to choose between a lumpectomy and a single mastectomy as she was diagnosed as pre-cancerous. She asked me what I would do. I said she must make that decision but based on the fact that her Mom had BC, maybe she should give some thought to the mastectomy. She chose that. On re-examination of the tissue following surgery - she was cancerous - not pre-cancerous. But, again, like our other friend, they felt they got all her cancer and she also is on hormones. I did not have the kind of BC that was receptive to hormone therapy. I was told last March that it has metastasized to my lungs. No treatment yet. They don't like to treat without symptoms. Without CT scans, I would not be aware that I still have cancer. I am given a CT scan every 3 months. I've given you 3 scenarios to think on and you decide what you think about your niece.",

Normally, my Onco would call right away with results. She has been away on family matters for months and months so I saw an MD who works in Oncology. I did not know he was not an Oncologist until his final letter to me or I would have asked for an Oncologist right when I was given the new diagnosis. My BC is ductal carcinoma also - just neg. instead of positive. The words they used were that I was not a candidate for hormone therapy.

You'll have to excuse the next line as it's from the doctor's mouth - not mine - He said they would give me immediate treatment if I was feeling very afraid and felt I could not wait. He said, Americans want treatment immediately and that with this type of cancer (non-curable) there is no rush. He said that since they cannot cure me, my chemo will be less intense than the first time. Once every 3 weeks instead of every two and a different kind of chemo. He also offered me pill chemo therapy but again, advised against taking that route. He said it had a good chance of making me feel un-well and really wasn't going to do that much. He first suggested a biopsy but then played it down as a bad idea. My largest nodule is on my trachea. Since this all began in Dec. of 2013, after mammograms, biopsies, and surgery, I had 8 rounds of heavy duty chemo and 26 days radiation. I have had two PET scans and I have a CT scan every 3 months. I'm tired but ...I look well so no one understands that I am tired and that sometimes I feel weepy. Two wonderful women in two different cities said \"Don't listen to your doctors. No matter how you feel, do something everyday.\" Both, according to their doctors should have been gone but both looked hapoy and healthy. I know they were in treatment because we were in the same room having treatment at the same time. So, until I'm told different or maybe until I know different, I'll continue to take their advice and also to do as the doc. Said - treat it as a chronic condition. Thank you for your encouraging words and I hope you will feel well soon. The tiredness you are feeling seems to slip away without a lot of notice. They are saying now that you should nap for a few min. If you feel the need but then get up and keep going. Exercise if you can.",

      "Content": "Hi I had one breast removed Feb 27, 2014. My surgeon tells me that the type of cancer I have can return anytime, anywhere. So far, I have not had a single treatment and it appears They don't plan to start treatment before April 16/14. Seems like a very long time. Today, I notice that I have a visible lump in the same place they removed the other 3 from. Should tell you that along with removing my right breast, he removed a clump of lymph nodes. He took out 11 and 4 of them were cancerous. The lump I'm feeling and seeing today is on the incision but it's in the same place as the large lymph gland he removed. The rest of the incision is flat. My surgeon is away this week. I have an appt. with my GP today because I don't know what this is and I'm too afraid to wait. Also, on my other breast, i mow have a rash but I think it might be from perspiring and going without a bra. I just don't know. My surgeon gave me a book on the right foods to eat to help avoid a recurrence. Sugar is definitely our number one enemy along with being over weight. Anyone else have a lump show up so soon after?",

I'm in Indianapolis Indiana and am going to the St Francis Breast Center. They have a very large Cancer Center. I don't have any friends to go with me and my family won't come. So I'm going into this alone and it's making it scary too. I did find out from my doctor that both my breasts feel very 'nodular' is what she called it. She did reassure me that being so small chested they have special plates to help the machine really see things well. So she said the mammogram was definitely 100% needed. If I do have cancer I will be traveling and finding a large cancer center with very good doctors. I'm just so nervous and worried and trying to make plans just in case. Plan for the worst and hope for the best Do you have a family doctor that you can confide in and ask for his advice, or is this your family doctor that you are referring to in your note. I have an excellent OBGY at the cancer center where I am an outpatient. You might also be able to find some assistance from the actual breast center, before you go in,you could ask if there is someone who can help explain what you can expect, and go over the possible tests, maybe ultrasound might be easier on you since they can see more than on the Mammogram, and you are small breasted and this is your first one. I have dense breasts but this determined after I had my first mammogram. Good luck you are being very strong. My prayers are with you. My Family Doctor is who haas referred me. She was really sweet and told me that the cancer center is really good. I think they said I would have an ultrasound after the mammogram. They said any other tests they want/need to do will be done that way and pretty much I will leave Friday knowing if it's cancer or not. I will call the breast center tomorrow and see if anyone could talk to me about this more. I think that's a good idea! thank you so so much for all your help!Hello, I'm sorry you have to face this alone. Do remember that the first thing they are going to do is a diagnostic mammogram. Most women go to clinics to have a regular mamogram. The diagnostic mammogram is more comfortable and more exact. They get a reading of your breasts and under your armpits. They will see your chest. Mammograms are brief and they do have to put pressure on your breasts so it's going to hurt a bit. A bit! I have seen my diagnostic mammograms and they are very clear pictures. Do not be afraid of it. The pressure on your breast is over fast. It leaves no lasting pain and no marks. If your mammogram is clear, it's not likely they will do an ultra sound. If they do - don't be afraid of that either. It does not hurt at all and again, takes only a few min. Do you have an Ipad or Iphone that you can record the words your doctor (or oncologist) say to you. This is Thursday so you have time to write down any questions you want answers to. Take your list with you. I downloaded a recording app on my IPad that works well. When you listen to it later you'll hear answers you didn't hear talking face to face. If you cannot record your session, take the time to write a brief ans. at the time you ask questions so - leave room for answers. They say now to treat cancer as a chronic condition. So far, you have not been diagnosed with it so try not to put the cart before the horse. You are being tested at a large cancer centre near you, didn't you say? Why would you travel? Stay close to home if you require treatment. It's so much more comfortable. I'm happy you are not burying your head in the sand and you are getting this looked after. People who invite trouble are those who ignore symptoms. You are doing everything right. Try to feel at peace with yourself and let us know how things go. We are on these discussion forums to help each other because we care. Take care and know that we are thinking of you. Be blessed and Peace be with you.",

They found something suspicious and aren't sure what it is. They said it wasn't something they could needle biopsy though. I don't trust the health care in my area at all. That's why I would travel. I'm disabled and have gotten VERY poor care at this hospital. Also I know of two women who have had very poor beast cancer care at this center. It never hurts to know your options. Hopefully they'll get me in next week for the MRI and find out what's in my boob once and for all! Anyone had a breast MRI?When I was around your age, my mammogram showed something in my breast. My GP said he felt certain it was only calcium crystals but they cut me open to be sure. He was right. I have a friend who just turned 68. Her mammagram showed a large mass. (6 weeks ago). They did further testing and she does not have cancer. Hopefully, that is what yours will be. Be happy they are testing. Not knowing I had anything, I went in for a regular physical. My Doc. Of the time listened to my heart and took my blood pressure. So, I said \"aren't you going to do a breast exam?\". He was shocked that I wanted one. He did a very cursory exam. I go for regular mammograms. My doctor should have caught what my mammogram missed. By the time I found it, my surgeon said the lump was there for somewhere between 3 - 5 years!! If you do not have confidence in your facility then definitely go elsewhere. There must be someone on here who lives near you that is very happy with their treatments and their Oncologist. I cannot help you. I live in Canada. I'll be thinking of you and praying for you. God Bless.",
