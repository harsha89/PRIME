    "Content": "I have been using Anestrosole for 5 years and hoping my doctor lets me off when I see him in a week or so. No, I don't have much hair -very thin on top and not much arounf the sides, but I have hair extensions which makes it passable. Yes, occasional joint pain but its bearable, particularly if it's the best drug available to keep cancer away. I'll take joint discomfort any day over the pain and depression - and worse - of cancer. I was just shy of stage 4 6 years ago and did not realiize the severity of my case. I asked my doctor to give me everything he had so I could beat this. 6 rounds of chemo; surgery; 6 weeks of radiation and then reconstruction, floowed by 5 years of this drug. Hoping my hair will grow back but if not I'll look into hair transplants. Im lucky to be alive and I encourgage anyone who wants to quit their drug therapy to hang in and keep going. avoiding reoccurance of cancer is well worth the dicomfort of the drugs.",
