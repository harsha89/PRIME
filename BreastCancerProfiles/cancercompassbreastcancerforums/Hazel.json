    "Content": "My mom had breast cancer in 1983 and 1991--received mastectomy and chemo the first time, then mastectomy and radiation the second time. Now has a recurrence of breast cancer in the right breast, evidenced by a severe rash and lesions on the skin over the breast area. We saw the oncologist today, and he started her on Femara--she's 83 years old, with emphysema and chronic nausea already. What experiences have others had with Femara? Thanks.",
