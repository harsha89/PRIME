    "Content": "Hello Terri: First, I will add you to my prayer list! Secondly, I agree that you should check with the ACS for support. I would also suggest discussing your support system with your physician, he or his nurse may have resources of local support groups. Now I will tell you I am not a cancer patient myself, but I work in Development Operations for a large bio-tech company that specializes oncology therapeutics. You may find a clinical trial to be very beneficial to you, especially in light of you HER2 status. But before participating, make sure you understand what the study involves including time committment and any risks/side effects. Most Pharmaceutical companies also post their trials on the web (just google 'clinical trials' for a bunch of links). Keep you discussions with your physician honest and frank so that you can be sure you're getting all the information you need. I am sorry you are going through this alone. My mom has advanced metatastatic breast cancer and is receiving palliative treatment at this point. I can't imagine what would happen to her if she didn't have my dad and my family's support. My heart goes out to you. I will keep you in my prayers. God bless you, Carol",
