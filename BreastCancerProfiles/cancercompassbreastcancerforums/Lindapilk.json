      "Content": "I am a stage III melanoma cancer survivor and I, too, had developed an odor under the arm.  It was different thay typical BO and yet, I cannot describe it. My clothes also sometimes retained the smell. It went away after my surgeries and treatment. Our dog at the time also sensed it, I am sure. She became overly protective of me for about the year before being diagnosed - to a point where she showed her teeth if someone were to approach me.  Unfortunately, we had two young girls at the time and we felt we had to get rid of the dog because of my upcoming surgeries and treatment. How would anyone ever get close to me to help?  Sadly, during the yearlong treatment, I happen to catch a tv special focusing on the ability of golden retrievers to sense melanoma. It was said that the dog senses it like it would an injured puppy.  Our dog must have known and was protecting me because of that. ",
