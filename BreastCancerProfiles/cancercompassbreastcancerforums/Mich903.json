    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for six years now post stage two invasive carcinoma breast. In the first two years I had four of my fingers operated on due to trigger finger. Hot flushes never stop, drive me crazy! I have had Shingles. In the past three months I have developed a rash on both upper arms. Extremely itchy, wakes me up at night. Swabbed by my GP nil result. It looks purple after the sores clear up. Then it starts again. I am seeing my specialist in two weeks and am going to ask him if I can change my medication. He has told me I have to stay on the Arimidex for another five years.",
