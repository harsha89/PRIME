      "Content": "Hi..my name is Debbie..I found my lump 3.5 years ago and chose to chalk it down to a womens breast always changing..it did not go away after 2 months and that is when I decided to go to the DR. at which point Knew it was not good. After testing..it was 2.9cm and Stage 3 breast cancer. I was lucky, the Surgeon(the best I know in my heart) performed a lumpetocmy and removed the tumour. I then underwent aggressive chemotherapy as well as radiation and brachitherapy(that's fun..lol) from there i was Her2 positive..oh joy..so underwent Herceptin treatment for almost 1 year however, my heart became damaged and had to be removed from such treatment. the ejection factor in my heart had deteriorated.I am now on medication for the heart and am back to work full time.Aanyone else who has been through this...please contact me And God Bless the rest of you Hero's!  ",

      "Content": "After my cancer treament which was quite aggressive..I felt so lonely and lost and did not want to complain about any issue regarding lumps I found etc as I felt I was basically just kicked out for the new cancer patients and I do understand that for sure but don't forget about me and my worries afterward.(not intentionnally for sure) I looked forward to the attention and love I received at the Cancer clinic as it gave me hope and caring which I did not receive at home. I lost most of my hope when I went home and mentioned I was \"cancer free\" for now..my so callled partner in life felt I should just get back to being mistreated and take care og everything for him as he sat back and dran and insulted me I am quite sure I'm not alone in this. I do thank you for hearing me out..God Bless us all!! Debbie Thank you and I love you all and know u r quite busy but I am still human please and scared.:) P.S My Oncologist was always the greatest with me however, I'm the type of person to not go into too much detail as I know they are very busy for a great cause",
