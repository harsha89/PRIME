This year it came backin the bone. Two spots, one on rib and one on pelvic. Well I went on hormonal therapy. Zometa, lupron shot and femera. First petscan showed it had shrunk. This last one showed nothing. I can still feel the pain in the area I had it. Its not bad pain. Feels like a bruise. Im very happy but still scared. Im just looking for someone in a simiular situation that is in remission. Doc wont tell me how long I can be in remission. Not even a clue. He is waiting 6 months for another petscan. I cant be happy about being in remission. I know I should be. But it's like im living day to day wondering. I would love to hear from someone that has been in remission for a few years. Thanks. Kim Hello. I just read your message. I am in complete remission over 2 and a half years after Dec 2005 diagnosis of stage 4 bc with mets to sternum and lungs. Put on Zoladex and Zometa and later had ovaries removed. In addition to treatment, I eat very healthy, use Chinese tea, and take a lot of supplements including 3 gms curcumin a day (read about Dr. Aggarwal's research re curcumin and cancer). I started all these after diagnosis and went into remission almost immediately. I know exactly how you feel about the waiting. Every month I get my blood tested and worry about my tumor markers. They dropped to 22 at one point, then gradually crept up to high 20's and 30.  In July they were 33 which is over normal, but last week back down to 24. Best thing is to enjoy and value every day of your life - Since Dx, I fulfilled life long dreams to go to Hawaii and Alaska. I know it won't last forever, but life doesn't for anyone.   ",
