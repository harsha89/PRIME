      "Content": "Hi there thankyou for accepting me as a friend. How r things going for u? Oh this is Norfenn made the name up from the two doctors who did my op earlier this year. I am just waiting to go in hospital again. However, the mental game is I agree so awful, people think they understand! They can only participate if you talk to them. But I remember something I once said to my father whilst caring for him. He kept saying 'nobody knows' he meant everything he was encountering. My reply was you r right Dad nobody will ever know how you feel. But I am here for you! Of course you are angry frightened worried scared etc...... and family friends neighbours etc can not get close to how you feel. May I encourage you to find one person close to you who will give you the freedom to just say everything and anything you wish! Freedom can be found by voicing the inner you. Who says we should cope! Don't bottle up........let the fizz out of your personality YOU ARE STILL JOJOSOLOMON> Look forward to hearing from you again. Norfenn.  ",

      "Content": "I must say Joyce you are brave taking the Arimidex. I did see the oncologist and made the decision not to take it. But my peronal statisics were good. And I also clarified that arimidex is strickly to reduce chances of further Breast Cancer only. So all in all for me it was an easier decision. I hope the Glucosamine helps you. 5 years is definatley a long time to be in pain. All the best  ",
