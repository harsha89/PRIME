      "Content": "Hi, my name is Donna and I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April of 96 with a recurrence in my left upper lobe of my lung in August of 1999. I have been on 7 different chemos, Aderaianmisyn, taxatere, taxol, Gemzare, Navalbine, Xeloda, and now Doxil and have kept the cancer under control. I do work full time and feel pretty good. I go on Friday for a routine CT scan and a little nervous. I have a very positive attitude. Looking for someone who has experience the same. I am Her 2 new positive and have done herceptin. Donna",

      "Content": "Hi, Joanna I was on Doxil for three months, it did slow the progression of the cancer but didn't do much good. I am now on another chemo. But just because I didn't have good luck with it doesn't mean your friend won't. Everyone is differant. I have been on other chemo's that work great on my cancer but didn't on someone else. I tolerated it very well, it can cause hand and foot syndrome which is redness and peeling on hands and feet. I did not have that happen to me. Also they said it can cause hair loss, again this did not happen. Does your friend have breast cancer? Tell her to stay positive. And if there is anything else I can help you with please write.

There is not much you can do about it. I was told by one of my nurses that wearing cross training sneakers help. I have been wearing them for about a year and they do seem to help. Donna",

      "Content": "Hi, Shannon Sorry if I confused you. Yes being Her2nu positive means that you have an aggressive cancer. And my cancer did return after 2 yrs after being diagnosed the first time. What I meant was that Herceptin is slowing the progression of my cancer. If it wasn't for Herceptin along with chemo the cancer would have spread a lot faster than it has. Did I make that a little clearer? Thanks for writing back. Donna",

      "Content": "Hi, Shannon I found out that I was her2nu positive after my recurrence. I have heard wonderful things about it and my oncologist and I both feel that it has been a tribute to what has kept my cancer slow growing. I wish that I were able to receive Herceptin as a follow up drug after my first bout with cancer. I do feel good and lucky. I have a great quality of life, work full time and have a great supportive family and friends. I hope all continues to go well for you. I hope I was some help to you. Donna",

      "Content": "Barbra, Hope all is going well, I found out 4 1/2 yrs ago that I have cancer (breast) in my lungs. Tumor markers started out at 48, not that high. After ever treatment marker would go down as low as 17 and the slowy creep back up. Four years later tumor marker are 42. I have been on many chemo the last treatment show shrinkage in all my tumors so I thought WOW my tumor marker must be down but they were not...my Dr. told me right from the beginining you do not rely on tumor marker, he goes by the scan. My prayers are with you and all cancer patients. Donna",

      "Content": "Linda, I have not heard about that new treatment. I have not been sick with any of the treatments. The only thing is being tired. They have so much to give patients for side effects. I am thankful for everyday and if this is what I have to do to have one more day with my family then this is what I need to do. As I said I do not have any side effect, except tired and have a good quality of life. Thanks to my Dr.'s and family. Have your friends family ask her what she wants. If the treatments are to much then she can decide what she wants to do next. With this new treatment I don't know what the side effect are. Donna",
