      "Content": "Linda, your experience sounds a lot like mine. My hair is just starting to grow back almost 5 months after my last chemo, and 8 months after my one and only dose of Taxol, which had such severe side effects they changed the drug after the first time. I believe that drug was the one most responsable for my hair loss. Before chemo I had very thick hair, mostly straight but with just a bit of wave on the ends, just enough to make it lay perfectly in a layered cut. It was originally a lovely auburn colour (according to others, not trying to brag haha). It was neither too fine nor too coarse but had plenty of body. Now, to my dismay, I am getting tight curls in the back and straight on top, like you, and it's only about 2 cm long and thin and frizzy. I hear most peoples hair comes back curly and I HATE that. I look ridiculous with curly hair anyway, it just isn't my style; and worse, it is so dry that now it's looking just frizzy.My hair was always healthy but it never grew very fast, only about 1/2cm a month before, so I'm afraid it will take years to ever grow to an acceptable length now. Also the colour is very drab. This is just not me at all. Does anyone know of anything that can stimulate re-growth? To lose a breast AND my hair is simply too much...I feel like there won't be anything feminine about me physically at all after the surgery; as it is now I look in the mirror and see what looks more like a man than a woman, and I've never been a tomboy type, just the opposite.",
