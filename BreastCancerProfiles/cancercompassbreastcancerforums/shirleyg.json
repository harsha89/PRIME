    "Content": "after 7 years being cancer-free, I had a concerning mamogram and today a biopsy and mri.  I had had chemo and radiation originally.  If this is a second cancer, which I'm hoping it won't be, how would it be treated?  It was removed today and was so tiny it could barely be seen, and could be scar tissue.  However, I understand that I can't have radiation in the same area twice and would hope I don't need chemo.  Would I just be given meds?  My first cancer was triple negative.  Thank you. ",
