    "Content": "Hi ! I have been going through the same things. Mammograms and even Biopsy showed inconclusive results. Mine show some type of mass but they don't know what to do. Mammogram is scheduled for Oct., maybe they will figure it out. The problem is that I believe it has gone from just breast to around the rib to back area. I can feel it when I lay down pushing on my ribs. They set me up with surgeon and he said that he does think I need exploratory surgery. You are in my thoughts and prayers.   Sondra",
