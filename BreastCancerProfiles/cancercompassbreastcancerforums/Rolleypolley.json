    "Content": "Hey Michaels,   I'm sorry about your loss. I'm here on the forum today because today on March 29th I have chosen to bring my mother home from Cedar Sinai hospital and use the hospice service in lieu of the carcinoma meningitis.  This has been one of the most difficult times in my life.  And it sucks because I feel like I gave up on my mother even though I know I had to make this decision. I'm not really sure what do and I feel like I'm going out of my mind.  It's bad enough I lost my father to cancer a few years ago, but knowing I will lose my mother has been very difficult.  Most of all, I feel badly for my brother because we're both young men having to deal with this.  I'm 27 and he's just 22.  To lose parents at this age is unheard of and it sickens me to the core.  In any case, I will post the story and history of my mother in the near future.  It's tough getting my mind around things at a time a like this.  I feel so confused and exhausted.  These are times where I wish I had a bigger family.  My heart goes out to all those who are going through this battle or who have lost someone to this heinous disease.  I'll be back soon.  Thanks for the ears.   Best,   R.   ",
