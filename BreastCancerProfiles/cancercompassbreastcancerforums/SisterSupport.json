However I have found a small lump where my breast joins my arm and it is very sore and wakes me up at night with some pain. I don't want to sound paranoid but now I am very scared. I am going to call and see if I can see a breast surgeon. I am just afraid because it takes forever to make an appt. Can any of you tell me of some of the symptoms? Did your lump hurt?   Regards, Esra   My sister was experiencing soreness and pain where you are describing. Her mammogram and ultra-sound results were negative, however the MRI finally informed her of why she was having so much pain. Unfortunately she was diagnosed with Breast Cancer which had metastisized to her lymph nodes. It would be a good idea to make an appointment asap (with your Gyno?) to check this out.  Good luck to you and I hope all turns out well.  Take care! ",
