But research tells me that the results will be the same and the cost will be $245 more a month. But last week, I received a 3 day suspension from work because of poor work performance. So the decision has been made for me. I was scheduled to begin medication in a couple of days. I have been off medication for 3 weeks now and I feel better than I have since all of this started. I can continue medication and suffer the horrible joint pain plus all of the other wonderful side effects and hope I can funtion well enough to keep my job, or I can stay off this 'neccessary' medication that is eating my cartiledge, bones and maybe damaging my liver, and hopefully keep my job. What do I do if I can't work and lose my insurance? Then I would have no medical help at all. After 3 weeks off, I still have pain in my fingers, mostly in my thumbs and still some pain in my calves. So I don't know if any damage done will be reversible, if my body can heal itself in time. Will keep you posted. Five years of this agony? I can't do it.",

I Know this is a mad thing to do but cannot take this pain any longer,like walking on broken legs..ahhhhh have tried aromasin but just the same no better. does anyone know of anything else I can ask oncolagist to put me on.  love to all xx jocey I, too have stopped arimidex after 8 months. After walking around, a  fuzzy medhead, trying to funtion and keep my job, I started experiencing the same bone and joint pain. I just could not take it any more. My ONC told me to take another week off, and then start on aromasin. But looking at all the reports on this drug, I doubt I will take it. The side effects are  the same or worse and the cost is way too high. I will suffer less paying  $5 instead of $250. And this is after my insurance copay.  But I have to do something. Today I was suspended for 3 days without pay because of my new disability. I'm now afraid to go back to work. My boss will be very critical. I have 2 choices right now. I can continue on arimidex, taking it for a month and then not taking it for a month.This way maybe my body can rest and heal at regular intervals and every other month I can look forward to feeling better for a while. I hope my ONC will support this decision, because the only other answer is to quit altogether. If I want to keep working, I will have to take my chances. No job, no insurance, no choice. At this time, from what is being offered to us, I don't  see much difference  in any of them except price. Huey Lewis isn't the only one, I WANT A NEW DRUG! Ain't life grand? Keep looking, ther are new postings every day. Luck to us both girlfriend. cindypeck",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm new at this so bear with me. Cyberspace is a whole new ballgame for me, just like breast cancer meds. Last year I lost a breast and gained a whole new outlook on life. I never let it bother me too much. I was happy that the cancer was found and removed. But I had no idea what I was about to experience AFTER surgery. Hello  arimidex! I was a changed person from the beginning. All of the typical side effects that I finally had to address. I went to my private Dr to get help. One drug has been a big help. I's fairly new and lowers  your adrinalin. It's  COREG  and it really calms you down. Now, after 8 months, I am battling joint pain. It became so bad that I had to quit taking it. You can't work, if you are hurting all the time. If I quit work, I lose my insurance. So, my ONC is putting me on aromasin starting next week. This past week and a half have been so great. The best I have felt since my surgery, and now, here we go again. My fingers and right thumb still hurt, I'm afraid I have done permanent cartilage damage. I'm more afraid of what will happen next. I doubt the change will be for the better. I will probably continue with the arimidex because of the cost. Why pay more for the same suffering? I just hope I don't have to start taking pain medications. I'm already a \"medhead\" and my work performance might be further jeapordized. But this pain cannot be ignored or lived with. Not in a world where you have to function! I's a no win situation. I'm winning so far. Everyone, wish me well, you are all in my heart. Cindy ",
