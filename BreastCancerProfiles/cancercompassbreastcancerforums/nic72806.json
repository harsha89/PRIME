      "Content": "Hello, I am a 26 year old female, and I am waiting for a breast biopsy. I had an ultrasound yesterday, and the Dr. found 3 solid masses (all in the same breast and area), and scheduled me for a biopsy. I was told that they are very backed up right now, and the earliest appointment I can have is Jan 11th. From what I have read i understand that these are most likely not cancerous, because 4 out of 5 breast biopsies come back benign; also because of my age. Unfortunately I have very limited knowledge of any possible family history. I am still extreemely nervous at this point, and not looking forward to the next 5+ weeks of stress.  Sorry if I was babbling. My question is if this is a normal amount of time to have to wait for a biopsy. Should I be concerned that this office is not scheduling me sooner and look for a second opinion? Also, after having the biopsy, what is the average wait time before receiving the results?    Thank you so much for your time and opinions. ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the reply. The day after I posted my OBGYN actually called me and told me she would like for me to have the masses removed, and they will biopsy them after removal. I told her I am very anxious, and she told me she would get me in as fast as possible. I have a lumpectomy scheduled for the day after Christmas. Hopefully all goes well from there. The waiting is horrible though, and I am not looking forward to surgery. ",
