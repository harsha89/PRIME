    "Content": "I am on Xeloda for Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  What type of cancer are you taking it for?   I took it last year also with Dosataxel and the two together worked great for about 4months then turned on me.  I can't do the Dosataxel again.  I wish there was something that would work as well with the Xeloda because I feel it's doing  a little good.   I'm looking at Phase I trials after this...I've been on about 6 different chemos in the pst year and each holds the spread at bay for a short time thn stops working.   Please let me know your story!
