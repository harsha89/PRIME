I was suicidal on the Tamoxifen.  I am currently 54.  So very similar in age.  I switched to Arimidex and had severe tremors to the point that I couldn't hold anything in my hands.  Quality of life, No.  Yes, everything you mentioned as well, memory loss, forgetfulness, hot flashes, joint pain.  I wish you the best.  I am on Lerisitole now.  Sometimes I take it, sometimes I don't.  I want to live.  Not have all of the shit side effects of the medicine.  Hugs  I am still getting nerve blocks.  My pain gets up to a level 5 frequently.  Doctor just tells me to go get another nerve block.  I was on gabapentin 1800 mg slept 18 hours a day.  Switched to Lyrica took a 3 hour nap the first day, plus came down with a bad rash.  No thanks.  Ugh",
