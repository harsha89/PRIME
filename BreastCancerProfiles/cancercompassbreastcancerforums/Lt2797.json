      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, underwent a mastectomy and chemo (A/C) followed by 2 years of Lupron injections.  I\u2019ve been cancer free since.   A few months ago I started having night sweats, which I haven\u2019t had since before the original cancer diagnosis.  To be clear these are not your typical warm room, too many blankets kind of night sweats.  I sweat enough to soak through my pajamas but my skin is cool to the touch.  In the past month I\u2019ve started experiencing a mild to sharp pain on my right side, on the back under my rib cage.  In the last few days the pain has migrated to my side, again under the bottom of the rib cage.  I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve injured myself in any way, haven\u2019t fallen or bumped into anything and I\u2019m not sure if the night sweats and pain is related.   Has anyone else experienced this sort of thing and if so what was the outcome?  My next oncology appointment isn\u2019t until August and I\u2019m wondering if I should go in sooner.   Thanks, Lisa",

      "Content": "Hey folks.  So I find myself here again.  I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m looking for answers or support so whatever you to offer have is much appreciated.    On background; I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 at the age of 37.  Left breast, 2.5cm mass in the upper medial portion of the breast, ER/PR+, DCIS/LCIS, modified radical mastectomy of the left breast.  Treatment included 4 rounds of A/C, 6 months of Tamoxifen (not well tolerated) then 2 years of Lupron injections.   Okay, so that\u2019s the past.   Six months ago, during my annual breast MRI,  a 5mm nodule was noted in the upper medial portion of my right breast.  My oncologist was not worried and suggested a follow-up MRI, along with my annual mammogram and ultrasound, six months later.  Fast forward to today.  I had the MRI, mammogram & ultrasound last week, the MRI indicated that the nodule has increased to 7mm.  Today the radiologist did a core needle biopsy (guided by ultrasound) of the nodule and the surrounding tissue, 5 samples in total.  My oncologist called later in the day to say she would be out of town next week and would call me with the path results the following week.   Here\u2019s what\u2019s bothering me.  Today\u2019s biopsy felt like deja vue all over again.  The radiologist said that these things are usually benign and not to worry, then had the ultrasound tech give me a brochure for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer.  Great!  The last time I had cancer the radiologist said the same thing but when I obtained the official radiologist report it said \u201c90% chance of malignancy\u201d.  I\u2019m feeling like its starting all over again.  Have any of you had the same experience with a new cancer in the other breast?   Like I said, I\u2019m not looking for answers but maybe just a little support.  It\u2019s going to be a long week waiting for that path report.   Thanks, Lisa",

      "Content": "I need some reassurance and advice.  I'm 42 years old and a 4 1/2 year breast cancer survivor.  The original cancer was in the left breast resulting in a mastectomy, chemo and hormone therapy.  Last monday I had my yearly breast MRI screening and a 5 mm mass was found in my right breast.  My oncologist says the findings are \"indeterminate\" and that she wants to wait 6 months to do another MRI, along with my annual mammogram and ultrasound.  This new finding did not show up in my annual mammo last November.  I'm not sure how comfortable I am with letting this go for 6 months just to see if it grows.  Has anyone had a finding like this and if so what was the outcome?  I'm wondering if I should seek a second opinion or if I'm just being a little paranoid. Thanks, Lisa   ",

      "Content": "Hello All, Does anyone know anything about a possible relationship between breast cancer & melanoma?  Here's my story;  dx'd with stage 1, er/pr positive breast cancer of the left breast in 2002 (no lymph node involvement).  Had a modified radical mastectomy of the left breast followed by 4 rounds of AC, then 2 years on Lupron (I didn't tolerate Tamoxifen well).  I was also tested for the BRCA-1 &2 mutation and came up negative.  I've been on no meds since 2005.  In April of this year a small, \"indeterminate\" mass was discovered in my right breast during a routine breast MRI.  My onc decided we should wait and do a follow-up MRI in October to see if the mass has grown.  Two weeks ago I discovered an unusual lesion on my back.  The mark is .50 centimeters in size, irregular in shape, light tan in color with a scaly, raised portion on one side.  I saw my regular doctor today and she referred me to a dermatologist.  While she assured me that it was probably nothing she did mark the referral slip \"urgent\" and advised me to get an appointment ASAP. I've since found articles on the internet indicating that there may be a connection between an increased incidence of breast cancer & melanoma.  I know much of the information on the net can be misleading so I hope that someone can shed some light on this subject.  I'm not afraid of having any kind of cancer again, I just want to have all of the information I can upfront so that I can ask my doc's good questions. Thanks for you help.  Good luck to all! Lisa",
