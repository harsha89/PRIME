    "Content": "Ever since I opted for radiotherapy and lumpectomy instead of masectomy I felt like my left breast had been cooked, it felt heavier and weird but not painful.  It was always bigger than the right.  In recent years when I have been stressed I've felt a mild pain going down my left arm and across my chest.  Recently this pain has been in my shoulder and clavicle and has become intense.  I feel teary and weak and tired.  I feel like my bones are like tree branches that are being bent to the point where they are going to splinter if any more pressure is applied.  I almost feel stinging sometimes.   And it also feels like my entire left side shoulder, breast, clavicle is in a vice being squeezed tight, as well as the bones feeling like they are about to break.  What the F is happening.  I am scared.  There is no lump in my breast.  I don't think  a mammogram would pick up anything, it never did in the first place, I could feel a lump and it was confirmed by biopsy I had this bloody unbelievable disease.  I thought I had beaten it.  Is this  a long term effect of the radiotherapy.  The pain is coming and going.  Right now its died down to almost nothing, before I was doing the dishes and i had to stop it was terrible and any movement hurt, yesterday i couldn't carry shopping with my left arm.  Can any one relate to this crap?",
