There are several types of breast cancer, i am triple positive.  The oncologist was amazed at how well i responded.  I even saw a major hospital oncologist for a second opinion and he was also impressed by the results on the new scans.  More than likely the spot on your spine is a site from the breast cancer .  Hey keep the faith  i did very well.  Best of luck, this is a very good site to ask questions to people wo have been there.    GOOD LUCK",

Stage 4 does not mean an immediate end.  since i started treatment 3 yeas ago the fda has approved 2 new treatments to deal with stage 4 breast cancer.  we have to try to say 1 step ahead of the game.  i have 2 new drugs waiting for me if what i get fails me.  my nurse told me don't worry if 1 treatment doesn't work there's a whole list to try. stay positive for your own good.  oh and i did alot of vitamins etc.  but i made no mjor changes in my diet.  my doctor told me to keep doing what i am doing cause it is working, and i told him we must assume coca cola cures cancer.  lol   i'll check back in a day or two and see if you are feeling better",

Had me fitted for special foot inserts.  After being diagnosed with stage 4 and it being in my spine and feet, I asked the local hospital for a copy of my bone scan.  14 months before diagnosis I had hot spots and (if i'm quoting this correctly) uptake deposits in my bones.  I don't think the orthopedic dr. even looked at my scan.  Anyway, I started treatment in March. 18 weeks of chemo, 1 day of treatment every 3 weeks.  The treatment did not make me unbearably sick.  Mild nausea and cold.  Then a very mild treatment for 11 more  times(again 1 time every three weeks), I'll finish up this March.  Doctors are encouraged the tumors appear to be shrinking.  Anyway, i was told that I've had the cancer for years.  Why I had to change hospitals for it to be found is beyond me.  They are doing alot to treat this even in stage 4, but I know how you feel when things are not properly checked by professionals.  Lots of luck with your MOM.",

      "Content": " it is amazing how we feel left out as we deal with this  monster.  But while i worked i was always running for my life work, family and home and hubby.  The rest of the world is still dealing with all that.  On a good day i sometimes ask a friend who works 11 to  7   to stop up and have breakfast with me.  we visit on the deck aand enjoy breakfast in the morning sunlight.    She gets outta cooking that day, we visit and she goes home and goes to sleep.  just a thought but it might help with the loniliness. good luck with your future. ",

      "Content": "i was diagnosed in 2011 with stage 4 b.c.   i went thru the chemo and have been doing very well.  now all i am hearing is that i am riddled with arthiritis.  they quit the armidex and started a shot once a month that is about the same.  my bones feel so much better.  When i wemt to see a bone doctor, he looked at my mris bone scans etc. and said he would question what the doctors thought was cancer as he sees it as a form of arthiritis.  i feel great but question if i had stage 4 cancer, because of the contradiction of the new doctor.  Any comments?  has this happened to anyone else?",
