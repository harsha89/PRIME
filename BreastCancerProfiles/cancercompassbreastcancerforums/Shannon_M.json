      "Content": "Hi There is a wonderful website that I visit every day for Her2/neu positive BC that gives you all kinds of information. It is: www.her2support.org I, like you, found so much information out there for ER/PR positive people, but not very much about Her2. So, this website helped me out a bunch. Hope you find it. Happiness and Health to you. Shannon",

      "Content": "Hi Donna, Did you do the Herceptin before or after your recurrence? I, too, am Her2neu positive and I am on Herceptin, but I am on a clinical trial. I have not had a recurrence and I am Stage 2, Grade 3, 1 out of 10 lymph node positive. The Herceptin is supposed to be the new miracle drug for her2. I hope and pray it works for you. Let us know how you do? Wishing you well, Shannon",

      "Content": "Hello Donna, I am a little confused about what your doctor told you about being Her2neu pos. In my research and in talking to my oncologist, I have heard that Her2neu cancers are MORE aggressive and have more of a chance of coming back sooner (2-3 years later). It sounds like your doctor told you that it was slow growing and that being Her2 is what kept it away for so long. That is the opposite of what I have heard and was just wondering exactly what he/she told you. My doc told me that only 30% of breast cancers are Her2 pos. I am curious as to what good things you have heard about being Her2 pos. I would sure love to hear some good things about it! If you wouldn't mind, please let me know. XOXO, Shannon",

      "Content": "Hi M, I don't have stage 4 BC (Stage 2), but I have heard wonderful things about Navelbine. If you get a chance, check out breastcancer.org discussion boards and Her2support.org websites. They talk about Navelbine quite a bit on there. You may get some much-needed information. Also, Herceptin is supposed to be a \"wonder drug\". They use it in metastatic stages now and are showing great results and I am lucky enough to be receiving it in a clinical trial to see the effects of it in earlier stages. So far, they say it's doing great in keeping it from coming back and killing cells. So, ask your doctor about it. Some ins. companies don't cover it in early stage because it is not FDA approved yet in early stages. But, you being Stage 4, I am sure you will be able to get it. Keep on them about this drug! I have done A LOT of research on it and heard nothing but good things about it. I hope this helps. Shannon",
