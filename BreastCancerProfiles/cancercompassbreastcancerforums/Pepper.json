    "Content": "I did have those feelings also. I did take Xanax for the anxiety and that helped a lot. Now I have my own business and its been 4 years since my surgery (lumpectomy).and lymph node removal. When things get a bit overwhelming I try yoga or I do take a xanax on a rare occasion. It helps take the edge off. Time works wonders and believe me in a couple years this will become a faint memory and your life goes on. I still get 6 month checkups w/ my oncologist/ surgeon and gynecologist. Everyone has a hand in my recovery even my GP who is great!As a matter of fact this is the first message board I have read in a very long time. I dont know what brought me here today. Anyway life is unpredictable and there is light at the end of the tunnel. I pray for you and all our sisters that have had this experience. God Bless. Marilyn",
