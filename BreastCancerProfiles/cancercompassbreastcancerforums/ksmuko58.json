      "Content": "Hi, I was put on Arimidex in 2004 for metastatic bc.  It had been 9 years since my initial diagnosis.  The Arimidex not only stopped the cancer from spreading anywhere else, but it shrunk some of the nodules in my lungs and some even disappeared.  I will hail Arimidex to anyone & everyone who has metatstic, hormone positive bc.  I hope all goes well for your mom!  :)",

      "Content": "Hi.  I am new, (today) to this website.  I came across your message and I just had to reply.  I have the same diagnosis, and am the same age as your wife.  Additionally, I have asked my husband & 3 adult daughters not to talk to anyone else about me & my cancer.  So, I guess I can relate to your wife on some level; I can also relate to you too.  Here's a short version of my \"journey\" thus far: First breast cancer diagnosis:  Nov 1995; was found in my lungs 2004.  (no sign of any other cancer in between); Cancer found in my other breast 2008; Found in spine Jan 2009; Most recently found in my gall bladder Mar 2009. This has been a long road, and the only strength & courage to keep going each day is my faith in Jesus.  Now I know you prob'ly will stop reading at this point, but if you would just consider, for a moment, this question:  Who is it that can help you, help your wife & bring you both hope in a seemingly hopeless situation?\"  If you'd like to know more, please reply and have your wife reply too, if she's willing.  In the meantime, I will be praying for both of you.  May God make himself real to you and give you strength to seek Him. In Christ, Kathy  ",
