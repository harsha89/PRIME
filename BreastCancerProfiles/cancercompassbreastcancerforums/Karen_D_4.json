    "Content": "Hello- My Mom had a mastectomy done and also a lumpectomy on the other breast. Once completed, the surgeon told her the margins (for the lumpectomy) were clear, but close....the second oncologist we went to says that the second breast should be removed. This would come after chemo and before radiation......I would like to know if there is anyone out there that has followed this path, and what were the results? Thanks, kd",
