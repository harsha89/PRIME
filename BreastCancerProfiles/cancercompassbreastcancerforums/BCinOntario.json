    "Content": "Hi daughter-in-law : I am very sorry to hear about your m-i-l's diagnosis. I don't know much about this particular cancer but it sounds like a particularly challenging one. Could it be that all of the negative feedback is the result of shock on the part of those family members? Shock has a way of manifesting in strange ways. Some people's response to bad news is to become angry and negative when all they see is defeat rather than possibilities. They feel helpless and become negative, while some others see challenge but are inspired to find answers in hopes of winning the fight.  MLindaG has made some good suggestions such as to stear clear of negative information on the internet, and to consider getting with another oncologist if necessary who will be positive and constructive in working with your m-i-l and you to fight this cancer rather than accept the status quo. Attitude is really key here and you will need to develop a tougher skin or understanding that your relatives just have a different point of view but it doesn't mean they are right in their conclusions. You don't mention your husband but if you both feel inclined, you might want to sit down with your relatives and talk it out and try and impress upon them that for better or worse, your m-i-l needs all of your love and support, right now. Wishing you strength and courage at this time. Take care.",
