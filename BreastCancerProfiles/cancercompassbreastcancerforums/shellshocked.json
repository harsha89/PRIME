      "Content": "I have recently been diagnosed with er/pr positive breast cancer and when setting up treatment, the nurse coordinator offhandedly said \"you will just be put on estrogen inhibitors\". When meeting with an oncologist, I mentioned I needed my estrogen(I am post-menopausal), he asserted I do not. After spending many hours researching these drugs, I have decided not to follow that particular treatment. Anybody else?",

      "Content": "Dear Grandma,     I am very new to breast cancer, as I have been diagnosed 8 days ago.  Surgery is set for next week, which would include a partial mastectomy, then radiation, and finally an estrogen inhibitor for a least 5 years.  No ct scans were mentioned for me and I was told that the side effects to the inhibitors are small to nil.  I am 58 and also ER/PR positive.  I am seriously considering foregoing the chemical treatment, but feel I need to connect with someone who has been through the regiment.  I hope you do not mind me jumping in on the message,  I am just looking for a little info.  Thank you very much. ",
