    "Content": "Hi Sher, You have already had some very good advice that I really cannot add much more to, but would like to tell you one little thing that I did to help take away the dread of each chemo treatment. I started a charm bracelet and for each chemo I got a new charm. I also did this for radiation but because I had 25 treatments and could not possibly afford 25 charms I got one after the first, then half way and of course completion. I know that this would not appeal to everyone as some may see it as a bad reminder of their experiences but I felt it helped to keep my spirits up. My friends and family have also added charms to it which has made it extra special. Good luck for your treatment.  I'm sure you will find an inner strength that you didn't know you had. Jenny",
