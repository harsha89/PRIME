      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer about 6-8 weeks ago.  She has since had a double mastectomy, and was waiting till she was fully healed to start her Chemo.  She went to her oncologst yesterday, and they told her that it had spread to the bone.  First of all - why didn't they do this bone scan BEFORE they took her breasts - is that normal procedure?  Second - what are we to expect now?  What are the best meds for her to be on?  Any personal experiences are great appreciated.  I'm very lost right now, and don't know what to do/think. TIA - Sarah",
