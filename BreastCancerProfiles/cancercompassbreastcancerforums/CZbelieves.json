    "Content": "To you in response to your comment on the breast cancer on your body, I am truly sorry for your terms.  So you do know, I have been marked with the ACC in the past within my throat.  I huge cancerios touma that bairly blocked my throut.  I was only 30 years old and they did surgery to remove part of my throut.  I then received radiation afterward.  It is noe 13 yraes later and I was again reunited with the old doctors.  The cancer has relocated both in my Liver and my right lung.  The doctors 1st releaved me at 43 years old of the growth in my Liver.  Major issues happened to me.  There was a clinical mishap that the Cheif Surgeon of the Boston hospital I was at proformed.  I had a surgical mishap in the surgery and could not speak - my right side was messed up. This was on April 8th, 2008. It is now October of the same year and I have inadvertantly regained my strength.  In addition, because of surgery mishaps, they wen't back in a second time in June and did my surgery again.  I am very lucky to still be here with real new thoughts and prayers.  I still will have to go on for more surgery on the lungs, but - AS ANY of us know. My life is better now and I still have plenty of love and pure addiration for my husband Steve who has never, ever let me down.  Please keep your sense of humor and your peace of mind!  Life becomes better!",
