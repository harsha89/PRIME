      "Content": "Hi Alexandria, I have a daughter your age.  My heart aches for you.  My husband had been radiated numerous times for cancer in his bones, brain, and lung.  In high enough doses, radiation absolutely kills everything it touches and damages everything in near proximity.  Like putting a hot poker on a wound to cauterize it and the surrounding tissue flares up from the insult.  Radiation should always be done conservatively since there is no recovery from it.  In your case, it doesn't sound like there are any cancer cells to directly target.  They were removed and found to be encapsulated.  You have clear margins.  That doesn't mean there are no cancer cells, just none that are apparently visible.  So it is anyone's guess, even the doctors, whether you actually have them or not.  In the event that you don't have them, and you are very young to have them, then the radiotherapy will only be killing healthy tissue.  It is the doctor's belief that microscopic cancer cells may be lurking in your breast tissue and the hope is that radiotherapy will take care of them.  But........radiation can also cause cancer as well as kill it.  I don't want to tell you what to do directly but you did ask.  If my daughter, who is 23, was in your situation and asked me, I would tell her no.  I would tell her to her to eat healthy, cut out sugar, exercise everyday enough to sweat out any toxins, especially work out her pectoral muscles under the breasts to keep her lymph nodes flowing, and keep a close watch with the doctors on her particular health status.  I would tell her to 'watch and wait' for any new cancer cells to show and in the meantime get to know her own body's signals and listen to them.  (I would also tell her to have children, not to wait, but that is just me, I'm still not a grandma, :-D).  Please do not take my advice as a personal directive.  Only you can make that choice.  Ask your doctors very pointed questions and demand answers.  Listen to your instincts.  They are your best friend.  Much Love, Rani",

      "Content": "I am so sorry you are going through such pain right now. Unfortunately I don't have any answers for you. My husband had radiation to his ribs and he also experienced muscle pain from it months later. Doc said take ibuprophen to bring the swelling down and the pain would dissipate. It helped my husband a great deal and it seemed to somewhat heal his damaged muscles. Maybe ibuprophen would help with your pain. I really don't know . It's just a suggestion. I will pray that you find some relief. Rani",
