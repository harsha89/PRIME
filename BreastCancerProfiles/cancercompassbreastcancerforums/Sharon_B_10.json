      "Content": "Julia, You sound so scared! If you'd like to get help from someone whose breast cancer was metastasized (spelling?) to various parts of her body, and after it was considered medically hopeless, she RECOVERED: A Cancer Battle Plan: Six Strategies for Beating Cancer, from a Recovered \"Hopeless Case\" by Anne E. Frahm, David J. Frahm Ann recommends a very agressive way of supporting your body so it can deal with cancer. She had the standard therapies, and ... I think you really would be encouraged by her story! She had a last-ditch standard medical attempt against the cancer, which failed, and she was sent home to die. Five weeks later, her doctor could find no more cancer in her! This happened because she had gone back to the nutritionist she'd blown off earlier, when she thought standard medicine was much easier to follow. (It is. But for her, it wasn't adequate.) The nutritionist's methods involved an extreme change in diet, exercise, and some other things. Not easy to do, but then, compared with dying with cancer, much easier. It's a short book, too! Another book: Challenge Cancer and Win! Step-By-Step Nutrition Action Plans for Your Specific Cancer by Kim Dalzell, Ph.D. Kim takes a milder approach to cancer nutrition, because she knows most people won't stop eating meat, take colonics, etc. She'd rather you did SOME of what you can than just sit back and hope the standard treatments (chemo, radiation and surgery) do work for you. She's associated with Cancer Treatment Centers of America, and has helped thousands of cancer patients. Another thing you seem to be seeking is the peace that you HAVE a future, even beyond death! In case you don't already know where to find it, I'll try to explain where I did. The bottom line is: we will all die. What matters MOST is not how long this life is, but that you have a permanent life with the Creator, Who loved you enough to die for you! You might already know this, but I'll repeat it: \"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him (Jesus Christ) might not perish, but have eternal life.\" (the Bible, Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16) Eternal life is not something you can earn by being good enough. We have all already earned a reason to fear God's judgement! And we can't help being born with this \"I'll-do-it-my-way\" glitch in our programming. We're all natural-born rebels, including against God. He didn't create the human race with this problem. The first humans CHOSE rebellion. We inherited their choice! So now we need a way to deal with our debt for our own personal wrong doings. That's why God's Son came to earth: not just to do miracles of healing, raising a few people from physical death, and teaching a higher standard of morality than anyone else ever did. He Himself said He came to die. ANd when the prophet John the Baptizer introduced Jesus to the public, he said \"This is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.\" (The Bible, John's gospel, chapter 1.) A lamb took sin away by dying as a sacrifice, not by being cute and innocent or by \"showing the way.\" So what do you DO about this? You tell God that you agree with Him about your having chosen to do wrong, many times, and ask Him to give you a new heart for Him and eternal life, based not on your earning it now or in the future, but on the basis that \"the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ...!\" (Bible, Book of Romans, chapter 3, verse [23, I think. I don't have a Bible here near the computer.]) When I had a breast lump, and a surgeon said the chance it was cancer was 1:2, it didn't scare me as much as it would have had I not known that God is in charge of the circumstances, and I have a relationship with Him. At worst, I'd suffer a miserable death, but then I'd be living with God forever! The lump was removed, and proved benign. But for a couple weeks, I got a very small taste of what you're going through. Very small, compared with your being aware you HAVE metastasized cancer! I'm a personality type that easily sees the negative, and can panic easily enough. But knowing I had a relationship with God, He's paying attention to even the least details of my life, and He has power over anything I don't, sure made a difference in my fear level in that situation, in THIS life. I hope this helps! Sharon",

      "Content": "I highly recommend the book \"A Cancer Battle Plan: Six Strategies for Beating Cancer, from a Recovered 'Hopeless Case'\". The author had advanced breast cancer that failed all standard medical treatments. She even had an autologous bone marrow transplant, which included taking a normally-lethal dose of chemo to kill all the cancer, but the cancer came back. She was sent home to die. But after getting serious about using alternative therapies (before the come-back cancer had much time to regrow), she beat it! She's been cancer-free for several years. The alternative therapies are NOT easy to do! But they made the difference between death and life! Mainly, they involve a radical change in diet, cleansing the body of accumulated toxins, faith, hope and love and laughter. I bought the book on amazon.com a while back. It was very encouraging!",
