    "Content": "Help! I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction 7 weeks ago. I have constant pain all around the implants, down the sides under my armpits, and horrible tightness straight across the bottom of my breasts. I take hydrocodone every 4 hours and all day I look forward to my Ambien at night. It gives me 4 or 5 hours before the pain wakes me. My surgeons keep telling me that \"it will take time\" and that I have a build up of scar tissue. I am doing physical therapy 3 times a week. They tell me that the muscles are loosening in some places and that there is some break down of the scar tissue, but the pain has not lessened. In pt they do ultraviolet rays and ultrasound to stimulate healing, then deep tissue massage. It's quite painful. I hear that the ultrasound works the best. I ordered a hand held ultrasound machine for $124 from LGMedSupply and have been told to do it twice a day. Here's the kicker... next week is my 3rd out of 8 chemo treatments. My body is exhausted! Anyway, I would love to hear from someone who has had some success. I hope this gives others ideas, and I look forward to spreading good news soon. God Bless, Kim",
