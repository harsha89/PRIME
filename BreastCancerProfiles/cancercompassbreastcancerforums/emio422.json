    "Content": "Hi everyone,  I'm not sure where else to turn for advice, so I thought I'd reach out on here to see if anyone could provide any sort of advice or guidance for my situation... My mom has had breast cancer off and on over the past five years. My parents never wanted to worry my brothers and I, so we were never given the full picture as to how serious her illness was (stage IV triple negative). All of my brothers and I went out-of-state for college, and both my older brother and I moved to New York City after we graduated. My parents still live in Florida, so none of the kids are anywhere near them. I've now lived in NYC now for about two years, and was hired in my dream job about 5 weeks ago, a job that I never would imagine leaving if the circumstances weren't as they are.  Basically, we received the news today that my mom's cancer has spread to her spine, and she will be beginning radiation/chemo treatments as soon as possible to start fighting it now. No time frame has been given as to how long she will make it, but this is much more serious than anything that we have EVER experienced before. We had a bit of a scare in February when the doctors found some spots in her brain, and I was able to go home for an entire week to be with her then. However, I don't have that luxury now because of my new job. I am financially-strapped and not yet receiving any vacation time, days off, or benefits.  I just don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and move home? Should I wait until my parents ask me to? I'm scared of losing my mom and not being there for her when she most needs someone. I'm also scared of doing something rash like quitting my dream job prematurely and leaving before it's the proper time.  She's my best friend and I love her SO MUCH, and I want to be there for her more than anything. I just don't know what to do. I never had any intention of ever moving back to the town I am from OR letting go of this opportunity I currently have, but I feel so terrible being separated from my family. I'm also so scared of losing my career and not being able to start over again.  Does anyone have any sort of guidance or advice to share? What should I do? Like I said, I don't have anyone to talk to about this, so any feedback is more helpful than you would ever know. ",
