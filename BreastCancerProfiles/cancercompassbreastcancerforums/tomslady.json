      "Content": "I have recently been dx with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. Had the lumpectomy and setinal lobe disection last week and now have to wait until next week and meet with the oncologist to find out what the next step is going to be. My husband has been very supportive through all this but i feel guilty putting him through this. We have been married just over a year and now all this. I don't know that I want to go any farther with treament. I have been cut open 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I am feeling very sick when i look at my scares, I know they are new and they will fade but right now I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to scream.  Intamacy has become a thing if the oast since all this has started and I think that is the hardest part of all this, I need to feel close to my husband, i need hito touch me and love me the way he used to before I got sick. How so I relay this to him without pushing him. It is going to happen sooner then later that I will not physically be able to love him and feel close to him but now while I can he is scared. Does anyone have any advice for me or encouraging words of wisdom. I need something to hold on to right now.  Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Ok heres the skinny! I have gone back to work for now as my surgeon called last Friday and was very exited about my insurance paying at least part of that Oncotype DX test I was telling you all about earlier.  Results should be back in about 2 weeks the tumor was sent off this week to the lab.  I have an apt with the cbc docs on 8/1 and with the radiation team on the 5th, so still not knowing what my tx regiman is going to be still alittle on edge. Finding myself falling slightly into a depressed state I am trying to stop it before it gets worse, upped the dosage on my antidepressant for the time being.  Hubby still holding strong and my mom and my sister where out for a visit this week. My mom was glad to see I looked so good not that she is bias or anything but I think actually seeing me has put her mind at ease alittle.  She left me with encouraging words and told me if I need her to come out again once tx starts she will be there in a flash. I have a good support team I think.  As I said I have gone back to work for now but only working 6-7 hours a day and very tired when I get home, my breast is swelling again, called the surgeon she said it is to be expected and not to worry but if it is not better next to call and she will see me just to be sure.  My incisions are healing (slowly) but they do look better.Bruising is still present but healing time is very slow she tells me.  My rigth breast is still lack and blue from the biopsy done like 4 weeks ago, bruising from iv's still very pronounced as well.  I guess I will close for now. Love to all and God Bless Kristine",

I didn't get very red in the breast area, a little onk and that was all. What side effects have been told you may experience. I worked all the way through my treatments and a day after my last one I feel really good considering all I have been through over the last several months with being diagnosed and having 2 surgeries. I had to have a surgical biopsy and then a lumpectomy with sentinol node removal. It's best to follow there treatment plan they are the experts and they know what is best. My first question to my oncologist was if they got it all why do I have to have radiation and he responded by saying everyone who has had a lumpectomy has radiation.  Follow there lead and you will be fine.   Good luck Kristine",

What are they leaning towards. You need to make sure you know and understand what you are getting ready to go through. Research research and more research is good. Know what to ask and get straight answers. You have been throught this before so you already know all that. I am lerning it all for the first time and hopefully the last.  I am waiting on the Oncotype dx test results to find out what my next step is. Alreadt had the surgical biopsy and lumpectomy with sentinal lode removal and now the hard part begins. I am back to work for short stay and trying to keep busy and not let myself get run down at the same time.  I have 3 children 20/18 and 6 she is the hardest to explain all this to. I agree wait to tell your daughter until you know for sure no need in worrying her until you know whats going to happen. She will be strong with you Im sure.  Need to talk I.m here just email me private if you want to I check my email all the time. Lots of luck and God Bless!    Kristine",

      "Content": "Thanks to all of you for your encouraging words.  I have had a very deep discussion with my husband since my posting and he has made himself very clear that he is here for the long hull. He loves me and we will get through this together. If all of this is for just one day longer it is worth it. He is wonderful husband and my very best friend. I have spoken with my surgeon today and we are going to have this new test done to find out if chemotherapy will even help me in the future other wise they will simply just do radiation. This is the first time my surgeon is doing this test she is very excited and thinks I am the perfect canidate for this study. It is something they do with the tumor they removed that helps to determine reaccurance risks. If there is not a great risk of reaccurance they will decide on whether it would be worth going through chemo or not. It is an expensive test but she is trying to figure out a way to get insurance to pay for it since it would be less expensive then chemo if it shows that that is not neccesary.  The only thing very frustrating right now is I can't get in to see the cbc until 8/1 and the radiology team on the 5th. The waiting is the hardest part right now. I am going back to work on Monday until we find out the next step we need to take. Not looking forward to all the questions and how are you's but the alternative sucks too. Well I will close for now and thank all you for your kind and encouaging words. I will kepp you posted on the progress made and let me know how all of you are doing as well.   Thanks and God Bless, K",

      "Content": "I am right there with you. I basically have benn going through the same thing. Found a lump, no show on the mammogram but did show on ultrasound, gave me 3 weeks to have it removed. June 13th  had a surgical biopsy in 2 weeks, it was invasive ductal carcinoma and had my lumpectomy with sentinal lobe disection done on July 2nd. Surgeon says she got it all and it had not spread so now I am in limbo waiting to go to the oncologist and find out chemo or radiation or both.  I am 38, married a year for the 2nd time have 3 gorgeous children and am scared to death. i told my husband today who is the main reason i am fighting this that i don't want to do anything else. Just let me go. I am becoming more depressed as time goes on and I know it is awesome that it hasn't spread and it isn't in both breasts but the thought of chemo and what you have to go through and I found out today that chemo will throw me in to menapause and truley my new husband and i were hoping to have a child of our own he does not have any children and I was hoping to be the mther of his first child. I waited all my life to find a love like this and I feel i am being short changed and that i am short changing him, he didn't sign up for this and now he is suffering to.   I hope your test comes out with good news and sorry to ramble on I just read your message and started to cry because I literally know what you are going through right now and it is not easy.  Keep us posted.",

My Radiation/Oncologist stated that this is fluid build up and I may need an aspiration.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I'm wondering why this would cause such pain.  Is it because I was sewed to tight, etc.  I'm curious on how many of us need an aspiration post surgery.  Is this on the rise or is this a rare problem... Hi< I know this is going to sound crazy but I have been having problems with swelling in my left breast since my surgery and the surgeaon said it is fluid but not enough to worry about. I have been not really in pain since my lumpectomy just very uncomfortable, different aches and pains then I'm used to so yesterday before work I was looking for some tylenol and all I had in my purse was Midol. So I figured what the heck it's got pain meds in it so why not try it can't hurt. Well I felt better yesterday then I have since my surgery on July 2nd. The swelling is starting to go down the pressure is easing up and I have no pain or uncomfortable feeling. the only thing it didn't help was the burning feeling I have when my clothes rub my incision on the breast. I have had a lump and black bruise directly above the incision since the surgery. No worse no better so it's just going to take time to go away I guess. Anyway, try the midol, it can't hurt unless you are in trtmtand are not aloud to take certain things. I have not started trtmt yet so I'm not aware of all the dos and donts. Hope this helps.

Thanks for any info...   Jill   I guess I don't understand what you are telling us. You have had cancer removed from one breast and it is also in the other one and they want to do 5 radiation tx on the breast that still has the cancer. Why have you not had the cancer removed and no I have not heard of the 5 day tx. I just finished 3 weeks ago. I have 33 tx, 28 regular and 5 boost and the only thing I had was the last 3 days very tired. I worked all the way through and did not have any pain or skin issues. My scars on the breast look awsome, the tx make them smaller and flat and very light. I am amazed at truely painless is was. I was expecting the worst, so the few days of being tired was nooooo big deal at all.   Kristine",
