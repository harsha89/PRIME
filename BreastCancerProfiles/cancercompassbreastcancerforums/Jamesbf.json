    "Content": "I was diagnosed in 2009. I was the first in my family although I can only go back three generations. I am also of Ashkenazy heritage. I personally believe that getting Cancer is not only really bad luck, but helped along by what we eat, drink, inhale i.e.the air we breathe, and other unknown factors. I, too, had a left mastectomy and four chemo treatments. The two lymph nodes that were removed were not cancerous. You are right about the Arimidex. I switched to Aromasin after about six months. I tolerated that better, although I still was lathargic and had some joint pain. I was diagnosed at age 64, so I'm much older than you. I am approaching my five year mark(June 23) and am doing fine. Talk to your oncologist about changing your medication. You can't keep switching, but no one should have to go through life feeling so miserable. I discovered exercising makes me feel better, and yoga frees my mind. I wish you the best in your journey to recovery. My thoughts and prayers will be with you daily. Barbara",
