I am to start taking this in a couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone on here had heart of this medication. I have been diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic adenocarcinoma with breast primary. I had 10 massive radiation treatments 2 years ago when my breast cancer as a lytic lesion on my bones. It has been ok since. But the last year my markers have gradually increased and my oncologist has suggested Ibrance as there treatment. Thank you for posting any information. Blessings to all of you.",

I kept telling my oncologist about a sore and stiff neck and was told it's stress and to do yoga and meditate all good advise if that's all it was. Just before Christmas I had 10 shots of radiation on my c neck bones and t3 bone and had to ware a neck brace. This all left me with a very swollen and sore throat and I am currently taking chemo pills every day to bring down markers and gain some control. If you still have reservations please get them fully checked out your own intuition should not be ignored. I wish you well and ask your oncologist about a different bone injection I haven't started one yet but I know there is another one available that may suit you better. All the best.Wishy, thank you for your reply to my original post. So sorry to hear you are in this battle. Yes I agree that our intuition should not be ignored. Nobody knows our body like ourselves, no doctor that is. I will ask my oncologist to review my makers further on my next visit in february. Hope you get stronger each day, I do know that our frame of mind has so much to do with our health, especially when we are diagnosed with cancer. Praying that you will be surrounded with encouraging and loving friends and family.",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer in 2000, after a mastectomy and chemo and radiation all went well for 13 years, when I started having problems with my tailbone, Long story short I was diagnosed after a biopsy with metastatic adenocarcinoma with breast primary. My cancer marker tests were just up a bit but still under what normal is said to be when this was diagnosed. I have had 15 radiation treatments that finished up december 2013, Having zometz infusions monthly for many months, markers always normal. Then went to zometa every three months beginning september 2015. My last markers taken december 2015 were all in the above normal or high range. This has be a little concerned, the oncologist said we would keep an eye on them, but this is out of the ordinary for me. I have been taking bone scans every 6 months and ct scans every year. Show up arthritis it says, of which I have lots of pain. But waking up at night with pain also. Had back surgery in 11-2014 for sciatica which is okay now, but I just do not feel easy about the test markers, or this pain I am having. Dr. says arthritis, I really trust my oncologist, but what questions should I be asking right now? I know that with stage 4 there is not much that can be done but I will not just lay down and give up. Thank you for your time, praying for all of you who are facing these issues, thankful for this site. Even if nobody replies it seems to help to just get it out there for someone who may be going through the same thing to see and know they understand, I love my hubby so much, and just do not want to put anymore on him, he has daily pain of his own which is almost unbearable and will not add to this. Wishing all of you a healthy and stronger you in the New Year.",
