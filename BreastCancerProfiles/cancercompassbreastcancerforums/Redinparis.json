    "Content": "...i too have noticed a thinning of my hair....i had chemo in 2003....but my hair really never came back as thick as it was....i started arimidex in the 2004.......and had to come off it a year later.....just too painful....and now i've been on aromasin for about a year.....and the pain is getting bad again.....but i've also noticed that my hair seems to be getting thinner and thinner.... there are just so many side effects....but i hate to stop all together....just because of the fear of recurrence....and the thought that i'm doing something positive to fight this.....but there's a lot to be said about 'quality of life'....and if this pain gets worse....i don't know... anyone have any suggestions about 'thickening' my hair.....it's bad enough to go thru all this....but then to feel like such an 'ugly duckling'??????...thanks...gk",
