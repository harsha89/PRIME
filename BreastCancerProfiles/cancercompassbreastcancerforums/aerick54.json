    "Content": "I have Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma stage 1, grade 2.  I have had a lumpectomy and radiation, and have been taking femara since June, 2009.   I have all the same side effects everyone else on this site mentions.  The ones that bother me the most are the hot flashes (one every 40 minutes day and night) the extreme fatigue, and the bone and joint pain ( I have a hard time walking)  I am constantly in a battle with myself, should I stop taking them alltogether and have a better quality of life, or just stick with it because I would really like to see my 21 year old son through grad school etc.  I just wanted to talk to some of you in my position (I feel so bad for all of you).  I don't know one person that is on this that I can talk to in person, because no one I know is on this drug.  I am 56 years old.  I feel about 80 though, with the limitations from this drug.  Thank you for listening.  ",
