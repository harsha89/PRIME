      "Content": "You sound like you have a nickel allergy, as I do.  I recently had a bilateral mastectomy and had no problem whatsoever with one side and a constant infection on the other.  I was told there is no metal in the expanders, as I was very concerned given my allergy.  Had there been, I would have had problems with both!!! I wasn't healing well on the one side and was hospitalized and on heavy duty antibiotics and they were able to save my expander. I have no idea what would have caused your situation but I would not worry about the metal when you have them redone in the future. Good Luck!  ",

If any of you can offer me suggestions to have in my retail store such as, natural healing remedies, clothing and accessories that were of help to you, etc.  I would be truly greatful! Thanks Tammy",

      "Content": "I had immediate reconstruction following a bilateral last November and would recommend to anyone to do it at the same time if possible.  I started as DD cup and came out of surgery with expanders in and quite close to a B.  I had enough skin to expand me 300cc's at the time of surgery.  I now have 550cc silicone implants and am fitting into a 38C.  The expanders feel like armor in your chest and it was a great relief to have the exchange to silicone.  The weekly expansion was no big deal, advil did the job.  Good luck and if you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me.

      "Content": "Scheduled yesterday (Tuesday) for bilateral mastectomy.  Called 8am Monday morning to inform my breast surgeon that I had gotten a pretty bad head cold over the weekend.  Told they proceed anyways.  Got to the hospital at 7am, asked for Anesthesia to check me out prior to the dreaded Blue Dye injections.  Told I was a go because of no fever.  Had the dye at 8, went to a room, IV, countless visits from hospital staff and surgery at 12:30. The plastic surgeon, doing the reconstruction, was last in and ready to mark me 10 minutes before surgery.  She noticed I had a pretty bad cold.  She left and came back with the breast surgeon and informed me she did not want to do the surgery because of possible complications, especially if the cold ended in my chest.  I got a \"sorry\" from the breast surgeon...........They sent me home.  Yesterday, all I could do was cry!  Those of you who know the anxiety prior to this procedure, Can you imagine????  Today I am starting to get angry!!  I realize everything happens for a reason...........but I can't believe I have to go thru the whole process again.........Anyone face this one before?? ",

      "Content": "I was in your same situation.  They decided to send me to Boston for an MRI assisted biopsy to have clips put in, one in each breast as I had something they were watching in each.  They could not biopsy the area because they had no guidance as to how to get to the spots, which is why they opted for the clips.  Once those were in, they surgically went in, removed the clips and the areas around.  I was Diagnosed DCIS. With my history, I opted for a bilateral mastectomy.  I'm 8 months out and it has been very challenging but I have no regrets.  I'm 46. I also had to wait periods of 6 month spans.  Don't wait and don't listen to your gyno.......you don't want to wait to feel something!  Insist on proceeding further!  It's your body, take charge and don't be intimidated by anyone as they don't live your fear on a daily basis.  Good luck!!!",
