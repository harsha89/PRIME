      "Content": "Hi Joyce, thank you for replying to my question. My sister-in law , Sandra, saw her GP yesterday and was prescribed beta blockers and an anti anxiety pill. Her onc Dr didnt think there was a direct link. I,m not so sure. Sandra , up until her cancer always seemed to be able to roll with lifes punches ( unlike me) IÂ  have taken note of your medication and will discuss the pros and cons with her drs. She is only on her 2nd lot of arimedex so I doubt they will be very receptive to her changing at this stage. I have also made a note of klonopin. Obviously I need to look up klonopin and any other drugs which may be able to help. All this is new to Sandra and me , but i,m a fast learner (we hit he ground running) as I suppose most cancer sufferers do. Take care . Gail.",

      "Content": "Hi to everybody , I am carer to my sister-in law. I am trying to acertain whether or not there is a link to the horrific panic attacks she is experiencing and Arimedex. I hear lots of strories re; physical side effects , but not too much about the mental effects. Obviously I know there will be lots of causes , but she seems to think that this medication is the primary cause. I would be so grateful for any advice or anecdotes. Gail.",
