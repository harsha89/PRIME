      "Content": "Hey guys...I haven't been on here in so long, mostly because it's still so hard for me to write about my mom even though it's been over a year since she died. I get so jealous when I see all these other girls with their moms shopping and going to movies and getting their hair done. They really don't realize how lucky they are to have such amazing women in their life. I want my mom back. My dad has started dating again and I'm happy for him, because he's the kind of guy that deserves to be happy. He gave my mom EVERYTHING when she was sick, he never left her bedside in those final days, and he was so lost without her once she'd died. He deserves to be happy. But it's still hard for me to watch him send another woman flowers on Valentine's Day instead of my mom. It's hard period, to think that when I'm a senior in two years she won't be there to help me plan my graduation party. I just miss her so so so much. I would give anything to have her right beside me right now, holding me, telling me that it'll all be okay in the end.",

      "Content": "I don't know what it's like to have a spouse with breast cancer, but I do know its impacts on people. I remember days when I'd come home from school, eager to show my mom a good test grade, and she'd be so cross that she would yell at me for disturbing her. I just had to remember that this wasn't really her. If I was hopped up on all this crazy medicine I'd probably be a little cranky too. She died only a week ago, and I still regret getting mad when she was so sick. Just hang in there- one way or the other, you WILL make it. ",

      "Content": "Haven't been on here in a long time... things are going okay here. It's been a little over five months since Mom died, and I think we're finally accepting that this IS how our life will be from now on. I made varsity soccer (as a freshman!) and I'm really excited about that. My little brother and sister start their seasons tomorrow too. My sis made it in the summer community play, and my brother got elected class president awhile ago... but I'm sure you guys don't really want to hear about all that do you?   I was wondering if anybody had more information on the passing of the breast cancer gene. How you test for it, how you can get rid of it, the chances of getting it. I have a 50/50 change of inheriting it from my mom. I can honestly say the thought of getting it doesn't scare me... the thought of passing it on to my kids someday does. It's so strange now, never hearing the words \"chemo\" or \"rads\" or \"clinic\" around the house. I wouldn't call it nice... growing up with cancer, you just kinda get used to it, you know? Mom was diagnosed when I was four, so I never knew any different. Oh well. I'm just praying that if one of us three kids gets the gene, it's me.",
