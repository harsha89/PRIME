    "Content": "I started on FEMORA in May of 2009 I was on it for 14 months before I had a flair up similuar to the pain of the newlasta shot durring chemo. extensive bone and joint pain. I stayed on it for 3 more months but had a second flair up. I have now been given Aromasin. It soulds like they put you on the best first for your cancer first and then change when you build up resistance and side effects are unbarable. I guess with 3 drugs if I take each for about 18 months I will be to 5 years.I wish all of you well in your journey. Have a great thanksgiving holiday.",
