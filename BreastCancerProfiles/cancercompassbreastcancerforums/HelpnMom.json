    "Content": "Mom's backgrounds - 67 yrs old, had a mastectomy of LB last week, neighboring lymph nodes negative for cancer, prescribed Arimidex 1mg/day for 5 years, bone scan result from last year prompted family doc to prescribe Fosamax but she did not take it (sorry, I do not know the details of the bone scan result). My questions are: In my mom's case, is it better to take Arimidex or to just remove the other breast ... considering her age and the possible severe side effects of the drug? Are all side effects of Arimidex reversible? (In case she decides to take the drug and later to stop before the end of fifth year) Thank you for your help. Mei      ",
