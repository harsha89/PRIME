      "Content": "Hello, I am currently taking mgn-3 for metastatic (bone) breast cancer. I have not had any miraculous results, and have been taking it since November. I will say that I did not get any colds or flu this past winter, which is quite amazing. Mgn-3 is giving my family some hope in managing my disease. They don't feel quite so helpless. Best of luck!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Fran, I don't have an alternative treatment. My left hip was, also, causing me a lot of pain, due to bone mets. I was sent to a radiation oncologist, received 10 treatments (daily for two weeks) and my hip is about 85% better. It surely is not easy to keep up a full work week,while trying to stabilize the cancer, but I really found the treatments beneficial, as now the pain doesn't overwhelm me at work!! I wish you much luck and my prayers are with you.",

      "Content": "Hello. I am currently taking warfarin and faslodex too. I had a port put in, since my veins are junk! My physician also knew that the surgeon put me on warfarin, so I won't get any clots in the port. He did not seem concerned either. Perhaps we are both on a small dose. I will phone my doctor to double check, but please don't panic yet! Best of luck!",

      "Content": "I have bone mets after five years since my original diagnosis. I was treated with arimidex and zomeda, from November through February. I have also been given lupron shots, sice I wasn't menopausal enough. Recent bone scan and blood test show that the cancer is continuing to progress. Have been switched to femara, but my understanding is that arimidex and femera are practically the same. I would like to know if anyone has had better results with femera after arimidex. They will be checking blood again on March 25th, so I am wondering what is likely to be next if the femera isn't working. Thanks, and keep on surviving!!",
