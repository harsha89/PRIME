    "Content": "hi,    My mom died recently on 5th april 2013 due to chemotherapy complications.she was diagnosed pT3N0Mx breast cancer after pathological report of removed tumor was disclosed(she underwent masectomy surgery of her right breast).her estrogen progesterone receptor were positive and HER-2 was negative.the oncologist planned TAC chemotherapy and enrolled my mom in clinical trial of pegfilgrastim drug.necess ary consent was given by the family in this regard.a complete blood count test was done every day and reports of daily CBC were in possession of the doctor and his health team.my mom developed severe complications such as high fever(above 39 degree celcius),dierria,difficulty in breathing,inability to walk on 7th day after first chemotherapy drug was administered.she was immidiatly admitted in the ICU of the hospital after i reported it to the hospital staff.she died on 8th day due to febrile neutropenia (reason for death given by doctor).i suspected some foul play and miscalculation on the part of oncologist doctor and hence demended all chemotherapy treatment documents and chronological step by step squential discription leading to her death.after going through the documents i am extremly shocked and aghast to see that my mom's absolute neutrophile count started declining on 5th day(it was 8400),6th day it was 600 and on 7th day it was 275 which is an dengerious threshold point of severe neutropenia and infections.yet the doctor who was in possession of CBC report did not act swiftly by putting her in constant observation and monitoring at his hospital.by the time she was admitted for neutropenia her immune system was completely damaged to an irreparable extent.her oxygen saturation level also dropped to 90 % to 60% in last five hours.i personally feel that mom would have survived if the doctor had been more alert and attentive.before cancer could kill her it was chemotherapy that killed her.i never heard that a patient died within eight days of first chemotherapy admistration.is it a fit case of medical negligence.can i complain in police and the medical doctors regulatory body.i would be indebited to all those people who have through the suffrings of cancer of their near and dear ones and would like have advice and guidence from them",
