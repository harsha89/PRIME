    "Content": "Go to this website www.cancercenter.com and take a look...this is where I went for my stage 4 lung cancer (Cancer Treatment Centers of America) in Tulsa, OK. They believe in treating the whole body not just the infected part...I have had chemo and radiation along with naturopathic medicine, etc. I have trusted CTCA with my life since the beginning and totally believe in what they are doing. Please have your friend take a look at this site. I have finished my radiation treatment and have 4 more chemo treatments and have not been sick once. Believe me when I say, \"They take care of you at CTCA!\" Julia M.",
