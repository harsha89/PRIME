    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy on May 6 and received the news that I did indeed have Breast Cancer on May 12. I  had Brachytherapy at the beginning of this  month. The surgeon inserted the cathater for Mammosite on a Monday. Tuesday the Oncologist said the balloon did not fill the cavity so he removed the cathater and replaced it with one that had 7 wires which each had to be hooked up to the radiation machine. This one also left an area untreated, so I only went through 3 days of Brachy although had to endure having the cathater in for 5 days. I was told that was a \"boost\" and will still need external radiation, but not for as many weeks as I would have without  the Brachy.  While I hated having this object inside me for 5 days, I am grateful that this option exists and grateful to every person who has ever donated to cancer research as well as those who perform the research. I was told that this option gives the odds of recurrance as a masectomy. If I had been told a masectomy would give me better odds, I would have had one! ",
