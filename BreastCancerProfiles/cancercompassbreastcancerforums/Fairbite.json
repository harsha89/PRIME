      "Content": "To see the alternative therapies of my choice, go to the following web addresses. www.brightspot.org www.gerson.org These two centers are non-profit organizations.  Between them they have about 90 years of successfully treating critically ill patients...from all around the world.  Their therapies are non-toxic, and do not wreck the immune system or the quality of life of the patient.  These alternative therapies enhance conventional therapies thru synergistic action.  They reduce or eliminate pain.  They reduce or eliminate side effects from the chemo, as well.  Best to you.........Morgan",

      "Content": "Your statements regarding a \"cure\" are more fantasy than truth, or perhaps a bit of brain wash.  It sounds like you're trying to sell something to someone.  My cancer research spans more than 40 years.  I've studied both the conventional and alternative therapies, as applied in the US and around the world.  As to what we know about chemo in this country:  there are some successes in treating breast cancer, some children's cancers, and testicular cancers. You are correct about the \"early detection\" message. Morgan     ",
