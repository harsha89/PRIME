    "Content": "Hi, My father was diagnosed with a rare (one of nine people in the whole world), a mix of neuroblastoma and adenocarcinoma in his paranasal cavity.  Anyway, after diagnosis, three days later, he had resection of the tumor that had invated his braine tissue.  Doctors were unable to remove parts of the cancer that were in various nerves. He was deaf and lost strength. Shortly after, maybe a week, we found out it spread to the CSF.   Doctors placed a port in his brain for IT therapy.  He got it in combination of six treatments of partial brain radiation. He now receives Xeloda and Temodor. Yesterday, we found out that his CSF was free of cancer cells on the test they did. We know it's not a cure, but I am hoping this means we have a bit more time with him. He does have a feeding tube as he is unable to swallow.  He is completely deaf, and one of his eyes does not blink. He communicates with a dry erase board and sends text messages on his cell phone. The doctor is still hopeful he will regain his hearing and he is unsure if it is from swelling from radiation.  The hard part is knowing if the treatment or the cancer is causing some of the newly developed conditions. This is a terrible disease.",
