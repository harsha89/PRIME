They said a period of 6 months, and now it's been 2 years he lives happily and healthy. He was undergone an ayurvedic treatment. Dear Sir/Madam, One of my relatives is suffering from stage 4 breast cancer.  After reading your comments, I thought I should try similar ayurvedic treatment for her.  Please provide the doctor and location details so we can approach him/her for the treatment.  Appreciate your help.",
