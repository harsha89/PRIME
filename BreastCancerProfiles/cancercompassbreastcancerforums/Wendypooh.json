    "Content": "Please April listen to the advice of someone who went thru \"a holding pattern\". Get this checked out to the fullest extent of medical testing. When I was 40 years old, I also had a older doctor. My boyfriend found a lump on the bottom side of my left breast. Went to the doctor and he sent up a diagnostic mamo and found nothing. His reply was mammoary gland swollen. For the next 6 years mammos yearly, nothing. One morning when getting out the the shower, raised my arms to comb my hair and there it was a dimpling of my breast that was only visable with my arms raised. This went on until getting closer to my next gyn visit but something told me better call early. By this time had a young gyn doctor, who knew about the lump, he felt my breast, same as always. It was then I raised my arms and let him look at the dimpling. From then out it was a whirl-wind. Surgeon, byopsy, lumpectomomy, chemo, radiation. Stage 11 lobular carcinoma, with micrometastasis in one node. Had I went to the doctor when the dimpling first started or had the lump removed who can tell. Please have this checked out so maybe you won't have to go thru what I did. My advice to my friends, if it is not supposed to be there, get it out. Seek medical attention because the longer you wait if the diagnose is cancer, survival rates are higher when you catch it early. I am a survivor since 2003 and plan to stay around for awhile. Good luck and God speed.",
