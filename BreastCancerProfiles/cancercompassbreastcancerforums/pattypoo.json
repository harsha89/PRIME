      "Content": "hello sisters We're all in this together and what a blessing this site is. I was diagnosed with BC 3.5 yrs ago, was on tamoxifen for 3 yrs and then had pain, severe hot flashes, etc.My onocologist switched me to aromasin. Just like everyone else has said the fingers, hands, knees, feet pain is awful. I asked my breast surgeon if he thought I should stay on aromasin for 1 more yr.He said yes, but my onocologist said he didn't think I evn needed it cause my cancer is not likely to come back.I'm afraid to go off it. I feel like everyone else, like an old woman. May all of you be blessed with good health!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for listening",
