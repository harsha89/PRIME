      "Content": "Why there is no ovarian cancer group? Is that because they are all dead? I am scared. Having a panic attack. Suddenly things came to my mind, I am a self-employed contractor. If I have cancer, I do not know what to do. How long does it take to recover to normal activity after cancer treatment? Should I get a short term disability insurance? Long term disability insurance? From where? I have no one in this country besides God. Will have a surgery soon. Any info, any info is greatly appreciated.",
