    "Content": "Hello, I'm new to this board and am searching for some answers and hope someone can help :) I am 39, was diagnosed with BC in 2008. I had a lumpectomy with 21 nodes removed - 17 positive for cancer as well as her2 positive. I received chemo as well as 25 radiation treatments and 1 yr of herceptin. I am still experiencing pain in both my upper thighs. It can be so bad I cannot sleep - has anyone else gone through this so long after chemo has ended? Has anyone had long term side effects from herceptin? I have done some investigating and due to my balance being off and dizzy spells along with the leg pain I read about neuropathy which somewhat sounds like what I'm going through but not quite the same...I don't have burning pain, it is more like constantly having aches from the flu or what arthritis sounds like for those that have it. Also it is in my upper thighs and from what I've read neuropathy affects more the lower portion of the leg. I'm very frustrated. My oncologist sent me to a psychiatrist thinking I may have depression from the pain or pain from the depression?!?!? The psychiatrist said I do not have depression and that he believes it is residual from the taxotere...myalgia? However he did try me on Cymbalta and it made me feel like I was walking around in a haze and I couldn't take it. In the meantime because my oncologist was not timely with his reports to my benefits provider for long term disability - I was cut off! Now he is sending me to a rheumatologist...I have never had  arthritis - is this not a Dr that specializes in arthritis? I have had to seek a lawyer to fight the insurance company and now I feel like I am getting depressed over all this! Has anyone ever or is there anyone out there going through similar pain as I am? Did anyone ever get a proper diagnosis? How long did it last for? My oncologist said this is unusual - I just find that sooooo hard to believe! It is as if he feels he's done his job and I should be ok....is it possible I do have neuropathy but it just isn't exhibiting the usual symptoms? I have always had a high pain tolerance and thought maybe some of the symptoms I'm just not feeling - a long shot I know but I'm just searching for answers! Any input is greatly appreciated!",
