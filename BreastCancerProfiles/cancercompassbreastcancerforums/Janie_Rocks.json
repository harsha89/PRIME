Nancy Psalm 103:1 - 3   Hi Nancy;  I am just starting my second round with Xeloda and have been on Zometa for a year with various other drugs.  So the two together have so far had almost side effects - what has been your experience - what about foot and hand syndrome and how long have you been on Xeloda? I noticed you offered a passage from Psalms - my favorite book in the Bible.  I spend a lot of time there gaining strength and hope.",

      "Content": "Hi Jackie;  Lucky you living in Florida, what part?  Two of my kids live in St Petersburg.  One is moving to Miami if they ever sell their home.  I think a tram flap is a great decision and I would do it if I had the decision to make over.  My implants didn't turn out well and I still have to wear prosthesis because they are so small and not equal in size. A lot of your decision depends on your age and lifestyle as well.  If you are young and active, it is more important to feel good about your body.  Thus, you wouldn't want to just go with prosthesis.  As long as you have enough tummy tissue the tram is a great way to go.  The recovery isn't pleasant but then what surgery is?  And in the long run you have so much less to worry about.  Good Luck, I hope you love the results.  My breast cancer metastacised last year and is in the bone now but I am doing very well and even though it is stage four there are still lots of new drugs to keep me going so I am very optomistic about how much time I have left. I was not able to take Herceptin - it is one of the newer wonder drugs so you are lucky to be herceptin positive.  Keep in touch,  Janie",

I was diagnosed on July 5, 2006.  I chose to have a double on July 21,2006 because I knew I could never face this again.  I was not able to do my reconstruction at the same time because my plastic surgeon was on vacation and I just wanted the cancer under control and decided not to wait even a week.  I am glad because this has given me time to research and decide which way I want to go.  I have also gained about 20 pounds and would like to not have this when I have my next surgery.  I walk at least a mile a day on the treadmill and try to watch what I eat, I have 3 more taxol treatments and then I will start harmone therapy and will continue with herceptin.  For me personally, waiting has been right.  I have had so much time to think and adjust.  I will answer any questions you have and will pray for you.  Good Luck  Hello;  I had a bilateral almost 8 years ago by choice and reconstruction immediately.  I 've never been sorry about the decision to go bi-lateral, only about the choice to have reconstruction at the same time.   If I had it to do over again I would wait and do more research on which way to go. I think it is a wise decision to take both breasts, especially with your history.  It isn't that hard to get over having both removed and I think you wil be happy not to have the stress and worry about finding cancer in the breast that is left if you don't have both removed.  I wish you the best outcome possible and feel free to respond or ask any questions you might have. My name is Janie and I live in Illinois.",

Hi Janie, I participated in a drug study involving Xeloda studying the effects good or bad of Adriamycin, Cytoxan, followed by Taxotere alone or Taxotere and Xeloda have on breast cancer.  I was chosen to take the Xeloda.  I had a pretty hard time with the added drug.  I had chemo for six months then 33 treatments of radiation which was a walk in the part compared to the chemo.  I believe I had hand foot syndrome although no blisters...just felt like blisters!  I am still taking medication for neuroapathy which shows no signs of letting up after three years.  Sometimes I think it is hard for the doctor and the patient to tell the difference between the two maladies if there is not a breakout of blisters.  What are your symptoms? Best wishes and good luck to you.  Linda Lou      Hi Linda Lou;  I don't have many symptoms yet, just increased neuropothy in toes and fingers and burning feet and cracks and small blisters on finger tips.  Also can't stand hot water on hands.  I put udder cream (highly recommended) on them hundreds of times a day and sometimes slather my hands and sleep with cotton gloves on all night.  My symptoms are better since the dosage was lowered.  I'm on Xeloda all by itself and Zometa monthly. By the way, I've had neuropothy since my first bout with cancer almost 7 years ago. Thanks for answering my message",
