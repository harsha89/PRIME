    "Content": "Hi Kay, I'm sorry but I don't know the answer to your question but any info you get will be of interest to me.  It sounds as though we may have the same thing -- I was recently diagnosed with angiosarcoma of the breast, probably caused by radiation therapy in 1994 for breast cancer.  I'm scheduled for a radical mastectomy on 5/1.  So how are you doing?  When was your surgery?  All the answers are probably here on this board but I'm new and don't quite understand how to \"work\" it.  I haven't found anyplace to look for info on this type of cancer and am writing you in the hope of finding more info.  I hope you are feeling well and will have a rapid and uneventful recovery.  Please PM me if you have any info or would like to share experiences. Sincerely, Dianne (--Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed. Consider private reply.
