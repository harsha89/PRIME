It's a battle but I love life so much I will fight as long as possible. I started a new nutrition plan. Lots of supplements. I feel like a million bucks. Everything i eat is plant based. what a difference! The nutrition is fighting the cancer too along with the chemo. Do that for yourself. The medications and surgeries do not prevent future occurrences. Changing your diet will!, I can not believe how different I feel....no aches or pains...energy galore. Vitamin D....have y ou had your D level checked? This is a big one. Ties right in to breast cancer. I am taking vitamin d supplements...b12, Oncolite, estro-dim. Mushroom maitaike and many others You need to do everything you can for yourself...not just what oncology tells us. Keep in touch.",
