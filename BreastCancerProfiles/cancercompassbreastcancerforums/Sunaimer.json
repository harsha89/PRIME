It sounds like we have the same types of cancer, etc.  I am stage I, ER/PR+, no node involvement, oncotype test score of 25.  They want me to do cytoxan orally for 26 weeks, and methotrexate intravenously for 26 weeks, followed by radiation and tamoxifen.  Can you tell me how the chemo affected you and what type was used on you?  Thank you!  I need to make decisions fast",

My oncotype score is 25.  I am 44 years old.  I had two small tumours side by side 1.2 cm and .8 cm.  The 1.2 cm tumor is the one they tested for oncotype score of 25.  Are you a doctor or nurse?  I truly appreciate your advice. Thank you.",
