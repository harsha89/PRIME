He says I have one year in the short term to live and 3 to 4 long term if I go through chemo? Anyone else going through this? I'm wondering what else I can do - are we being aggressive enough? Thanks for all help. Jan",

      "Content": "Barb - Thanks for your reply. The others all worked for me - each one about half the time as the previous one - the last being Aromasin for about 1 year. How are you doing now? Are you still on chemo? Have been battling for 15 years and am feeling a bit fearful of what might be next. Thanks for your answer - it helps to know someone else is at this same place in our lives.
