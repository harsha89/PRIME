    "Content": "HI everyone, I'm very new to this, so please bear with me. My mom was recently diagnosed with Met Breast Cancer that has spread to her left lung and bones. She's currently on Taxol and Avastin, and has only had 3 treatments. She's been feeling down and i'm trying to get as much information so I can keep her positive and strong. Now, she's starting to lose her hair, nauseous and feeling tired after 2pm. We don't find out if the treatment is working until 2 weeks from now. My mom is an extremely strong woman, but I fear that her mental strength may get the best of her. Can anyone give me any insights to typical side effects (I've read all of the pamphlets) and what we can expect or any words of wisdom? I don't want to lose faith yet and I'm going to be strong. Thank you ALL for any response... Hugs, Michelle",
