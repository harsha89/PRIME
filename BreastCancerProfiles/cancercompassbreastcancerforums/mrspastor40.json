      "Content": "I found a lump that was more than 5 cm in size in 6/09.  I had a mammogram every year for 12 years prior to this and nothing was found.  At the point of finding the lump I went to my doctor.  They sent me for another mammogram and nothing was found.  They then did an ultrasound and said they could not find anything.  But they could feel it and I could feel it.  I had been told my breasts were dense up til this time.  The radiologist came in and did something different with the machine(changing the color of  image) and then was able to see the lump.  I was told as long as I have dense breasts an MRI will be necessary.  You should definitely insist on an MRI.  Insurance now acknowledges this and it should be covered. ",

      "Content": "I don't know about a week to get results.  I got mine within a few days.  Some doctors insist on giving results in their office.  I have never had a cyst so I don't know about the popping sensation.  It kind of makes sense that it could be a cyst.  I have heard that cancerous tumors are not painful but they are hard and do not move. They are usually fixed.",
