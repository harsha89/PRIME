      "Content": "Yes I agree with you 100%. I too was diagnosed with fibromyagilia. Kept have all over pain.  Started having seizures and got a  blockage in my intestines.  The  Dr did an xray and found out where the blockage was and also found out that I had kidney cancer  in which I had had for 6 years and was never  diagnosed.  I was so sick throwing up and having seizures and scaring my family to death.  I feel like the lord caused me to get the blockage  so the Dr would find the cancer.  I wouldnt be here if they hadn't found it.  But since my kidney has been removed I feel so much better.  The cancer was poisoning NY body.  But now after 6 years I'm having pain where my kidney was.  Bad stabbing grabbing breath taking pain.  But the drs  don't know what could be causing it. Ut hurts to move . I have been to the emergency room  no answers. Good luck with your  problems.Keep me posted. Ok My prayers are with you .",
