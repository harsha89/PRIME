    "Content": "Hi I finished treatment for breast cancer in December 2008. during the time i was being treated for the breast cancer the Dr found high calcium levels, at first they thought the cancer had metastasized to another location but the pathology did not support that. the breast cancer was dcis or non invasive. The hypercalcemia was due to an adenoma on my parathyroid gland after having it removed my calcium levels have returned to normal. good luck let me know what happens",
