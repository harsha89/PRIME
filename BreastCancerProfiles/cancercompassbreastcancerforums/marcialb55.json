    "Content": "Hi Dehrah, Stage 4 May 2011, thats what the doctors said.  I was also diagnosed In 2004 with Stage 1c. Be encouraged there are many others out there. My own experience, my faith has got me through this. I am on Ameridex, my joints hurt so bad until I started taking the Krill oil tablets, its a fish oil tablet.  I read it on a blog somewhere.  Please, please try it. My hands on a morning use to be stiff and hurting.  I complained to my doctor and she said she will switch me to Femara, did not want that either since I heard that it makes your joint hurt as well. Try it for 3 days without using any other pain killers and let me know how you feel. its worth a try.  I get my tablets from Dr Mercola site, its the real deal at his site...no fillers and vegetable capsules.... I too had to change my eating habits...I walk into most grocery stores and there is not much for me there.....most of the foods are processed... I eat mostly organic now even to the chicken and fish (wild)... it was a Big adjustment but totally worth it.....I feel so much better... My last PET SCAN they barely saw anything....not easily detected they said. GOD is good. Some other things I've done is drink organic Aloe Juice 2 ounces every day now I may just do 4 times a week. Hot lemon water in the morning at least 4 times a week. help alkaline your body.....fresh garlic tea ...no sugar....no wheat (the wheat my alternate doctor said is too processed now.  My bread is Rice bread or Sprouted bread... I hope you feel better....please keep in touch both of you ......much love...... Lynn",
