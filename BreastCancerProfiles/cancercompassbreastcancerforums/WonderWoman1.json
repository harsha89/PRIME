Maybe not hidding it, will give u less insecurities , that is if u feel comfortable with it, you dont have to make cancer look easy, dont be so hard on yourself, and be kind to yourself. They can adjust and adapt.   Or.. i guess the hats give u away, have you tried a bun ( if u have long hair ) or maybe a hairband? Or carry one of those rollers with u, the sticky ones?  P.S. ur a trooper, treatment and the GYM! wish i had ur strenght :) ",

Yuck, i have 5 more to go, the last one was so harsh on me! Anyways, what ive decided to do after chemo, is to fully detox my body with juices and herbal teas and foods.  Ive made a list of alternative stuff that i would like to follow up on for recovery and preventing recurrence, like metformin, low dose aspirin etc and bunch of other supplements that boost the immunesystem, oxygen therapy and an occasional vitamin C IV, still researching other options that i can add to my routine, so a mix of alternative and conventional, and a splash of healthy , oh yeah and i would like to do some fasting every three months or two months in the hope to reset my system. I know its not exactly in the same range as your plan, but since everything is so close and far for me now this is my plan for now, and to be honest ive checked some immunotherapies out aswell, but most of them seem out of range cause u get them when ur \" sick\" again, and not preventive",
