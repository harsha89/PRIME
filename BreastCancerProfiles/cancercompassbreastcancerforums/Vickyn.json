      "Content": "I had a stereotactic breast biopsy in 1999 then came back fibroadenoma. This was good news. I had my mammogram in March and it was abnormal- then back for compression views. The spot where the fibroadenoma was diagnosed by the sterotactic procedure has doubled in mass size from 2004-2005 mammogram. I have consulted a surgeon on recommendation from the radiologist. I am schedule for needle localization in xray then to the OR for excision of all of the mass. Also, another spot in the same breast they want to do ultrasound guided core biopsy samples. So, I go to ultrasound first to get poked who knows how many times then to needle localization for more pokes. They do not give you and IV sedation or any sedation at all in xray when you are going through this procedure. Please share with me your experiences with needle localization and ultrasound biopsy. My anxiety of course is right up there high afraid it is going to be terrible painful. Along with the fact I have been waiting like 5 weeks to get on the surgery schedule. Please share with my your experiences with needle local and ultrasound biopsy from a patient's viewpoint so I know what to expect beforehand. Thank you kindly, I try to think this is just the fibroadenoma returning. However; no one knows that not even the surgeon until the final pathology report is in. Thank you for any replies. I am anxious. Miss Vicky",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies. I sure do appreciate it. Yes, like the one reply I agree I am more anxiety over the procedures themselves then the diagnosis. I am thinking fibroadnemona the first time and has reoccured in my mind. I pray. Thank you all for your experiences. Vicky",
