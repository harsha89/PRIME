    "Content": "Hello- Message boards are new to me, but here goes.  I had a radical mastectomy in 1974, then a lumpectomy in 1991. Both times were followed with radiation.  Now here it is 2007 and I find myself with mestatatic breast cancer in my lungs and bones.  Anyone out there have a track record with something like this? I am a fighter and a survivor and I feel strong about my good response since diagnosis last month with Femara.  The pain is gone and the lymph nodes that were affected have shrunk about half the size they were. Just wanted to compare notes with someone.  Thanks",
