My biopsy came back neg fibroadenoma. But the dr don't like the way the lump looks he's not comfortable with it so he wants it out right away. I go for surgery on the 29th. what worry me is that the ill feeing i'm getting is not only in my mind but also the dr mind.  But i will stay positive so you do the same girl hang in there and let me know ok.",

They face it and deal with it in private it's just they don't let anyone in. which really in a since is betrayal to those closes to them because we are on the outside of their emotion and trying to peek in wanting to share the emotion, but they just won't let us in. Terrible feeing. Just let them know that you are there and wait for them to let you in to that room of thier mind... God bless",

Iif that happens it can be harder to treat. so it make sense to eliminate that possiblity. cancer is very sneaky it has to be rooted out. you and your Dr should approach cancer in a very radical way or it will overcome you. Determine and perpose your mind, body and spirit to fight this with all you have, remember its an enemy to your body an enemy who refuses to die so you must be determine to kill it. I have lost far too many people from this foul thing call cancer.",
