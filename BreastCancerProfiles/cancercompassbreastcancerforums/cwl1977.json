    "Content": "Not sure if I have cancer yet but I am worried. I found a lump under my left breast about 6 months ago. It was small and I thought nothing of it, however over the last 2 months it has greatly increased in size and pain. I have also been having weird allergic reaction where I break out all over in itchy hives that I am certain are not food related. I finally just went to the doctor and they said it does not feel like a cyst and they are sending me to have complete blood work and a physical. Again not even sure yet but wanted to get some advice.",
