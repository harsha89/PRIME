    "Content": "I'm 33 years old I've always had lumpy breast but last year I noticed a large lump in the left breast. They did a ultrasound it came back negative so did the mammogram. I noticed 2 weeks ago that the same lump I had checked out last year is larger. Once again I did an ultrasound it was negative then a mammogram it came back with with a cluster of microcalcification. I go next week to see a surgen. I'm freaking out. Am I being to paranoid ???",
