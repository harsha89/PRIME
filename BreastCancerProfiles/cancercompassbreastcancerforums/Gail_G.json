      "Content": "Just over a year ago, I found out I had breast cancer - it was found in my liver first. I had eight treatments of taxotere, surgery to remove the lump in my breast and now I am on my ninth round of Xeloda. My tumor markers have dropped dramatically and I continue to work (teacher). I am told there is no cure but I am praying for remission. Would like to hear from anyone with a similar diagnosis to compare treatments and share the experience. Gail G.",
