In a nutshell, my 46 y/o wife had stage 1, lymph node-negative breast cancer , with the tumor being under 2cm. The oncologist has informed us that she wants to administer this Cytoxan and Taxotere cocktail every three weeks for a total of 4 treatments...this along with the usual tamoxifen treatment and radiation. We're not sure what to do because my opinion is that this seems to be a bit extreme based on the circumstances...or maybe not. Any opinions? Thanks for the help. I had the cytoxin and adryamyican and taxatore....I had estrogen positive, node negative 3 cm tumor. .Now mind you, EVERYONE responds different but there are similarties. So you NEED to talk to your doctor. I had a world class doctor. I did ok with the first two, they did what was called \"dense dosing. which the body tends to acceptbe better. I did lose my hair around the third treatment.  Do get a wig and get the hair cut very short. Its a bit painful coming out so be careful brushing, the scalp gets very sensitive. I had a bad allergic reaction to the taxator, this happened  on the second dose.  It is quite aggressive but before you continue you should see the pathologist report to find out four things: if it is estrogen and or progesterone positive, Her2 and another that tells how aggressive the tumor is at growing. Talk with her and her doctor and understand WHY they want to treat her with just those two. My suggestion also is, if you want GET A SECOND OPINON. I did and I went with the second opinion..  I went to  CTCA in Zion, Illinois, was happy with the treatment even though I was allergic to the Taxatore. I liked the way the doctor answered ALL my questions such as yours. They wanted to treat mine as aggressively because test showed that the chance of reoccurrance in studies showed better results of the cancer not  coming back. Not a guareentee mind you, more like peace of mind. I am also going thru radiation therapy, the hardest part of this is my husband is a therapist and has the feelings of a porcupine!! I don't like the burns, my skin is very sensitive. You and your wife's best thing to do, is to sit down and talk with the doctor. If he/she doesn't take the time to talk and answer ALL your questions, then it's time for a second opinion. Good luck to you and your wife. PLEASE get peace of mind and get a second opinion. It does help.          ",

I'm opposed to the markings they want to put on my body for seven weeks and they are also suggesting tattoos but I'm not happy with that alternative either, is there ANY other way to do this without mutilating the patients body any more than it already is?????? I'm so angry and  upset that this HAS to be done and you have no choice in it at all, it's YOUR body for crying out loud  they've advanced  radiation therapy a lot in the many years it's been around,  find something that doesn't mutilate or make the patient feel uncomfortab le",
