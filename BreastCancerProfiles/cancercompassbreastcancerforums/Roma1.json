Always give some sort of positive energy to the patient as well as the people who are caring the patient. I know a person who is still living happily after being discharged off from hospital saying that there is no hope on his life. They said a period of 6 months, and now it's been 2 years he lives happily and healthy. He was undergone an ayurvedic treatment. Hi , plz can u give us the address of that Ayurvedic treatment. My mom is suffering stage 4 stomach cancer. Looking for alternative treatments. Thx",
