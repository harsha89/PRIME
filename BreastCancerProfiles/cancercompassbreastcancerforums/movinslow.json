    "Content": "I am with you, no history.  I did drink soy milk around the time when my tumor started. I had 12 lymph nodes removed and only was cancerous. I only had radiation and have taken arimadex for 5 years as of March.  I did that so I wouldn't get uterine cancer.  I got it anyways and had chemo and radiation. You could go back to tamoxifen since you have had a hysterectomy. I did have a lot of joint pain, especially my shoulder, which still is very painful today. It will be hard to avoid soy. Good Luck    ",
