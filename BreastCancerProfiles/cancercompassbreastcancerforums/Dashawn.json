      "Content": "Yes I do - I have found that if I wear a sleeveless undershirt I can wear anything sleeveless shirt. The best stor in my area is Cato as far a fashion and prices. Not sure if they have a web site or not. I also wear the undrshirt if I want to wear anything with a v-neck or scoop. I have fun with and play with all the diffrent colors making up diffrent combos to go along with and hats or wraps I might want to wear. I think we should have all have fun with this if we can - we have no choice about missing breast or being bald but we can make it fun if we choose. On your swimming did you buy the swim prosthesis? I did and it has been worth it, the suit is a little expensive ($108.00) but after I spent that much I found a wonderful website that had them for a little less. tlcdirect.org - this site is the best for hats, scarfs, and other items you may need.

I did okay on the 1st chemo - other that we discovered I am allergic to the anti nausea med and we had to change that. I had to go see the doc today - I have an ear infection and am having stress headaches. But she gave me antibotics and that should take care of that. How are you doing? I would love to hear about you instead of always talking about me.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in the left breast in 5/05. I went in for my yearly check up as a 22 year survivor of cancer - by the way I am only 33 years old. I have always been good at going in for a yearly female check up and have had a mammogram every year since I was 25. I have had 1 lump removed from the right breast that was not cancer. So when this one showed up on the sonogram and mammogram this year a needle biopsy was done. My family, myself and my OB/GYN were stunned when this one came back malignant. I was sent off to the surgeon of my choice and had a left mastectomy with 3 lymphnodes removed (test stated no node activity)- recovered well from this. I have elected not to have reconstruction yet as I wish to have the right breast removed in a year as a precaution and have been adviced that this is a wise decision by my doctor. Went to my 1st oncology visit to be sent on a testing course ( echo, bone scan, and CT Scan) the CT showed a 3 cm node that needed to be removed for further testing. But before we got the resluts from all of the test it was recommended that I have a port-cath placed as my veins are very small and blow very easy. Then came the CT news and another surgery. This time I had 7 nodes removed and yesterday we were told that 3 were malignant. My tumors are not hormone positive (not sure if that is good or bad). I am waiting as patiently as I can for 7/05/05 as that is my new target date to start chemo. with radation to follow. I will be having a PET scan 7/6/05 and am very nervious. My question is has anyone had a non-hormone Breast Cancer diagnosis and how are you doing and what was/is your treatment?",

If I have to lose it - I wanted it to be my way. So we cut it and then shaved it the rest of the way. I have had my 1st round of chemo and have 7 more to go - then radation. I will do the recontruction after that.",

      "Content": "I have wnet through the same thoughts and process. Here is what I discovered, I can wear a sleeveless shirt and one with a v-neck by just putting on a sleeveless undershirt and it helps cover the scars as well I am sure of radation markings. As for swimming - you did not mention if you have the swim prosthesis or not - I have that goes in the $100.00 bc patient swim suit that I bought and it floats alittle but not enough to stop me from swimming or just getting in the water with my son. I am not sure where you live but the best store I found here in West Texas for shirts is Cato, they have the last fashions and are very fair priced. Keep me posted on your search. Lots of Luck ChrisinTX",

      "Content": "if you are this uncomfortable please seek a 2nd, 3rd or even a 4th opinion. I had a from of ovrain cancer at age 12 and had 1 ovary and part of the other tube removed. My parents were told that at anytime I decided to marry and have children that it could be repaired, well this was not so. Due to massive scar tissue the tube was unable to be repair. So we went through IVF and my body reject 3 embryos, this was after many injections and almost a divorce over the mental stress. After 6 long years we adopted our son at birth, i have never regeretted this as he means the world to me. However I had a very hard time emtionally and mentally when we were told that I would never be able to have children. I had a complete hystorectomy in 2004 and 13 months later was diagnosed with hormone negative BC. My OB/GYN and the surgeon agreed that a lumpectomy would not work because of the size of the tumor and surrounding issue, I had the left breast and lymphnodes removed and have started chemo with radation to follow. I am also very young I will be 34 on 7/22. Cancer knows no age - but you can get through this with lots of prayer and having Jesus to guide you. Please keep me updated. DaShawn",

As I am a breast cancer patient I also tend to look at those sights. The ACS has a program for bc patients called reach to recovery, check to see if they might have some thing like that for your type of cancer. They will send out a volunteer that has survived your type of cancer and they are pack with information and things you need. Also speak with you local cancer center about support groups in your area.

I am 33 going to be 34 on 7/22 and this is my 2nd battle with cancer. It could not get me at age 12 and it will not get me now. I was diagnosed in 5/05 with BC - not what I wanted to hear but have learned to deal with it. Instead of being negative I try to be postive about it. My best friend told me on a bad day that she wished she sould take away the pain she would gladly bear it for me. I told her never - this was my battle and my cross to bear. God has a purpose and a reason and I will know what it is one day. Something that always gets me through is this , \" GOD OF THE MOUNTAIN IS GOD OF THE VALLEY\" my husband preached on this once and that everyone has to go through the valley to get up that mountain. Another thing that I remember is the ending is better than the begining - this is in the Bible. When things get tough I get on my knees and start praying and telling Satan that he must flee at the mear mention of Jesus, this always calms me. When I am having a really bad day, which is usually chemo and 4 days following I spend alot of time listening to soothing music and sounds, this also helps keep me calm and relaxed. I have a 3 year old son and i keep his picture with me at all times when i need to have a reminder as to why i do not give up - I pull it out and have a look - this is why i get up everyday and why i can and will fight with all of my might. So instead of Why Me? change that to Why Not Me? Who can i help - pray that God will open the door for you to help another person that has the Why Me syndrome.
