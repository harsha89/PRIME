    "Content": "I am on taxol/herceptin just had my 6th treatment yesterday at first it was just the \"normal\" joint muscle pains that they say taxol is notorious for..had an appt w my onc and NP yesterday and they didn't seem to concerned about it just said it's the muscle and joint pain from the meds ..when I had my 5th treatment before this one it was the usual took about a day or two for it to start but the back pain hasn't really let up since then and usually it does til the next round it's a lower pain runs kinda down into top part of my right buttcheek..a dull pain mostly I'n the mornings it wakes me up and seems to feel better w movement..I'm not for any pain killers at all so my doc told me to rake Tylenol everyday to keep the pain away of course not to suffer but I just of course can't help but to think of mets to the spine even tho I'm I'n the middle of treatment..anyone have any advice or similar experience to share would be greatly appreciated???? Thanks!",
