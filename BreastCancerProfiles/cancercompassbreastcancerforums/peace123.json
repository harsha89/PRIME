    "Content": "My Daughter was diagnosed last September 2017 with Triple neg breast cancer. She decided to go to Mexico for alternative treatment. Very expensive. Three weeks later she came back looking great.She did everything they said to do at home but her tumor grew larger. She then raised the money to go to a Doctor in Reno who does a blood test and sends it to out of country to see which chemo works for her body. They found 2 out of 10 types worked for her type of cancer. She was in Reno 3 weeks (also expensive) came home and the results were amazing. She was on about 50 vitamins & minerals, some medications. She also had wonderful results. But it went to her lungs and brain after a short time. This type of cancer is very agressive as you know. Skip the alternative and go to chemo & radiation. This cancer is very hard to kill. I think if she had gone to Reno first it may have put her in remission. She is at Kaiser now but all they have is a very few types of chemo. So do your research and pray for a miracle. Prayer helps. If you need to talk you may respond.",
