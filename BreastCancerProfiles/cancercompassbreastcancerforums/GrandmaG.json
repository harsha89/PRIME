      "Content": "Hi there! I have been on Letrozole for about a year and my hair is thinning too!  Every time I shampoo I rinse off enough hair to see it go down the drain.  Like you my scalp is not showing yet but it always makes me cringe.  I tell myself that it's not a big price to pay since Tamoxifen made me miserable and I'm glad to be on Letrozole now.  It is dismaying though.  I don't know what to do or if anything can be done.  I'm convinced that the Letrozole is keeping my stage 4 with bone mets at bay so I'll not complain too much.  Good luck to you and God bless.",

      "Content": "Oh, Tamoxifen was so much torture for me!  In 2009 I had both breasts removed and my Onc put me on Tamoxifen.  I took it for 3 years and then quit it because of the side effects.  Every side effect you mentioned was my case.  I developed a huge (and I mean HUGE) fibroid tumor within 4 months of starting the Tamoxifen and had to have a hysterectomy.  My Gyno said it was likely the Tamoxifen but my Onc. said that was ridiculous.  Anyway, it really messed me up.  Had just started a new job and it was so bad I had to quit because I was so unable to learn.  Well, 5 years later my cancer came back so I'm stage 4 with bone mets.  I wish now I'd have made other choices.  Hate hate the way Tamoxifen messed me up!  Now I take the Letrozole and get Xgeva shots once a month.  If Tamoxifen would have kept me cancer free I still don't know if I would have took it.  I have a new Onc. now and he's great.  Told me that even though I didn't make the 5 years on Tamoxifen, it likely wouldn't have made a difference.",
