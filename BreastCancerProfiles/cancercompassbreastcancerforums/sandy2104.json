    "Content": "I had surgery for stomach cancer Feb 5, 2013 and it was determine that the cancer had gotten into my lip nodes. I completed chemo, chemo/radiation and more chemo. Now that my treatment is completed I still have pain on my upper left side and the doctors have not been able to determine the cause. I\u2019ve had EGD, CT, small bowel series, and x-rays. Today I looked at my test from this week and my Alkaline Phosphatase, Ferritin, Folate, and B12 are all elevated. I think I may have\u2019Blind Loop Syndrome\u2019. Anyone have any other ideas or suggestions this is driving me crazy. I am sick of being in pain. My doctor keep offering me pain pills and gave me the OK to return to work. I returned to work to make sure I would continue to have medical coverage and be on COBRA. Test Range Results FERRITIN 13 - 126 ng/mL 189 FOLATE >=5.4 ng/mL >20.0 VIT B12 200 - 910 pg/mL >2000 ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE <=125 U/L 127",
