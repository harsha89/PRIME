      "Content": "I don't have any elevated calcium BUT like you I was monitored for microcalcifications.  They were found in June 08, monitoroed in Dec 08 with all \"appearing to show no change\".  In May of 09 a halo showed on the mammogram and the radiologist appeared distressed by this, having a very hard time trying to explain this to me.  I went to a breast center on my own, and they found 2 masses, 1 Invasive with the other 1 DCIS hiding behind it.  PLEASE, demand a biopsy.  Mine were not particularly clustered during the \"monitoring\".  They look for the clustering.  I don't understand why the monitoring.  Were you told you have the option of getting a biopsy?  If not, I wonder why not.  I wasn't given this option, though I tried to ask all the right questions.  My chemo oncologist said it was a warning sign that something was brewing when the microcalcificatins were found, my radiation oncologist said if he had found the microcalcifications, he would have ordered a biopsy immediately.  I just finished my last of 4 rounds of chemo on Sept 14, and begin the 1st of 33 rounds of radiation on Oct. 5th.  I intent to kick cancers butt. I wish you all the best of luck.  PLEASE, get a biopsy.  DON'T WAIT.  I was \"monitored\" right into breast cancer, I hope you aren't.",

I am 39 and have been tracking a \"cluster\" of microcalcifications on my right breast for about 2 years now. I went in for my first mammogram and they saw them. We did ultra sound and the magnified mammogram as well. Since then I have been brought back in at 3 months, 3 months, 6 months, 6 months, and yesterday at 6 months. They say that the calcifications haven't changed...but now they want to do an MRI as well. I have very dense breasts (although small :-) and my mother had stage 2 breast cancer and got a mastectomy 3 years ago. So I guess the family history is definitely there. My question...I will obviously do the MRI as the radiologist suggests, but should I demand a biopsy of the calcifications as well? If they are so concerned about them to make me come back every 6 months, wouldn't it be better to biopsy them so that I can stop worrying about them? I know they are being cautious, which I appreciate, but this fear keeps getting put in my head every 6 months. Any suggestions? Thanks I just finished 4 rounds of chemo and start 33 rounds of radiation in 1 week.  I was \"monitored\" for 1 year for microcalcifications.  I was MONITORED right into breast cancer.  Please, DEMAND a biopsy.  I tried to ask the right questions, all I got was that he recommended to monitor me.  If I had known, I would have gotten the biopsy.  Please don't wait.  Get the biopsy.  God Bless You.",
