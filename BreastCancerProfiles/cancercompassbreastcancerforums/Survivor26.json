    "Content": "I too had horrible pain withthe Neulasta. I would spend most of the next 2 days in bed after an injection. Oxycodone barely took the edge off of it. After reading about it on several blogs I tried taking Claritin the morning of my scheduled Neulasta shot and for 3 days afterwards. The difference was incredible. I only had minor twinges of bain and those cleared right up with Tylenol. My doctor knew nothing about it and a couple of nurses had heard of it but didn't know of anyone who had tried it. After my success with it, they now mention it to everyone.",
