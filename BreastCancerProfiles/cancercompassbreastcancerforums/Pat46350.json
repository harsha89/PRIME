    "Content": "Copper, my heart goes out to you, I have Waldenstroms, and cancer is such a scarey word, to anyone! But 25% is very good odds, it is ok to cry and break down, I call my tears, God's cleansing fluids, I have been very fortunate to have a wonderful support group, www.allin1accord.com,Â  that has helped me through the 2 1/2 roughest years of my life, they have cried with me, prayed with me, and listened when I needed to vent, we have a couple of breast cancer survivors on our board, that can really help you, if you would choose to visit us, in the mean time, talk to your wife, see how she feels about this, be very open with her, and most of all, give her the support she needs till you get the results, the waiting, can sometimes be the hardest thing to do, I will be praying for you and your wife, that the results will be negative, just hang in there, God is still in control of all things, put your trust in Him! God be with you both, Pat",
