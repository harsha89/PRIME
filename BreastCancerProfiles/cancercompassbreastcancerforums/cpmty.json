You probably can check with some of the reknown hospitals like CANCER CENTERS OF AMERICA or...and even if they don't help you with treatment, they can give you information of other places that will and have 'private gifts' to help people like you, depending the area you are.",

      "Content": "I don't 100% agree with 'financial help' but shee is right in some things.. there are manay (millions) of people without insurance ( for ex. my daughter, I too -only cover by my husband since i retire before time- and know several people without it) A few years ago, a knew a young lady (about 26-28) who was working (minimum pay) but had no insurance. She died of breast cancer, she wasn't able to get help until a few days of her dead. TOO LATE, NO TREATMENT. I KNOW NOW that are some places that will help you if you are in this situation. You must check al look and don't stop until you find some where. some medical school hospital can help, and other organizations. Negative thoughts will NOT help your heath.",

Q10 9it is good for the heart and fatigue, etc... you should ask your doctor first or research in google for possible contradictions with your medication or cancer. BECAUSE i have the same problem, i was told to take B12 for energy etc.. until I find out that some vitamins can affect you cancer by helping metastazide the tumors. So I stopped taking it. For your fibromyalgia and pain sometimes dark red cherries (fresh, frozen,juice etc), celery seeds tea help a little bit. And anti inflamatory herbs (ginger, cinnamon...) and spices. Also try to keep your body in the alkaline side (when body is too acid the pain is worse). I drink 8.0and higher alkaline spring/mineral water and you can google a list of alkaline foods. ",

Please look for comments in 'protocell' in this message board for ca. treatment. I think I am going to try that, because the possitive comments i read. good luck.",

I told my family doctor and she told me she too knew in advance she had cancer ...she had removal of her both breast. There are many women who know something is wrong but many doctors do not listen. One lady, even told her doctor that she felt something, her doctor told her it was nothing, with in a year, she was dead with a very agressive cancer. ... an he was a very good doctor, but he didn't listen.",

Me too knew I had cancer ... things were not right I told the doctor, they didn't care or didn't pay attention to it. I was lucky because I insited and they found it in stage 1, very early THANK GOD!! I KNOW SOME DUGS CAN SMELL CANCER. Yes their is a smell that humans can't smell or at least are NOT prepared to recognize.  There is a board here called  'salbestrols' that some people can help with answers or they may know more. God Bless you all, and good luck.",
