    "Content": "It's ok to be scared.....I was diagnosed with rectal cancer, stage 3, in September of 08, and at this point have had chemo, radiation and surgery to remove the tumor, and now have a permanent colostomy.  I am 45 years old, and have always been a fitness freak, and have eaten right.  I have done all the right things, and still got cancer.  I went through all of the emotions....denial, anger, depression, and now 6 weeks after the surgery I am coming out the other side OK.  In fact, I really think that this has made me better.  All that I can tell you is this:  Th Lord has carried me through this.  I was honest with Him, and told Him how scared and angry I was, and He gave me peace and strength to get through it all.  Also, my wife, and kids, who are now in their twenties, have been a great help to me, and also a reason to keep fighting.   I have added you to my prayer list, and will pray for you every day.      Keep fighting and trust the Lord.........                                            Fred",
