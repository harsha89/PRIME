      "Content": "You need to call a major hospital and ask for an Oncologist, NOW!  Do not wait.  Catching it early is of the utmost importance.  Being scared is natural, I was, also, very scared.  However waiting is the most foolish thing you can do.  I was lucky to catch mine early and, recently underwent a lumpectomy. G-d bless you and, PLEASE do not wait.  A lumpectomy will preserve your breast.  If you wait, a Mastectomy is much worse and you risk your life if it spreads. Let me know that you made the call, for an appointment, as soon as tomorrow.  A fool, you do not want to be. Blessings, Leenie",

      "Content": "  On 7/30/2007 Leemg wrote: No, No don't be concerned about the radiation.  I would agree that head & neck patient's have a difficult time but for breast cancer patient's it is not bad at all.  I have sensitive skin to boot so I asked my radiation oncologist for something to put on my skin.  She gave me Biafine for radiated skin and I used it right away as directed and it worked very well.  The most I had was some pink which eventually faded.  The sunburn effect was minimal.  I would ask before hand for the cream, it really works. I read the info about radiation, you wrote.  I am very concerned about getting radiation post lumpectomy.  I had 2 surgery's in 2 weeks.  I have read, many pro's and cons.  Do you know what the percentages are re:radiation and  preventative measures.  I, really, don't want to have radiation.  Have you done any alternative treatments?  I sould appreciate any info you offer.
