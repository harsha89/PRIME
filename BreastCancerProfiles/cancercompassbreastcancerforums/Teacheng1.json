    "Content": "Liz, I was also diagnosed with non-invasive DCIS in September 2004. Surgery was outpatient and I left with a drainage tube that was removed five days later. The morning after the lumpectomy I had to return to the doctor's office with mini-stroke like symptoms (bp 204/125 and hr 160 bpm, extremely diminished vision, numbness spreading from hand up arm and into face, somewhat impaired mental faculty). The nurses called 911 and an ambulance took me to the hospital where I was admitted for just over 24 hours until symptoms improved. To make a long story short, radiation was postponed due to further complications, but we finally completed the 36 treatments mid-January 2005. It is now nearing mid-April, and I still have a great deal of pain at times, it seems especially where the drainage tube was. Doctors say that it is normal, but I'd like to know about yours and others' experiences. How long did you continue to hurt? Should I keep questioning about the pain? Thanks for your help.-Teresa",
