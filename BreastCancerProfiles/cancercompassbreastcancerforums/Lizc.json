    "Content": "Hello fellow survivors! My name is Liz C. I am from Houston, TX and I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29. My DX is: stage 3a ductal & lobular carcinoma, er/pr+, her2neu+ Treatment was 4 (3 week)rounds Adriamycin+Taxotere, Mastectomy, 16 weekly rounds Carboplatin+taxol, radiation, 1 year herceptin (off trial), 3 years (so far) hormone therapy including Zoladex, Tamoxifin and now Aridimex. Last year had prophalactic mast and reconstruction uising the S-GAP procedure. Today I am cancer-free and doing fine and now I would like to continue the fight by helping other survivors! In October 2005 I will be participating in The Ride for the Roses to benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF). The goal of the LAF this year is the \u201c7 For Survivors\u201d program \u2013 to raise 7 million dollars for survivors just as Lance himself is trying for his 7th Tour de France win! My personal goal is to raise $7,500. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this message and for your support. Together we can help others like us who are living with, through and beyond cancer! Elizabeth C.",
