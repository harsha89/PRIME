    "Content": "I am scheduled to have a DIEP flap performed at the University of Pennsylvania on August 1, 2006. I have had breast reconstruction for a double mastectomy six years ago with implants. I have had a lot of muscle and nerve pain in spite of physical therapy, pain intervention, etc. I had previous radiation on both sides after lumpectomies and the radiation in 1996 . This affected the elasticity of my chest muscles during the implant process. Since I am still experiencing discomfort, I have decided to try the DIEP flap to see if this surgery with the removal of the implants will make me more comfortable. Dr. Serletti at the Univ of PA was very positive about the outcome of the DIEP flap surgery. Has anyone had positive results with taking out the implants and reconstruction with the fat and skin of the stomach? Was your pain reduced and what was your outcome? Are you satisfied with the results and how was the recovery period? Thank you in advance for your response.",
