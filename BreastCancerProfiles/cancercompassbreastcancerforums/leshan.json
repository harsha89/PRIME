      "Content": "Hi-My wifes inital diagnosis and surgery was similar to yours except that she followed medical advice and had radiation and chemo as well.Horrib le side effects and didn't work.Develo ped a severe pain in the lower back six months later.Metast atic cancer in the bones.Second course of chemo,different drugs.First two treatments bad but bearable however dose number three saw her hovering between life and death for three terrible days.I insisted all chemo stopped at once,obvious it would kill her long before cancer did.After she recovered we talked at length and she convinced me that we should just get on with life however long or short it might be.That was a couple of years ago . Life is good but not all roses.Bone cancer pain is intense and hard to deal with and treat without becoming a zombie but neither of us have any regrets about refusing to follow our oncologists recommendations for further chemo.You have worked out the odds like we did and made an informed choice as we did.If we have both made the wrong choice so be it,we are the ones who will pay the price,no one else. This is not a rant against conventional medical treatment in any way but one has to call when enough is enough.Living a life, over length of life.Good luck and God bless",

      "Content": "My wife has the same pains in the same areas plus lower back and is also stage 4 metastatic breast cancer which has spread to the bones.Her pain is intense and constant. Only thing we have found that helps is at six hourly intervals- 1 panadine extra plus one panadine forte .If you are not already taking this paracetamol/codine mix you may find that 2 Panadine extra alone will help.Be aware that the codine in Panadine extra and Panadine forte is highly addictive but most of the other drugs prescribed to treat this sort of pain are also addictive and some have troublesome side effects.It looks like we will have to go on the stronger stuff sooner than we would like so addiction is the least of our problems.If you go for the stimulator(It's for pain blocking not cancer treatment) please post how things go.Best of luck and hang in there.",
