    "Content": "Hello, my name is george I am 24 From south Texas. My mother, Norma 43yrs young, was recently diagnosed with breast cancer in her right breast the begining of this year 2007 while she was pregnant.She received chemo treatment for it and was doing great, little side effects and no damaged to the baby, the tumor had began to shrink and would be removed after she gave birth.Her labor was indused on July 14, and began the complications she wasn't dialating so the offer of a c-section arouse to minimise stress on the baby.She agreed he had been through enough with the chemo and decided to go with the option.My brother Jonah was delivered weighing 5lbs 0.6Ouncesand was 18 inches long.He was a healthy premature baby.He did not have any complication or did not have to kept in the hospital like was recently though.Two days later they were both released and sent home, the first week my mom was fine complaining of minor pain in her back, which we belived to be from the epidoural,  which she hadn't had with her other two deliveries.She went in to the hospital when the pain incresed and did not cease.She was checked out and released cause the could not find anything wrong.She was prescribed strong pain killers and was fine for a couple more days but the pain incresed in severity and she returned to the hospital,was given more tests and released. She returned home staying for about 8 hours when I heard her in agony, and complaining of blurred vision.This time a spinal tap was ordered,when I went to see her I was given the Bad News by the attending Dr. He told me that the spinal fluid had confirmed their suspisions that she had Carcinoma Meningitis and there was nothin they could do to save her life.When I heard that I felt like a ton of bricks had landin on my chest.I went numb and felt like I was dreaming I kept think that any time I would wake up from this nightmare.But reality sank in and I new I could not take this laying down we would not roll over so easy.Me and my uncle and aunts, her brothers and sister did everthing in our power to find someone that could help us a diffrent doctor, or hospital, herbal treatments that other people had used that worked by killing cancer cells,chemo directly in to the brain and prayer lots of it from all over the world.But time kept moving foward and the disease progressed till she non responsive.The hospital said the could not give her any more treatment because the chemo was to much for her and was causing more harm then good so they decided to release her. When all hope was lost two days ago she began to respond to us she began to conversate wtih us and answer question we moved her to a Home called comfort house and a glimmer of hope was lite in us.Last night I was given bad news my mother, my queen was non responsive and was breathing very shallow.We belived the Lord was going to call her home.My Immediated family rushed over and said are good-bye's and retired to our homes wait dreading that phone call.At 3am we received a call that she had passed.In two weeks time our life's had flipped and been turned upside down by this disease that little was known about in a time were technology was moving at an alarming rate how could we not be able to do something about this.My Mother Left behind three sons ages 24,8,1month, a daughter in law, and a granddaughter 19months that loved her so much and thought the world of her.But I know she has not left us and will be watching, guarding, and guiding us, till we meet up with her again.I find strenth in something my Mother would always tell me \"The Lord Never Gives You More Than You Can Handle\" even though it some times feel like we can't go on we need to give everything to God and let him take control.I hope that this story helps anyone struggling with this same situation or any other trials they are going through.I'd like give my condolances to any one that has lost a loved one remember that your not alone, and we will see them one day when that time come.                        In Loving Memory of My Mother 1963-2007                        You Will Not Be Forgotten",
