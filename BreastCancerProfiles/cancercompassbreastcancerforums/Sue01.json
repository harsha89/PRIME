    "Content": "Hi, have you considered trying alternative therapies in conjunction with traditional treatment? My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 ibc 1 1/2 years ago. it had already travelled to her lungs, liver and bone. Since then she has been doing chemo, raiki, acupuncture and added herbal supplements to her diet. Her lungs and liver are now clear, bone masses have decreased significantly and she looks fantastic! Her doctors stopped all treatment but estrogen inhibitors 3 months ago & new scans just came back unchanged, so results can be positive! She started a trail in New York 6 weeks ago for antibody treatment with Reolysin and doctors are very hopefull that this could be of great benefit to her.... if you would like any info on the trail, please contact me. Good luck in your fight - it is one that CAN be won!!!",
