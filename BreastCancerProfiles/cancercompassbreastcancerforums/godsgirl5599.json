    "Content": "I've begun to notice a smell radiating from my body, especially the breast area. It's sort of a mixture between a sickly sweet and the smell of a shower or tub that is ready to be cleaned... like the dead skin that accumulates in a shower or tub. It's not your average smell. I teach high school, so I know that lack of hygene smell that comes with not being clean... This is different. I'm 38 & have never had a mamogram.Â ",
