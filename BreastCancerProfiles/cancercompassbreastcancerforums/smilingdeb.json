      "Content": "Hi everyone, I had a double mastectomy two years ago and I am ready to have breast reconstruction. The plastic surgeon I met is highly recommended here where I live and heard he does an excellent job. I can not remember the name of the flap procedure but it is the one where they take the muscule from the back and use gel implants. My question is had any of you had this procedure done and if so are you happy and please with it? I heard that you might have some limit to using your arms afterwards. I would really appreciate what information and experience you had. Thanks, Deb",

      "Content": "Thank you ladies for your replies. I went and saw the surgeon. He and my oncologist decided that I need to wait due to the fact that I am on blood thinner because of my cancer pill that I take daily. I really like this surgeon for his honesty and concern and will be going back to him when I can because I know that I will be in good hands. Take care my pink sisters, Deb ",

      "Content": "Hi KathyAd, I was diagnose with rare and aggressive cancer in my left breast. I am now in my 2nd year of remission. I was very determine to beat this so I put on my pink boxing glove and told my doctor that I was ready for the fight I had ahead of me. He told me since I had the rare and aggressive cancer that he was going to treat it with aggressive treatments. After the chemo strink my tumor, which was very big, I was ready for my surgery. I told my doctor that if they were going to remove my breast that they are going to take both of them. Best decision I made. After my surgery and was healed enough for radiation I did it and if I had to do it again to try and save my life I would. I am now ready for my reconstruction surgery and saw a plastic surgeon. He told my I was a perfect candidate for the surgery. So yes, the breast that is getting radiation can have the reconstruction surgery. Please don't be sorry for worring and yes these questions are very important. I hope my reply has help and if you get a chance reply and let us know how you are doing. If you have any other questions feel free to private email me. Lots of ciberhugs, Deb    ",

      "Content": "Hi Kathy48, I read your post and I am wondering how you are doing with losing your hair. Boy do I remember how I felt. I knew that I was going to lose my hair but I guess I really didn't get myself perpared. When my hair started falling out I cried and cried but I didn't know at the time that I had fallen into a depression. Once I got on medication for my depression I came to terms with it and accepted the fact that this was part of chemo and I had to suck it up. I did get a wig but I never wore it. I wore bandanas the whole time. Much better when you live in TX. I was so happy when I got on my depression medication cause I felt better about everything and had a postive outlook on my fight with cancer. I put on my pink gloves and started kicking butt. I did not buzz or shave my head. Instead my sister cut it above my shoulders and to me I felt like I dealt with it better going slow with losing my hair. Lol, once I lost my hair I still had a pieces here and there that kept bugging me. I felt like I had a bug crawling on me. Well, I sloved that problem. Since I live alone I did not want to use a razor so I got out my link roller and rolled it all over my head. My mom called and ask how I was doing and what I was up to and when I told her she busted out laughing. I now have a full head of hair, curly and I think thicker to. Let me know how you are doing. Would love to hear from you. Ciberhugs, Deb",
