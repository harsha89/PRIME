    "Content": "In o2 i had tnc, lumpectomy and radiation. Recurred in 08 and had double mastectomy and tried expanders. I got a staph infection and they had to take them out. Thet put them back in 2 years ago. Finallly had inplants in nov 13 and another infection. In hospital trying to recover from infection.. They just said today they will be ttaking the bad one out today. Then can just take the other out too and i just wont have anything. Or i can wait 3 weeks and do tram flaps. All the info i know/have is that most peopledont mind having no replacements. Most are my age 56 orlder. Problem are there few options concernim Ng prothesis as far as fashion or comfort. . I went t a shop once and the showed me ugly, clunky stuff that was hideous and they werent very nice. My hubby is fine with this. The other option, the tram flap is more concerning. Pain, 5 weeks recovery, possible complication with people who are regularly athletic(stomacm muscles). Any comments would be so appreciated, i have 6 hours to decide. Fran",
