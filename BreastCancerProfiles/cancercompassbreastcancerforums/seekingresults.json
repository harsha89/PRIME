Sorry you and your mom are going through this but someway or the other, everything will be ok.  Thank you. I am trying to see her as much as I can. My Dad visits her everyday and I am trying to go most days but we have to work around her sister too visiting her as she is too weak to have too many visitors at once. But thank you cause I too originally didn't want to tire her out because I know she gets tired with the constant tests, and checks the nurses and doctors do at the hospital...but I will visit her as much as I can. I have thought about video taping, but I am not sure she'd want that as she wouldn't want us remembering her like this (I think. She looks so frail and weak and originally she wouldn't let us visit her when she went downhill dramatically because she didn't want to upset us). I have just had a baby too so I wanted to get her to write or say a message to him but I don't know how to bring it up. Hmm I already have regrets with my life like you mention too. I regret not having a baby earlier as now I feel I've taken away her opportunity to be a grandmother to my child (which she was so excited about and I know that causes her great distress that she won't get to watch him grow up) and I was waiting to get married as I wanted a child first to meet her but not I regret that too. I guess it's natural to have many regrets in situations such as this and I guess we will learn from them. My mum's own mum passed away when I was a baby so I really didn't think lightning would strike twice as they say. But my mum was such a beautiful and positive woman and I wonder if it's because she realised at a young age how precious life was and she made the most of the life she was given.  Also one other question I think you were originally looking at alternatives. Was the reason you didn't try anything else because her situation deteriorated so quickly? Unfortunately my mum has said she'll try anything and we can't find the 'anything' for her to try. I just hope other families don't have to go through this and that a cure is found sooner rather than later. I hope your regrets pass in time. If you have any other advice (you mention there was so much you regretted not doing or saying. Anything else you care to mention?) I really appreciate to hear it. And I am glad this is therapeutic for you as it is most probably good to get this out and off your chest. I too don't talk to people about it either. Mainly because it's changed so dramatically from ok to bad and because it's too emotional and a lot of people don't understand. If you need to say anything to make yourself feel better please do.",

Hi Springflowers Hope you are doing well. It was so nice to read your story about how your cancer has been cleared. My mother unfortunately has advanced breast cancer to bladder, around bowel, in lining of lung, in stomach lining and spine. She is doing it quite tough at the moment and has been in hospital most of this year. She had strong chemo about one month ago and it has left her bed ridden and in a poor state. You mentioned being able to email a list of supplements/nutrients you took. I would love to find out exactly what you did as I would like to replicate this for my mum. I also read in an earlier post you said your voice went away for a while but came back. My mothers' voice is very weak at the moment also and she is having laboured breathing. I suspect from the cancer in the lining of her lung. Do you know why your voice went away? If you are still on this website please let me know so we can make email contact.  Many thanks and best regards and hope to hear from you soon",
