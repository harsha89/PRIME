      "Content": "Hi, I have a twin sister who I am very close too so I understand the love of a sister. I have stage 4 breast cancer and my twin is all clear and it's very emotional for both of us. Firstly please remember there is always hope so don't give up on that and having your support is the best medicine you can give your sister. I too have cancer in my bones and I receive an injection once a month to stop the bones regenerating so the cancer can't invade. You can survive a long time with this treatment. I also have been on a course of chemo drugs (pills) to bring my marker numbers down and I take other herbal medicines to help support my gut and immune system whilst taking the chemo this I believe has helped enormously. I take a vegan probiotic and a mushroom pill called PSK my blood results have been very good so far. They also suggest an alkaline diet and water system if you could get one. Eating healthy and exercise is something you both can do to support each other. I wish you both every success and a happy long life together that's certainly what me and my sister are aiming for. Happy to message if you like.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this site but read your post. I also have stage 4 breast cancer which spread to my liver and now bones in my neck. I kept telling my oncologist about a sore and stiff neck and was told it's stress and to do yoga and meditate all good advise if that's all it was. Just before Christmas I had 10 shots of radiation on my c neck bones and t3 bone and had to ware a neck brace. This all left me with a very swollen and sore throat and I am currently taking chemo pills every day to bring down markers and gain some control. If you still have reservations please get them fully checked out your own intuition should not be ignored. I wish you well and ask your oncologist about a different bone injection I haven't started one yet but I know there is another one available that may suit you better. All the best.",
