    "Content": "Hi, I am new to this board as of 5/14/07.  I had stage 0 and stage 1 bc found by a mammogram. Had the lumpectomy  on 9/18/06 and  finished radiation on 11/22/06.  Had severe radiation burns and had to stop, although had only six more tx's to go.  I was told I had a very rare reaction.  I started on Arimidex and was on it about three to four weeks. I had what they think is radiation recall (it was just like being on radiation again) plus just plain sick. I then started taking Aromosin (on it now almost 3 mos.)  The only problems I have now are a LOT of water retention, weight gain, but mostly the fingers in my right hand are very sore, and cannot move them in the morning. One finger \"pops\" when I bend it and is very painful. It takes about an hour to get my hand and fingers moving again.  I am going to see my oncologist's pa in the morning to see what we can do.  I know I need to be on some medication for the follow-up, so I think it is just a matter of finding the right one. I also had major depression but it I was put on Effexor XS and that works fine. I stay positive that something will work and the ca will NOT return.  Good luck and God Bless all of us in this boat together!!",
