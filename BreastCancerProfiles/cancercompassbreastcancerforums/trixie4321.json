      "Content": "Thank You very much for your reponse. I don't know if i had this test...had sooo many...i don't know if i mentioned that my cancer was a CUP cancer...they sent a sample to a San DiegoÂ  forensics lab to see if they could tell where it came from, as all the normal \"biopsy\" and blood tests came back neg/undetermined. Does this change your response at all? Reason why i ask is that they were only 83% sure it was breast cancer... i have had a \"first look\" PET scan, however and it showed i'm remissed....which ocourse is great, but i'm not sure what my re-occurance rate would be??",
