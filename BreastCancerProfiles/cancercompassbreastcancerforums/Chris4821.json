    "Content": "My mother (61) was diagnosed with Stage IV Breast cancer (ER+) about 4 months ago - spreading to her lymph nodes & bones. She had a lumpectomy. Her doctor has Rxed Arimdex for her cancer & Aridea (misspelled) for her bones. She has tolerated it VERY well - back up to walking/running 3 miles a day. No side effects except makes her sleepy, so she takes it at night. So....does this sound odd that she isn't on chemo? Her doctor said that the results would be the same and that Arimidex is better tolerated. Her CA27 has been dropping and her CAT scan showed a definitely improvement in the lymph nodes. It just seems odd b/c everyone else seems to be on chemo. She sort feels guilty b/c she isn't having any issues and life is just going on.....:) Any info would be great! Thanks in advance",
