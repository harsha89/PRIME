    "Content": "There are a few organizations out there that will pay your copays and deductibles for you. I checked out Patient Access Network and found out that they will reimburse you, your doctor or your pharmacy for any copays you have to pay for your breast cancer treatments. I don't think you have to pay them up front - I think they can pay them for you right when you pick up your medication or they pay your doctor directly. I looked online and saw that there's an application for you and your doctor to fill out and you have to attach a copy of your tax return. I don't know what the income limits are, but there's a place on their website called How to Apply and you can put in your information and it will tell you if you qualify or not. Their website is www.patientaccessnetwork.org. You can also call them and they can tell you if you qualify or not. Their number is 866-316-7263. These copay organizations can sometimes be on waitlists and when their money runs out, they won't take any more applications. I checked out all of PAN's funds and saw that some of them say they aren't currently taking new applications, but it doesn't say that for breast cancer so if you need copay help, you should get in touch with them soon while they are taking applications.",
