    "Content": "My mom recently had breast cancer luckily it was only stage one. and she had a mastemectomy and the cancer is gone. She is currently under going radiation for 6 weeks. SHe has gone on a spending spree and if anyone disagrees with her she automatically brings up that she is a breast cancer survivior. Her boss also eliminated her position while she was out on medical leave. Everywhere she goes she tells them that she is a breast cancer survivor, which is all fine that she is proud of it but she also includes that her boss eliminated her position while she was away. She is i guess you could say not in her right mind. I am worried about her and want to know if this is normal and if not what can we do to help is there treatment for this?",
