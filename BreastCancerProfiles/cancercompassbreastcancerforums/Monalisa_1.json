    "Content": "Hello everyone,                      my name is Monalisa and I'm on aromisin and I hurt real bad. I've also been gaining weight. My joints hurt so bad. And unless you take the stuff, I don't think you could possibly understand how bad it makes you feel. I'm a very active person and would love to get back in shape. I do yoga and tai-bo every other day + I play volleyball once a week and now I'm trying double dutch jump rope. Last night I could hardly jump, I thought my ankles were going to break. During volleyball I can hardly run in the sand. True statement, I'm going to get back in shape, even if it kills me! (and it might). I resorted to taking a hydrocodone last night and iced my ankles and knees. I'm taking ibu's daily for the pain, my doctor doesn't seem to care about any of my side effects and tells me I just need to keep taking the pill. If anyone can give me any tricks of the trade, please help me.                                    God Bless all of you                           ",
