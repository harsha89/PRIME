    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999.  I had a modified radical mastectomy followed by chemo.  I went on tamoxifen.  In 2003 the cancer went to my liver.  I received taxol and zeloda for 5 months.  The lesions stopped growing but did not shrink. I took falsodex for 13 months after which the lesions began to grow.  I then was put on abraxane and avastin.  I have been taking that plus aromasin for 13 months. I am told that I have about a dozen lesions.  Some in both lobes with the largest being 8 cm and some very tiny.  I have read about a procedure caleed RAF to ablate the lesions.  Has anyone out there had any experience with this.  The chemo has began to take a toll on my body and I do not think I can continue it much longer.  I would appreciate any input anyone else may have.
