      "Content": "My mother (65) was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002. She had a lumpectomy. In 2003, she had a recurrence; malignant cells had traveled to 3 lymph nodes under her arm (same side as original lump). Last week, we learned there is more cancer in lymph nodes under same arm. Who can share similar experiences? I am trying to support my mom and want to obtain as much information as possible. What can we expect going forward? My mother has not had either a mastectomy or chemotherapy, though she had radiation after both prior surgeries. She is not a candidate for tamoxifin (sp?). She also has Parkinson's disease and is on Requip for that. Worried daughter . . .",

      "Content": "My mother (age 65) was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002. She had a recurrence the following year; breast cancer had spread to lymph nodes. In 2004, my mother was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Last week, we learned she has had another recurrence of cancer in lymph nodes. I would like to know whether anyone has experience managing cancer and Parkinson's disease simultaneously? What are the complications? How do you cope with fatigue? My mother is sleeping about 16 hours a day already. She is presently on Requip for Parkinson's and Lexipro (sp?) for depression. She has not had chemotherapy and does not think she can tolerate it in addition to coping with Parkinson's. She is not a candidate for Tamoxifin (sp?). What are our options? Worried daughter . . .",
