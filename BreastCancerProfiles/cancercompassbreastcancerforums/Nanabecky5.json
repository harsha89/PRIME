    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy no reconstruction in 2010 and 17 lymph nodes from one arm and 12 from another the cancer was deep the cut is very deep and now I have a pain on the deepest side if I turn the wrong way the pain is soo bad it feels like a knife just sticking in you or like a sharp bone chip enough to take your breathe away and it stays for a long time, I did not have reconstruction because I did research and a personal thing.  I had a hack job done, I changed doctors and am going next month for MRI and praying because I had cervical cancer at 26 and hesterectomy, breast cancer acouple times and not in best health but my doctor told me you can get breast cancer after a mastectomy one little spec of tissue left inside and I do not know if this is normal but I have all this sick hanging on my sides that my new doctor said should have been removed he offered to take sking fat off stomach and on sides (like under arms) and give me reconstruction but I am afraid to do that just heard so much bad things that has happened ...I truly believe we all should be Blessed and very happy we are survivors but it is so hard and others do not understand that YES I am happy but NO it is so hard now I can not do alot I use to be able to do or I swell up and I have pain, so not worth doing.  Anyway I would have that lump you are feeling checked like I am with mine,,,If anyone can tell me do you have that bone thing happening or is it scar tissue anyone have MRI on it? is there anyone out there that did not have reconstruction can show me what they look like, I think I got hacked that is the way I look and then I have this big piece in center that sticks out and that swells up, do any of you swell up easy?  thank you all and I say we just all stick together help each other and we will get through anything because we understand each other!! Bless you all!!!!",
