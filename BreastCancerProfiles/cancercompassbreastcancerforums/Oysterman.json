Like essiac tea and tumeric and no sugar ,lots of veggies stuff that does not poison your body,, I heard that chemo kills people not the cancer.. true??   And is there bad things out there about the tomoxifin and fermerax ?? just wanted some input ..thank you  Hi, I'm traveling the same route as Dan... natural remedies, herbs, supplements and  a healthy diet; meaning no dairy foods, no sugar, no red meats, no processed meats, minimal alcohol. I'm happy to experiment too with natural      treatments discovered and researched on the internet. Having lost a kidney to cancer15 years ago I determined that I wouldn't allow metastasis to develop.. and it hasn't, though I did develop a Gleason grade 9 prostate cancer four years ago, and subsequently two deadly skinMelanoma's. No matter, I continue to take responsibility for my own health and enjoy the challenge. My own research with medical web-sites and forum's convinces that I am on the right track. It is often said that if the cancer doesn't get you - the medical treatment will. I would agree that is all too often the case. You may find my own blog journal of interest: http://www.prostateruminate.com Good luck to you. David",
