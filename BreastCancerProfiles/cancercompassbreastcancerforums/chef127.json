    "Content": "DO NOT IGNORE THE LUMP in your breast. I had a golf ball size lump in my breast that would come and go with my monthly cycle since I was 20-22. I had it bx'ed and it was B9, it never showed up on any mamo and none of my drs ever questioned it. Sooooo neither did I. When I started to go through peri memopause I noticed changes in the lump. It appeared and did not go away like it had for years, my skin dimpled around the lump. I thought it was simply hormonal changes due to meno.......had a mamo, US, and biopsy, and IDC, 4.5cm. That lump should have been removed before it had the chance to become malignant. Please insist on careful monitoring of that lump. On to a breast surgeon who told me a Mast and complete nodal removal, followed by chemo radiation and hormonal tx. REALLY. Went for a 2nd opinion and neoadjuvant  DD ACT chemo followed by Mast and hormonal TX. They almost had me. I was ready for it all Til I researched cancer treatment. There was no way I would subject my body to this distructive med. advice. I too opted for LaserCancerSurgery, pain free, clear margins, and the results are amazing. I still have my breast (went from a DDD to a C cup) and had breast reduction on the other side for simatry. I did go see an MO and CMF chemo, radiation,  and hormone tx was recomended. ALL poison. I did do the radiation out of fear because CA cells were found on the skin that left me with ??? but the laser surgeon assured me that he had zapped the skin. Anyway NO chemo, NO hormonal tx for me. Listen to SpringFlowers and research her protocall. Protect your immune system. And PLEASE check that lump. CONSISTANTLY.",
