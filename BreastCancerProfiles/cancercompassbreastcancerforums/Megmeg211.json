    "Content": "So I went in today for my mammogram and ultrasound. Both were negative. But the tech and even the radiologist could feel it when doing the ultrasound and even my touching it with there hands. He stated that he has to put negative since he couldn\u2019t see anything on the images. But he said something is definitely there. And to follow up with my PCM. I first noticed this about 3 weeks ago. I had left breast pain. Thought I was just sore from lifting. After a week i thought it was weird it was still hurting so I did an exam and noticed the lump. I went and saw my PCM and she said there is something there and ordered the mammogram and ultrasound sound. Now im just waiting to hear back from my doctor for the next step if there is one. Basically writing this to see if any one has had anything g similar to my situation. I know every ones bodies are different.",
