      "Content": "Dear LSADallas, Great city Dallas, I am from Houston, but don't live there now.I miss Texans, great people. In answer to your question, vitamins and minerals can be sold over the counter (OTC) in combinations, or alone and in varying amounts.I am not recommending any particular source, I am not in the vitamin business. I suggest that you find the cheapest place possible to buy them in high doses as that is what it takes. When one has cancer, their entire body is sick, not just the place where the tumor is.If left alone, cancers can metasticize (spread and grow) because the \"ground\" or tissue where the cancer grows is \"sick.\" In fact, the tissue area where the cancer grows, has to be prepared first by various chemical actions and breakdowns, to \"prepare\" the site for a tumor to grow. Diabolical isn't it. Tumors just don't show up one day, and say to themselves, \"OK, I think I will create a breast cancer tumor here.\" It doesn't work that way. Cancer begins to grow, when there has been a long-term \"inflammation\" that is system, or body wide. Therefore, the entire body has to be treated. To treat inflammations, or a cancer, one has to take larger doses than what are usually recommended by the FDA. For example: the amino acid L-glutamine is sucked up like a sponge in a tumor when there are high doses of L-Glutamine taken in by the person, which then overdoses on L-glutamine, and then signals the body's own natural cancer fighters, the white blood cells to attack and kill the tumor. Study after study, now show that L-Glutamine all by its self, can kill a tumor. Too much L-glutamine in a cancerous tumor, of any size, in any place in the body...is an abnormal condition in your body. No, too much L-Glutamine in your cancer cells do not make you sick. Just the opposite. Although your normal cells know how to regulate correct amounts of L-glutamine, your cancer cells or tumor does not. That is why tumors are called \"L-glutamine sponges.\" L-glutamine is also an anti-inflammatory agent, which then reduces greatly your chances of getting cancer again in the future. Read the research, when I started there was just a little research on L-glutamine, now there is a lot...because laboratory studies show it works. There are testimonials also from HIV/AIDs victims, who say that L-Glutamine cleared their livers of toxins, allowed them to have a normal \"gut\" and eat and absorb food so they could recover, and healed their \"mouth sores\" which are so prevalent in both radiation and HIV patients. In fact, L-glutamine is routinely given in hospitals for mouth sores, and to persons who have perforated intestines caused by radiation or other factors. L-glutamine is also highly recommended for spastic colon and Chrone's disease, and given to people with cancer who have no appetites (called cachexia). 60% of the human body's amino acids are made up of L-glutamine. What does that tell you? L-glutamine is taken like a powder, one to two big heaping tablespoons in the drink of your choice. It is tasteless, dissolves easily, and your body loves it! When one has cancer, it is recommended that a person take from 10,000 mg to 60,000 mg a day. One large heaping tablespoon equals about 5,000 mg. As I said, L-Glutamine is tasteless, odorless, and a white powder and easy to take mixed with any liquid. Reishi mushrooms also come in a capsule form. A related mushroom \"Shitakii,\" can be eaten as a food. I ate about 5-6 Shitakii mushrooms a day, fried, grilled, raw in salads. It is a pleasing taste, and you have eaten Shitakiis or black mushrooms almost every time you have eaten Chinese food. Both mushrooms (Reishi is more potent) increase your white blood cells, who then eat up cancer cells. Shitakii or black mushrooms can be found in your local grocery story. However, they are cheaper in bulk, about $3.00 for a very large bag, if you buy Shitakii mushrooms from your local oriental grocery store. They are dried and can be reconstituted by soaking them in water for a few minutes. I mixed my shitakii mushrooms in everything, including grounding them up in the food processor and putting them in ground beef, meat loaf, hamburger helper, etc. If you don't want to eat them...you can take capsules labeled \"beta-glucans\" the activce ingredient, or \"Reishi\" mushrooms. While actively ill with cancer, I took from 6 to 8 a day. Vitamin C, Lysine, Proline, Arganine and copper can be bought in one pill from Dr Rath's web site, or other websites that sell \"Epican Forte.\" Read Dr Rath's articles on cancer as well. His research has been duplicated by other research institutes not related to Dr Rath. I stumbled upon Dr Rath's Epican Forte after reading other research studies on cancer. I would say it works, or at least worked for me. The more individuals do basic web searches, of good, published, peer-reviewed cancer studies, and what works...the quicker deadly chemotherapy, and radiation will become a dinosaur of the past. As I have stated before, both my aunts and mother died of breast cancer. They took extensive chemotherapy and radiation. Not only did it not work, but it made them sicker. My attitude is: \"If it makes you sick...it makes you sick.\" Chemotherapy, etc. should make a person \"well\" not sick. This is just common sense, duh! Just yesterday, I talked with a friend, whose neighbor was put on Tamoxafen. She became paralysed due to \"blood clots\" caused by Tamoxefen. Tamoxefen's studies are that it is suppose to reduce future breast cancers by 20-60%. What Tamoxefen's laboratories don't tell the public in their press releases, is that more people get heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and liver cancer by taking Tamoxefen...than would have gotten a secondary cancer IF THEY DID NOTHING! This is just outrageous, and I wish I could go to congress, or somewhere to pass laws, to make such drug makers as Tamoxefen, and other chemotherapies tell the truth to the public. I watch TV advertisements selling drugs. After the nice looking guy says to take say \"Luvoxcin\" an anti-cholesterol drug, he then says quickly, with a smile on his face...such-and-such drug will cause heart palpitations, muscle weakness and pain, diarrhea, astham, abnormal blood clots, blah blah blah. Why then...do they allow this drug to be marketed on TV or even sold? Because it means big bucks for the drug companies, marketers, public relations firms, TV ad sellers, packagers, and so on. Our cancer and other illnesses, many of which are the result of long-term poor food intake, lacking nutrition, smoking, alcohol, toxic environments, and genetics, or all of the above, can be remedied by \"normal\" methods and pathways in the body. Chemotherapy and radiation are not \"normal.\" They are poisons. Worse yet, since 1955, the studies of chemotherapy and radiation show that it does not do any good, or achieve higher cure rates in most cancers, than if someone did nothing! I am hopeful that some of the newer chemotherapy drugs can be beneficial, as some of the newer ones work on a molecular level. However, the conditions for getting cancer in the first place, chronic inflammation, are not being addressed. One can forget about radiation. Radiation, as everyone knows from the atomic bomb studies of populations who were subjected to \"radiation,\" cause cancers. This is established fact. Also, one must take therapeutic doses of vitamins and minerals. I have talked with people who say they are talking vitamins and minerals, and I ask then \"how much,\" or in what quantity. Most people are taking such supplements as Vitamin C in such small doses, that it would not help a mouse. When one is ill with cancer or other nutrition-related illnesses, one's body has been depleted for a long, long time. Therefore, one has to take huge doses to catch up, and also defeat the cancer. If you are interested in dosages, or the amounts of each vitamin to take, email me, I will be glad to give you my personal opinion, based on research, on what dosages were effective. By the way, RDAs, (the FDA's Recommended Daily Amounts) of many vitamin and mineral supplements were based on a) rat studies (such as how much of a depletion can make a rat sick), and b) clinical and observable studies whereby, they study how much depleting a person of a certain Vitamin, such as vitamin C, causes that person to become sick. This is just ridiculous. RDAs are not based on supervised, clinical trials at the intra cellular level...but by such criteria as\" at which dosage of vitamin C does a person's tongue turn red, indicating an insufficiency.\" I want to slap these people. There are some larger population studies that show better information, such as: \"Populations who eat \"selenium-depleted\" foods, have X-amounts of higher rates of cancer...than populations who eat \"selenium-rich\" foods, grown in soil where there is an abundance of seleniu. Populations studies also show that Orientals, who have been eating mushrooms of certain types an varieties have about 60-80% cancers than other populations who do not eat cancer. Both mushrooms (Reishi and Shitakii) as well as Shark Fin soup (shark fin is shark cartilage) has been known for its cancer killing, or curing properties for about 2000 to 3000 years. I have another bone to pick. The medical establishment who studies cancer and what makes it grow, \"knows\" that cancer requires 5 times more sugar, or glucose than normal cells. Therefore, one should eat no sugar, or any sugar-producing foods, such as anything white, such as bread, rice, potatoes, or any refined carbohydrates that turn into sugar. When you eat sugar, you are feeding your cancer cells or tumor. One can help to starve a cancer to death, by not eating any sugar. I did this before I was operated on, and remain on a near sugar-free diet. I learned this from a woman weight lifter, who is also an attorney. From their studies, they found that women who had had breast cancer, who later became weight lifters...and so ate no sugar in order to get a lean body mass...had as much as an 80-90% reduction in secondary or return cancers than the rest of the breast cancer population. Women weight lifers do their homework and know what happens to their body with every spoon full of food they eat. Most women who are weight lifters, or the one's I know, are professional woman, including nutritionists, physical education instructors, researchers, attorneys, etc. They are not dumb by any means. I would rather try their approach than any oncologist. Don't believe me? Then I highly recommend you do your own research...I am not pulling this information out of my hat, nor am I selling anything. Good luck, I certainly hope that if you or a loved one is afflicted, you will get well. My best, Diana W. PhD",

      "Content": "Hi Mart Allan: My tumor was Her Negative. From my research, it does not matter if the tumor is estrogen neg or pos. Its been one year and nine months since I was diagnosed when I put myself on my regimine. I remain on my regimine, except for the shark cartilage, which should not be used all the time, since it prevents the growth of new blood vessels, including healthy ones as well as those associated with tumors! I am sorry to hear about your situation. But there is hope and there is something you can do about it. The more I read about cancer research, the more I see that cancer is a disease of molecular chemistry and nutrition. What else explains why some people get it, and some don't. Genetics certainly predisposes some people for cancer, but that is why one has to compensate with good nutrition and good overall health. There are more and more doctors who are turning away from chemotherapy and toward nutrition to combat cancer, which is not surprising. The use of shotgun poisons and chemotherapy since the 1950s simply is not working and its becoming too obvious that this singular toxic approach can't work. However, there are some new approaches based on molecular and biochemical and nutritional approaches now in the works that are in medical trials. However, some of these so-called \"new\" approaches have been known for some 2000 to 3000 years. Other physicians are rejecting chemotherapy and radiation because of the overall toxic effects, and because in most cases of the deleterious effects it has on the body in killing the very biological agents that help the body defeat cancer, such as destroying the immune system. My mother and both aunts took chemotherapy and radiation, and it made them instantly worse and they soon died after such treatments. Observing this as a 16 year old, I vowed that if I became afflicted with cancer, I would \"not\" subject myself to chemotherapy or radiation...and I didn't. My oncologist at the University of Miami, Sylvester Cancer Institute offered me TAC and FTAC chemotherapy. I did my research and looked at the world-wide mortality rates of these chemotherapy treatments and found that in comparison that if I \"did nothing took no chemotherapy\" my recurrence rates would be at 25%. However, if I took either FTAC or TAC chemotherapy, my recurrence rates would be at 30% or higher!. What the hell? Plus, chemotherapy would cause me to lose my hair, be sick, and incur the costs of the chemotherapy, and I might die from stroke and heart attacks and suffer further cancers caused by the chemotherapy. Also, I was offered radiation therapy. Radiation therapy was said to improve my chances of not getting cancer by only 1%. Ridiculous. However, the chances of getting secondary cancers in the next five years was increased by 20%. This was insane! Plus, I risked tissue damage and burns at the site of the radiation, a 1 in 5 chance of tissue damage to the point that tissue reconstruction for my breasts would be unsuccessful or delayed. Then I was offered Tamoxefen and other like drugs to prevent further breast cancer. However, in my research, I found that the complications for Tamoxefen causing strokes, heart attacks and further liver cancers were too high for me to consider. Plus, I knew 5 women who had come down with subsequent breast cancer after taking Tamoxefen. So, I was not convinced it did any good. No thank you! These are the real statistics and other nasty complications that oncologists do not tell cancer patients. What is the real truth is that more people actually die from the complications of chemotherapy and radiation than die from \"cancer\" each year. This is what the medical industry does not tell patients when they get cancer. Thus, I feel that in my research, nutrition and natural supplements was the way to go. Furthermore, as I sat in the waiting room at the hospital oncology clinic, just looking at the other women taking chemotherapy and radiation it spoke volumns. They all looked sick and miserable. They looked like hell. Then there was me. I looked and felt great. So far, so good. Time will tell, plus I have my university studies to back me up. I have since met other people such as myself who have rejected the \"medical\" and oncological model of chemotherapy and radiation, electing only for surgery and natural medicine to make themselves well after being diagnosed with cancer. And they are doing fine. My attitude remains: \"If it makes you sick, it makes you sick.\" This is pure logic. Therefore, it is my duty to speak out, and not keep what I know and am experiencing to myself. I am not selling any thing. What needs to be done is good studies, good research to compare such people as myself using natural methods, with the chemotherapy, radiation and oncology medical models. I welcome such research and its high time this research begins now. The only losers will be the pharmaceutical companies who make trillions off the consumers and insurance companies and the tax payers and the United States government, and that's just too isn't it. What we do know is that as told to me by my own oncologist is that there is only 3500 more people \"saved\" since since the 1950s after trillions of dollars of unsuccessful research... and I will bet this figure is \"confounded\" by the fact that such people/cancer patients were also using good nutrition and \"supplements\" and it was \"not\" through chemotherapy or radiation. My best wishes to everyone. Keep me informed. Diana Wilson PhD",

      "Content": "Hi Kim, I am glad that they found your cancers in your colon. I am so sorry that you, and other Americans have to go through this. But surgery is one of our best defenses, especially in the early stages. In general, according to my extensive research, and you are certainly welcome to do your own: Mammograms only detect about 33% of cancerous breast tumors. This means that %66 of breast cancer tumors go undetected. What I chose for myself, and was given the option to find \"all the cancers\" in my body was a PET scan (Positive Emission Tomography). PET scans from head to toe have, according to the research a 99% accuracy rate. This is far above and beyond anything a simple mammogram or sonography can do. The negative news is that having a PET scan is like absorbing radiation from about 1000 X-rays. If one had more than say 10 PET Scans in a year or two, then I would be worried. When one has to weigh the advantages of early diagnosis, and a complete diagnosis versus how limiting a mammography of the breast is...PET scans win out. PET scans are also indicated the research says, in those of us who are either older, or at high risk for other cancers in our bodies. In your case, you already have found cancer in your colon, and there is some suspicious \"nodes\" in your armpit. In my point of view, the alarm bells should be going off. Mammograms do not hurt. The process is one where your breast is squeezed between two pieces of clear plastic, and they take an X-ray of it. If one has a lot of fat, fibroid (scar) tissues, or lots of little calcium deposits that look like white dots in the breast, then a cancer diagnosis is made much more difficult. The process usually takes about 10 minutes or less and is essentially painless. I have never seen man do a mammogram on a woman. Thank God! All the mammogram technicians I think are women. A PET scan was one of the easiest tests I have ever had in my life. One lays down on a long table that is slowly moved into sort of a tunnel that is open at both ends. If one just closes their eyes and thinks good thoughts, the half hour that it takes to have one's entire body \"scanned\" goes by quickly. There is a humming and a ker-bump sound once in a while. But, the process is completely painless. The machine does not touch you. For more information about the process of diagnosis and often mis-diagnosis, and my experiences, you can go to my blog: www.360.yahoo.com/dwilsontx Therefore,yes,if I were in your tennis shoes, not only would I get a mammogram, but a sonogram, and a PET scan, and then have \"punch\" biopsy done if the \"nodes\" turn out to look suspiciously like cancer. In your favor, is that you feel good. Good health and nutrition are more than essential to keeping cancer at bay, and even killing it. The body \"kills\" cancer cells beginning from the day we are born. It is a many people's opinion and research, that cancer is caused by many factors, not just genetic, but factors that involve aging, caused by negligent nutrition over many years. I just had a conversation with another researcher, who also thinks that cancer, especially in young women and children is caused by pesticides. Pesticides do absolutely horrible things to the human body's chemistry. It is ridiculous to think that if \"pesticides\" kill insects, which are living thigs, that pesticides don't kill or change the human body. At no time in history, has the USA...and developed countries had such a high rate of cancer. Excuse me, but does our high rates of cancer also parallel the proliferation and use of pesticides. Too often in cancer research, they do not go to the \"obvious cause\" of cancer, but by the very nature of researchers...look at the human body's cellular stucture in microcosm. This attitude has to change. There are getting to be more recommendations that we all eat our green \"veggies\" and this is helpful, but not good enough. How, I ask, can someone eat 9 servings of fruit and vegetebles a day? Can you just imagine buying, peeling, cutting up, storing, cooking, serving and then eating \"9 servings of fruit/vegetables\" a day. Impossible. Therefore, in order to combat and counter balance all the pesticides, and health-damaging chemicals in our food, the air, clothing, computers, what we sit on, and what we drink...one has to take extra-ordinary measures and take vitmins and supplements. This is even more important as we get older, as our \"guts\" seem to wear out, and we do not have the ability to absorb and process the number of necessaray vitamins and minerals we need not only for good health, but to combat cancer. Lastly, about chemotherapy and radiation. I will state blatently that I am against it for all the reasons I cited. It just does not do any good. Until the research shows that chemotherapy and radiation save more women's lives than statistically was known in 1955...I am against it. The only caveat I have for chemotherapy, is if one refused to take vitamins, minerals, immune-producing organics (you can see the partial list on my website), and cancer was advancing at a very high rate. Or, if a person felt they were incapable of defending themselves through doing some research, and felt \"helpless.\" I have run into cancer patients who were so scared to death, that they would only do what their physician told them, even if that physician was not obviously making them well. It was like watching a drowning victim grasping at twigs, when a life raft was within their reach. I understand cancer patients being frightened, and it can be an overwhelming and devastating feeling to be told you have \"cancer.\" When I was diagnosed with cancer, I had two overwhelming emotions--fear and anger. I turned both of these emotions into \"action,\" because I knew that if I was going to win and really kill this cancer, then I basically had to do it myself. I used surgeons as just one of the arsenals I had in my tool kit to kill and defeat cancer. Because more than 90,000 people die as a result of hospital \"screw ups,\" which is more than die on America's highways...I knew that I had to take control, and keep these people from making me sicker...I used them, the medical establishment did not use me to make money off me to pay for their expensive mortgage payments, their teenagers cars, and their trips to France. I have zero illusions regarding who doctors and surgeons are, they are people just like us. The tragedy is that cancer doctors do not tell the real truth about the so-called \"rates\" of cure when talking patients into taking chemotherapy and radiation. Chemotherapy and radiation make people sicker. And as I have said before: \"What makes you sick, makes you sick or sicker.\" The good news is that the medical establish is a) getting better at earlier diagnosis, and b) their are new research methods going on that don't kill or weaken normal cells in the body. But, we will just have to wait. If anyone is contemplating radiation and chemotherapy,just ask the oncologist and physician what the mortality or cure rates are...in comparison to what would happen if you didn't use any chemotherapy at all! My oncologist would not tell me...and I found out the cure/relapse rates myself. I was horrified. As I have stated before, in the types of chemotherapy offered me, my chances of getting cancer in the next five years actually increased by 5-10%, than if I did absolutely zero. Radiation has a very high rate of not only disfiguring the person, but high rates of causing secondary cancers. Just ask them! Then look up the research online. Therefore, go into chemo and radiation with your eyes wide open. Just because your doctor smiles at you, pats you on the head, and makes you feel as if he/she understands and cares about you...does not make the low \"cure\" rates of chemo and raditation better. Be very cautious of Tamoxefen and other such anti-estrogen drugs. Women's body's need a certain amount of estrogen for good health. The jury is still out whether or not low doses of estrogen, either occuring naturally, or by ingestion cause cancer. I hope I answered your questions. If you need to know more, or just want to gripe about it all...email me at: --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed. Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html ---- I care about women with breast cancer, because I had it, I grew up with it, and from the time I was 5 years old, breast cancer has plagued my life.
