    "Content": "Hi, I have all of these side effects. I have neuropathy which started with chemo, and progressed to point of requiring oxycontin to control the pain. I have been diagnosed with trigger finger in both thumbs, carpal tunnel in both hands, today i had cortisone injections in both feet for bone spurs, and the list just goes on and on. my physicial took me off of Arimedex due to severe (an understatement) bone pain. This started after being on the drug for only 6 weeks. I have been on Arimedex for 9 months and my onc is surprised I have been able to last this long. I know it is only due to strong narcotics I take for sensory neuropathy that this is so. i drop things constantly, have osteopenia, horrible muscle spasms, but they dont last very long and there is minimal residual pain, no energy, uncontrollable weight gain, and the memory problems. If all this werent backed up by tests of some sort I would think I were going crazy for sure. But I have awesome docs that are working with me to keep me on this for nas long as possible as my tumor was 99% estrogen reactive. i know i remember reading somewhere of studies showing most of these probles, and if i can find it I'll post the link. I have apost it on my laptop to remind me to look. take care everyone.",
