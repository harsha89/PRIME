    "Content": "My Dr ran all tests on me before I started my chemo and found that it had mets to my liver. It was the PET scan that detected. I have since started chemo and have gone thru all 4 treatments of adryamiacin and it has really done its job. The lesion on my liver has gone to half the size it actually was when first found. Did the onc do all tests on sis before starting on chemo?",
