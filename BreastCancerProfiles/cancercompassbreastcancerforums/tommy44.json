      "Content": "Hi! I am usually not one to sign up for sites like this. I am age 51 , male. Had male breast cancer 2 1/2 years ago. Partner left me because he hated looking at my scars. Dr. does not acknowledge post-mastectomy pain syndrome or chemo-brain. Lost my health insurance. Nobody around me understands that I freeze a lot after chemo and I found a new lump that i hope is just a fat glob.Â  I am crying daily and cannot find any support. I feel alone.",
