I wish you good health.  Thank you again.",

I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years now, having had a mastectomy in November 2003. Firstly I had hardly any side effects and slowly but surely they seem to be building up, some days far worse than the next. I have never had nausea though, thank goodness. The main side effects which I am experiencing now are aching bones and joints, mainly while trying to sleep at night. Also tiredness and seem to want to just go to bed to rest from as early as 8 in the evening - this is sad as I always went to bed late before my breast cancer. I also contemplated coming off the drug but decided that as the cancer hasn't come back at all in almost 2 years then perhaps I am doing the right thing in taking it every day. Hello everyone,  I wanted to let you all know that I was on Arimidex also.  First it was Arimidex...horrible rash developed after 5 months...then it was on to Exemestane (Aromasin)...bone pain, joint pain, hair loss.  But now my oncologist has me on Letrozole 2.5 mg once daily.  Hardly any side effects compared to other two drugs.  Bottom line is, if you are having bad side effects, call your doctor and tell him to change your medication!   ",

Thank you all for your input.  It really helps, as I do have a decision to make.  I truly hope they can find a resolution. I've suddenly had severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.  It started when I had an extreme case of cellulitis in my breast in Oct, which ultimately led to my diagnosis.  After mastectomy and reconstruction, they tried a different med, and about a week later another reaction.  So, I can sympathize with the skin rashes and itches.  I hope they can find a compromise for you.  Maybe a different, similar drug.  I'm sorry to hear about your drug reaction.  I contacted my doctor and was told that the reason for taking the anti-cancer drug is reasonable because I tested as node positive.  Meaning that a cancer cell was found in the sentinel node.  The doctor has now placed me on a drug similar in nature to Anastrozole but hopefully with less side effects.  Sit down with your doctor and have a list of questions for him.  Pros and cons about your situation.  Then make the decision that is right for you.  Good luck.",
