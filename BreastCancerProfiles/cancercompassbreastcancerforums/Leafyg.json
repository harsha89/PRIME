      "Content": "Thanks for the encouragement CAC.  I done this very thing nearly 7 years ago with my Mother-n-law,  she passed a yr. after she was diagnosed.  My sister has a determination that she never had.  I do strongly believe in prayer.  She is doing good and her spirit are high.  She will be coming home from the hospital on Sunday, we start chemo after she heals from surgery.  She told me today that giving up is not in her vocabulary or her near future...was so glad to hear that.  Thank you again.  Leafyg",

      "Content": "Just really green at all of this....been with my sister everyday for 6mths now doing chemo and stuff...yesterday they done radiacal mastectomy on her right breast.  They said they could not get all of the cancer...it is too close to blood supply in her arm and is in lymph nodes.  Would like to know if anyone has any info about someone going thru this and what is the likelihood that she might get cancer somewhere else ....she is continuing chemo and radiation after she heals.  plz help....feeling lost here.  Thanks  Leafyg",
