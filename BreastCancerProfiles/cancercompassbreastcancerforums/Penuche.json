      "Content": "I'm new to this forum so hope not too late to reply. I notice first post was 9/14. I was diagnosed DCIS no nodes in 2001. Bilat & recon. No treatment. June 2013 tumors in my spine were removed somewhat emergency after figuring out what symptoms really were. Triple HR2 positive. Tumors were pressing on spinal cord. As much removed as possible. 16 rounds radiation. Immed started Letrozole daily. Herceptin IV ev 3 weeks. Zometta IV ev 6 weeks now every 2 months. Also had a spot in hip, shoulder & skull. PET in Nov showed no activity. Tumor markers go up & down 10 points or so. Right now 29. Lowest since after surgery at 147. Doing well. No side effects. Hair thinned horrible from the Letrozole/steroids after surgery. Thats it. Strength, energy & balance are coming back & feel very good. Hope you do well on it too! I wish more taking Herceptin would comment. I'd like more info too. From what I understand it's a pretty kick ass drug & getting good results. ",

      "Content": "Yes I'm aware of the Perjeta & have had conversations w the Oncologist. I'm doing so well w just Herceptin (no activity last PET & markers remaining in low numbers) that she is wanting to wait to add. I was a little unusual as I did not hav chemo or radiation the first time around 2001. Was Stage 0 Insitu. So the cells are naive to the drugs. I think it will be added at some point. I have very little reaction to the Herceptin. Sometimes like you say a little fatigue. Just take it easy those days. The Zometta effects me more. Flu like symptoms. Aching joints. But only do that every 6 mo. And then Letrozole daily. I'm told there are a LOT of drugs for HER2 & developing more all the time. I like to focus on that. Yeah...the positive & positive people, energy & events. Agree w you there. We carry on! Best. ",
