    "Content": "Looking for advice and any help that can be offered. I'm a 28 year old mother if three who I have breast feed. 4 weeks ago i started having intense pain in my right breast, I also noticed that this breast which had been smaller than the left was now bigger. After 2 weeks I went to the doctor who suspected a cyst and ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed nothing and no cysts. Started on a double dose of antibiotic for mastitis which had no impact at all. When I went back to the doctor and given the scant results of the ultrasound ordered another which again has showed nothing but the tech doing the ultrasound told me my lymph nodes were very swollen which explained the intense pain which spread to under my arm but given I had almost finished the antibiotic should not of been the case. I have been back to my doctor and he now feels he is out of his depth and has referred me to a surgeon who I'm waiting to see. I am very keen to have a biopsy and my doctor thinks this is a good idea and the surgeon would be the one to do it. I feel like I'm waiting and waiting and getting no answers. Waiting for my blood work to come back, is it going to be cancer? Has any one else had this happen?",
