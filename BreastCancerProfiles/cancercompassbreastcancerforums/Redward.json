      "Content": "Hi - I have to tell you, Dr. Todd Tuttle, the leader of this study, was my surgeon for both of my BC surgeries (nine years apart).  While I agree with you that it seems this is a man's point of view - you'd have to know Dr. Tuttle.  He is one of the kindest, most compassionate doctors I know.  During my very first visit to him (8:30 a.m., Valentine's Day, 1997), I was a wreck!!!!  I hadn't eaten breakfast cause I thought I would lose it.  Well, my stomach growled while he was examining me.  He didn't say anything until it growled again.  Then he stopped, looked me in the eye and asked if I'd eaten breakfast.  I said I couldn't.  He offered me donuts that he had brought in for the nurses.  I declined of course!  When it growled a third time, he begged me to let him get me a donut.  I don't know of too many other docs that would have done that!  I would recommend him to any one who has to deal with this ugly disease! I had just a lumpectomy with my first diagnosis and started with a lumpectomy on the other side when I got the second diagnosis.  Ended up with a double mastectomy after chemo because of DCIS in the new side, my own history and my family history.  Dr. Tuttle is a doctor who presents the options, makes sure you understand the issues at hand, but then steps back and lets you make the decision.  He never made me feel like I was making the wrong decision. I think I get to see Dr. Tuttle in two weeks (yes, I get excited to see him cause I like and admire him so much).  It will be interesting to get his take on all this and see what was really behind it.

      "Content": "I took Femara for 20 days and regret it!  I have now been diagnosed with fibromyalgia which my doc feels is directly related to the Femara.  I've already been through BC once ten years ago (on the left side).  Was diagnosed with the right side last November.  I took tamoxifen for five years the first time and ended up having to quit working for three years because of the insomnia and brain fog it created.  After taking the Femara for 20 days and already having awful hot flashes and the joint/leg/foot pain which was getting worse by the day, I have decided not to take anything.  I just have to pray that I'm making the right decision because I can't take the pain.  Unfortunately, I have been off the Femara since August 2 and the pain still has not gone away.  Actually it is spreading to my arms and hands now.",

      "Content": "Lisa, You are where I was one year ago today!  I was first diagnosed in 1997 when I was 39 with BC in the left breast with 4 positive nodes.  Did lumpectomy, chemo, rads and tamoxifen for five years (hellish years, I might add).  Well, last year, went for my mammo and saw my onc for yearly visit.  She said mammo was clear but that she didn't like the looks of the skin on my left side so decided to do an MRI.  I didn't want to go through the hassle, but she talked me into it.  I can only thank God that she did!  The MRI showed a 2 cm lump in my right breast.  It was unbelievable!!!  Here, I had done the tamoxifen for five years - and low and behold, the rotten stuff showed up again.   But at least it was a new primary vs. a recurrence!  Well, had a lumpectomy last December and they found multi-focal DCIS throughout that breast.  Also one positive node.  So, had chemo starting in January and then in June had a double mastectomy with reconstruction.  Life has been something that's for sure.  But, through all this, I have to remember that I beat it the first time for 10 years.  No reason why I can't do it again.  The only difference this time is that I tried to take Femara.  The side effects were awful.  I stopped after 20 days.  I did have gene testing done as my mother and five of her sisters have had breast cancer.  Surprisingly enough, I don't have the brca1 or brca2 genes.  They think our family must have it's own set of gene problems.  Oh well.  Life provides lots of challenges and it's up to us how we face them. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers, Lisa.  The week definitely will be long.  I remember I had to wait over a weekend the first time!  And I thought that was long!  The second time, I was with my son at his doctor's office (he had strep) and got the call while sitting waiting for the doc to come in.   Please let us know how things turn out.  I'll be watching the board for your results! Robyn ",

      "Content": "One thing I didn't say yesterday was that I was 39 the first time I was diagnosed and 49 the second time.  I spent my 40th and 50th birthdays doing chemo!  Now remember that each of us has a different pain tolerance.  Well, mine must be pretty low cause this was all pretty painful! At the time of the surgery, my surgeon removed my breasts and then the plastic surgeon came in and put the expanders in place.  They place the expanders under the chest muscles so those muscles can later hold the implants in place.  I had surgery on Monday and went home on Thursday (had a wicked surgical resident who tried to send me home the day after surgery.  I had to put my foot down and said absolutely not).  I did have two JP drains that I went home with.  But, I had those with both the lumpectomies.  Ugh! I was actually pretty scared leading up to this as I didn't know how I would handle it.  Would I be depressed, crying, etc.  Well, as it turned out, I was absolutely fine!!!!  The first time I looked at my chest was kinda hard.  But, not as bad as I thought it would be.  I was fairly well endowed and they left all of the extra skin in place (well, kinda in place - folds of skin just kinda hanging there). The plastic surgeon started filling the expanders two weeks after surgery.  The fill itself isn't painful - unless they go overboard and you'll know that right away.  Just say something and they'll back off and even withdraw some of what they've put in so it's not so painful right away.  It's a couple hours after the fill that things start to get pretty uncomfortable.   What's happening is they are stretching all the muscles so they can later accept the implants.  My PS gave me percocet to deal with it.  Lasted for about two days - although he says it should only last until the next morning.  So then you go every week to be filled.  One thing I figured out, it was better for me to get filled in the morning and then go on to work.  That way, I kept active during the day and the muscles didn't get quite so tight and painful.  When I first started getting fills, I would go at the end of the day then I'd go home and sit down.  By the time I got up to make dinner, yowza!  The pain was pretty intense!  So far, I've gone a total of 9 times.  I'm now as large as he can get me because of the radiation to the left side.  I think I'll be close to a C cup.  He did offer to do a \"lat flap\" which is bringing a muscle from the back to help fill in, but I declined.  I think I've had my fill of surgery and pain now! The expanders sit fairly high on my chest and are HARD!  I actually have a lot of fun with friends when we go out to eat.  I'm always poking them to show people how hard they are.  I've had a lot of pretty weird looks from servers!  My \"protrusions\" don't look right at this time, but my PS assures me I will look more normal once he puts the implants in.  I sure hope he's right! Once you are filled to where you want to be, the surgeon lets everything \"mature\" or \"ripen\" for six weeks.  That's the stage I'm in now.  I see my PS on 10/24 and hopefully will set a surgery date for the implants.  Can't wait to see the end result of all this pain!  I don\u2019t know anything about the final surgery yet \u2013 sorry.  I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be in the hospital or how long I will be expected to be out of work. The last decision I will have to make is whether to have my nipples replaced.  That\u2019s one surgery I don\u2019t know much about yet. Overall, I am truly happy with the decision I made.  I don't enjoy pain.  And I think it was hard having chemo first and then eight weeks later, having the surgery.  I'm definitely not as strong as I used to be!  But I think having younger, perkier ones may be okay.  I've always had to wear  a bra that was fully supportive - not pretty.  Now, I'll get to wear the pretty ones!  That's one plus! Any questions? Robyn  ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC on my left side in 1997, had a lumpectomy and chemo & radiation.  Then, in 2006, was diagnosed with BC on the right side.  Had the lumpectomy and when the results came back, they had found multi-focal DCIS all over the slides (multi-focal means cancer cells spread throughout the ducts - not just one place).  My surgeon, my gynecologist, my oncologist and my internist all agreed that a mastectomy was the best way - but - not the only way.  They did offer just to start watching me more closely.   Mammos and MRIs much more often - like every 3 to 6 months.  Well, I didn't think I could go through that stress every few months so opted for a double mastectomy with reconstruction.  (If you ever want to talk about the reconstruction side of it, just ask!  I will tell all!)   My mom also had bilateral BC and 5 of her 11 sisters had BC.  Only one of her sisters died of BC.  One of the reasons I decided on the mastectomy is because cancer is so strong in our family. One thing to think about, if you have radiation and later end up having to go through the mastectomy, it can be much hard to do reconstruction.  They will not be able to make me the same size I used to be because of the radiation.  Your skin and the underlying muscles are generally not as elastic so they won't stretch as much. Our decisions are ours to make - no one else's.  My husband wouldn't even tell me what he wanted me to do.  The first time, or this time.  I had to make this one on my own and I'm glad I did.  I'm totally comfortable with my decision and would do it again this way.  Not to say I enjoy what I've gone through and don't wish I had my old ones back, but the decision I made was the right one for me. Good luck to you! ",

Good luck!   ",
