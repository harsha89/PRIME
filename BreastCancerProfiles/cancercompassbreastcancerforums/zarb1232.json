Had maste,chemo 6 months, then went on tamox for 3 months, started getting blurred vision, switched to arimidex and then the real pain began..could have used a cane for walking...quit that..My oncolgist is really unhappy, but I dont believe that it is necessary to take those specific drugs to live...am doing alternative medicine for aromatase inhibitors like Dim, melatonin, vitamin d, mangosteen juice, green tea extract, maitake d mushroom extract, fish oils, little to no dairy, organic everything as much as possible walking 30 or more everyday........cant live the other way I tried Tamoxifin, Arimidex, Femora and finally Aromasin.  I had to stop all.  I to am going to take my chances.  I am exercising, changing my diet, and was most interested in this response. I want quality of life over the crippling effect of the Rxs. I could not take the headaches with Tomoxifin, the crippling bone pain of Arimidex, and the fatique and constipation of Aromasin and now... after I stopped (2 weeks) flare up of peripheral neuropathy (post chemo result) I have to work and cannot do this Rx and work too.  ",
