      "Content": "My joints hurt, too, and I have been wondering the same things.  I feel like I'm 104, especially in the morning when I first get out of bed.  I started taking Arimidex in September 2005.  I experienced hot flashes, vaginal dryness, but worst of all was the joint pain/stiffness and trigger finger in several of my fingers and both thumbs.  My oncologist switched me over to Aromasin in January 2006.  Sideeffects have remained pretty much the same, except that the trigger finger has subsided significantly and I'm having significant pain/range of motion limitations in the thumb/wrist area of both hands. Now I am going to try Femara (February 2007).  Maybe I'll do better on it.  Have you tried any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Celebrex, etc.)?  They work for some, I have heard.  Unfortunately, I'm allergic to all of them, so I can't try them.  I'm going to try the new Tylenol Arthritis product.  Maybe it will work for me. There is some talk that a low level of vitamin D might have some connection to the joint pain.  My oncologist just had my vitamin D level tested and I'm waiting for the results.  Tonight, while searching the web for something that would get rid of this joint pain, I ran across a suggestion to try accupuncture.  I think I am to the point where I am willing to have someone poke some needles in me if there is a chance it might help.  One of my concerns is that I might be doing some long term damage to my joints.  What I've heard is that once you stop taking this stuff, the pain goes away, but how can something hurt sooooo bad and not be doing any damage? Well, I don't know that I really have any answers for you (or me), but I guess there is some comfort in that there are a lot of us out there with similar sideeffects looking for answers.  -Lisa   ",

      "Content": "Hi Shelley,  My vitamin D levels came back within the \"normal\" range.  The article re: the possible vitamin D link was in the Washington University in St. Louis \"Record\".  The internet address on my print-out is: http://record.wustl.edu/news/page/normal/6909.html The only other comment I have about the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is that they don't come without sideeffects, also.  Sigh!!  Just be certain you understand the pros/cons of the drugs.  The accupuncture needles are only supposed to feel like a mosquito bite (per my sister the oncology nurse with an accupuncture masters degree).  I just have this aversion to needles.  But, I think my aversion to needles has been superceded by my need to get some relief from this joint pain. You might check Bastyr's website for possible info/links to Oriental medicine sideeffects.  It's the school my sister received her masters degree from and they seem to have an excellent reputation.  I have to say, my sister used accupuncture and chinese herbs during her chemo for breast cancer and did not seem to have a lot of the problems that others had on her same chemo treatment (i.e. mouth sores).  She was fortunate that our oncologist was willing to work with the Oriental medicines.  Other doctors were not so willing. -Lisa ",
