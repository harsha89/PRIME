      "Content": "ppp I'm 30. No children. I had thyroid cancer a couple of years ago. I have a grandma, an aunt, and a great aunt from both sides of my family who had breast cancer but I do not know what kinds. So I have ducts 'riddled' with papillomas. They were found by ultrasound after I had a really painful lump that went away by itself after about a week. My GP sent me for a few more 6 monthly ultrasounds, and then referred me to a general surgeon to ask what to do. The surgeon has done a few more 6 monthly ultrasounds and one mammogram. On ultrasound the little guys don't seem to change or multiply, and I haven't had any more painful lumps. But at my last appointment the surgeon said he thought I would eventually need the ducts removed. Is that right? I feel pretty strongly against preventative surgery.Â  As well as this I hate general anaesthetics and believe I experience side effects for 6-12 months afterwards, in particular cognitive problems. And the hardest part of recovery after any surgery I've had has seemed like trying to shake off the anaesthetic. I would be much more willing to consider the surgery if I could have it under local anaesthetic. My surgeon however said he would not. Is anyone aware of this ever being performed? With my long medical history and previous experience of cancer, I am not afraid of it. So to me it makes perfect sense to continue to ultrasound for the rest of my life, or until I one day develop cancer, and then have a mastectomy, lumpectomy or ductectomy, and chemotherapy or radiation if necessary. And if it's just in one breast I could have a preventative ductectomy on the other breast under the one anaesthetic. This to me is completely reasonable. But I got a response from my surgeon like I was a bit insane.",
