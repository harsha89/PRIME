      "Content": "Hi again   I have taken three treatments intravenous, I'm having to go  back to work in two weeks.I ask the Doc. it I could switch on oral chemo. It takes two hours to get to the hospital and then I'm their for another two hr.. I'm on the TAC cocktail. It didn't spreed anywhere else, it stayed in the breast which I had it removed, & 11 lip nodes. He said that oral chemo is just for people with cancer in the other parts of the body. Is this true?  Would someone out their  know the answer to this?                                             Thank you  Rose  ",
