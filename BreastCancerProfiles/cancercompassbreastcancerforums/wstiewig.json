      "Content": "Hey, my first time here.  one week into a 35 week radiation regimen, and 3 cisplatin blasts in the meantime. the first one kicked my butt!  I really thought I could do without the peg tube, going to have that put in tomorrow.  too skinny to keep losing like this.  the mucus is atrocious, and the anxiety is eating me alive.  can't sleep for any length of time.  I know all the advice about positive thinking, etc....but when they give u a 50/50 prognosis, and you're only 52, and just starting to enjoy life with your 3 year old grandson, this is a real kicker in the self doubt arena.",
