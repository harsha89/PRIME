I try to accept things, but you know, we all have those dark nights where the doubts come back.  Funny you mentioned the chiropracter.  Two days before I went to the hospital with back spasms (and found out about the cancer) I had been to a chriopracter.  He did not take x-rays and told me he knew exactly what the problem was, etc.  I went through an adjustment session and yikes, my back felt terrible.  He told me that was normal and to come back the next day.  I did and received another treatment, which made things worse.  The next day is when I went to the hospital.  So I think your doctor is right on this.  When you have growths on your back, I don't think chiropractic treatment is good.  Plus, I know for me they are worried about the bone retaining its strength (that's why I take the Zometa).  Good luck and let's try to keep in touch during our \"adventure.\"  Cindy",

      "Content": "Yes, there is always hope.  I was just like your mother in that I always had annual mammograms -- and they always came back clear.  Then in March 2007 I had terrible back pains and had to go to emergency.  They discovered that I had 4th stage metastatic breast cancer.  My lesions are all along my spine. (To this day, nothing has ever shown up in my breasts.  The random cancer cell that was once there traveled through my blood stream to my bones.)  They gave me 2 months to one year to live.  Here it is September 2009 and I am not only alive but back to work full-time.  I of course, still have the cancer; I have to think of it as a chronic condition.  I have chemo off and on and also get treatments of Zometa for my bones; but it is something I've learned to live with.   So you have lots of hope for your mother.  Don't let her give up the fight!!
