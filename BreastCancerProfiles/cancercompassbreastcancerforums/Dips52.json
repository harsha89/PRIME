But the worst side effect that I can only attribute to Arimidex is all over itching with no rash etc. I quit Arimidex with my doctors permission and none of the pain or itching have gone away yet. I have been to a dermatologist, allergist, oncologist, gynecologist, rheumatologist and my primary care doctor. None could find an answer or help for the itching other than taking up to 8 antihistamines a day!! So I decided I'd see a neurologist. She put me on Neurontin and it kicked the itching immediately. So I did some research and found that Progesterone is lowered as well as estrogens, by Arimidex. When progesterone is too low, GABA is lowered too. GABA is a neurotransmitter. It is a calming neurotransmitter. In lowered levels it can trigger systemic itching. Now for the interesting part. Neurontin's generic name is Gabapentin. It increases GABA in the transmitter world of the body. It also helps with nerve pain. My sciatica is a little improved and the itching is gone as long as I take the Neurontin.. I will not take anymore of the cancer drugs. My oncologist said I probably would do worse on tamoxifen so I passed on it and another one. I am working on my diet and exercise to hopefully deter the cancer from returning. Has anyone else experienced this horrific itching? I pray it can be reversed eventually so I can stop the Neurontin too. I hate medicines. I have Lupus and have had it for 20 some odd years. I had about 10 years of horrible illness and meds with that and am happy to say it is under control now for the past 7 years. So now you can see why I hate meds! Well, I have rambled enough. Let me know if anyone has experienced itching. Thanks!I just started taking the same pills about 3 months ago, I assumed it was the pill but was afraid to stop. I'm going crazy with this terrible itch, I called my oncologist today but she hasn't gotten back to me yet I'm going to tell her about what I read here, if she doesn't agree I'm going to see a Neurologist. I know this was written a few years ago but I would love to know how you are going today. Thanks for sharing!",
