    "Content": "Hi Nancy I had a Latissimus Dorsi Flap breast reconstruction in July 2007, the back muscle is tunneled under the armpit and transferred to the front. I have  a 12 cm scar on my back, the line slanted.  Usually with this procedure a small implant is used but I have opted out of it as it is a foreign material.  I asked my surgeon, he said so far he has only done this reconstruction without an implant on two other women. I saw him in November 2007 and he was surprised that it looks beautiful.  The problem I have since the recon is nerve pain on and off along my arm on the operated side.  Some damage to the nerve resulted from the mastectomy and worsened with the recon. I had a Lt mastectomy in July 2003 and the scar line has always been tender from the radiation.  I had chemo of adriamycin, 5FU and cyclophosphamide.  I am a public patient and have been on the waiting list since 2004 and in this year the surgeon left the hospital system to go private.  I was referred to another surgeon in 2006 who has returned from the USA and have done mostly breast reconstructions.  He was very skilled but said he had enough of breast recon and wanted to do other cosmetic surgeries. The operation took about 2 to 3 hours and have no problems with recovery.  I wanted a DIEP recon but it was not possible as I had previous surgery (a scar in the midline). My colleague had a DIEP recon in 2006 and it looks natural as the fat taken from the abdomen is wobbly.  She has a scar right across her abdomen under the bikini line.       I have changed my lifestyle (no red meat, organ meat, diary, coffee and fast food etc) and drink green tea and vegetable juices since my diagnosis.  I cook my food the long way (no convenience food).  I believe it is important to prevent a recurrence and giving the cancer not a chance to thrive.  I was offered tamoxifen and arimidex but I refused and this April will be my 5 year anniversary.  ",
