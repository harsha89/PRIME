      "Content": "Hi! I am Patty an I am a newby to this board. I had breast cancer the first time in my r breast, 5 years later in my left breast. At that point I had to bi-lateral mastectomy and a hysterectomy. Last summer I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to my bones. It started with a sharp pain in my upper back. I now go monthly for Zometa for my bones and a hormonal injection for the cancer  (i can never remember the name of it). Overall my health is ok, except for the aches and pains that go along with it. Oh, it's also in my liver. The liver has improved as well as my lesions. I just try to live on day at a time. If you want to be friends, send me a request. I am a great listener! God Bless You All!",
