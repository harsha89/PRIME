    "Content": "I saw your question and I just discontinued Aromasin because of hand and feet pain. A baby aspirin would not have begun to cut the pain from Aromasin. There are two other drugs in the same chemical family as Aromasin. But, they probably have the same side effects. One is Femara (which hurt me as much as Aromasin) and the other was just prescribed to me today. And don't have the name of it. It's being filled at the pharmacy right now. These two other drugs are worth trying, but only for two months each. I take Tylenol with codeine and Advil for pain. Hope this helps! Lori",
