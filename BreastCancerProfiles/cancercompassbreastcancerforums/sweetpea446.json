    "Content": "Hello Jodie & Patti, I am a 61 year old Gramma with the same thing...as of today. I had BC in June of 04. Lumpectomy, cent. node biopsy..none in lympy system. 4 rounds of chemo at 3 week intervals, 35 rounds of radiation. I had a clean bill of health in April 07 but I told the nurse practioner I had a feeling of blood pressure in the right side of my neck. She was very curt, saying anyone who smokes will end up with high blood pressure sooner or later. She did not take my bp or examine my neck. In August I happened to lay my hand on my neck and there it was, half as big as an egg. They did a pet scan and found numerous lymph nodes involved. Some in the middle of my chest, deep ones. One in my left chest and the ones in my right neck. Today my oncologist told me that after the ct scan they think it is my bc met. They found numerous non-calcified nodules in my lungs. All less than a 1/4 cent. He is going to call tonight or tomorrow when he knows for sure. I know you know how this feels but this is not a good day for me and it has been a long and hard 6 weeks of testing and waiting. I have been very positive since it all began but today has gotten me down more than I ever have been. Can someone give me some (positivity)Â combo word, positive and activity, from Vicki Girard's book \"There Is No Place Like Hope.\" I wish the best for both of you, Jean",
