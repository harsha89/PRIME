    "Content": "Hi, As I said I'm new here, I had a total thyroidectomy on 6/22/07 .  I am having really bad lower back and leg muscle aches, water retention, face, hands and feet, and alot of other things we all have to go through, you know the list. Well anyway I was wondering if there is anything to ease the muscle issues until I am on hormone replacement, this is my main complaint. Does anyone have any good information?  Also I was wondering what causes the water retention. Thanks so much for any and all info! Linda",
