    "Content": "I was given taxol approximately nine years ago and had knee surgery about 18 months ago and have been very slow recuperating . I still have lots of fluid around my knee and joint pain , it was just a repair to a meniscus tear . I'm wondering if it's got anything to do with the joint complications Taxol sometimes causes ? Any thoughts?",
