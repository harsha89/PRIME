    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ. I will be having a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy this week. I have had an MRI of both breasts and it was negative. I am really torn on the issue of radiation. In one breath the doctors say it is really a pre-cancerous condition, so why the need to damage healthy breast tissue following the lumpectomy? If they cut surrounding tissue and get a clean edge and the node biopsy is negative it seems as though 5 weeks of radiation is overkill. If there is anyone that can help me sort this out I would appreciate your input. The medical profession in my area only support conventional cancer treatments so they are not much help.",
