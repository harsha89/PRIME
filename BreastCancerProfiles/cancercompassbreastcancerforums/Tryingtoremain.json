    "Content": "I was dx., with breast cancer in Sept., 2006..Under went 2 lumpectomy's & 33 radiation treatments which was completed on Jan., 11-2007.. Feel very lucky.. I currently take Arimidex.. I do notice hand & knee pain, increased hotflashes, fatigue, & unable to sleep.. I recently had a follow up ultrasound which showedÂ  tissue thickening & fluid pocket..They now want me to have a breast MRI with fluid aspiration and possible tissue bx of thickened area. What am I to think?? Want to remain + yet worried.. Any one experience this? It seems with everything I have read no one seems to keen on Arimidex.. Plz talk to me would like to learn as much as I can... Thank u & my thoughts are with u.. Deb",
