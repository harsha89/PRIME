      "Content": "I have been taking tamoxifen for 8 months. My pesonal veiw is that it is worth taking even if you do get side effects. If it stops the cancer regrowing than it has got to be worth a go. I did have a few side effects like problems with my vision which went after 3 months and a few menapausal side effects...hot sweats. I have managed them by cutting out caffine and reduce my wine drinking. I do get cramp now but a small price to pay. My weight hasnot really change but my stomach is a little bloated. I was unlucky and had a hysterectomy 5 weeks ago. The drug had inflamed my uteris and caused me pain but since the operation i have not had that pain.....fingers crossed it doesnot return.",

      "Content": "Hi I had the same problem with clothes.This is my first summer so i am still learning what i can get away with. I have gone to charity shops and found a really lovely dress's and then found a maker who alters the straps etc.(can work out cheaper than buying a new dress).It all depends on what the fashion is and this year the cut is low. Plain T shirts under low cut tops/dress is one idea. Also tops with straps you can alter so you can bring the hight of the top up. The swimming costume bit is a little different. I have bought a costume from Nichole Jane. The only problem that i have found is that if you get out of the water too quickly you suprise the prosthesis and it slaps back on your skin and makes a bit of a noise. Have now learnt to get out of the water slowly. I know it is frustrating but to be honest i wear tops/dresses and you can sometimes see my radation marks but what the hell.The starps are hell to live with but try a skin coloured bra or wear one that you can see, make it part of the top.",

I go swimming a couple of times a week.(swim 2/3 miles a week). I know that they say repetative excerse is not good for the arm but i have found that it has worked for me. It has not stopped the pain but eased it off. I have been told that it is just something you have to live with.",

      "Content": "Hi I have have had breast cancer/removal/radio/tamox and was clear for 1 year and 5 months. The cancer reappearred in my neck so it was chemo this time along with radio. I have now finished my treatment but have had bad lower back ache for 5 weeks now. I have had an xray which has come back clear so now i am waiting for a bone scan. Has anyone else had this problem or i am just the lucky one getting an extra complaint? Also i am going to be starting Arimidex, i know that you can get some nasty side effects but do the last for the whole time that you are on the drug or do they ease off after a while? Any info would be greatfully received Kim",
