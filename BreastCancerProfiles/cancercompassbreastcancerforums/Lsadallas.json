      "Content": "I was 38 years old with breast cancer in 2004. I just found out this week that I have liver mets. I am seeing a surgeon on Tuesday to see if he will offer anything. My Oncologist said that after I see him, I should go to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She said there is really nothing else she can do for me. She told me that since it is less than 2 years since the original diagnois, and I have mets already, then I have microscopic disease throughout my body and that it is just going to keep popping up everywhere. Have any of you with liver mets had to go to MD Anderson or to Sloan Kettering in NY? How and what is the statis of your treatments now?",

It sounds by your post that your sister stayed at the facility for several weeks without going home. Did her insurance cover this? How long was she there for total? How sick did the treatments make her? I am glad you said the doctors name, I will have to ask about seeing him.",

      "Content": "I'm 39 and found liver mets in January. I went to MD Anderson. They started me on Abraxane for two rounds (I have only had one so far, next one in a few weeks). The next step is stem cell transplant. The stem cells will come from my sister. They said her cells will do a seek and destroy on the cancer cells. They didn't give me any numbers, but said it has had a \"very high\" success rate. Hope that helps you. MD Anderson has been great, but if you want to go there, start the process now. You can go to their web site and do a self referral. It took about a month to get in because they need ALL your records before they give you an appointment. You get an appointment if they think they can help you.",

      "Content": "Janet, I see the specialist at MD Anderson for the stem cell transplant on April 11. I can't answer many of your questions yet because I don't have all the information. What I was told was that the donor MUST be a relative and the best chance for a match is from a sibling. They check the donor for a match through a blood test (which MD Anderson mails them a kit to take to a local lab). If there is a match they have to go through a medical check up like EKG's, etc.but that has to be done at MD Anderson. My insurance pays for all donor expenses (if approved by insurance). They said they will kill off my cells before they transplant the new ones from my sister (sounds like it is similar to bone marrow transplant). I don't have any time frames on how long this takes yet. I hope that helps. Lisa",

My markers when first diagnosed was 45 at which time I had 3 breast masses, lung and liver masses. It went as high as 68, at which time a new tumor mass had shown up. I am now cancer free, but the markers jump around each month from 37 to 55. Up and down, up and down. I just had scans done, and still no cancer seen. The doctors told me as long as they are jumping around like this, it is a good sign. It would only be a bad sign if they where in a steady rising pattern. What have some of you experienced?",

      "Content": "Patti, I just saw your post today. I am also estogen positive. I never took Femura, so I am not familiar with it. I will tell you that both my lungs had numerous growths found in 2004. We saw some of them shrink during chemo. I started Tamoxifin in Feb. 2005, still having growths in both lungs. In June 2005, my lungs where clear. Nothing found, and they have been clear ever since. I am not still on Tamoxifin, since I had a tumor show up on my liver in Jan. 2006. I am cancer free now. I did not have the pain you are describing. Who are you treating with and why don't they want you on the stongest first? I treat at Texas Oncology at Presbyterian Dallas. I see Dr. Kristi McIntyre. I also went to MD Anderson in Houston from March of 2006 to August 2006 to get their opinion. Hope to hear how you are doing soon, now that it has been 2 weeks. Lisa in Dallas   ",

      "Content": "I think you meant metastatic BC. I was diagnosed with stage 4 BC in 2004. I had tumors in the breast, lungs and liver. I also did the lumpectomy, chemo and radiation in 2004. By 2005, I had no cancer. Then in 2006 it came back in my liver. Again, I did surgery and chemo. I am now disease free again. I was 38 yrs. old when this started. I never thought I would live to see 40. This month I will be 41. Your daughter can beat this. I also went through what she did with losing my hair both times and dealing with all the side effects. It was all worth it. If she is having trouble with dealing with the stress of treating her cancer, there is nothing wrong with having her doctor give her anti-depressants. It is very difficult to go through what she is dealing with, and it is hard to deal with the stress of feeling sooooo sick and wondering if you are going to survive. Many, many cancer patients need help dealing with treatment, and anti-depressants can help. If her doctors ever say there is nothing else they can do to help her, find a new doctor. There are new drugs coming out all the time. The chemo I took in 2006 wasn't available when I was first dianosed in 2004. Tell her to keep fighting and keep praying. If she is feeling positive and keeps up with her treatment, she can win. I am living proof that stage 4 can be beat. I am a 3 yr. survivor and plan to celebrate yrs. 4, 5, and more. She can do it too. God Bless you all, He has certainly been blessing me and I pray that she will receive that kind of blessing too. Lisa from Dallas   ",

      "Content": "Cinnamon, I just saw your post today or I would have responded sooner. I went through the crying and fear too when I had mets discovered in 2006. I agreed to let the family doctor prescribe a mild anti depressant called Lexapro. It made all the difference in the world. I don't cry and feel afraid and helpless anymore. I know the God is in control, but I found myself having tears run down my face while cooking dinner, driving, doing laundry, etc. I knew from research, that it is believed that half the battle is in the mind, and it is very important to stay positive and have a fighting spirit, not a defeated spirit. I can only say that God cleared my lungs. I had finished chemo and radiation to the breast and my lungs still showed multiple nodules in each. For 10 months we watched them, some of which shrunk during chemo. Then 3 months after all treatment was finished, my lung scans came up clear. They have been clear ever since. This June it will be 2 years. I had a dry cough, but did not have pain when my nodules where there. I hope you and your mom are doing better since it has been over a week since you posted your message. What is your mom's name? I would like to pray for her and you. Lisa in Dallas",
