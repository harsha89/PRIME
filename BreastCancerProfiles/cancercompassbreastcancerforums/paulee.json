    "Content": "Hi Sabine, First of all I have said a prayer to give you strength and courage, God bless you. From everything I have experienced it seemed to help a lot, but you have to stick with it. I Know one Ojibwe man, and many of the Ojibwe swear by it, and have been using it for literally hundreds of years. They would know, and the FDA won't say.  My wife was so weak when we started she literally could not stand up. I did a shot (1.5 oz) with her every day to keep her interested. It doesn't taste bad. We noticed her getting color in her cheeks within a couple weeks, and she was back on her feet in about three wks. (still a bit weak). At the time she had secondary metastasized breast cancer and it didn't interfere with any of her conventional treatments (hormones, chemo, etc.), and as a matter of fact it helped with her nausea as well. I wish we would have had the essiac early on. We found it the second time around. She was receiving herceptin, and a friend said we should give the essiac a try. I do not think it was a coincidence, but the cancer had spread to her organs, lungs, and chest cavity. The tumors began to shrink quickly, visible on the scans. The Oncologist attributed it to the treatment, (he had a surprised look on his face though) but I truly believe in my heart she was given a couple good years because of the essiac. My wife had a lumpectomy immediately, then we did the chemotherapy watching her white cell count. They introduced the hormones during chemo. After several months of chemo there was a break, then the radiation. There is a lot of ways to package essiac, but I suggest either of these. The first one is a bit pricey, but highly recommended. http://astore.amazon.com/naturalcancertopical-20/detail/B000 one in the concentrate is really inexpensive per dose at $8.97 for a months worth but I haven't tried it, the mix sounds right. http://astore.amazon.com/naturalcancertopical-20/detail/B001",
