    "Content": "I've been on arimidex almost 2 yrs now. The first 3 months I had no side effects then started having bone pain, getting stiff after sitting too long, trouble getting out of the car, etc. Also fatigue. Just the past few nites, I wake up sweating with my hair soaking wet and my bedding and pajamas damp. I see my oncologist on Monday and will relay all this to him. I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this while taking arimidex. Thanks, Sandy ",
