      "Content": "I am also taking arimadex - I have diarreaha (sp) a lot - I didn't know this was a side effect - but I  have had diarreaha(sp) since starting chemo, tamoxophin etc.  My oncologist always talked about constipation - not ever a problem!!! It is kind of comforting to know that others have the same issues that I have had.  thanks",

      "Content": "You WILL get through this!!  The medicines they now give you reduce the efects of chemo so that you shouldn't get sick or nausiated.  I went through the same chemo 8 months ago - I am 58 years old. Take the medicines that they give you for anti-nasia (sp) they really do help.  There will be days when you don't want to eat - make sure you have someone who will fix you as much as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a glass of juice.  You won't want a big meal- that's ok.  Just try to get some nutrition each day - yogurt, peanut butter, fruit.  You don't need much- just enough to keep you going. Lots of fluids with chemo - kind of washes the bad stuff out!!  Especially at the beginning when you get the \"red stuff\" - flush it out!!! I know it seems awful - it did to me too - but, the doctors are doing their best to save your life!!! So take the time in chemo to savor all of you blessings - it is a very safe place!  I now go every three weeks to have Herceptin treatments and I look forward to the time to just \"let down\" and tune out to the world around me.  If your hospital provides counseling as mine does at no charge, take advantage of it.  My counselor has been of invauable help to me throughout my treatment as she was a oncology nurse and a radiologist nurse before going into counseling so she can tell me what is going on all the time and can deal with my doctors directly when I need more emotional support.  I wish you  well.",

      "Content": "I am 58 and was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer - right side only, but it was not even an option for me even though several doctors said I needed only a right mastectomy - I chose to have a double - at our age, what it the point.  To live or not, maybe. That is your choice of course.  Radiation was not unpeasant until the last week - I am fair skinned and my skin peeled off to the point of raw skin - it was ugly and I was scared and upset and I had to take some pain pills for a few days. 4 weeks later, everything healed and I am ok now.  It wasn't pleasant by any means, but I feel that my radiogist got all of the portential cancer cells killed by treating my cancer breast and the incision.  I wish you all the best. I think everything I went through was worth it.  Robin",

      "Content": "I wish you peace with your decision - I opted for a double mastectomy with chemo and radiation and I feel really good about it - everyone's story is so personal and different - I couldn't even share this a month ago. So, each person needs to do what she feels is right for her. I feel \"cured\" for now - there is obviously no guarantee - I was stage three when I went into this.  I love my medical oncologist - he is very factual yet compassionate and I think that made a huge difference in my reaction to treatment!",
