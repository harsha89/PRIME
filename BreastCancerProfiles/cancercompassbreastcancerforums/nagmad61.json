      "Content": "I am a newbie.  I have recently had a second mastectomy, the first being 17 years ago.  I had a breast reconstruction on the remaining breast in February this year.  The tissue that was removed contained a DCIS so I opted to have a mastectomy. The tissue from the mastectomy contained a 7mm cancer.  I have been recommended to have Arimidex for a max. of 10 years.  I took Tamoxifen 17 years ago and couldnt tolerate it after 2 years.  I have read about the side effects of Arimidex and feel like it is all going to happen again.  I already suffer long term affects from Tamoxifen and Arimidex seems marginally less destructive but some of the comments I have read on this site make me seriously question whether I want to put myself through this again.  Is there anyone out there who declined hormone blocking treatment and is still going strong?",

      "Content": "My thoughts exactly.  I have always listened to my gut reaction and acted on it wherever possible.  There have been outside influences that have made me question my decisions, and have, in the past, persuaded me to change my initial decision.  On this occasion I have a strong feeling that not taking Anastrazole, is the best treatment for me.  I stand by my decision and will blame no-one else if it proves to be the wrong one.  I am willing to take that risk.  Thank you for your comments.",

      "Content": "Hi there. Thank you for your candid reply. I am of the opinion that I would rather choose not to take these meds. Like you I have been through the chemo and radiotherapy routes and have had to deal with the legacies they leave. I already ache all over, have recuring UTI's, suffer mood swings...in fact most of the side effects listed. I not only want to be alive, I want to  LIVE. Thank you for your honesty. I hope you get some relief, whatever your decision. Be good to hear how you get on. Wishing you well, and good luck. ",
