    "Content": "Elaine H.: I too am working grandma who had the works done and never considered reconstruction as I am just happy leaping and clearing daily hurdles to get on with each day God gives me. I really think it's important to be busy and active and not dwell on things as God will surely help along the way. I live in a 3rd world country and have to work hard to pay fror my chemo and rads (no insurance) and was let go from my work last month (reason sited was lost time for surgeries (a huge 20 days after 1 year).Â  Of course I was upset, but took that as a sign I should definitely work for a better Company. Opportunities are opening up and I'm very positive that I can continue to be productive and happier than ever. I look back to what used to make me upset and it all seems so very trivial to me now. What was I thinking??? I thank God that he opened my eyes and he makes me new each day. I don't really know God that well, but he seems to be very nice and loving. I pray for anyone with Cancer that they see through the very worst (what is the worst that can happen, truly) and pray that they find compassionate Dr.'s and Nurses along the way. Jen",
