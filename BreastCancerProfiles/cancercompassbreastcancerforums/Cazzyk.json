      "Content": "Hi  This is the first time i have ever done  anything lije this. Don't do face book or twitter. However, my twin has a massive lump and her nipple is now inverted. She went in to see her doctor last night  who was upfront and told her its looking like cancer. We talked it through about a year ago when she felt the intial lump on her breast. She has decided not to go down the road of chemo or radiation. So when i came across your article i was greatly encouraged. We live in the U.K but don't know what other alternative treatment is availble. No doubt we  will now start to research. When my sister came home from the doctors surgry(where she works) last night we both experienced a REALITY kick. If you get my meaning. I was upset and so was my sister. But hey she is the stronger one of the two of us. At least mentally.  We lost our brother last year who was healthy didnt smoke or drink and was fine  when he went into hospital, but sadly, after he was put into an induce coma, he never came through . My sister sensed deeply that these experiments in this specialised unit were ummmm........to say the least and sensed or discerned that our brotherwas already dead. .... Anyhowback to my sister. We are belivers and trust in the Lord , though this is not the reason behind refusing treatment . My sister has always been  health  concious in her daily diet. Does not smoke or drink. (Whereas i like red meat and chips).T his has been a huge help and i know my twin sister will also get a lot from it its her kind of thing. So again big thankyou . She also has green and fruit smoothis daily and apple cider vinigar. Guess We will have to check out what food to ea and what to avoid. Cazzyk ",
