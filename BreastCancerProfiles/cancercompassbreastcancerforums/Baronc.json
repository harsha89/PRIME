      "Content": "Hi BCFP, Sounds like your a strong person.  You should ask a friend or two to help you out.  Most friends will come to your aid if you ask.  Everybody backs off a little when you say you had cancer (like they are going to catch it from you) Ha Ha,  But you should ask 2 of your friends for help when you need it.  My cousin is 33 now and I had not seen her in years until she was at John's Hopkins for treatment.  Now she's living with us putting up a great fight against Stage 4 gallblader cancer.  So you should check with a friend or two just as backup.  If after a treatment you don't think you can get yourself home or you just need someone to talk to it would be best to tap a friend for help.   Good luck with your fight.

      "Content": "  On 7/26/2007 boobie cancer fightin pri wrote: Hello all! I just wanted to introduce myself as I am new to this site. My name is Melissa or as I like to refer to myself \"boobie cancer fighting princess\". I was diagnosed with Stage IIA breast cancer- Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Carcinoma In Situ- on March 15, 2007 at the age of 31. I am a BRCA2 carrier so I underwent a bi-lateral mastectomy on May 3rd (my dad's bday) immediately followed by reconstruction. I just underwent my second surgery for the reconstruction on July 16 (day before my 32nd bday). I start radiation in August and am currently taking Tamoxifen. I do not have to do Chemo, as I was randomly selected to not have that treatment as part of a clinical trial that I am participating in. I start my ovarian cancer screenings in August as well. Anyway...that is my BC story. One of the hardest parts for me is that I do not have a \"caregiver\" being that I am not married or in a relationship, do not have any children, and my closest family members are 42 miles from where I live. So I do everything myself and that is only compounded by the fact that I'm back at work and am an insomniac. Good day all!  ",
