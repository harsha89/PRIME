    "Content": "To make a long story short, my sister has been battling cancer for the past 2 yrs. In remission for almost 5 years before returning.  It started as Breast cancer, now spreading to the liver, spine, abdomen, and brain.  2 mos. ago, her dr. has told her she has probably 3-5 mos. to live.  My question is, does it happen  fast?  I mean I've seen people who have cancer suffer for weeks or months and then die.  To look at my sister, you would never know she has cancer,  she still has her hair with this treatment (I believe is Doxil) and she looks great.  She has most of her pain in her abdomen and spine but is on alot of painkillers.  The biggest disappointment is her memory,  it is horrible, from one minute to the next she can't remember and gets very discouraged. We're not sure if its from the cancer or the drugs.  So, this is tough to ask but am I holding out hope for nothing, seeing she looks so good and performs her daily tasks pretty well, napping often. Is it possible to only have such a short time to live? I guess I should also say, when she was first diagnosed about 7 years ago with Breast cancer, the drs. told her flat out to get her things in order that she had a very aggressive form of cancer.  She was living on the East coast at the time, so we back on the West coast were not able to speak with her drs. personally.  She had a mastectomy, chemo, and recovered amazingly.  She has a tremendous amount of faith and relies on God thoroughly.  To all of us, it was a miracle, so we are praying and hoping for another miracle.    I would love to hear any similar cases, and honesty. Thank you much and God Bless,    Caring Sister",
