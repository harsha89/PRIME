      "Content": "Hello Randy and community, I am a 45 year old healthy male living in Colorado. I have never had cancer nor any Bisphoshonates EVER! I also have developed ONJ and it is developing very quickly. I am very concerned with what is going to happen with my jawbone and the pain is out of this world. I am just blown away with how this can be such a problem and Randy and I are the only ones that have contracted this ONJ without any of the normal onset of problems that are usually contracted with it. Oh the joys of something else our lovely FDA has allowed to pass into our food or some Monsanto shit that is going to kill us all off with a ton of pain one by one. This sucks and I am not happy about it at all. I am sure I will be sad later but right now I am still angry and want to know why this horrible ONJ is pleauging us healthy people. It is more than what we think it is at this point and I can guarentee this is going to be popping up a bunch in the future.",
