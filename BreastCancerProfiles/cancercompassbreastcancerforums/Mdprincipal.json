We may not have any other treatments available to us after chemo, but what we do have going for us is that the farther out from diagnosos we get, the less chance we have for recurrence. They say that after the first two years, which is the most common chance of recurrence for us, the recurrence rate diminishes greatly. After you get to five years, it is said that we are once again like the normal population. Women with positive receptors do not get this chance. They are at strong risk for recurrence for the rest of their lives. We are at less risk for recurrence the farther out we get. Some women are so fearful of being triple negative...I was happy to be - - -. When my breast surgeon told me I was triple negative, I went \"Yesssss!\" and he looked at me like I was crazy. I did not want any part of those meds that the positive receptor women have to take. Many of them have horrific side effect for all of the years they have to take it. They have to be screened closely for uterine cancer, if they are on Tamoxifen. I am sorry I got BC, but I feel I lucked out with the bc that I got...bad report and all. I am 5 years and two months out from diagnosis and I have not had a recurrence...knock on wood. I had a pretty bad pathology, large tumor, positive nodes, lymphatic and vessel invasion, micro focal spread, triple negative, etc, etc. I thank God everyday for his blessings. I wish the same for you. PS>>> I hope I haven't already posted in this thread. There are so many, I can't remember which ones I've visited. Sorry for any repetition cc4cure truefacesofbreastcancer.org  If you don't mind me asking...what chemotherapy did you have to take?  I WAS triple negative and took TAC for 6 rounds.  I did bilateral mastectomy because I was 34 when I was diagnosed.  I'm a little over a year out...",

They wont start rad Therapy, which some say we shouldnt have, some say your should,until the problems I am having have either resolved, or some one finds an answer to. You are in my prayers...is your rash going away? I had some weird effects that I attribute to the taxotere (I took TAC for 6 rounds).  And I still have some weird feelings...but it is not pain.  I'm not sure if what you're describing you think has arisen from the taxol...but who knows.  Please let me know how things are going so that I can continue to pray (I like to be specific :) ).  God Bless and Merry Christmas!",
