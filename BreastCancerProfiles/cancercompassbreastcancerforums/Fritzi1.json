    "Content": "I just had a bilateral mastectomy on 12/21.  I did have cancer in the left breast but had the right breast removed for preventive measures and did not have reconstruction.  I am so glad I did it this way---and only wish I had had a preventive mastectomy years ago.  There are people who won't understand your decision but you need to do what you feel is best. I disagree with anyone who says you are too young to have a preventive mastectomy.  That is wrong.  However,  I strongly feel you are too young to have to have needless worry and pain as you have had.  My best to you and I encourage you to go with what you feel is right for you. ",
