      "Content": "Jamie, I have been diagnosed with a spindle cell tumor. It is a metaplastic breast cancer. The tumor is not a typical breast cancer and is very rare. How was your Mother's cancer detected? Please share what type of surgery your Mom had, general surgeon or breast cancer surgeon, type(s) of treatment? Did she have treatment at a Hospital Breast Center? Was it rated Type I, II, or III cancer? Where had the cancer spread? There is little known about this cancer. Can you help me as to where I can learn more about this cancer? I have gone on the internet and can find very little information. Thanks, Rockylu",

      "Content": "Within the past month I have been diagnosed with Metaplastic Breast Cancer. It is a rare cancer. Tumor is in right breast but is not considered a typical breast cancer. It is fast growing cancer known to spread to lungs, brain & bones. Is anyone familiar with this cancer? I am supposed to have an incise lumpectomy, radiation & chemo. Have had a stereotactic biopsy by my regular surgeon. Biopsy sent to Hopkins who identified this cancer. Can anyone help me with any info about this type of cancer. Scared & overwhelmed, rockylu",
