I would see my oncologist(real nice guy) for follow-up and I would ask how will I know if the cancer comes back. With my breast it was a no-brainer-felt lump thought it would go away...mascectomy. But, what if it moves. Well, of course they would do blood work...but I stopped going this pass Feb. My decision, not doc's. So now I am asking for anyone who may have been in this situation-how do you know if what you're feeling is cancer. Stupid question I know. But, I stopped going to doctors because I do not feel well, but nothing ever showed up. For instance I have had a pain in my back (behind the breast that had cancer) before the surgery. All say it is nothing. Now I just feel foolish, but still do not feel well most of time. I cannot explain all here.  I feel silly even asking. But, maybe someone has been in my shoes. Thanks. I know I worry and most of the women in my support group.  Yes if you have a pain and want answers you better be your own advocate and be demanding for MRI or CAT scan - I had horrible pelvic pain last fall and they did a PET Scan with dye and found nothing.  I found out later it was a nerve from riding my bike and not moving the seat correctly.  Took 2 mos of chiropractic adjustments.  Trust me if the Doctor had cancer and has pains - they will run and get every test there is.  Why wait?  It could be the difference between early detection with little treatment or too late for any treatment.  This is your life - value it as I do mine.",

I read your message and wanted to hug you through the computer.  My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year so while I do not directly know what you are experiencing and what you have gone through...I do have an idea of some of the challenges that you are dealing with. I want to say first and foremost that your user name says it all.  \"Godismyhealer\".  What you have to do right now is to really and truly believe that is the truth.  Go grab your bible or whatever holy book based on your individual beliefs and pull out passages that have to do with health and healing.  Place these scriptures on note cards that you take with you whereever you go and read to remind yoursel of God's promises for healing.  You are physically a magnet and your attract to you that which you are radiating from.  You must get yourself out of fear doubt and worry.  The more depressed, scared, and stress you are, the weaker your immune system becomes.  I have actually been contemplating putting together a virtual support group for women battling breast cancer - who want to treat their cancer naturally. If that is something that is of interest to you, please contact me and let me now and i will share with you the details.  Blessings & Love to you! Soteria Let me know if you do the virtual support group that would be wonderful for so many of us.  Keep me informed.",

Hope thru this forum i will be able to have strenght. Thank you.... I was dx's late Jan this year.  Routine mammo and ultrasound found it.  I was told stage one 8mm biopsy showed ER/Pro pos HER2neg most common.  After two lumpectomies my margins showed atypical hyperplasia - so they said full radiation.  Then another test came back oncotype score of 29 on a scale of 1-100 - because I'm in the middle they call it the gray area and to be safe put me into Chemo !  I refused chemo and radiation and did mastectomy - all of this and a troubled daughter single daughter with two small kids, grandson just DX with Autism and I'm in year two of a new marriage.  I wanted to run away ---- to Hospice.  I yelled at multiple doctors and their opinions and finally got some options.  One doctor told me in front of my stressed out 30 year old daughter I had 1-3 years to live if I didn't do chemo.  As an RN I know the damage chemo does now and down the road.  I wasn't doing chemo for stage one - not based on a $3000 test !  Moneymaker  I believe the bioidenticals fed the tumor and years of birth control.  After going for 3rd and 4th opinions and 4 surgeries.  I am just now healing physically and still trying mentally - It is horrible and some friends have exited when I have always been there for them.  Others who I hardly know - jumped right in.  Human nature really amazes me.  My daughter and grandson need me - so I feel for you too.  I am 56 and feel 26 !  Good shape and very active but this has rattled my last nerve some days.  I have basically gone through it alone as not to stress my husband and daughter.  I did find a patient of my husbands who did not want to do the chemo or radiation and followed a Biochemist PHD/MD for alternative care.  Long story short -after blood/urine all tests he has put me on a great program to wellness.  Has treated 300 women over 13 years with no recurrence.  This is not for everyone.. not sure what stage or type you have.  I also refused the Tamoxifen which has crippled my friends beyond belief.  He doesn't believe in it either.   Besides being an RN 10 years and 20 years in Pharmaceutical sales - my 30 yrs experience was to step outside the box or color outside the lines as my doctors now say.  They preach black and white but their is a gray area to some treatments.  I told them I would only do chemo once in my life and it would be for the big one like stage 4 sarcoma or leukemia.  Not stage one breast cancer which can be cut out.  No lymph node involvement by the way.  It was interesting my INS co was willing to do the Oncotype test for $3000 and pay $400,000 for chemo and radiation but not an extra ultrasound a year????  I smell a kickback.  A company in Georgia does the Oncotype test for $50.00 my doctor was unaware of it.  I found a clinical study from London that 75% of all Oncologists would not do chemo - I armed myself with a lot of info and studies and conflicts of interests for certain companies.  Cancer is a BIG money maker and I wasn't going to line the pockets.  Just do your research and throw yourself into it and ask for options.  I want to have quality of life at my age not poor quantity from chemo/radiation and Tamoxifen.  But that is my choice.  I am back to working out and going on a great vacation with my husband next month and again in September.  Good Luck -  Emotions will be up and down for quite some time -very normal for up to two years I was told.  I live in the now and it helps.  My mastectomy was April 16 2013 and had a hematoma 3 weeks later and was back in.  Have your husband handle your bills and Ins and 18 year old help you at home and errands.  You care for yourself then the younger ones.  Ask for help.  We will all get through this together.  Write me anytime - I had a breast buddy that got me through this.  She is two years out with maybe two more surgeries for reconstruction.  My grandson is 4 and so needs help too. I am more scientific than religious so knowledge was my power and finding people who had been through this.  Mos people don't have a clue until they walk in our shoes.  Many hugs.  I'm here !",

Also I read that early detection of other locations of metastasis will  increase survival rate. We live in a small city in Indonesia, and I think cancer treatment in our country is not as advance as other country. So I want to know how does the location of metastasis detected ? Is there any specific tests/machine to scan cancer ? What should I ask my mom's doctor about this ?  Yes ask the doctor an Oncologist.  Here in the U.S. they do CAT and PET scans.  Blood work called tumor markers are also done here but not real accurate.  Good luck and all the best.",

Diana    any development on your daughter? I appreciate your asking.  Keeping in mind that this is the daughter (I have 4) that has never even let us know when something was going on with her, I am extremely worried about her because she is sharing what is going on!  I can tell she is very frightened - and it takes a lot to scare her.  The doctors have finally admitted they don't have a clue.  Everything seems to center on the left side (left breast, left ovary, left pelvic area).  Here are some things going on: 1) A sizeable lump 2\" below her belly button.  They did an ultrasound of the pelvic area but said the area where the lump is located is not considered the pelvic area (what?).  It costs her $700 to be told sorry, \"we couldn't examine the area we should have because it was a inch away from what WE consider the pelvic area.\"  2) She is waking up during the night with her right ear stopped up and left ear hurting.  Once she sits up, it subsides. 3) Her left ovary is twice the size of her right ovary.  4) They did a biopsy and said it was inconclusive for lupus.  They did a second biopsy and said it was also inconslusive.  They will do another biopsy in mid October.  I appreciate my Cancer Compass family's input.  You were always there for me when I was undergoing treatment for tonsil cancer.  I had excellent care at CTCA but from reading so many posts on here from others received inadequate care, I don't want to hear one day that I am going to lose my daughter because of the incompetence of some doctors who didn't have a clue.

I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in Novmeber 2012. I had a lumpectomy in December on the right breast. I am currently in chemo, and am supposed to do radiation after that. I am Triple Negative, and my lymph nodes came back negative (a sentinel node biopsy was done during the lumpetcomy.) I am 43 years old, with no BRCA mutation. I am also rather busty - a size G on the healthy side, and a size DD on the side that had lumpetcomy. :-( Before the lumpetcomy, the breast surgeon told me she thought a double mastectomy would not really decrease my chances of more cancer. I was also under the impression that, once all my treatment was done, I could get surgery on both breast to even them out and make them perkier and such. It is now my understanding that the breast getting radiation cannot have surgery after that. I am toying with the idea of a double mastectomy instead of radiation since: (a) I am quite busty (like I said G on one side, and now a DD on other side), and don't necessarily feel like it's critical to \"save\" my breasts. They are quite large and I kind of wanted a reduction anyway (to maybe a C or D). Plus, they are obviously pretty saggy at that big size and age 43. I figured reconstructed breasts would be more perky... (b) A double mastecomty and reconstruction does not sound fun, but neither does radiation. It sounds like radiation is for someone who is really determined to save the breasts they have. (c) Exposing my body to radiation doesn't sound like it's the safest/smartest option. I am wondering: (1) Can anyone send me links to good article about a double mastectomy vs. radiation? (2) Do many people in my case choose double mastectomy instead of radiation? (ex. it is not genetic, the lumpectomy had clean margins, etc.). It seems like radiation is \"standard.\" (3) Do you know if insurance would cover a double mastectomy and reconstruction, even though I've already had a lumpectomy with clean margins? (4) In trying to reduce the chance of more cancer or cancer returning, would a double mastectomy and reconstruction do that better than radiation? At the end of the day, if radiation is the better bet, I could live with it. I would keep the breast that had cancer (size DD) and have my healthy breast (size G) reduced in size. But my breasts would still be pretty big, and pretty saggy. Sorry if this sounds like I am worrying about things that aren't important. I am happy to be alive and happy the cancer was caught at stage 2 and not stage 4. Thanks!     I am having R-side Mastectomy to avoid radiation- radiation they told me could cause worse cancers than breast - down the road - risk I'd rather not have.  Getting reconstruction during mastectomy and the left side at the same time.  New law in U.S. says Ins has to pay for both sides for reconstruction. The chance they say for me getting it in L breast is less than 4% so I don't want to do double mastectomy.  I am stage 1 no lymph involved and margins do have atypical hyperplasia which is pre pre cancer.  So either radiation reverses it or mastectomy.  Radiation is harm.  I always think \"first do no harm\"  but there is always risk of surgery and infection.  Personal choice for me I'm sure.  Good luck.",

OF course it is the drug - print out the side effects and show your Oncologist who is in denial.  All these class of drugs can cause pain and joint problems.  Call your pharmacist right now - they will read the package insert to you.
