      "Content": "Can anyone tell me if it's routine to do a bone scan after breast cancer diagnosis? I went in for my lumpectomy and axillary Monday. I had a chest x-ray before the surgery. Then my surgeon ordered a bone scan after. Should I be concerned? I know I should have asked at the time, but I was pretty heavily sedated on morphine at the time and wasn't thinking clearly. I was just wondering if anyone else had been through this. Thanks for your input.",

      "Content": "I've just been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma and have to decide on the type of surgical treatment (lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy w/ or w/o reconstruction). My surgeon told me that medically they were all equal. My problem is that I am dreading the idea of daily radiation for six weeks. It would mean travelling two hours to the nearest participating hospital after work every evening. I have a fairly new job that I love, but it requires a lot of planning time outisde the office. I don't know if I can stretch myself that far (not to mention the fatigue associated with radiation). On the other hand, I'm not wild about the idea of getting a mastectomy either. Additionally, I'm a very active person and recovery time is a major factor for me. Can anyone offer me any advice that might help me decide what is best for me?",
