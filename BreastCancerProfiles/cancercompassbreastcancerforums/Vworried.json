    "Content": "I was referred to the breast clinic as I have a dimpling on my left breast. The mammogram and ultrasound came back ok but I was referred for an MRI which I had last Thursday. I got a call today to see the consultant on Monday. My very stupid and I know probably naive question is, do consultants only see you if it is bad news?? I have no experience of hospitals and I have not really talked to anyone about this except my husband who has no idea either. I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.",
