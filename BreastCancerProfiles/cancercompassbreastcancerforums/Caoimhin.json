      "Content": "My aunt has a little T Cup Terrier which I have cared for a lot since she got him. She was not always able to cause of ill health. He comes to me before anyone else. Goran. Had him now - must be near five years. You know how dogs near lick your ears and face off.  The usual stuff.  About six months ago my aunt was here for Sunday dinner and as usual - Goran had to come along too. I love the little pup and he loves me I know.  I was upstairs for a while and Goran follows me everywhere. He was licking me like crazy - everywhere he could access skin and would not stop even when I tried to get him to stop.  Trying to tear at my clothes too to get at the skin. I even went under the duvet to escape him to no avail. He wiggled his way under and licking non stop in a frenzied kind of way. This happened a few times.  I wondered later if he was smelling something. I ended up collapsed in the street last August - could not breathe and had to be put into a medically induced coma and a stay in ICU. Thankfully made a good recovery. It was something else but I wondered if he sensed that too.   I have been having sensations down below for some time now - I'd say two years perhaps. Not all the time but it comes and goes. I was a nurse so you'd think I'd know better. You just think - ah it's nothing, an infection or just getting older. I am 55 years old now.  Then a few months ago because my older brother was having problems with his prostate, I wondered if that might be what it was with me too. My father died from prostate cancer but not till he reached 85 years of age. So I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and had a blood test and physical exam.  He said the prostate was quite enlarged but smooth.  The PSA raised but not significantly.  So going for more tests later this month.  But I hd / have noticed a sickening sweet smell for some months now. And it does seem to come from the pores too. It seems to come from down below more notably at times and I am scrupulous about cleanliness. Can't stand feeling dirty and certainly not smelling of anything.  I can smell it now as I am tying. Sweet - sickening. And most notable in my nares - the nose.  I have sinus trouble and when there is build up there and it might ooze at times - the smell is more notable because of the fluid.  The dog - Goran - never ever in all the time we had him behaved as he had on those occasions. I haven't seen him for a while cause my aunt was away.  I might pay a visit and see how he behaves.  It does make me wonder though.    Hope you are all well.   Thank you for the space to vent.  Greetings from Ireland.  Caoimhin",
