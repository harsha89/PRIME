      "Content": "Hi Patricia, I had breast cancer in 1999 and all the usual tx. Including tamoxifen. In 2001 I found about mets to the bones and liver. Strarted on IV chemo. In june 2oo2 I had mets to the lung. I was on 5-fu for a year and half and then went onto other IV chemo. In Summer of 2003 I was doing poorly, tumor marker going up, ascites in the abdomen, new growth in my liver and lung getting worst. I was started on xeloda and Femera in Aug of that year. Had the ascites drained and it has not returned. The liver tumor shrink. By Dec I had new engery. Started to volunteer at a free health clinic. I had scans done 2 weeks ago and the tumors are still present but no groweth in the last year. And the lung fluid that was present last summer is gone. So I have had good results with the combination of Xeloda and Femera. A few side effect. No drop in counts, occ diahhrea, very dry feet and hands with some peeling. I take Vit b-6 100mg twice a day to prevent the foot and hnad syndrome that comes form the xeloda. Hope this has helped. I will pray for you to make the right decisions for tx. God bless, Marie in NC.",

      "Content": "Dear Alicia Life on Chemo does get tedious. I have been on something continuous for almost 5 years. Day to day is how most of us do it. I just had a month of really being down. So i had the dr. up my antidepressant. When I feel good I do something to have fun and I also find something to do to be useful I don't know if you still work . Work can help but it can be stressful too. So rethink what you want in life. Each time my chemo is changes I have a new set of sytoms. So i learn how to deal with them and then life is better. Prayer and time with God helps. but sometimes He seems far away. but I remember feelings are not all there is to our relationship with Him. He is there wither we feel it are not. Get you rest and know its okay to say I can't do it. Enjoy nature and the life that is all around you. Never stop questioning you doctors. I had a large lump growing in my rt breast and I didn't want to go throuh surgery again. So i asked for radation. Never the radiaologist or the oncologist felt it would work but they okayed it and it worked. You know your body listen to it. Research new options for treatment. My goal is to kept having treatments until new treatments are developed that work better. Take care of want you have. Eat, rest, use your supplements and wake up thankful to see a new day . I have had some real challenges in the pass few months. I had major lung surgery in Nov and have a chest tube that may or may not come out someday. I how have an ulcer in my mouth that will be biospied.So say a little pray for me. I feel over whlemed sometimes. but life goes on and it better to live each day then give in to being overwheled.

The center does have naturopathic physicians whom worked with me to get the right supplements. As far as medical treatments its about the same as other places. they do offer a lot of hope. MD Anderson in texas is probably one of the best reasearch hosptipal in the county. You can live a long time with bone mets. so don't give up. I have been in some type of continous trement for the last five years. Last year I had some complications with a lung and now hve a chest tube in and recently had pneumonia. It is easy to get down. But keep praying trusting and taking up for your self with the doctors, I took Xeloda and Femerma for two years and had great results. So YOu might ask about the xelolda. It is an oral chemo that converts to 5-fu at the cellullar level. Hope that you contine to enjoy life. and espically your kids. I just got to see my two \"kids\", 26 & 29 graduate from college.

      "Content": "Just a word of encouragment to people with mets. I found out I had mets to liver and bones in June 2001. I went to CTCA and they gave me an attitude of hope. Keep looking and trying different treatments. I also developed a lung mets in 2002. I have been on some type of chemo for 4 years. I do believe the help that the naturopathic doctors gave me through supplements has help my body stay stronger to fight this diease. But hope is necessry and I must deal all the times with that negative thought pattern. I have been taking oral Xeloda and Femara since Aug 2003 and I saw my tumor mark drop and liver tumors shrink. In march 2003 I was so sick I came home on oxygen. Now I can volunteer some hours at a free health clinic. So don't give up--just give trying and searching for what is the right treatment for you. I praise CTCA for their approach, that you treat the whole person. Nutrition is important despite what local physicians say. If you can go to CTCA I believe it would be worth you time. I haven't bee back since Jan 2003 but I will always be thankful I went. Life is good so enjoy whatever days that God has granted. Love and laugh. Marie In NC",

      "Content": "Hi Beatrice, I am 56 and understand tired. Learn to do things when you feel better. I will pray for you that this treatment works. CTCA stands for Cancer Treatment Centers of america. They treat all kinds of cancer. In 2001 when I found out I had mets to the liver and bone, I deceided to check them out because they offer the tradiation treatments of chemo and radation but they also offer complementary therapies. These include nutritional therapy, naturopathic medicine, mind-body-medicine and very strong spiritual support, exercise and pain management. Naturopathic medicine uses botanical medicines, vitamins supplements, acupressure and other therapies. I feel that the nutritional support and the naturopathic support keep me stronger through all the chemo treatments. they have so many other programs that help. The one I went to is in Zion, IL there is one in Tulsa, OK. You can check out more by going to www.cancercenter.com. Let me know how this goes, God strengthen you, Marie",

      "Content": "Hi Mary Pat, Cancer can be microspoic and not show on the scans. HOw are the tumor markers? if they are down then thing are probably okay. I had breast cancer diagnosis in 1999, had chemo, radaition and was put on tamifoxen. My biggest regret was that when I was a year out I did'nt ask for a bone scan and CT scans of organs, IN 2001 I had mets to bones and liver. Maybe the scans would have caught it sooner. The armididex you are taking is probably better then the tamifoxen. The studies have shown that it works better to suppress the estrogen positive cancers. I learned to go with what I feel I need and push the doctors to do it. It's your life not theirs. I still take oral chemo and Femara. Life is good enjoy it now that the treatment is over.
