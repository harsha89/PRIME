      "Content": "Congratulations to your daughter on her 10 yr survival!!  That's wonderful.  I'm sorry to read that her father has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  That is a difficult disease to treat and very challenging. While your daughter has had a successful remission following HDC/SCR (high dose chemo/stem cell rescue) this is a very dangerous and intense form of treatment.  There is little, if any, clinical trial evidence to show that this is the most effective treatment for inflammatory breast cancer.  Those who received the treatment and have survived feel it \"saved them\" while the voices of those who did not survive are quiet.  The debate continues.  Fortunately, with the advent of more chemo options and more physicians knowing to treat this disease aggressively, more of us are becoming long-term survivors. I was diagnosed in 1994 when this disease was a death sentence and given a poor prognosis, even at stage IIIB.  I was treated aggressively with relatively high doses of standard chemo and have been one of the fortunate ones to obtain a good outcome in spite of residual disease in the breast and lymph nodes.  I remain NED (no evidence of disease) More research is desperately needed to understand the complexities of this disease and improve diagnosis, treatment, and survival.  I am a part of the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation a non-profit dedicated to this very mission.  For more info visit: www.ibcresearch.org Again, congratulations to your daughter.  As you indicated once we have cancer we are at greater risk for a 2nd cancer....hopefully our first experience makes us more aware of our bodies so changes can be dealt with quickly and effectively.",

      "Content": "I wanted to post in response to the news article \"Rare breast cancer is deadly\", the Dr. Gott column that ran recently in many national newspapers.  As a 15 yr survivor of inflammatory breast cancer I know first hand how aggressive and deadly this cancer can be, but I also know that there are more and more survivors.  Unfortunately mammograms don't typically find inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) so it is important for women (& men) to pay attention to breast changes.  If you have rapid increase in breast size; change in the color, texture or thickness of the breast skin; have pain or itching; what looks like a rash, bug bite or bruise that doesn't go away; or other breast changes that do not resolve in a 2 wk time period....SEE YOUR DOCTOR!  You'll have to be your own advocate when dealing with a cancer that typically doesn't have a lump.  Also, remember that chemo is the first line of treatment for IBC. This is not a new disease.  The first articles written were in the 1800's with the most detailed in 1924 by Drs. Lee & Tannenbaum.  Fortunately more people have become aware in the past few years and that is a good thing.  Research is needed to help determine why this cancer is so aggressive, striking younger women more often as well as more African-American women.  I have been involved with the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation since it's beginning in 1999.  We are involved in many research projects, have an extensive website, 2 email discussion lists and a monthly e-newsletter.  Please visit our website for more information: www.ibcresearch.org.  If you have questions about this disease, feel free to ask!  I'm grateful to be around to answer!!",
