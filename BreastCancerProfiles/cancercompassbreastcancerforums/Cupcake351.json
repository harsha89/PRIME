      "Content": "Hello,  I am a triple positive and have had a brush with BC 3 times.  I just finished chemo for metastasis.  My scan is clean except for a small spot near adrenal gland.  Would like to do the Breuss for 42 days to kill of the remainder.  Anyone have any advise or experience with using this protocal after treatments.  I am still on Herceptin and Projeta.  Feel great and no side effects.  Completely plant based diet.  No diary. ",
