      "Content": "I'm late in responding. 3 years in fact. But maybe it is still useful. I did prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in 2012 (4 surgeries total: Mastectomy, 2 weeks later reconstruction with implants, 8 months later cellulitis of right breast- implant removal and replacement, and then a year later liografting over the implant to increase tissue and blood flow as the area had thinned out). The BC data is very impressive mmimicking and maybe even exceeding that of the BRCA gene and since I work in oncology it spoke volumes to me. I was most worried about if/when BC occurred, we as hodgkin's survivors would have limited to no options for radiation as treatment (unlike brca). If I had BRCA I might would have waited it out and rolled the dice. But these limited treatment options following radiation worried me. Plus, my husband really wanted me to consider it. Score one on the husband points!  I had hodgkins 21 years ago treated solely with mantle radiation. Long term effects I've experienced: asthma, hypothyroidism, fatigue (cause effect unknown as we all have fatigue!). I didn't want to add BC to that list. My journey is chronicled here if that wouldbe one any help to you. I went in to it rather iniformed. Won't make that mistake again. So now I reallyw ant to advocate for women who choose this path. www.tradinginthetatas.blogspot.com Wish you well as you navigate!   Sally",
