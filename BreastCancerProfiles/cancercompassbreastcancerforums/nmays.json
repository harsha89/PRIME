She didnot receive any radiation/chemo at that time. She had a chest wall reoccurence in 2006 and had radiation and CMF chemo in adjuvant mode. She was diagnosed with mets to her pleura in 2008. She had radiation again and carboplatin/taxol chemo in palliative mode.  She had mets in the pleura  in 2010 with bone mets as well and has been on hyperthermia and the coleys fluid. She does not have any pleural effusion to-date. Now, for the last 2 weeks,  the pain in the bone is quite high, She will go on radiation again. She is around 68 years of age, Are there any chemo drugs effective for bone mets besides zoledronic acid. Does Xoleda work for bone mets.  what is survival rates for women with bone mets. My mom has been triple negative with receptors since 2006. Any help would be highly appreciated.. thanks My mother is triple negative stage 4 with pleural effusion, pericardial effusion and yesterday we were told she has mets to the ribs. She has been on every chemo in the book. They took her off Doxil as of yesterday and will start her on something new next week. How is your mother doing? Do you have any suggestions?",
