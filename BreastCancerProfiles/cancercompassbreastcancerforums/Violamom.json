      "Content": "Instead of being reminded daily that \"YOU HAVE CANCER\" as you take that little tamoxifen pill, I wonder if anything is being done to develop a time-release or longer lasting (meaning that you would only take it monthly or ???) --- I wonder if the chemical make-up of tamoxifen is such that it won't work in that manner? I'm trying to get in touch with a drug co rep or tech who will look into it or discuss it with me further. I think it would improve my quality of life to not have to think about it every day in that way...anyone have any thoughts or experience in this area?",

      "Content": "Most days it's not an issue...I'd never even had an IV or a surgery much less a medication to take daily until the last 4 months...then three surgeries, radiation and now tamoxifen until further notice...so it's been quite a shock --- and my files got mixed with another woman...same 1st and middle names and one letter different in our last names...and inverted birthdays (9/3 and 3/9 same year) and same left breast lumpectomy...except that she was found to have lymph node involvement and hers was already on the move and she ended up having chemo and finally a mastectomy...but much of our stuff got mixed and now fixed, but it was not fun in the middle of it all! Most days I am glad to be taking something that will be effective.",
