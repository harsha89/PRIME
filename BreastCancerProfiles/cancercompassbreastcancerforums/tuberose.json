Not too long ago, we started going to a gym together and we did that because she was accepted to a program the gym held called 'Living Well With Cancer'.  Just to let you know, I don't think Linda had ever engaged in any sort of formal exercise her entire life up until that point.  Needless to say, those two days a week absolutely transformed her in so many good ways!  The program has long since been over and the gym is kind of far away so we don't go as much, but I've been trying to get her interested in Pilates since we started this whole exercise thing together and she finally seems to want to do it.  The only thing is, she's worried one of her bones might just snap, and let me tell you why.  Her breast cancer has done quite a bit of site seeing throughout her body.  It now completely encapsulates her lungs, is in both hips and has settled itself in every every section of her spine.  Her bone mets are currently at 80% with no detectable holes in the bone as well as no detectable active bone degeneration, but no one knows for sure whether or not the cancer is presently causing any damage to her bones and will not know unless something happens to indicate that the bones have been attacked.  So!  Now, finally, to my question!!  Given Linda's history with cancer, are there any certified Pilates trainers out there who know specifically, from the following list, which of these Pilates mat exercises are not safe for her to do so she won't have to stress over breaking bones?  Also, she will be doing modified versions of all exercises, to start anyway. ~ The 100 ~ Roll up ~ Roll over ~ Climb the Tree ~ Leg Circles(on your back) ~ Roll Like a Ball ~ The 5's(single leg stretch; double leg stretch; scissors; double straight leg lowers; criss-cross) ~ Open Leg Rocker ~ Corkscrew ~ Saw ~ Swan-Dive ~ Neck Pull ~ Shoulder Bridge ~ Spine Twist ~ Jack Knife ~ Leg Work(side kick front; side kick back; gluteus medius lift; side leg lifts) ~ Teaser ~ Can-Can ~ Swim ~ Beats on the Belly ~ Plank ~ Seal ~ Pilates Pushups Any suggestions for more are certainly welcome as well!!  I look forward to your feedback on this topic.  And thank you for taking time out of your day to read my post. Peace and happiness to you all! Joanna My personal or \"gut\" feeling is do not attemp Pilates. Is there a support group through Linda's Oncology Center that has meditation and perhaps \"Healing Circles\"? A freind who dealt with metastatic BC for over 10 years found a center that did meditation, and drumming. This really helped her.You may have to really search through local certified Yoga instructors. Many are registered nurses, and are very helpful. Also many Massage Therapists specialize in care of cancer patients with specific needs. Linda is lucky to have you. God Bless.",

Dear Ladylacy, I think that our doctors understand our frustration and angery after being diagnoses with cancer of any kind. I did my won research, brought it to my oncologist and we discussed it. I went to credible sources like the Sanantonio Breast Cancer Symposium which is also presented on breastcancer.org . I also found information in Dr. Susan Loves Breast Book. Again my doctor listened. When I decided what treatment I would have through our discussions, he was very supportive. I am coming up on year 7 in remisssion. No doctor will use the word Cure, just remisssion. As the years went by, my oncologist through new research talked again. He said I had made the best decisions for my type of cancer. If an oncologist is condesending toward me, does not listen, I would make a change.  One thing I know is all doctors do not want to lose a patient to a diseased state, without giving that patient the best standard of care. I will add, if a doctor is offended by the research I find from a credible resource, it is his problem. My quality of life is very important to me.",

I know that as cancer patients we look for other \"alternative\" supplements to boost our immune systems or increase our well being. One caution please: Always keep your oncologist informed of any herbal or natural supplements you are taking. Some herbs actually block the pathways that the chemo needs to work. I almost learned the hard way when I finally read the ingredients on a supplement. Milkthistle blocks the enzyme that Tamoxifen needs to work to block estrogen. I would also recommend that you check out Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute's website under herbs. They have done the most extensive research on herbs and the treatment of cancer.",

I have already told her in a Christmas card that I appreciated her services but now have two other drs. I see for follow up so I will not be coming back to her. Her nurse called today to tell me that I really need to stay with her and wanted to make me an appt.  I hate being rude, but what do I do.  I would have never thought that the surgeon would deal with anything other than the surgery process anyways. Anyone else out there go to their surgeon for follow up care?   The more doctors who care for you after cancer the better. You will be getting an exam about every 4 months, so a recurrence or new cancer has a better chance of being found. Be thankful you still see your surgeon. After 3 years out, I now see the surgeon's Nurse practitioner, which is also very good. She really gives a thorough exam. Count your blessings.",
