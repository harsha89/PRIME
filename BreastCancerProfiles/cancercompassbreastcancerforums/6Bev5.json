    "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC (stage IV) with mets to my entire skeleton 3-1/2 yrs. ago.  My tumor marker was normal (27) at that time, and last year went to a high of 61 and then back down to 49).  Because I am hormone positive, I have been on Arimidex for that entire time.  Had a partial mastectomy and radiation to breast, right hip (largest lesion) and right femur (3 lesions; femur was rodded to prevent pathological fracture).  My oncologist at that time started me on Arimidex and planned to switch to other drugs (Femara, Aromasin, etc.) when it stopped working, and then to Faslodex, and finally chemo when all else failed.  He was hoping to \"buy\" me more years than the 5 yr. life span that my surgeon gave me.  His treatment plan was reviewed by an oncologist at a cancer center in the East who said it was the same plan I would have received there.  In 2006 our insurance was changed, and we are now with a large HMO (California).  I have seen two oncologists there (so far) and they have kept me on the Arimidex, saying I have more hormone receptors that \"normal\" and stated that I was in remission last summer, although they refused to do any tests to confirm this, saying it is costly and unnecessary.  In December, I finally got the doctor to do a bone scan, which shows many more lesions, and that my lower spine looks like it is fracturing.  I will press for a full spine MRI, CT scan and PET scan but know it will be difficult to get these. I am seeking any information from someone who has gone through this.  I am scared and do not feel confidence in my oncologist.  Yes, I will get at least one other opinion.  I am afraid to start chemo already, because if that doesn't work, I hear that nothing else will. Thank you for reading this and giving me any encouragement and information.",
