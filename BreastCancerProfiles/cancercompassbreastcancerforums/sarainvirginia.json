    "Content": "Hi, My sister has had breast cancer 3 times now.  the first time she did chemo with a bone marrow transplant, the second time she went alternative with Dr Nicholas Gonzalez in NYC.  She was cancer free for almost 8 years then went off his program and went through a very stressful period. The cancer came back and is now in her lungs, bone and liver.  She is doing his program again, but it has been a long haul. She will recover and she is certain she did the right thing thinking that chemo would killher this time.  I have the book and I LOVE IT!",
