    "Content": "I have been taking Arimidex for a year now.  Fortunately except for some pain in my joints I have not had any of the major side effects described.  I am interested in how you may be tolerating the Arimidex for someone who has taken it for more than a year.  I usually take mine before going to bed at night along with my calcium tablet.  I am a carrier of the BRCA gene and had both breast removed although the cancer was only in one.  I did not have to do chemo or radiation because of the size, but I wonder if that was a mistake. THANKS",
