Please and thanks guys Sorry, but it's not that simple. The chemo drugs are very strong/toxic and designed to destroy bad cells and it just takes it's tool on nice little hair follicles. I have seen hundreds of cases where I volunteer and what I always advise, is not to shave your head but only cut your hair short enough so a wig will fit better. You need to wait to see how you do. Not everyone looses their hair or maybe it will just be thinning out. I would start to investigate wigs that look like your real hair. The wigs now a days are very, very good. The hair is just beautiful and fine. Here are all my personal notes: http://liveforeverwithcancer.com/ Please write, this community will take care of you and give you great love and support.

My mother is 95 she has had different kinds three times. She has had a radical Mastectomy several years ago for reasons very similar to yours. In fact most of my aunts have had radical Mastectomies or problems like yours. I had a cousin in California (65yrs old )that passed away last year from Breast cancer. Her two daughters were in their 30's tested positive for the gene that causes BC and they both had Radical Mastectomies when nothing was wrong just so they would not have to deal with all the problems BC could cause. I support your decision and pray for your speedy recovery. All my personal notes are here: http://liveforeverwithcancer.com/ My LFWC Facebook Link John",

I have had over 35 chemos of Taxol, Carbo/Cisplatin, and Alimta. 2 major lung surgeries, over 40 CT and Pet Scans and over 600 needles and IV's and 28 Radiation treatments to the neck. And right now i am all clear over the 12 years i have been doing this. Naturopathic things have their place and i have used them (maybe 10 to 15% of what i do) but they are not a substitute for Surgery, Chemo and Radiation.
