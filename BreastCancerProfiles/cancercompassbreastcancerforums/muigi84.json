I hope that you have a very good support system with family and friends and an oncologist who will get you through this hurdle. Have you learned what the treatment options will be? Hugs, Lana",

      "Content": "Hi Brittany, My mom also has stage 4 cancer and I'm the main caregiver for her..my father passed away from cancer when I was young, so I understand how devastating it must be for this to happen, knowing that you and your brothers are just at the beginning of new chapters in your lives. I'm glad to hear that she's going to be treated at America's #1 cancer hospital. I have a brother who lives away from home and he calls often which brings a lot of comfort. When he's home, they exercise together and he brings her to the appointments for treatment. My best advice is just to be there for her. Whatever your mom is interested in doing or learning about as far as dealing with treatment- whether its researching novel treatments, doctors, or looking at complementary therapies, offer to help. Memorial Sloan Kettering has a great webpage on herbs with clinical research. Also, check out www.inspire.com /groups/advanced-breast-cancer/ The above link is an online support community for people w/ met breast ca and there are people who are stage 4 and living w/ cancer for a very incredibly long time. Books I highly recommend would be life over cancer and the cancer fighting kitchen. Also check out everythingchangesbook.com If your mom needs a wig, don't hesitate to contact the American Cancer Society. My mom got a free wig from them. I've been dealing with this for more than a year and have learned a lot, so if you have any questions, don't hesitate to message me or post on this board, as it's been very helpful to me. I wish your mom great success as she begins treatment. Please keep us updated. Take care, Lana",
