One was stage 4 sarcoma (very aggressive) and although she is not cured, she's still alive after more than 5 years, which wasn't in her prognosis. The other just went through treatment at Oasis of Hope for MM and it is too soon to know results. Dr. Ralf Kleef in Austria is well regarded at his hyperthermia/immunotherapy clinic. I spent a month there, know several patients who are in remission from stage 4 cancers, but of course, not everyone has great response. I get scans today to see if it worked for me - I wasn't stage 4 yet, and hope I'm not now! But I think there is some validity to some of the treatments in integrative/alternative clinics. Many use natural therapies, hyperthermia (I think important aspect), but also use targeted chemo and radiation if needed plus diet. I think you have to do your research and the hardest part is getting hard data of survival on their patients. Many of these clinics deal mostly with stage 4 patients, so of course, those are much more challenging than early stage cancers. Good luck to you!  Thank you SO much for replying!  We really hope to connect with others using these alternative treatments.  The success stories sounds amazing and 'too good to be true' and, as you pointed out, it is hard to get solid numbers from any of them on successes.  They will tell us they have a 60% or 75% success rate--and when I ask them how they define 'success' they say 'complete remission--the cancer is gone' as if it's so easy!?  I really want to believe in this stuff but have been brainwashed by the conventional medical system here in the good ol US of A.  :-(   I wish you GOOD LUCK on your scan today and hope that others keep the comments coming on their experience(s) with clinics like the ones in Baja, CA/Tijuana, Mexico!   THANK YOU!!!",
