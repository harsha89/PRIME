    "Content": "In 2003 I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a right mastectomy with reconstructiive surgery followed by chemotherapy. After chemotherapy I was placed on Tamoxifen for five years. The bad side effect I had from the Tamoxifen was hot flashes, which I could live with as long as I was taking effexor along with it. In December 2008 my oncologist decided to put me on Arimidex, that only lasted about three weeks, due to severe knee, foot and thigh pain. I was then started on Aromasin and that lasted about a month. I came home from work the other day with severe hand, feet and arm pain. I barely was able to drive home. I cried myself to sleep that night because the pain was so severe. I had tried alternating motrin and tylenol but that did not seem to help.I called the oncologist office the next day and all they suggested was stopping the medication for a week to see if the symptoms would go away and continue using motrin and tylenol for the pain. I had also placed a call to my primary care physician, who called late yesterday afternoon and called in a steroid to help with the inflammation and vicodin for pain if needed. I was real appreciative of his help. My oncologist's office wants me to call back in a week and if symptoms are better would like to start me on femara. I have discussed this with my husband and don't feel that it worth putting myself through these side effects again, Does anyone have any thoughts on this?",
