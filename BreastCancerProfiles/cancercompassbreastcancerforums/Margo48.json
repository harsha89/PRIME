      "Content": "I have had quite a few radiation sessions over the years on different metastasis. Sessions have been from 3weeks to 6 weeks and they are usually daily, except for the weekends. I also have had Cyber Knife treatment, precision radiation. I use from day one a moisterizing cream cream, like Sorbolene, over the area of body that is being radiated to prevent burning of the skin, or at least minimise the burning. I have never had any side effects otherwise. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Linda, your radiology oncologist should be able to tell you what the program is and for how long. I have had quite a few courses of radiation and they lasted from 3 weeks to 6 weeks daily, except on the weekends. The length of the treatment depends on where the tumour is and how big it is. So, 4 days is nothing yet! You really need to ask for the program and. Best of wishes for your father-in-law. Margo",
