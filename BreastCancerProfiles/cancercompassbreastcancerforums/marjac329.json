    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy this spring. I knew that I wouldnt need a mastectomy because my cancer was so small. I think if you dont need a mastectomy, dont get one. Breast cancer can reoccur even after a breast removal, so why get rid of a body part if it wont necessarily help?  One of my doctors said that women are opting for lumpectomies more these days.  Is your doctor advocating one or the other?",
