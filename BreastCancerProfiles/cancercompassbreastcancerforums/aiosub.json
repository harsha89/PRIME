Thank you and all the others for their kind message. I have assumed the risk of stopping Arimidex after taking it for about 3 years. My oncologist gave me a funny reply: I don't know what happens if you stop or if you continue taking Arimidex. I am still cancer free, but I keep everything under control. The rest is God's will.  ",

I welcome your thoughts. I had no withdrawal side effects. On the contrary I felt very well. I think the joint pains are not related to the drug. Have you tried Cortisone pills to stop the pain? What about osteoporosis? It could be that. I take Osseor daily. I wish you health! Adriana",

What do you do for yourself when you are in good moments? Adriana I used to be a singer, so I listen to the music I either used to sing or would love to be able to sing again.  My vocal cords got thrashed over the last 20 years because of a chronic cough that seemed to come on hand-in-hand with the FMS.  I've always been a very social person, and that seems to be a part of my past, too.  Hubby & I moved 50 miles away from my cohorts'n'galpals 2 years ago so I could be closer to my 90 year old mom.  He has to commute daily between here and there, and it takes him hours a day.  So, I'm alone alot.  We did get a darling little dog after I finished up my chemo; but, now I feel like a \"bad mom\" since I feel too low and lethargic to take her out for walks ... poor little dog.  I know I have to take care of my own emotional needs as far as socialization, connecting with my new community, etc., but that's the problem with depression ... doing so takes a type of energy that has been sapped from me. I was doing so unbelievably well, too.  I can't help but wonder if some of this depression is a delayed reaction to all I went through with the move out here, subsequent diagnosis, surgery, treatment, etc.  I really held up well and buckled down and soldiered through it, rarely giving much thought to how I \"felt\" about it; I didn't have time to feel much once I got over the initial fear of the diagnosis; I had to do what needed to be done to \"get well.\"  Well, I have been declared a \"breast cancer survivor\" ... but I'm not sure what that means.  Even when I heard them tell me this, I knew I should have felt some sort of joy in my heart, a spirit lifted.  I just smiled and rather weakly said, \"Yea.\"  I did likewise when I told my family and friends; I think they felt more actual joy in the cancer-free declaration than I did.  Fortunately, part of my cancer team includes a good psychologist who I'll see Sept. 27th.  And a psychiatrist I'll see Oct. 2nd.  Maybe they can give me some pointers on how to weather this particular storm.  I'm also going to talk w/them about an endocrinologist.  I don't know if Kaiser will let me go see one, but perhaps if I threaten to go off the A.I. altogether, they will.  Thanks again Adriana for you support and information!  CYD Never forget that the experience you went through cannot be fully understood by people who only read about cancer and treatments. On the other hand, try to live for yourself, not for the others. I have a dog too. She is a black Chow Chow and she feels my mood better than my husband. You are a great mom for your dog! We are survivors but we have paid a lot! Adriana",
