Switched to Aromasin 3 months ago...from Arimidex that I had started 15 Aug 2009...Had also been on an anti-depressant...Arimidex and my anti-depressant both had weight gain as possible side effects and since I had gained weight I switched to Aromasin which can cause loss of appetite and tapered off anti-depressant with docs permission...Weight gain has stopped for now...thank goodness...Have had extreme hand pain from both Arimidex and Aromasin...Have nerve damage in hands...Have knee pain off and on...I wear patella knee straps and have orthonics in my shoes for arthritic knee pain...I use naproxen on really bad days...My knees would be better w/o weight gain...I think I feel better overall from some form of exercise everyday...",
