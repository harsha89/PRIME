      "Content": "Hi Abigail, so sorry to hear about your mum. I went through that same path in September 2015 with my dad. I was not interested to find out about his life expectancy when diagnosed, but our doctor had hinted the same as yours - few weeks to a year at best. His journey lasted for 3 months from the date of diagnosis, 96 days to be precise. Can share my ordeal in detail should you be interested in order to prepare yourself better. Last point to you guys, I came across cannabis oil (Rick Simpson oil) quite late. Infact he passed away the very next day when the oil got ready. Didnt even get a dose. Why dont you give it a try. I dont know whehter it would cure, but I had heard it helps in building appetite, relieves pain. Let me know if I could be of any help in making this oil. Take care. Stay strong. Cherish these moments together. Be patient. Pray for an easy journey for your loved during this period.",

      "Content": "I am here for my dad. :( .LC was diagnosed last week, although adenocarcinoma was diagnosed 2 yrs back. A strong, healthy and otherwise asymptomatic man is now confined to a bed. After following this entire post, it is clear that there is no treatment as such. Dad is a fighter and he wont go down without a try. I am now in my quest to gather some info regarding alternate treatments/therapies. Shall appreciate all help I can get. And will surely post my findings or the supplements we may start.",
