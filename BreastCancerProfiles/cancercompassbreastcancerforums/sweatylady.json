    "Content": "Hi, i am 49 was diagnosed with breast cancer on Novemer of 2006. I am now cancer free Thankfully. My treatment was 6 months of chemo and then was put on tamoxifen. 10mg of tamoxifen in the morning and 10mg at night. I am expieriencing TERRIBLE hot flashes. So much so that water comes out of my nose at night and wake up drenched. I complained to my doctor and he then put me on Tramadol. I did some research on his drug and it seem to do the opposite of tamoxifen. Anyone else going through this as well ?????    ",
