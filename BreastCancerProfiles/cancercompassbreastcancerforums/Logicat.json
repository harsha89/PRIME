A prognosis is impossible from anyone other than the oncologist and they don't know. There are too many variables. My tumor was 6 cm, all 18 of the 18 nodes they found were positive for cancer. I was \"staged\" at 3C. Advanced breast cancer. My surgeon wasn't very optomistic, but my radiologist and oncologist said that with my attitude I would be a survivor. Just had my 7th three month checkup and I'm doing fine. After the next one, if everything is still fine, I'll graduate to checkups every 6 months. I'm in full remission. I AM A SURVIVOR! (So far, at least. The fear never goes away... ). I know it won't do any good to tell you not to worry. You will learn that worry is part of your life, now. Just do the very best you can to live life to it's fullest and one day, when you pass away in your sleep at the age of 103, your family can say, \"She beat the cancer\".",

They thought it was stage 1 but I had two tumors, one was about 1 cm and the other was 3.5 cm. MUCH larger than expected. ER/PR +, Her2 -, and unfortunately two lymph nodes positive, K67 tests were 3 and 8???. PET scan and MRI negative for lymph and other areas, but I am really depressed. Doctors were telling me that chemo was a big maybe and now I am stage 2B and they are talking chemo, radiation and not so encouraging about my chances for survival. I am freaking out. I don't mind the treatment (had a port put in yesterday) but I want some hope to hang my hat on! Everything keeps changing for the worst and I don't trust anything anymore. Please give me some advice. I am meeting with my oncologist on Tuesday and can't stop crying.  Best wishes to all. Dear lookingforward,  First, take a deep breath, hold it for a count of three, let it out slowly then read on... Biopsies can only tell about the tiny little piece that is removed during the procedure.  What is found in surgery is what to go by.   So, they staged you at 2C and you had 2 lymph nodes positive.  DO NOT panic. In March of 2005 My pathology report came back staging me at 3C.  Some staging charts only go to 3B.  I had all 18 out of 18 nodes positive.  Every single lymph node they found was positive for cancer.  They removed a 6 cm tumor they thought at the biopsy was a 1.7 cm. I'm er+ pr- and HER2-.  Sure I was upset and I think we all panic just knowing we have cancer, no matter what the stage. My surgeon, at one of my post op checkups, made the comment that I shouldn't have to worry about the cancer coming back for one year.  Of course that was discouraging especially when I had to work, had to recover from surgery, go through chemo treatments, go through radiation treatments and finished almost exactly one year from the day I found the tumor.  Here I am, almost 2 years from finishing treatments and still going strong.  I'm officially in remission,  I'm almost as good as ever except for the missing breast and some neuropathy from the chemo and I still worry about every little ache and pain but it's part of my life and I'm still here to complain about it!  Yes, there are hard days, but they're getting fewer and further between.  Yes, you can still have a life and even enjoy it.  Yes, there are many of us in that boat with you, just lean on us when the going gets rough.  It really helped me to know there were people out there that had gone through this before me and were still doing well many years after the fact.  More and more of us every year and some were in worse shape, staging wise, than me. Do what your doctors tell you.  That is probably the best advise I can give you.  If you don't understand something, and there will be lots you don't understand, ASK!  Then get online and look and ask more questions and learn. Get a copy of your pathology report and a printed copy of every test you can.  You will refer to them often.  Before starting chemo and radiation, ask for suggestions.  One survivor told me about Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash.  I've thanked him every morning since.  Yes, a male breast cancer survivor!  Another told me about chewing ice during chemo to ward off mouth sores.  The nurses pooh-poohed the idea but the first time I didn't, I got mouth sores. I looked at the treatments as an adventure.  It's shrouded in mystery to the average person, especially things like the \"chemo room\" and port.  Learn, ask, talk and above all, BREATHE! Please feel free to contact me if I can help you get through this.         ",

I gave up Silk soy milk, Garden burgers, Hot & Sour Soup, bacon bits, hot dogs, and a host of other items including Sun Chips, Cheese Puffs and even KFC chicken because when the trans fat scares started getting ugly, restaurants all changed to soy oil to fry their foods in! I know, I know, fried foods are not good for anyone, but I did not know just how bad they could get until soy avoidance became an issue. The only things that are truly safe to eat and avoid soy are fruits and vegetables with nothing else added, fish, chicken, a small amount of beef, with no breadings or coatings of any type, and a few types of pastas, but read the labels first.  Lots of pastas have soy flour and breads may contain more soy than you'd care to deal with. Actually, to avoid soy now days, you'd be eating pretty darn healthy!  Bon appetite!    ",

I have been taking Arimidex since my cancers were ER+. I have absolutely NO libido whatsoever. Has anyone else experienced this and is there any treatment? I only had a left mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation and have been on Arimidex for two years.  It took almost a year and a half before I decided that I was not only still a woman, (Oh, I forgot to mention, a hysterectomy in 1990 for cervical cancer), but that I was still capable of being attractive and sexual. Once I got feeling well enough and got my head back together, I made the conscious decision to look better, which in turn made me feel better!  I colored my hair, started using makeup again, dug out some clothes that I liked, being careful to make sure they would not show my prosthesis.  I still have problems wearing high heels because of the neuropathy from chemo treatments, but I'm doing better with lower heels.  Once I felt that I looked better and more attractive, it was easier to allow myself to relax and enjoy sex with my husband.  No, the libido is not the same as it was but it's a vast improvement over what it was two years ago. Yes, we do need Astroglide but that's a wonderful product and there are many others, easily available, that do not contain estrogen.  I don't know how much help this gives you but I don't think it's the Arimidex alone that causes so much problem with sexuality.  It's not a pleasant thing to be on but I look at the increased chance of survival and consider it worth the side effects.  ",

What would he know, anyway.  They go by what the pharmeceutical companies tell them, make no mistake. Estrogen suppression therapy is only appropriate for men with prostate disease.  Good luck to ladies who can't say, wait a minute, I want to get some  more information, I want a week or two to do research, I want two more opinions,  I only wish I knew in 1996 what I know  now. .  .  Kbcns, Anything that's used outside the parameters of what it was designed for can be dangerous.  That especially applies to things like Arimidex.  The illegal steroid market is a master at this.  BUT, just because it's used by some people in that capacity does not mean that it was designed for use as you described.  For that matter, all of the steroids used incorrectly, illegally and without PROPER medical oversight, fall into the same category.  Ordinary table salt is a good example of a product that's not only considered safe and required for health, can be deadly!  You will NOT become a man using Arimidex!  No one is agreeing to have their \"femaleness destroyed\"!  I DID get more research and information and that's how I found out what you're talking about.  The illegal steroid market is out to make money.  They don't care what they convince someone of and don't care what the effects of their actions are except when they kill their buyers, they must find new ones or drugs that don't kill them as quickly. Arimidex, on the illegal steroid market, is marketed for use by males to stop the normal amounts of estrogen from interfering with solid looking muscles or the buildup of breast tissue that often results from some of the other illegal drugs they take. Just because you are frightened of it because you heard or read such things, or decided that the side effects weren't to your liking, please don't cause others to panic when they're using Arimidex just as their oncologist directs.  There is a world of difference and someone else that could have a long survival on the drug and goes off it out of fear may not be as fortunate as you.  ",

I don't earn much but am able to pay my normal bills and Medicaid takes care of my medical costs. I have wonderful clients and customers. Being self employed, I could set my own hours and work when I was able. It's pretty common around here to acknowledge that most cancer patients are living for something in particular and that is what keeps most of us going when the going gets tough. When people would ask me what I'm living for I would tell them, my cats. We had 7 at that time and my husband told me that I had to outlive them because he wouldn't be able to take care of them. We have 9 now but not because we asked for them! The two new ones are just outside cats, one is in/out and the other six are just indoor. Won't go outside no matter how long the door is open. People that know me know that they're the dearest thing to my heart so it's only natural that I would pick them to be my lifeline to survival. They're mostly special needs cats so they take more than the usual care. As to how I've changed since cancer, that's a little tougher. I still work, I don't venture too far from home except to work so traveling is not on my agenda like some people. I have some difficulty being on my feet for long so I have to plan ahead even when going to the store. A left-over from chemo treatments. The up side to that is the handicapped tag on my car that gets me good parking spots. I learned to play Texas Hold-em poker online and really have a lot of fun with the new people I've met. Also, I'm involved with political issues, church/state separation issues and anything related to the various jobs I do. The Internet has become a fixture for me. I took a position with a national organization I've been a member of for many years, and am now the state president. It's given me a lot to do, so my main thing is keeping busy. The fear of cancer returning will always be with me. Every little ache or pain or sleepless night is filled with anxiety for a little while, at least. That's something we survivors live with. I've talked to 20 year survivors that still struggle with the fear so I've accepted it as best I can. It's the untamed animal that will walk beside me the rest of my life. Occasionally it gets out of sight but always comes rushing back. The hair has grown back, the arm will always be a little \"tight\", the scar has lost the horrid ugly redness and I still have my chemo port, but I'm alive! That's the most important thing, I'm ALIVE!!! I don't know how much my contribution has helped you but if there's anything more, just ask. We're a prety friendly group.",

If you have the time, and it's a while before you see your doctor again, put \"oral cancer treatments\" into Google or whatever search engine you like and do some reading.  It takes a while to find out specific information on cancer treatments, sometimes, but can be very worthwhile.  Perhaps you can find something useful and if you do, print it and take to your doctor. From the little bit of reading I did after reading your post, it sounds like the oral chemo is mostly for people with \"mets\".  That's where the cancer has already spread to other organs and parts of the body.  There is research going on, all the time, and that's one of the many reasons to keep in close touch with your medical team.   .",

And if she chooses to completely ignore it (which she may well do), am I to respect that as her choice? Or does my duty lay in encouraging her to fight? When my mother's cervical cancer returned, 40 years later, and had metastacized, she wasn't going to fight.  I found out later that the REAL reason was pure vanity,  she didn't want to lose her hair.  She thought that if she was going to die it would be better that she die with hair.  But I had gone through chemo just the year before for breast cancer, reminded her that I'm still here and doing well AND that my hair came back.  She's been in chemotherapy for about 6 months now and hasn't even lost her hair.  She's only had about 4 or 5 days of nausea and the only thing she complains about is  some loss of energy.  She's 76 years old but you'd never guess she's older than 60, my age!  The chemo has stopped the cancer in it's tracks.  It's not gone but it's not the threat that it was.  Before you take up any staunch discussion with your mother, find out what's behind her reasoning.  It could be something as simple as what was bothering my mother; it could be fear of the unknown; it could be something you'd never dream could be bothering her.  She may have known someone years before that went through treatments and suffered greatly.  Remind her that treatments have come a long way since then.  Find out how her mental attitude affects her decision and help her understand what a cancer battle or not fighting may mean.  This is the time for honesty, truth, understanding and loving concern. Should she choose not to fight, after a few good discussions, I would recommend that you do your best to accept it and be as loving and helpful as possible.  Until then, be armed with facts.  There are many sites online that can teach you what it's all about; the options, their ramifications, their side-effects, their possible outcomes.  Read and learn and talk.  Remind her that there are people who can go through treatments and survive and be fully functional people for many years.  Being Stage 4 means it will have to be teated as a chronic disease.  There probably won't be a solid remission but anything is possible.  There are many cases of people that beat their prognosis!  My best to you and your mother, also.  Please let me know what she decides.  I care.    ",

She had just undergone a mastectomy and was going to need very extensive chemo and radiation.   My neighhour was told to keep it a secret, but told me because she was having a hard time dealing with it and she trusts me not to spread it around.  I was outside talking to both of them not long ago and if you hadn't told me, i wouldn't have noticed the mastectomy.  I guess you just don't look in that area when you are talking with someone.  I didn't want to make it obvious.  At that time her chemo hadn't started so she still looked pretty much the same.  Since then i was told that she had several chemo treatments.  You can tell because my neighbour has started to wear head scarfs and looks weaker.  I haven't had the chance to talk with her, as she hasn't been outside alot.  I so desperately want to offer my assistance and support but just don't know how to approach this without 'outing' the neighbour who told me about it all.  I kinda wish she hadn't told me because if and when my neighbour decides to share this with me I don't know how to react.  I understand how horrible cancer is on the family as i just recently lost my father to pancreatic cancer and my mother was diagnosed shortly after with leukemia.  I just want to be there for  her.  I find myself peeking out the window when she is outside to see how she is doing.  I worry terribly about her and only have good intentions.  How do you think i should deal with this?   She has small children and it breaks my heart that such a lovely person is battling cancer.  But i also know that if there is anything i can do to lessen her burden i would do it in a heartbeat.  Please help.       Having afamily members with chemo, just \"accidentally\" walk outside and across the street when you see your neighbor and ask, that due to your experience, you couldn't help but wonder if she is undergoing chemotherapy treatments.  If she says yes and she's open to conversation at all, start talking and listening.  If she prefers not to talk about it, you'll know.  If she doesn't, offer her any help, tell her you're there for her and make your exit.  If she is open to talking, by all means, talk.  Or rather, let her talk.  When I was going through chemo, I was so very lonley.  Few people actually came up to me and said anything.  The only place I felt comfortable was at the hospital.  Friends didn't want to \"bother\" me, aquaintences didn't know what to say so they stayed away for the most part.  There isn't much family to lean on so I was lonley.  The lonliness hurt almost more than anything else. I had friends online, but there's nothing that replaces human contact.  A neighbor to share a cup of coffee, someone to chat with, someone close to home, these things are so important.  Worlds close in on a cancer patient or anyone with a dilitating disease especially when one's appearance is changed so drastically, like when chemo treatments alter the appearance so dramatically.  Extend a hand.  If she is so uncomfotable that she can't open up, give her time.  But if I were you, and your heart seems to be in the right place, do it.  She just might be sorely needing a friend.

One toe, also on the left side, is behaving as though it's \"trigger toe\". I started out with a rheumatologist who did all the tests and there's no arthritis.  From there it was physical therapy to try and keep the problem from getting to a surgery situation.  A gal on breastcancer.org told me to call the Astra Zeneca company and talk to them, which I did, and they said this appears to be a side effect of the Arimidex.  They are taking names and information to forward to the NIH.  Hopefully there will be some research done on how to combat this.  If you have these symptoms, please call the company and get on the list. This side effect was not noted in the clinical trials but maybe those that were affected had no way of knowing there was a connection at that time.  I am not in the category of being at risk for CT as in repetitive motions, so that one can be ruled out as simply getting worse.  This was brand new.  I do have neuropathy in my feet from the chemotherapy treatments and perhaps that is a connection?  My physical therpist, for my d' Quervanes is recommending the \"shots\" into the lump on my wrist and I go for an evaluation this afternoon.  If that doesn't work it's surgery next.  I will stay on the Arimidex, as long as this doesn't get much worse, as I was diagnosed as stage 3C, 6 cm tumor, 18 of 18 nodes positive, er+ pr- and HER2-.  I had surgery, left mastctomy and node dissection, A/C and Taxol chemotherapy, 30 radiation treatments ending in January of 2006 and so far, so good.  ",

I lost the 8 small toenails but the one big toe, on my right foot, that had been painfully ingrown, strightened out! LOL. Took the longest time for my thumnails and index fingers to outgrow the discoloration from the chemo but they're fine now. Well, my left thumbnail is still a little too curved but unless you knew what it looked like before, you'd never know the difference. My hair came back in just as stright as it had been before and the color went from salt and pepper to brown and gold. I'm so fascinated with it that I haven't resorted to coloring it yet, but the day is coming swiftly. It had been so many years since I'd seen my natural color that it quite shocked me before it was all gone. Oh the adventures we take through chemo... Quite interesting, actually. That's one of the ways I'd talk to myself while getting through this process. That and helping others that were just starting the treck. Are you comfortable with stopping the AI's? I think I would be too afraid. There's also talk in the medical community of going to 10 years of \"pills\". But I'm one of the lucky ones that have been able to tolerate the side effects pretty well. Besides, having that little handicapped tag gets me some pretty good parking places when I just don't get along very well... I whine occasionally but the reason is because I can. LOL! Please keep me posted and let me know what your doctor says. Also if the pain and fatigue start letting up. Okay? Laura",

I went in for my follow-up with the rheumatologist, yesterday.  He told me  that since the pain in my wrist is almost gone and the \"trigger fingers\" have started behaving more normally, I don't need to go back for 6 months.  The lump on my wrist is still there but unless I'm a really vain person that I shouldn't have to worry about surgery unless it gets bad again.  Yeah!!! It appears that the AI's all cause hand and foot pain and stiffness, to some degree.  I suffered, with everything getting worse for over a year, then it started to lessen.  It's not all gone but it's very manageable at this point.  The one thing that doesn't seem to be getting any better is the incredible foot and leg cramps.  More than likely this is from the Taxol which I just found out, I probably wouldn't have had to have if the research had been released just two years earlier.  If you're HER2 negative, the newest news is that it seems to be of no value.  Positves and Herceptin users gained the most benefit.  No benefits to the rest of us.   With all of the bashing we do about the drugs that are saving our lives, I would like to mention one benefit, aside from life, which is THE most important thing, the chemotherapy side effects cured my ingrown toenail!  LOL!!!!!  ",

I have about two dozen hairs total, on both legs that grew back and about half a dozen under both arms.  A razor almost seems pointless.  The hair on my head was never very full so I'm not sure if it's as thin as it always was but it sure isn't any thicker.  It did come back a little browner than the salt and pepper that I had before.  The outside halves of my eyebrows didn't come back and my eyelashes are thinner but at my age it was probably bound to happen anyway.  I'm now 60, was 57 when diagnosed but could pass for 40.  I sure can't pass for much younger now.  But what the heck.  As the old saying goes, \"the older I get, the better I was\"!  LOL!!!  ",

I can't imagine that you would not have chemo or at least radiation if there was a 6 cm tumor!  My breast tumor was 6 cm and at that time I was told anything over 1 cm practically meant automatic chemo and radiation treatments.  Your tumor type must have been an odd one.  They took no lymph nodes to test?  Maybe your lymph nodes were clear and that's why they didn't recommend further treatment?  If so, I'm envious!!!  LOL!  Hang in there and congratulations on the reconstruction.   ",

The doctor said they got it all and I went thru a series of radiation. Now after a PET scan they said it is back. I had three vertebrae that was affected. My doctor set up a back surgery to repair my vertebrae and did a biopsy at the time. It was confirmed that is was breast cancer. So my cancer doctor put me on aromasin but that didn't work. After another PET scan they found the cancer is now in my left leg, in each of my hips and in my right side in my back. So he changed the medicine now I am taking Megestrol. I was taking 40 mg of aromasin. Now I am taking 160mg of Megestrol. My cholestrol went over 400 and my tricly. was over 380 so I went on a diet eating only fruits and vegetables, whole grain cereal and pasta, fish and chicken. All lean and without fat. Last time my cholestrol was down the 287. I have lost 15 lbs. Which is all good. In a week I have to have another blood test to see it the Megestrol is working. I am 61 years old and I have grandchildren I dearly love. I want to be around to see them graduate. Has anyone else been thru this same thing? What treatments have you had?   Thanks so much. NEENEE Neenee, I've read the other responses and the very first thing I would tell you is NOT to start on adding \"Natural\" medicinal herbs and such without asking your oncologist FIRST!  It's chemical fact that quite a few of these old \"remedies\" are quite harmful when you are in treatment for cancer.   They might make the chemicals inactive or combine with the drugs to make them actually harmful!!!  Just ask you doctor, FIRST!  Please. My breast cancer has metastasized to my spine, I was diagnosed with it just this February after the initial diagnosis and treatment in 2005.  I'm presently in chemotherapy treatments and I'm on Taxol, Zometa and Avastin. Originally, I was treated with a left mastectomy, 18 nodes removed with all 18 positive for cancer, chemotherapy with A/C and Taxol, then 30 radiation treatments.  I went three years on Arimidex before the cancer returned. I've had two aunts, one blood, one by marriage, that lost their lives to cancer.  One had medical treatments, went into remission for about 12 years, then when the cancer returned, refused medical attention and turned to \"natural\" healing.  The other went only with the natural healing.  Both lost their lives quite quickly.  The one that had originally been treated by regular medicine, changed her mind and went back to her doctor, but she'd waited too long and there was nothing that could be done for her except manage the pain.  The other started with the asparagus diet, went through a few others and finally spent most of the family's savings on trips to Mexico for their \"miracle cure\". Always ask your doctors, first, and do your own research.  Most of these people are only out to make money, sell you a book, sell you a product or ask you to do a testimonial for their company to get some other schmuck to buy into the same thing.  If I hurt some feelings with this statement, that's too bad.  I'd rather hurt your feelings than harm someone else by not giving them at least a head's up.  ",

I wore hats.  There are hats specifically made for we bald women that are really cute.  Some women prefer scarves and bandanas while some go with wigs.  It's all a matter of what she wants to do and you won't have much say in the matter.  It's about helping her deal with the whole fight she's going through and being loving and supportive no matter what she's doing that may drive you up the wall. If sex becomes a problem, talk to her doctor.  The tissues are very dry for most chemo patients and can even be painful.  You may have to try a few different hings before you find something that will work for the two of you.  Make sure she drinks *lots* of water.  I got a pint bottle, and made sure I drank at least four of them through the day in addition to the usual tea, coffee, juice, etc.  Especially the first few days after a chemo treatment.  It helps the body get rid of the chemo after it has done it's work. Believe me, the advise I'm giving you is from both mine and my husband's point of view and hopefully she will be one of the lucky ones that have none of the above side effects. My best to both you and your wife and please keep in touch.  As a husband going through his wife's chemo, you can be a valuable resource for other husbands with the same situation.  There is very little out there in the way of help and advise for husbands or maybe you already know that by now...  Any questions?  Just ask.

It bothered me a little but I passed it off and told myslef I'd mention it to my doctor on the next annual appointment. A few months after that, I woke one morning and the left breast has hot, had a hard spot and HURT! After doctor, mammogram, untra sound and biopsy, I found out the left breast was nicely filled out by a 6 cm malignant tumor!!! Was I surprised! Now I'm 60, only the right breast is left, but I'm alive and can tell others to be very aware of any changes. They may be nothing, they may be normal aging, they may be dealing with a cyst or simple infection but GET IT CHECKED!!! Laura",

      "Content": "tigger, Having not had reconstruction I can't address your letter from that perspective but I have had a mastectomy and what you are feeling is not that uncommon.  As you mentioned the teary days are getting fewer and farther apart and will get even better in the future.  It takes time.  You are probably tired of hearing that but it is true. Reconstruction, once the healing is complete, should help you to feel better about your body image and your spirits should lift.  If you let them.  Concentrating on what you've lost will not help and finding a new normal should be where your attention is now. We can't go back to what was.  We're on this side of the bridge now and it beats the heck out of falling off the bridge before we get here.  Congratulations for finding your way across.  You've joined a distinguished group of survivors, here.  There are people, both men and women, that have fought this battle and are now holding their own against the dreaded monster, cancer. Search for anything good that has come from this.  After all, you've made it this far and that is an accomplishment all it's own.  Sometimes the smaller the battle, the greater the sometimes silly feeling of winning can be.  My own piece of the puzzle is from chemotherapy.  There was a good side.  I had been suffering from a painful ingrown toenail.  I lost all the small toenails from both feet and the big toes did some strange things.  The straight nail curled slightly on the sides and the curled nail, that had been causing the ingrown problem, straightened out.  I no longer suffer and worry about having that nail removed as it is no longer a problem!  The small nails grew back and for the first time ever, they're actually pretty!  Most of us are much stronger and braver than we thought we could be.  We are the shining light that others just going into this battle will search out for answers to questions, support, a person that understands to vent to and to lend a hand when we feel we can't go on. Still not feeling like a warrior?  Still just feeling like a victim?  Consider that you and your medical team are fighting a very real battle and although you won't look or feel like George Washington or even Ghengis Kahn, it's still a battle.  The feelings of victory are no less important in your life.  There are feelings, both emotional and physical, that are foreign to those that have not been where we are.  Symapthy, empathy but not really an understanding is the best we can hope for.  There are also the rude, the frightened and the curious.  Treat them kindly as no one of us knows when it might be their turn.  I've found that when I'm feeling down or wonder what's coming next, the best thing to do is get on \"the boards\" and chat with others that have been here.  They do understand.  You may find someone or a few of them, that become close personal friends.  I have and you will to.  Just hang in there and keep the forward motion going towards the future and being able to have fun again.  Sorry this is so long.  I tend to get wound up on this subject.  ;-)",

      "Content": "tigger,  It's a pleasure to meet you, well online at least.  I'm 61 (sheesh that sounds old!).  I've gone through two bouts with cancer.  The first was cervical cancer in 1990.  Caught way early and only had surgery.  The second was 2005 with breast cancer.  Along with my left breast and 18 nodes that all tested positive for cancer, went a 6 cm tumor.  I then had chemotherapy and radiation and I'm now on Arimidex. I could also pass for much younger but doubt that still applies.  Matter of fact, my husband is 15 years younger and most people think he's older than me.  (Aack!!!).  He's now 46 and we've been married 18 years.  He's been with me through both cancers.  I'm aging more quickly now, with no estrogen, but I'm alive! What was your diagnosis, if I might ask?  Were any nodes positive?  Did you have one breast removed or both?  Has the reconstruction been uneventful as in no infections or problems?  Where are you in your cancer treatments?  Are you er + or - and what is your HER2?  These answers will help me to know what advise would be the best to help you with.  No point in stressing all the things to avoid with er+ if you're a triple negative, for instance. Feeling alone is such a big part of the recovery process.  I don't know what I would have done without the friendships I've discovered in these survivor rooms.  There are many on the web that I've depended on.  breastcancer.org has a live chat area that was my life saver even when I just suspected that I was dealing with BC.  The people on that site kept tabs on me and virtually held my hand through every step.  With posting, maybe you feel like saying something and maybe not but in a live chat room, the others will draw you into the discussion and help you unload whether you thought you could or not. Okay, I've thrown a bunch of questions to you.  Throw back a few answers and you can even ask whatever you would like.  (Just so it's not a bucket of ice)!  LOL! Laura aka LaGata     ",

Thanks again lyn   lyn, Stay curious, stay positive but stay away from Laetrille.  There are so many so called \"cures\" that waste valuable time and resources that could be used to follow proper, proven, medical treatments and probably give you many, many relatively healthy years. Laetrille is an old one.  Steve McQueen, the actor, was doing the Laetrille treatments when he died 30 or 40 years ago.  That's when I first heard about this \"cure\".  I also had an aunt that went that route, about the same time and died, but this was also many years before the new treatments we have now.  Trust your medical team.  If you can't, then find another doctor but make sure they're AMA approved.  Thousands and thousands of clinical trials have been properly done to insure the very best is being done to help us.  Don't get \"sold down the river\" with something that has been \"tested\" (questionably) on 85 people like the last one I was asked to check out.  This is your life you're dealing with.  Don't take unnecessary risks and waste valuable time that could be used to beat this.  There are more and more survivors that have gone the \"regular\" medical route who can attest to the effectiveness of the treatments we now have and more research is being done all the time. My best to you and keep us informed.",

I'm not familiar with that tumor marker test but most of them have a number that your number is gauged against. My onc takes the CA29-27 and as long as I stay under 40, I'm considered fine. There are other things that can raise the number over that but it's usually higher just after chemo treatments. The tumor marker test, in itself, is usually simply used as a guide to determine if other tests should be done. My last two tests came in at 29 after one at 30 but when I still had my tumor, before anything else was done, my markers came in at only 38! After chemo they were 60!!! In other words, talk to your oncologist. Either they will have you do more tests or tell you that's it's something to not worry about. My best to you and please let me know what you find out. I care.

I am 73 years young, living with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) and on oxygen 24/7.   Seven years ago I had a double mastectomy.  The cancer was only in the right breast but it opted to have both removed.  All the lymph nodes under the right arm were removed and all free of cancer.   Fortunately I did not suffer with lymphedema of that arm but do have a problem under the arm in the area of the surgery.   It is tender all the time to the extent that seams in clothing irritate me.   Also when I try to exervise that arm it feels as if something is pulling when I extend the arm up.    I have checked and despite the fact that it feels \"raw\", there is not a mark to be seen.     I also have arthritis in both shoulders and between the arthritis and this \"whatever\" under the right arm, I am not able to do much.     I am interested in finding out if anyone else has had this problem. I  appreciate any help that might be offered.   Thank you so much and everyone have a blessed day :-). Joan Joan, I had a left mastectomy in March of 2005 and 18 nodes were removed.  (All were positive for cancer!)  I have a knot about the size of a large ping-pong ball under my arm which was so very sensitive to anything touching it for the longest time.  I'm told the knot is scar tissue and the burning, tight, uncomfortable feeling is from the nerves that were cut during the surgery.  It has gotten a little better over time but I too have a small problem with arm range. About the first year and a half after surgery, I could not wear a bra for more than about an hour without feeling as though the same arm was in a vice.  I suffered and asked questions, getting no answers, until I went to a professional bra 'fitter' that deals with prosthesis's for mastectomies that told me the answer was simple.  She said the prosthesis I was wearing was too small and it allowed my bra to cut into the sensitive area where the nodes were removed.  She suggested a larger prosthesis and it solved the problem by pulling my bra out from under my arm.  It hasn't made the knot go away, of course, but it made dealing with the nerve damage much easier. Where you had a bilateral mast, this is probably not your problem but it illustrates the situation with nerve damage from surgery.  My only suggestion would be to watch carefully if there's anything in particular that seems to trigger the problem more than usual.  Seven years is too long a time for it to still be 'healing nerve endings', so the best you could probably do is avoid anything that seems to make matters worse.  It may be something rather simple and the rest you'll have to deal with. The suggestion for physical therapy is excellent and I agree.  Maybe it will help.  Otherwise, just good luck and keep going, sounds like you're doing well, overall.   Laura",

Until I read the transcripts of the conference, I did not know that lymphadema of the excision site was even possible.  We can learn so much on the computer. To find information on just about anything, go to your search engine, I usually use Google.com, and put lymphadema or lymphadema treatments, then just go down the list and start reading.  You can do the same with types of cancer, different drugs, clinical trials, or anything you could possibly want information on. It won't take long before you find anything on any subject that you could imagine and some you wouldn't even have imagined.  And then ask your oncologist for a referral to a lymphadema specialist. I credit the information and the friendships I've found on the computer with helping me to be a survivor.  It's only been 3 years since diagnosis but my BC was stage 3C with all 18 of 18 nodes positive.     ",
