    "Content": "Hello.  I just came back from my grandmothers last radiation appt and I am just overwhelmed by questions which I felt were not answered by the doctor.   Granny has stage IV breast cancer.  By the time they found the breast cancer, it had already mets to her bones.  It has been a year and the cancer has mets to her brain (we have known this for about one month).  The gave her decadron to reduce the swelling since the tumor is surrounding her brain (both sides) and they done one round of radiation.  At her appt today they talked like we should expect the worst, but if she improved they might consider more radiation or more chemo.  So far no chemo has helped.  My question is what do we expect.  I know that she does not have a lot of time left, but what happens next.  Is it now time to just keep her comfortable?  We also called in Hospice today which makes everything seem so so final.  Somebody please just tell me straight up what stage we are at!  ",
