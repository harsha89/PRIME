Now I am battling serious fatigue and depression and deciding the arimidex may be the culprit.  I took it upon myself to stop the medication for a trial period to see if things improve.  Today is just day 2 of not taking this medication so I've not seen any improvements yet.  But it is encouraging to know that I'm not imagining my symptoms.  I am a very active 57 year old and this fatigue is so out of charactor for me.  I can barely function at this point but have to muscle through.Please hang in there! Two days is not enough time to undue the side effects; give yourself at least 6 MONTHS!! If you aren't improving, go to an alternative health practitioner to help with the pain & fatigue. (Acupuncturist, Chinese medicine, etc.). I have had fibromyalgia for years (unrelated to my breast cancer), so I know how debilitating chronic pain can be! Western medicine has very little to offer for chronic pain but more of these damn drugs! Our doctors have, sadly, become \"pushers\" for the pharmaceutical companies. Yes, there has been some \"success\" with these drugs, but we have to have quality of life, not be fighting the side effects all the time! Some side effects of some drugs outweigh the benefits, IMO. I had double-breast cancer (right breast Stage 1; Left Stage 2; Grade 2). I had a double mastectomy, chemo, & didn't have to have radiation. The radiologist I saw (loved her!) said it's all pretty much a crap shoot anyway; she has patients who do the absolute least that recommended...i.e., lumpectomy only, no treatment(s), and their cancer never returns. Others do exactly everything to a \"T\" and die anyway. We're all going to die someday from something, so quality of life is imperative! I tried all 3 Aromatase Inhibitors and, lastly, Tamoxifen, all with side effects I couldn't manage, and all exacerbating, one way or another, my fibromyalgia symptoms and/or giving me new unpleasant symptoms. I'd say that, on and off, I was probably on one or the other of these drugs a total of under 2 years. I'd go off, wait a while, feel better, go on another one, etc., etc. finally I got a new, young, female doctor who basically said nothing was going to change so for me to just consider that portion of my treatment finished. I was very happy! My hubby & I said from the outset that we would make our decision(s) as the need arose based on what we knew at that time, move forward, and never look back in regret. If cancer comes back, that's what I'll do at that time. Though my health is far from perfect because of the fibromyalgia, I definitely felt better being off those other oral cancer meds. You are not alone! Give yourself some time to heal! Best of luck to you! Hi DixieEQ & Cydsong, DixieEQ I just sent you a private reply, but I now I see Cydsong's post too.  I believe, as she does, you make decisions with the info you have at hand at the time.  When the info is updated, if it has changed, then you have to re-evaluate, at that point.  Quality of life is most important to me & along with the info about my risk of recurrence & that I was a stage I, is what I based my decision on.  My family doctor had also said it would take about 6 months for the side effects to wear off.  In that area, I was not so lucky.  I deal with the bone pain everyday, confined to my butt, hands & feet---since Dec 2011.  I take an opioid twice a day & between that & my exercise, life is good. Some days are better than others.  Today is a really good one! As all the oral chemo for breast cancer are in the same family of drugs (similar chemical structure) , they all tend to have the same side effects, some, however, worse than others.  Tamoxifen is known to cause uterine cancer in some individuals.  Just what we need!! In general, this family of drugs causes bone pain & osteoporosis, which makes us more likely to fracture.   We're here for you! I have been on frames for 2 years and considering changing over to Arimidex. But after reading y'alls post, I think that would be going from the front pan to the fire. My bones ache is horrible. I teach and some days it takes all I have to make it through a day. It seems the longer I am on it the worst it becomes. I have cone to the conclusion that all of these estrogen sucking drugs cause the same pain. Good luck ladies, just bring strong and trying not to give in to the drug! ",
