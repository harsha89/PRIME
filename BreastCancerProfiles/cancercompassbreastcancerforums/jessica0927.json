      "Content": "Just came across your post....my mom is a 10 year bc survivor treated with lumpecomy, radiation and hormone therapy.  She has recently noticed a significant shrinkage in the size of the treated breast.  She still has a hard area over the lumpectomy site that she has been told is scar tissue.  The area is very sensitive and occassionally aches.  No lumps or dimpling...just a smaller breast.  Her recent mammogram was normal and her breast exam was as well.  She is very concerned about the shrinking...she looks a bit lopsided.  Anyone have shrinking so many years later??? She sees her onco this week.  Any ideas??",
