      "Content": "Hi Lola27, I have had 8 treatments with Kadcyla so far. My doctor does not use tumor markers so I cannot comment on my own markers. I can however tell you that after 4 treatments, my CAT scan revealed that my numerous nodes in my lungs are gone! Or at least cannot be detected by this type of scan. They are still gone after 2nd scan two 1/2 weeks ago. I am NED and feel great. I hope it works for you too. ",

      "Content": "My nightmare started April of 2013. Nine months of Taxotere, Perjeta and Herceptin. Taxotere dropped as well, but progression 3 months later. You are not kidding that Taxotere is nasty. I truly wasn't sure how much longer I could take it. I am so sorry about your business having to close and you not able to run any longer. This cancer steals everything. You are lucky that you are hormone receptor positive as well because you have many more options than with Her2neu+ only. I hope therapy helps you find some happiness in your life. Take care. Lisa",

      "Content": "Lola, It is good to hear your markers have dropped. Scan time is so stressful. I just had scans of my neck, abdomen and chest as well as an MRI of my head. Those were some stress filled days. I so hope your scans are good. Kadcyla is the best drug I have ever had. Keeping positive all the time is impossible. I allow myself to be sad, cry, be angry, and anxious as well as happy when times are good. All those feelings are natural. I am too emotional to try and stifle them. I vent those feelings on my blog www.stageivnowwhat.blogspot.com. I recommend writing/talking as a way to release the many difficult emotions we have to deal with as cancer patients. I read other's blogs too. It makes me remember I am not alone. I do try to remind myself that as long as I feel pretty good, I am waking up tomorrow. That makes me happy. ",

      "Content": "I so agree. Healthy people truly don't understand our suffering, but how could they? I didn't really understand the utter helplessness of losing the sense of control in one's life after a diagnosis such as ours until it happened to me. They want us to stay positive because it probably makes them feel better, but they don't understand that we think about our deaths almost every hour of every day -or at least I do. Another sad aspect is several people I thought were friends have completely abandoned me - not even an email to just say hi. Maybe I should be more forgiving. They most likely have no idea what to say to me. Makes me sad though. My own husband at times says things to me that makes me feel like he is invalidating my feelings about my situation when I am feeling depressed. Really, he doesn't know what to do or say to lessen my pain. The thing is we all will die. The difference is we have an idea of how we will die, and that it will happen earlier than we had hoped. Let me know how your scan goes. I will be hoping for great news!   Lisa",

      "Content": "Tomorrow is a big day for you. Just thought I would send you a message that I was thinking about you. I know how tough scanxiety can be. I am so very sorry about your mom and best friend. I am sure they appreciated you being there to help them through their struggle. Those tragedies no doubt left you hopeless after your own diagnosis. As you said these are dark times. At least there are some moments of happiness. Those moments are what keep me motivated to continue my treatments so I can enjoy life a little longer.  Wishing you good days too.",
