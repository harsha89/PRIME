    "Content": "Hi, My husband has been going thru Chemo since June and he uses EMEND for nausea.  It is taken on the day of chemo and for the next two days after chemo.  He too takes Zofran.  What he finds is that orange juice helps him with the nausea also.  He gets queasy just driving near the cancer center.  Another trick that he has found is he carries a small bottle of rubbing alcohol and sniffs it when he feels queasy - just a quick whiff and he feels much better, odd but it works for him.  He finds that he craves protein for a few days after he has had his chemo too, so I make lots of meat and bean dishes for him.  Hope everything works out for you.   Elsie",
