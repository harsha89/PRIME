    "Content": "I wanted to make you aware of a clinical trial we are conducting that induces spontaneous remissions in a variety of cancers. Early results are very promising. This is based on a CAM therapy that I myself recently used to remit my own breast cancer (case report being documented by my physician). One Stage IV breast cancer subject in our study, who has not had any other tx, has had her CA 27-29 markers go from 289 to 149, her lung tumors have shrunk and omental tumors have disappeared. If you would like more information, please contact me. We are limiting enrollment through Nov. 2005.",
