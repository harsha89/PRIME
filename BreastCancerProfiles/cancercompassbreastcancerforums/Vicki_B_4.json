      "Content": "You do not say what type of cancer you had. This can help you decide on your choice of treatment. I had a masectomy in November last year and my growth was 5 c. However, the type of breast cancer I had was 1. Slow growing, 2. Has a distinctive path it takes, 3. Does not cross over to the other breast. Mine also was not inside the lymph nodes, however they were removed anyway as a precaution which was fine with me. After extensively researching radiation and chemo in libraries, internet and then contacting Cancer Treatment Centers of America for answers to questions I could not find, I decided not to do chemo. I did discover that women in the South who had done a masectomy were being given radiation which has a high rate of heart damage in masectomy women. Simply because there is no tissue to absorb the radiation, so the heart becomes damaged. In your case, some women will do the radiation since they did not have a masectomy and not do chemo, some do both. I did take Essiac and CQ10 immediately after I was diagnosed. Five months later when the expander was removed and the implant put in, several biopsies were done and no cancer was found. Remember that your choice of treatment IS your decision in the end, however, educate yourself on the type of cancer you have and its characteristics. If I had the other type of breast cancer that 80% of women have, I probably would have opted for the chemo, however, I would have went to Cancer Treatment Centers of America and/or a facility in Houston, TX. These two facilities are more up to date than anywhere else I could find in the US. Every cancer doctor will tell you to do radiation and chemo, choose what YOU feel is right for you after getting the medical information you need.",

      "Content": "Get the biopsy! Even if you have to change doctors to get it done. I had a large mass that came up in my right breast. They did mammogram and ultra sound and said it looked okay and I could have it removed when I was ready. Saw three different doctors and none of them even mentioned biopsy. I waited almost a year due to having a hysterectomy. Went to have the mass removed by a plastic surgeon and boom! Malignant. I had lobular carcinoma which will ONLY show up in a biopsy and can not be detected by mammogram or ultrasound! Go girl go. Even though I waited, I was lucky it had not passed through my lymph nodes. Now cancer free. Good luck, don't wait and always follow your instinct through this process every step of the way.",

      "Content": "A friend of mine had breast cancer and because of her network and living in a rural area she had to move in order to get the treatment she needed so her insurance would cover it. But before you go to this degree, you need to research ductal carcinoma to see how this type of cancer travels thru the body. I had lobular carcinoma and had a masectomy. Lobular Carcinoma at this point and time has to travel thru the lymph nodes to spread. I was lucky, mine had not. There are types of breast cancer that do not have to travel thru the lymph nodes and can travel anywhere in the body. So I first recommend finding the travel route. My tumor was also 6cm. I had a masectomy and found a doctor who was very detailed and concerned enough to remove absolutely everything he could. In fact, he was able to freeze samples during my surgery until he had a clear area. I had my surgery at Vanderbilt in Nashville. After getting the pathology report I researched lobular carcinoma, the treatment for it, etc. Since it had not traveled thru my lymph nodes, they removed four to be safe, I opted for alternative medicine. I did talk to an oncologist who told me I would be dead in a year without radiation and chemo, but I researched it, figured my chances, and opted for alternative. I took 6 weeks of Essiac that I only ordered from Canada (you can find it on the internet), waited 6 weeks and took another round of 6 weeks. Order it from Canada to be sure you get the pure substance. America substitutes. In addition I took CQ10 which you can find almost anywhere. I order mine from Swanson Vitamins on the internet by the name of Q-Gel. CQ10 Q-Gel has the highest absorption percent than any other CQ10 on the shelves. Your first steps should be to research the type of cancer and how it travels, treatment options in your area, and whether the doctor did or will do a masectomy. Certain types of breast cancer will show up in the other breast so sometimes it is better to remove them both. My type did not, per my doctor, so I only had to remove one breast. I was diagnosed Nov 2004 and am cancer free (not dead after a year as the cancer doctor told me I would be). Also, check your mothers insurance policy to see if she can be referred and it still pay in network. The doctor I chose to do my surgery was 4 hours away but if you can find a doctor to refer you where you want to go, sometimes it will pay. The more you educate yourself by research, talking with her doctor, talking with friends or people who have had breast cancer in your area and in your state, you will find great doctors so you and your mom can get your questions answered and you are both comfortable with your decision on treatment. Also, breast cancer did not run in my family even though I had it, but your risk is high due to your mom so the more you educate yourself now, you will be able to start alternative preventive, like the CQ10 Q-Gel, to protect yourself later in life. You both have much to gain and I know you will be directed in the right path. Use your mind and instinct. Try your best to detach your emotions and NEVER look at the situation as if it is the beginning of the end, but merely finding your way thru a tunnel to the other side, which is exactly what you are doing now when you posted this message. God Bless You Both, I'll pray that you keep the strength because I know you can make it thru the tunnel to the sunshine on the other side. Vicki",

      "Content": "Lou...I completely understand your anxiety. I had lobular carcinoma Nov 2003 and had a masectomy of my right breast. I was blessed in many ways through the entire experience of not having to endure many things that other breast cancer patients have gone through. I can only tell you how I responded when I found out I had breast cancer. I knew I had not gotten cancer 'over night' so I decided to take two weeks and research what exactly I did have. One full week to research it and one week to just let it all sink in. Educating myself helped relieve my anxiety. I immedately got a copy of my pathology report. Call them everyday until you get it. Once you get it, get on the internet and look up the definition of each word. I had difficulty understanding it even after looking up the definitions. I met a great friend who had also had breast cancer and she was in the medical field. She was able to put the pathology report into layman terms for me so I could understand where it was, what lymph nodes were actually involved or if the cancer had went thru them, etc. I then got on the internet and educated myself about the type of cancer I had, how it can travel in your body, etc. I then educated myself on treatments for the type of cancer I had. I was amazed at the options available including alternative medicine. Like you, I also had a bad experience with an oncologist. Get two opinions. Have them tell you what type of treatment in detail they want to give you. Again, research the type of treatment they advise. Your treatment is your choice. I chose my treatment and, no, the oncologist was not happy with me, but I was. I am now cancer free and have never regretted my treatment decision. Only you can choose your treatment. Make sure you understand all the side effects of any treatment you choose, not only the immediate (during treatment) but also ask about the long term side effects. This will also help you tremendously because you know you're body better than anyone. The key is: know your options. Cancer Centers of America can help you with some of the questions you will have. Luckily, I talked with them but found it was not necessary to physically see them. However, after researching their cancer centers, I would have chosen the one in Oklahoma (and I'm from Tennessee!). You can find good information on Cancer Centers website and M.D. Anderson Clinic in Texas. Both are excellent starting places for your research. Good luck and I know God will lead you in the right direction through this.",
