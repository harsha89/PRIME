      "Content": "my sister was told she has breast cancer but they can't find it she had a pet scan done and a couple of ct scans and they can not find it.but she is in stage 4 it has spread to her neck and to the lung she had 4 chemo treatments which the tumors went down 75 percent in size, but she went from stage 3 to stage 4 in them 3 months i just can'e understand that.she is now just finishing 25 radition treatments which is leaveing her really burned. she has a heart condtion which affected the amount of chemo treatments she got because they had to stop her last treatment she became to weak. and she had a really bad skin problem which they don't no where this stems from if it's to do with certian drugs or it's cancer related.i just don't know where this is all going anyone with any info i would really be so gratefull. Thank You and may god bless anyone suffering with cancer. Carolyn",
