    "Content": "hello everyone,this message is especially for the woman who wrote to ask for suggestions for financial help.i hope all of this suggestions will help her.the medical bills are endless but thankfully after almost 3 years am almost finished paying them.i am on federal disability also.i too was accepted on first try.however,you have to wait two full years to get medicare.i even just checked my medicare card to make sure.also it takes a full six months for them to make a determination.the best thing to do is try state disability and while collecting that apply for federal at same time.since i didnt do this had no income for 6months and had to use almost all my savings.also some states might not allow this.must do prior research.also is it worth it?will you have enough income with only that.i have my deceased husbands pension as well and its still difficult to make ends meet.perhaps if you get decent child support payments it would be feasible.medicare only pays about 80%of bill so still best to have some type of secondary insurance.my heart feels for you and your children,personally wish we had socialized medicine.did anyone see michael moores movie sicko???good luck to ya!",
