      "Content": "There are extenuating circumstance why I need to keep the discretion at work at the moment and why I am trying to be creative at hiding it there. My boss and the critical people know of my cancer and are supportive of me through the process otherwise. I was avid at the gym prior to starting chemo and have the clearance to continue to do that during chemo as much as I feel up to it. For my the gym quiets the mind and helps me sleep better in general. The biggest challenge for me is that I don\u2019t want to wear my wig to work out, but will need to change",
