      "Content": "I was taking Premarin for over 15 years.  I stopped taking it in Dec. of 2006.  In June of this year, I had surgery to have a lump removed, along with 2 nodes.  The nodes were removed as a precautionary measure and turned out to be clean and had no cancer.  The lump was found to be malilgnant, but all the tissue around the tumor, the corners, etc. were all clean and there was no cancer there, therefore only cancer being the lump.  Tests and biopsy could not reveal if it was malignant or not (prior to the surgery).    The question I have is:   I have been reading up on Premarin causing breast cancer, law suits, class action suits, etc.   I have also noted that occasionally \"receptors\" are mentioned.........some being negative and some being positive.   I have Negative receptors.   Would I be elligible to file a law suit again the Company who makes the drug??????       . ",
