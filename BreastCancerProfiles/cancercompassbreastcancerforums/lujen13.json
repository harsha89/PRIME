I'm currently looking into the same thing. I'm in S Florida and I know Cleveland Clinic here and in Ohio are doing it. I have only talked to 1 woman who has had it and this was recent. So far so good for her but I'm waiting to see how long , how well it works.",

I put myself on a diet and some alternative stuff.. Just wanted to know if others are just taking the meds without the surgery or stuff.. I took it for about a year and then I had a bilateral mastectomy Oct 09. Unfortunately it didn't help me to much. I have met many women who are using it alone. I was using a low fat, low carb high protein diet with vitamin supplements.",
