      "Content": "I was receiving carboplatin and Etoposide for neuroendocrine cancer. I have tumors in my skeleton. The chemo wasn't working and after finding a tumor on the lining of my brain I went to Boston for second opinion and was rediagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. I had DCIS ten years previously. My treatment plan was changed to Taxol, Herceptin, and Perjata. I have had 3 cycles and my markers are decreasing. I'm keeping my hopes up.Â ",
