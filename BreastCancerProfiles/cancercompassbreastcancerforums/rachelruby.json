    "Content": "Hello. I am new here. My name is Raxhel and I want to say what brave and amazing people all of you are. How I got to this site: my mother had radiation to the thymus as an infant. My sister has alopecia-age 54, had since age 16 and had breast cancer two years ago, lumpectomy and radiation. Very brave lady, indeed. I have lumps inside my neck, have been born with parathyroid problems. Lumps in neck are making it harder to swallow, I choke at times, blah blah. I have no insurance and can't look into it but things are malfunctioning. My sister is in much worse condition to me. My question; has any research been done as to the children of mothers who had radiation for enlarged thymus/ thyroid as infants. I thank all of you. I wish each of you best wishes, strength, and only the best. I'm a good listener if anyone needs to chat online. :-)",
