    "Content": "My aunt was diagnosed with breast and lung cancer in March 2001. She then had radiation treatment, followed by a mastectomy, followed by chemotherapy, followed by skin graft surgery to close the wound from the mastectomy. This all took place over a year ending in March 2002. She then began having trouble eating, keeping food down, and walking. These problems were caused by brain tumors. She had radiation treatment in April of 2002 to attack these brain tumors. She is now able to eat without vomiting and she can walk with a walker. However, she does not have a good appetite and her strength/energy is improving at a very slow rate. Is there anything she can do to improve her appetite, energy level, balance, and overall leg strength?",
