      "Content": "Five months ago my mother was dx with bc with mets to bone and liver. She had too many legions in the liver to count. To date she has taken four chemo treatments. Today she just got the results of her most recent scan and we learned that the tumors in her liver are GONE! Of course this is wonderful news. However, the doctor was concerned about some things or at least perplexed by them. Her liver appears to have shrunk and there is fluid in her abdomen that he can't explain. I know that swelling in the abdomen can be a sign of ovarian cancer, but he did not mention finding any new tumors and she has never been diagnosed with them before. We will be meeting with him to speak about the scans in detail on Thursday during her regular appointment before her next chemo. Has anyone else had a similar thing happen? Any advice? Thanks!",

      "Content": "I have found this webpage very helpful and decided to join. My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer with mets to bones and liver. This came as a huge surprise because she had non invasive breast cancer in 2004 and had a lumpechtomy and radiation. She has been taking tamoxifin, getting 6 month check-ups, and all was going well Then just a few weeks ago her doctor discovered the invasive cancer and scheduled a masectomy and said he would do an MRI to see how far it had spread. He noticed some places in the bones but said we would need an MRI to know for sure. However, we soon found out (from another doctor, an oncologist--its a long story, but we trust this doctor) that she actually did have mets to bone.... and to the liver. This second doctor said she needed to do chemo ASAP. Without chemo he said she had about 3 months to liver. With chemo he said her life could be extended. So, the breast surgery was cancelled and she began chemo this past Thursday. Before chemo she had no symptoms of liver mets, however she was experiencing some bone pain on certain days. So far she is tolerating the chemo well. The doctors are hopeful that the liver tumors could decrease and she could perhaps treat this kind of cancer as a chronic illness. Of course we hope so too. My husband and I had already planned to come back to the area in the summer, and we had hopes of spending time with my parents, perhaps having children, etc. This news of her diagnosis is heart breaking. She is 63 years old. The good thing is that we had already planned to come back and be near my parents. Of course, it would be wonderful if we were able to have even a few good years together. I have so many questions I don't know where to begin. I would love to hear from other breast cancer patients with bone and liver mets. I know the prognosis is poor, but I also know that some people are able to go on and live for at least a few years with this kind of cancer. I am scared, overwhelmed, and sad. I don't want false hopes, but I would really be interested in knowing other people's experience with liver and bone mets. Also, I am so unsure about the whole concept behind chemo. I know this is the form of treatment we have right now, and that it can sometimes help. However, I can't help but wonder how breaking the body down is a form of sustainable healing for an illness such as cancer. My mother is very interested in alternative therapies and would have never agreed to chemo if the situation and diagnosis had not been so dire. Is there anyone out there combining alternative methods with chemo? I know you all have discussed liver and bone mets on this list before, but if anyone has any thoughts to share about what I can expect, hopeful stories of living with this form of cancer, or any other related information, I would love to hear it. All of this is so new. Any information is appreciated. Also, if there are any adult daughters caring for their mothers, I would love to hear from you too. I want to be a good caretaker and be there for her as much as I can possibly be. Thanks to everyone for this wonderful page. I can't tell you how much help these message boards have been to me. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I should also note that she has liver cirrhosis that only became apparent after the tumors in her liver were gone. We have been to the ER once for these symptoms and to her GP twice and I have been on the phone with her oncologist's nurses more times than I can count. I feel very concerned about this, but can't seem to get any help from the doctors or any answers, except for that it could be tumor fever. I have another message in to her Oncologist about these \"riggers\" as his nurse calls them. ANY related information is MUCH appreciated. Thanks again.

I am happy to say that as of her last scan her liver mets appear to be gone and her bone mets are almost completely gone. If all goes well, she will have a masectomey in five weeks. The problem is that recently she was dx with a UTI. She was running high fever and having night sweats and shakes. But this has been going on for almost 6 days now and her doctors can't seem to figure out why the fevers and shakes won't go away. Her oncologist seems to think it may be tumor fever. Has anyone experienced something similar with their tumor fever? Any other guesses? She see her oncologist tomorrow and I have asked all the questions I can think of, including if this can be a sign of the tumors growing again. Any related information would be greatly appreciated. And thanks so much to the people who have written in before. This website is wonderful.",
