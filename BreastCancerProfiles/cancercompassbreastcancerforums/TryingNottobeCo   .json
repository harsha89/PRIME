    "Content": "I have recently undergone a mammogram and an ultrasound (actually several as they've called me back a couple of times) and in the last ultrasound the technician marked out \"ligaments\" coming out of the mass (or whatever that is).  She said that the radiologist would call me with the results on Monday, but it's disturbing.  She also indicated blood flow in the area and the veins on that breast are blue.  In the meantime, I've been researching on the internet, probably working myself into hysteria, but trying to prepare for whatever....and trying not to be a baby about it.  I would appreciate any advice, if only to tell me to \"get over it.\"  Thank you.",
