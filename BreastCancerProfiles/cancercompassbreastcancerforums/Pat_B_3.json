      "Content": "My husband had non-hodgkins lymphoma and my daughter had mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Both are cancer-free. My daughter has faced multiple reconstruction surgeries. We have spent a lot of time in the last 4 yrs. down at St. Jude's in Memphis. I felt like you do--the safety net is gone when we're home. But, after much struggle, my daughter, who is now 21, is on the emotional/social recovery track. All we can do is to trust that God knows what's going on and what is going to happen. I'll keep you in my prayers.",
