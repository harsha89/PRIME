      "Content": "Kathryn, Thanks for your response.  I'm going to take all of your info to M.D. Anderson with me next week. I have \"Metaplastic Matrix Producing Carcinoma\".  I just know that there is a doctor somewhere that knows something about this.  If we could only find out who that might be.  I feel very fortunate living in Houston, but feel that maybe I should be going somewhere else for treatment. I'm just baffled and confused and feel like I need to unravel this mystery and put the pieces of this puzzle together. Terri     ",

      "Content": "I'm 45-years-old with five young kids and was diagnosed with Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma in April, 2005. I had a mastectomy at that time.  Three-weeks-ago I found a lemon size mass in my bottom.  The doctor sent me back to M.D. Anderson where they found a spot on my neck and on my lung.  They are now doing chemotherapy (FAC).  Has ANYONE had a positive result with any type of chemo, radiation, etc.  Can these sites be surgically removed?  I need help (as we all do).  Someone, somewhere, has to know something about treating this terrible disease.  Please let me know.

      "Content": "Hi, I just read your message, and I too had Metaplastic Breast Cancer that metasticized.  Back in September I had chemo (FAC), and all tumors seem to be gone as of January.  I had one in the lung, one in my neck, and a large one in my buttocks (Weird).  These tumors seem to be able to go anywhere they want.  But, the point is, I did respond to FAC, and I follow the cancer diet; berries, mushrooms, no sugar, no white bread, no alcohol, etc.  Another key ingredient here is God and prayer, your faith has be to greater than your fear.

      "Content": "My name is Terri and I just found this website.  I was diagnosed in April 05, with one tumor, and a Mastectomy and was told that chemo wouldn't be effective  with this type of cancer. I WAS with M.D. Anderson in Houston.  Two and a half years later, I found a lemon size tumor in my buttocks, and when they scanned me, they found one in my lung and one in my neck.  I did chemo (FAC) from September, and December 26th was my last one.  I got scanned a week later where nothing showed up.  I pray that it doesn't return and have been doing the cancer diet since September (lots of mushrooms, berries, and greens, and of course NO SUGAR).  I am now with Baylor, Dr. Kent Osborne, an amazing doctor for anyone looking for one.  If you google his name with Baylor after it, you can read a hundred of his websites,  He knows a lot about Triple Negative Cancer, which I have; I don't know if all of us with Metaplastic have Triple Negative.   Is Taxol recommended afterwards?  I have an appointment January 31 and I guess I'll find out the gameplan then, but at this point the plan is to keep monitoring me every two to three months. I am 45 with 5 kids and a great, supportive husband. Please e-mail me if anyone has any other info on this. Thanks! Terri - --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
