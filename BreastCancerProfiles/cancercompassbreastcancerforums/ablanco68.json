    "Content": "I had my breast reconstruction about 4 years ago. I have been worried for about two weeks when a brussed, burning, cold sensation goes up and down and around my left breast. I am afraid of any re-occurracence.Â  I have always have a great insurance, but this year, even though I am paying $850 a month for my daughter and myself, our district picked the worse EVER insurance for their employees and for that reason I can not visit my Doctor, because I have to pay $500 fo the visit! Does any one know what is happening? Has anyone experience this before? I need your assistance. Thank you",
