    "Content": "Don't Worry, Be Brave! i think these r the words u have to feed in ur mind. my mom got a breast cancer 3 years before, and she is now back to a good healthy life, thanks to God and her doctors. u know some thing God always help the people who needs him but the most important thing to servive is keeping our moral high and a will to fight back. so don't worry ok.......... and by the way breast cancer has no genetic courier in itself, my family never faced any type of cancer in our medical history, it's just a desease like flu or a mild fever, and it's medically cureable :) and a good news is that it can be controlled without any lose of feminity with the latest laser treatment. So be Positive and keep urslef in good postition. Remember losing the will to live is the first and the deadliest step towards defeat. i hope u will make ur way from this battle field safe and secure. Have a nice and healthy life Friend. and never say GOOD BYE :)",
