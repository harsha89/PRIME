      "Content": "Thanks, Teresa, for replying to my diet message. I'm trying my best to do my part to stay healthy (eating right, eliminating stress in my life and exercising). And, I too, am relying on God for my complete healing as you are. I had 2 tumors - one was 1.8 cm and the other was 1.5 cm in my right breast. One was hiding behind the other and wasn't discovered until surgery. There was no cancer in my lymph nodes and the margins around both tumors were clear. Yet, my oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Research Hospital in Houston, Texas, wanted me to receive 6 months of chemo followed by 31 radiation treatments. I prayed about it and then decided to go through with her recommendations. It was a VERY TOUGH road to walk but I'm thankful I did it. I just feel it gave me that extra bit of help that I might have needed. I pray daily that God has completely healed me and has made every cell in my body completely normal. I've wondered if I'm more afraid of the disease or the treatment. In either event, I DO NOT want to be sick again with that wicked disease! Now, regarding, flax seed or flax seed oil. I have been counseled by my dietician at MDA and by a counselor at the Cancer Treatment Center of America to NOT eat flaxsee or it's oil - as it contains a natural estrogen. Therefore, I have elimanated that from my diet. I have read much on the subject and have learned it is very good for prevention of some cancers (breast included) but it NOT good for estrogen receptor positive breast tumors. Where are you getting your information? I am very interested in this subject and any information on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Also, have you been taught anything else you should or should not eat? I've not quite a bit of research on this subject and am hungry to learn more. Thanks again for replying to my e-mail above. I look forward to hearing from you again.",

That would tell a lot. Breast cancer isn't something to mess around with. I had breast cancer in 2004 and I was blessed to have a doctor at MD Anderson Cancer Research Center in Houston, Texas, who was very aggressive in her treatments. You mentioned that you had a \"dimple\" in that breast and that the lump was close to that. I've always heard that any suspicious \"dimpling\" should be exaimed very thoroughly. I don't want to sound like an alarmist but I think I would get a second opinion. Carolyn in Texas",

      "Content": "Hi everyone - it's been a while since I've posted a message BUT I have a real problem.  I have been on Arimidex for 3 years now.  I didn't do well on Arimidex for the 1st 6 months but then everything got better - no pain anywhere!  The only thing I suffer from occassionally is joint stiffness - but that's not really an issue.  THEN in March of this year, my left rib cage began to hurt.  It has persisted until now (July).  I had breast cancer surgery (right side) in 2004.  But it is my left rib cage that is hurting.  I have had x-rays and a bone scan done and nothing is showing up.  So, now I wonder if it could be a side effect from the Arimidex?  Have any of you who are or have taken Arimidex experienced this problem?  The rib cage itself is tender to touch but mostly it just feels like a HUGE catch in my rib cage area - like something is in there.  This is worrisome to say the least.  Please write me back if any of you have experienced this kind of pain.  I can't imagine what it is as many of our vital organs are on our right side.  I look forward to hearing from any of you when you have a mintue to write.  Thanks!!  Carolyn in Washingto state",

      "Content": "Hi. I, too, had breast cancer (estrogen receptor positive) and completed my chemo last and then 31 radiation trmts. in April, 2005. Also, I have been on Arimidex since April, 2005. Yes, there are some side effects but my thoughts are that unless they are completely intolerable to me, I will continue with the drug - as I believe it is a very powerful drug to prevent or block cancer cells from forming. The side effects I have experienced are stiff hip joints, knee joints and especially shoulder stiffness. But these things are tolerable and I can deal with them. I generally feel like I've had a very hard work out the day before but as I said, I can tolerate that. I would rather deal with some soreness or stiffness than to go through cancer and chemo again! Now about tofu -yes, there are certain foods that carry a \"natural\" estrogen, as well as, foods you need to stay away from that have \"added estrogen\" - or growth hormones in them. I have been advised by my dietician and oncogolost at MD Anderson Cancer Research Hospital in Houston, Texas, to stay away from tofu, soy products, flax seed or flax seed oil - as all carry a \"natural\" estrogen in them. Also, I was advised by other dieticians and other people who know about growth hormones being added to our meat supply to stay away from beef, pork and chicken as much as possible. My husband has a business associate who used to be in the chicken feed industry and he said he would NEVER eat chicken again because he knew what growth hormones were in it. He is convinced that is why we are seeing so many young girls these day develop breasts early and start their periods early. He told me that in July 2005 and I have not a bite of chicken since then. There is a lot of information out there (Internet, books, etc.) that one can study about this issue. So, I would advise you to do that. Now I basically eat no beef, pork, chicken but do eat fish. I eat lots of fresh vegetables, nuts, whole-grains, whole grain bread and fruit. I have NOT missed meat. I never thought I could live or eat this way but the fear of cancer and the treatment that follows has made this easy for me! Good luck to you. I hope things go well for you.

      "Content": "Dear Litzia, thanks for writing. I can only tell you what I've been told, and I trust what I have been told is the truth. As I said, I'm getting my info. from dieticians at MD Anderson Cancer Hospital and from info. from the Cancer Ctrs. of America. I have been told by both that flax seed carries within it's own makeup a natural estrogen. It doesn't trigger production of estrogen but has a natural estrogen already within it's own makeup. I, too, was spreading the flax seed on my morning oatmeal and had done that for a couple of months. But when I questioned them on that, they said not to put it on anything as it carries a natural estrogen within it's own makeup - and for women such as us (who have had estrogen positive tumors), that that wouldn't be something we would want to take into our bodies. Another thing they mentioned was soy products. I'm not a fan of soy anyway, so, that was just fine with me. I did ask about soy sauce and was told that a little wouldn't be that harmful but I wouldn't want to make a steady diet of it. Regarding omega 3 supplements. I haven't heard anything about that. I assume that taking a fish oil supplement would be good. Who told you about the importance of taking an omega 3 supplement? What will it do for us? Also, do you know anything about Vit. E.? Is it okay for us to take? I've added that to my supplements but have wondered if I should have. Now, regarding your stiffness and dizziness. My stiffness is really in my shoulders and neck area and hips. Also, my knees get quite stiff from time to time but not constant like my shoulders, neck and hips. I've not experienced the dizziness. I can tolerate a lot of pain and discomfort and so far, my stiffness has been tolerable. As I said earlier, I think the benefits of Arimidex far out weigh any stiffness I might be experiencing. Litzia, I've very interested in nutrition and supplements as a result of the cancer experience I went through. Therefore, if you have any other information on either, I would really love to communicate with you about it. I believe we all can learn from each other. I look forward to hearing from you again if you would like to. Thanks - Carolyn",

      "Content": "Hi Kim, I have been taking Arimidex for 2 years now.  For the 1st six months, it was really hard for me - aching knees, hips, hands and back.  After the 1st three months I told my oncologist about all my pain and she asked me to give the drug some time, as she found that after a patient had been on the Arimidex for at least 6 months, that oftentimes many of the symptoms went away.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt and continued on the drug.  And I have to say she was right!  After about 6 months on Arimidex, the majority of my aches and pains have disappeared.  The only thing I experience from time to time are stiff hands when I wake up.  But by the time I make our coffee and breakfast, that stiffness has gone.  So, I would encourage you to try it if your doctor suggests it for you.  Yes - our bodies have gone through many assaults going through cancer - surgeries, chemo and radiation.....and then we are asked to take other powerful drugs such as Arimidex and Tamoxifin.  But I'm thankful that we have these drugs available to us these days!  I have 3 more years on Arimidex and honestly, I'm NOT looking forward to going off it!  I feel very safe taking it and only hope and pray there is another drug after 5 years that I can take.  I pray that you will get well soon and will make the best decision for you.  Good luck!",

I'm thankful that I have a wonderful oncologist and general physician that \"take the bull by the horns\" (so to speak) for me. They do not have a \"wait and see\" attitude but a \"let's get to the bottom of this soon\" attitude. I hope your sister has the same kind of physicians. Now about her arm pain - how long has she had it? As I said in my originial message, joint pain and pain throughout the body is somewhat normal while taking Arimidex. I have learned to accept it and just go on with my life. Has your sister spoken with either her oncologist or general physician about her arm pain? I think I would talk to my oncologist about it first, as I'm sure her oncologist is the doctor that prescribed Arimidex for her. Tell your sister to hang in there and not to get discouraged. I think wondering about other pain in your body is normal after cancer. The wise thing for her to do is to call her doctor, tell him/her of her concerns/pains, and then let the doctor take care of it. It does your sister no good to worry. If anyone else is reading this and agrees or disagrees, you might respond to this, as it could help the reader. I hope I have been of some help.",
