      "Content": "HI Kathi, I hope your husband is doing OK. I have only one more chemo treatment to go. The first week is difficult but then I begin to feel better. I have been taking supplements as soon as the first week is over as initially after the chemo everything bothers my gut and many of the supplements seem to cause an increase in gas and burning for me. I find Miso soup helps and kefir...a kind of yogurt...it is very soothing. This coming week I am going to see Dr. Zoltan Rona (MD and naturopath) and am hoping he can give me some good advice about detoxifying and so on. I will let you know what happens. I find some of the advice a bit confusing. How are you getting along? God Bless yourself and your husband, Moira",

      "Content": "Dear Marilyn, Thanks for replying to my message. For the first two weeks after the oncologist warned me about taking large doses of antioxidants I did not take them. I found the first chemo treatment to be horrible. After the first two weeks as I began to eat again, I decided to take the vitamins and so on...the next chemo treatment was easier on me! I have the third one tomorrow...so I'm hoping that it wasn't just luck the second time! Best of luck with your learning too! God Bless, Moira",

      "Content": "Just a month ago I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, stage 3. The lymph nodes were clear but venous/lymphatic invasion was present. I had a lumpectomy and have now begun a course of chemotherapy. 5-Fluorouracil Infusion, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide. As soon as I was diagnosed I began to take Essiac, Beta-Carotene, Vitimin C & E and a fish oil supplement. The oncologist has told me not to take any large doses of anti-oxidents as they could interfer with my treatments. I find this upsetting as I have read much that is hopeful regarding cell protection during these treatments. Has anyone else been given this directive? I need to know his reasoning.",
