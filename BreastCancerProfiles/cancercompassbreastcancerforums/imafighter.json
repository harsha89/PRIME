      "Content": "About two months ago I found this site after having an abnormal pap. Later it turned out to be mild dysplaisa, which is alittle scary. I am thankful thought it is not worse. In April of this year I had a breast reduction. Everything went wonderful and I healed up pretty quickly.  About a month ago I felt a lump in my breast.  I went to see my doc about it and he said he thought it maybe a cyst but he wanted me to have an ultrasound to be sure. So I went for the ultrasound and then they said we need to mamm. So I did that. They told me it looked like fat scl. or scar tissue but nothing to be worried about. They said that I should go see my doc in month and have him check it out again and then another ultrasound in about 6 months. I said ok and was like ok, nothing to worry about see your fine. Then boom! I get a letter in the mail saying that i had some abnormalites and need a bio. I was so mad. Why did they say everything was ok if it wasnt. I am glad everything is being taken care of but it is just so stressful. I am so confused and have no idea what is going on any advise would be helpful thanks.",
