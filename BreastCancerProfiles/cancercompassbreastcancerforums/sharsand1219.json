I am new to this site and newly diagnosed with BC.  I am trying to find out all the info I can, especially from others who have already travelled down the road. Thank you for the link to healthjourneys.com .  I have already downloaded one relaxation recording.  I know your responses were over a year ago, so I'm not sure if you even come back to this site.  Nonetheless, I wanted to thank you and wish you well.  Take Care.   Sharon :) ",
