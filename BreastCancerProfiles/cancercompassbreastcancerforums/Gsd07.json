      "Content": "Anyone out there experiencing higher blood pressure since starting Tamoxifen?   After mastectomy and chemo, I began taking Tamoxifen.  It's giving me very bad hot flashes and night sweats, and I've also noticed an increase in my blood pressure.  So I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed that. I don't need heart problems on top of everything else! Thanks",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed last April with Stage II BC (it had moved to lymph nodes), had double mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction.  Then went through 5 months of chemo.  Now I'm on Tamoxifen.  My onc said in 6 months they'll do a basic blood test, but that there is no industry standard for followup testing to identify recurring bc.  He says they usually let the patient tell them when something's wrong.  That doesn't feel good to me, since my bc was picked up through a mammogram, and the tumors weren't big enough to be felt.   So by the time I would've noticed it, it might've been too late.  Is that what everyone else is being told, or are there standard tests that you take once initial treatments are over?  And how frequently are you tested? Thanks for any input you can offer.",

      "Content": "Mine didn't recommend the colonoscopy, but I've been wondering if I should do it anyway.  If there is a link between the two types of cancer, then it couldn't hurt.  And I agree with the concern about checking other parts of the body where the bc could metastisize to... my onc just said usually the patient can tell if something's wrong.  But I don't really like that answer.  From one of the responses it certainly sounds like there are plenty of tests that can be done to check those other areas, so I guess I'll try a different dr. and ask him/her about those.  Thanks to all who've replied.",
