As for the HER2, it said no over expression. Not sure what that means. My oncology appt is still days away, and I am going crazy with the waiting and wondering. Feeling overwhelmed by it all, and don't know what to do about my job. I took a medical leave when this started, but don't know how to plan for a return to work until I know something more definite. Is there anyone out there with a similar diagnosis who can give me a clue on what  to expect? Marshabel   Yes I just found this page today.  I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma on 2/28 and am going to have a bilateral mastectomy on Tuesday March 20th - one week from today. I am told I will have to have chemo and radiation but have no details of that yet, have not met with an oncologist yet. I've only met with my surgeon and a plastic surgeon who will both be in the OR at the same time.  I live in Vancouver, Washington, very close to Portland, OR.  My name is Marsha and I am 51. ",

      "Content": "Hopefully within the next month I'll be exchanging my expanders (bilateral) for implants.  I don't know much about implants and wondered if you all could share your advice and experiences? When I leave the hospital, will I have surgical drains in?  If so, for the same amount of time approx as with the bilateral mastectomy surgery? Do you have any idea how soon I could return to my office job?  Next day? Thanks so much, Marsha in Vancouver, WA",
