    "Content": "Green tea is good for you but not premade with sugar in it.  I am under a nutritionist and because of ovarian cancer do not do soy products, nor dairy, nor meat,  I stay away from sugar as much as i can.  Find a green tea that is in a tea bag make your own tea and if you must sweeten it a bit try using Agave Nectar.  That is what is recommended to me.  good luck",
