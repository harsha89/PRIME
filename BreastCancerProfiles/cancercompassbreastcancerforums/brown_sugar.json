      "Content": "Can someone explain to me why the chemo is recommend. I had a double mast in December 2008 because the doctors @ MDanderson and I agreed to have this due to a 1.5 lump found in my left breast. Also I have three other sisters that have breast cancer that were in their 60's where as I'm 55 and develope cancer. mother lived to be 95 no breast cancer. Grandmother both size of family no breast cancer. I confused because I'm HER2, hormone receptor negative. it was first said it I had a double mast I would not need Chemo but maybe radiation.  Now my oncology said it is recommend that I should have 8 rounds of chemo and radiation.  I can't understand since my tumor was early stage and I elected to have a mast.  Can someone explain that have experience this.  Also my other sisters are on daily medication such as Femera 2.5mg. My oncology said no meds for me after the treatment.  I haven't decide to take the chemo as of now.  I'm still trying to understand all of this. thanks Patricia in Texas On 3/1/2003 Nancy jo wrote: To: Jeannine S. I was diagnosed 4 yrs ago this April with stage one breast cancer. I received a lumpectomy and bachytherapy on my left breast. As of right now I am not receiving any treatment, but I have changed my eating habits and I am taking vitamins and drinking carrot juice. One supplement I am taking that is supposed to be good for hormone receptor negative is indole 3-carbinol 200 mg caps twice a day. Nancy H,  ",
