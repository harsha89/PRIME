      "Content": "Hi rainybrain, I know this is a scary time for you, but please go to Cancer Treatment Centers of America's hopsital in Tulsa. They are the most caring group of people I know. They treat the whole person. I know because I had a bad report in Dec. 05 on my mammogram, and I really got the run around in my town. Do not delay any test. I had stage three cancer and had the whole breast removed and it was not as bad as I thought it would be. I have had chemo.and will be going into radiation soon. You will have superb professionals taking care of you. The Center Is a place of Hope. Call them 888.816.5122 My prayers are with you. Miss k",

      "Content": "I was said to have stage 3 breast cancer with 11 positive lymph nodes, I started and have completed four cycles of the taxotere chemo and my nails look yellow and brittle,but what I wonder about is all this swelling of my legs, ankles, feet and stomach. (10lbs in a few days) Does any body out there have the same problem? I reported it to the Dr. but they do not know. My moods are strange. I cry alot and feel helpless. Is this just part of chemo? I am 46 and the chemo has stopped the monthly cycle..If this is menopause God help us all...It is worse than the treatments. The emotions are trying...I call it the roller coaster ride. I know our Lord is with me, but this is the hardest thing I have ever gone thru. Any body else been here? I have never felt so out of control.",
