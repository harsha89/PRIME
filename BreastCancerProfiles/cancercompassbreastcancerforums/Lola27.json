      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I'm happy you are doing so well on this drug. I have had 3 treatments and will have a scan on Monday. I was on Herceptin, Pertuzamab and Taxetere in 2012... Very rugged protocol and then the Taxetere was removed. I also have Zometa every 3 months. Prior to this recurrence my life was great. I was a personal trainer and a runner. Now I've had to close my business and running is no longer an option. For a year and a half I had so much anxiety and depression caused by tamoxifen ( did not now the source then) I couldn't get off the couch. Things have improved now that I'm on Kadcyla but not a lot. It's hard to live with all the worry and uncertainty. I'm starting therapy next week. Hoping that will help. My best to you!",

      "Content": "So happy to connect with someone I can relate to. It's difficult for friends to understand the perils of this cancer thing! They all just want a good outcome and some have no idea about the daily struggles of living with a life threatening, life altering illness. It's natural for healthy people to want to focus on the positive but the reality is what I need them to understand. Maybe that's not possible. Sometimes I feel I need to take care of them instead of vice versa! This is tough territory to navigate!",

      "Content": "Funny how some people I never thought would step up did,while others closer to me backed away. My sister has never come to visit even once and she lives a half hour away! I think I've given up trying to make sense of it all. I need my energy to get through the day, so I've tried to stop being bitter...hard,though. Some people can be pretty disappointing. I do, however, have many supportive friends who are there for me. My husband is my \"wing man\" and does his best to give me what I need but sometimes he's at a loss as to what to say. Sometimes I am beyond consoling....those are very dark times, indeed. Facing all of this is daunting. Sometimes I am in a good place but so often I am totally terrified. I know what a cancer death is. My mother and my best friend died months apart. I took care of them both. It was terrible. I will let you know what the scan shows and in the meantime, I wish you good days!",
