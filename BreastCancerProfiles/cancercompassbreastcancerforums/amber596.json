I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!! Hello all, I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 58, in June 2010. Left breast lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node positive, all lymph nodes removed from left.  I was on Arimidex for close to 4 years.  5% recurrence rate, I was in that 5%. In June of 2009 I was diagnosed again with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. My oncologist changed my medicine to Aromasin and I thought I'd share my side effects.  I'm 60 now and feel as though I've aged 10 yrs.  The bone and joint pain is almost everyday, in my wrists, knees, ankles and feet.  I just had a cortisone shot for trigger finger.  I want to get off this medicine, but my oncologist thinks it's best for me. I tire easily and I feel more depressed than before.  I'm not sure whether to switch or not.  Any suggestions?  Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 60 and have had breast cancer twice. First time a lumpectomy '05 with complete lymph node removal left arm.  I was put on Arimidex.  I was on it for 4 yrs, when I had my recurrence.  The arimidex made my wrist, knees, ankles and feet hurt.  Lot's of bone pain. Prone to falling.  June of '09 the cancer came back and I had a mastectomy no reconstruction.  I was switched to Aromasin and have the side effects to be the same. I've been on the Aromasin for 2 yrs.  Post mastectomy pain is REAL and so are the side effects of Arimidex and Aromasin.  I'm beginning to think these medicines are all the same.  Just wanted to share thoughts with you.  Good health to us all.  ",

      "Content": "They couldn't take the skin from my stomach because it was radiated.  That is why I would have to have the latissimus muscle tunneled from a back incision to the mastectomy scar. The down time is 4 weeks and 4 drainage tubes.  After that is done, I'd have to go in to have a \"fill\" in a port in the left scar, and I'm not comfortable with that.  A year later I would have a nipple. I was terrified and confused at the time I was told about the mastectomy, so I said no reconstruction.   The procedure I described is what a very wonderful plastic surgeon told me 3 yrs ago.  I'm 66 now and not sure and still scared.  I don't know how old you are, but from my previous experience, I wish I could do it.  I know you will be happy if you get the reconnstruction.  I wish you good healthy and happiness. In retrospect, to be perfectly honest I wish I had done it 3 yrs ago.  Go for it!",

      "Content": "I have those same moments you do. I've had breast cancer twice.  2005 and 2009. 2005 was a lumpectomy, then chemo and radiation. Once I struggled through that they put me on Arimidex for the cancer.  There was terrible bone pain from the medicine.  95% rate of no recurrence.  2009, I was in the 5% that had recurrence.  The surgeon said everything so fast, my head felt like it was spinning.  He told me I had to have a mastectomy and do I want reconstruction.  I was so upset, I shook my head no.  I'm 66 now and having trouble accepting myself.  I hate having one breast.  I'm blessed with the most supportive husband and son ever.  I suffer from depression and anxiety on a daily basis.  When I tried to find out about the reconstruction a few years ago, I was told they can't take the skin from my stomach because I had radiation.  They would have to make a large incision in my shoulder muscle in my back and tunnel it around to the scar.  Every 2 weeks I would have to go to the doctor to have it \"filled.\"  It would be a year of that and then get a nipple.  I could not do this.  I wanted to but it was so contrived I had to pass on it. Very long recovery also.  I'm still working and could not take the time off.  I have a \"fake\" breast and no one can tell.  Just me.  I hate myself everytime I look in the mirror.  I feel so very unsexy. I miss my other breast so much.  Would have, should have could have.  I need to get myself to a point where I am grateful that I'm alive.   Can you shed some light on this please?  Thanking you in advance.",
