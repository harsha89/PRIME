      "Content": "Hello: I have been on Arimidex for 4 years. Just went to my oncologist complaining of side effects-joint pain, back and neck stiffness etc. She said, that most of these side effects go away after one stops the medications. One more year- anyone out there having relief after stopping? I had already had 5 yrs. of tamoxifen for breast cancer the first time..  ",

I had been on Femerra (l'etrazole) but the side effects, nausea, diarhea, and joint and muscle pain were debilitating. I certainly don't have the nausea and diareah with A but I am tired and seem to feel quite down. I am experiencing some pain in arms and hands. It seems by reading through the messages my symptoms aren't that uncommon but I am so reticent to complain again to the doctors. I suppose I think I should feel lucky to be alive.  As anyone tried acupuncture or other non-drug interventions to handle the side effects?  elle0   I am also a 2x survivor of breast cancer having been on Taxoxifen first and now Arimidex.  Joint pain too.  What has helped some is Glucosamine and Condroitin (minerals)/ Give it a try.",
