The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G I was diagnosed with breast cancer; had a masectomy, and breat reconstruction.  My oncologist prescribed Arimidex for my cancer treatment.  I advised him I was taking Black Cohosh to help with hot flashes.  Seven months after my breat cancer surgery & treatment, I decided to get a second opinion which turned out to be one of the best things I have done for myself since being diagnosed with breast cancer.  The second opinion dr. was very concerned that I was taking Black Cohosh.  Her response was something very similar to:  \"I know you are here for a second opinion and I will be happy to take you as a patient, but whatever you decide, I beg of you to stop taking black cohash.  You are taking medication to take the estrogen out of your body and then you are putting it right back into your body by taking the black cohosh which is a natural form of estrogen.\"  Needless to say, I stopped taking the black cohosh and I did change drs.  I am very glad I went for the second opinion.  She is a wonderful dr.  So, I would ask you to please stop taking the black cohosh. I am new to this site but thought I would share that I take fish oil capsules for my hot flashes which were severe. It has almost eliminated them completely. Worth a shot for anyone who cant take the flashes. As for bone and joint pain, I really don't know what to do about that:( Mine are awful. I was taking fish oil long before I started Arimidex but my hot flashes are so bad that I can soak through a shirt in minutes!  As for the joint pain, it was suggested that I take glucosimine/chondroitin but that didn't work.  I absolutely hate taking a lot of other pills just because of the side effects one little one.",

Quit radiation after 9 (of 30) sessions, no chemo.  I've been on Arimidex at a half-dose level for 4 years now.  I have very few side-effects, mostly dry skin and some bone-thinning.  I work with a distant oncology-trained acupuncturist.  I've never met him as we talk on the phone and he order comprehensive lab-work to look deeply at my 'terrain', i.e. my body that allowed the cancer to grow. He presented the option of using a half-dose in order to receive the benefits with fewer drawbacks.  We do lab-work a couple of times a year to verify that my estrogen levels are undetectable.  I asked my oncologist about this option and he said only \"it doesn't work that way!\"  I think that meant that standard cancer treatment is not yet actually customizable for different bodies.  But the acupuncturist made clear to me that the point of aromatase inhibitors is to drive estrogen levels to zero.  So, I feel confident that I am doing that with less medicine onboard.  Of course, the acupuncturist is extremely careful to present options without advice.  We're all doing the best we can with this situation.  Just wanted to note an 'outside the box' option that I've never seen on any of these boards.  My approach is a bit of a hybrid. Outside of 1/2 dose arimidex, I rely on enormous immune boosting 'alternative' therapies for now.  Fingers crossed.I was on Arimidex for 2 1/2 years. Before the Arimidex I took 33 rounds of Radiation.I had severe hot flashes.. Joint pain along with night sweats. I was tired all the time. The pill didn\u2019t work my breast cancer returned. And in February of this year 2018 I had a double Mastectomy. Tomorrow I go for my 6 mth check up at the Oncologist. Fingers are crossed that all is good.. two times with cancer is to many. I\u2019ve noticed that my hair has been coming out pretty much everyday when I brush it. And I have very long hair. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal but it is. I hope that stops soon. I\u2019m not on the Arimidex now I guess I will know more about that tomorrow. Time will tell... I hope, and pray, you are now clear.  I only took Arimidex for 10 months because I couldn't handle the side effects.  One of those was losing and thinning of my hair.  The funny thing was that that side effect didn't start until after I stopped Arimidex!  Now that I've been off for almost 2 years, my hair is still more thin than it was before being put on the drug.  If I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't have taken my oncologist's word for it and not gone on it.  She never told me about that side effect and neither did my pharmacist.",

Speaking of, if memory serves from college, HCG is a human hormone produced by babies to make them grow. My guess is that homeopathic drops cannot actually contain HCG because it would have to be administered by a physician. I'm not a fan of WW because of the way their program works, or doesn't. Have you tried keeping a 3-day diary(don't cheat on it) of everything you eat. We had to do that and there wasn't one person that wasn't surprised at what they put in their mouths and weren't aware of. Try that, be honest, and go from there. Going out to eat is a huge ding to anyone's diet. People don't realize what that Subway or Whataburger is in calories but it is shocking. We won't even talk about putting all the fixins on it. There was just a blip the other day about diet sodas and they don't actually help with weight loss. What helps, a lot, is water. What concerns me is that these drug companies, doctors, and pharmacists don't, or won't, tell us what the immediate and long-term side effects of these drugs are. Good luck. ",

      "Content": "It's amazing what they don't tell you before you're put on this drug.  Half-life is very real but that is for one dose!  You go along fat, dumb, and happy and all the while the drug keeps building up in your system.  As for me, if there were 15 side effects I had 10 of them.  It got down to the fact that I was just plain miserable and after 10 months I'd had it so I just stopped it.  The oncologist wanted me to go back on it and I told her that if she, all of her staff, the drug peddler, researcher, and manufacturer went on it, then I would go back on it.  The look I got!  It's easy for them to say, \"here, take this and it'll protect you.\"  I sound like Bill Cosby and I don't mean to.",

I am still stiff with femara but not as bad.  Hot flashes continue.  I am very tempted to stop the medication but haven't as yet. I do feel femara is a better approach than armidex. Delaura  You want the bad news about Femara?  It has almost the same side effects as Arimidex and the first one is hot flashes, join/bone/muscle pain is the fourth, different from Arimidex(Anastrozole).  To be honest, if the doctor and/or pharmacist told us all the side effects, we wouldn't take anything.  I know when I was prescribed Anastrozole, I was not told anything, and I mean nothing!",

      "Content": "Something that no one has posted, that I've seen, are the long-term side effects of Arimidex. After 10 months on the drug, the side effects became too hard for me to handle BUT 2 or 3 months after I stopped I developed pedal edema, something I have never had.  My primary put me on Lasix to get rid of the water (swelling); it took 2 weeks before my feet and weight got back to normal. Then it would come back again and again. When I saw the oncologist, I asked her but she just shrugged it off and I don't know if it's because she didn't know (which I doubt) or was surprised I could connect the dots. Anyway, I happened to ask another doctor in passing about Arimidex and pedal edema so he looked it up on his PDA and guess what? Pedal edema is a long-term side effect of Arimidex! I don't believe for a New York minute that I am the only one who has connected the dots or experiencing this; anybody else?",
