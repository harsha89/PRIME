      "Content": "Hello, new friends! I had a lumpectomy of the right breast and am contemplating treatment options and need your help.  Five nodes were positive and my \"O\" suggests 7 months chemo, followed by 7 weeks of radiation and hormone therapy for 5 years.  I am 53 and in otherwise excellent health. Problem?  I am in remission from Burkitt's Lymphoma 3 years.  I KNOW chemo.  The procedure was hospitalization for chemo 24 x 7, 7 days each month for 8 months.  I KNOW I am not the person I once was physically and emotionally and feel any further damage will not be acceptable. I felt if I made it thru Bukitt's, I could get on with my life.  Not the case anymore.  What I'm trying to express is that although no one has a crystal ball, I don't believe the hype that I can get through this and everything will be hunky dorry.  I feel what will be next. I would like to hear the truth about these procedures from people who have experienced all the pitfalls, all the pros and cons.  I realize everyone is different and no one knows that more than I, but I need to hear from patients, not doctors.  I need to hear from survivors.

      "Content": "Thank you, witchdoctor, for your response; however, as I have had just about enough of doctors at this point, it is the survivors I wish to hear from.  I want to know the after effects of radiation and hormone therapy.  I want to know the things the doctors gloss over or don't tell you at all! Hopefully yours ",
