At the time of reaccurence I ha masectomy and switched to tomoxifen.  Side effects are terrible.  I didn't think evista would be of an benefit for already diagnosed idc.  I do not want to take any drug just for the heck of it,  If anyone has had success with just evista after having idc, I would appreciate hearing from you. thanks sloopy.",
