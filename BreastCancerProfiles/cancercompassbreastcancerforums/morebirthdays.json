    "Content": "I was diagnosed five years ago with hormone receptor breast cancer.  I had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed.  I began a therapy of Femara which worked for three years.  Two years ago my CA markers began to rise. I had PET and CT scans, nothing showed.  My medication was changed to Tamoxifen and then to Aromasin.  The Aromasin brought them down but after six months they rose again.  Then my medication was changed to Arimadex.  Rising still.  Megestrol still rising.  Then a PET scan showed nodes in my armpit where the other nodes were removed and a spot in my left groin.  After surgery, the lab report showed the same cancer in the nodes.  None of the hormone blockers stopped the cancer.  Has anyone had this occurrence and what treatment were you been offered?",
