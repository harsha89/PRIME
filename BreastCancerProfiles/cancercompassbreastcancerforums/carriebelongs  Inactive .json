As for soy consumption, remember that women in Japan have a relatively low incidence of breast cancer despite a high intake of soy. Often that correlation led to people being encouraged to increase their consumption of soy products. As a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist; I would recommend a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy products and lean proteins especially fish high in omega 3s. If you prefer to be a vegetarian that it fine too. Just educate yourself. It is best to rely on \"whole foods\" rather than tons of supplements. If you can afford organics, go for it. On a limited budget? There are places on the internet where they list the top 10 foods to spend the extra $$ on for organic (like berries which you can't really scrub...) good luck and lots of healing energy for a quick recovery. Consider yoga as part of your recovery. Soy in Japan is not the same as the soy produced in America.  Most American soy is GMO, I believe about 90 percent of it.  Plus, the Japanese have a very different culture with lifestyle and diet.  Too many variances to make a comparison.  When I was diagnosed I had a well-intentioned friend bring up the whole Japan women and soy thing and suggested I eat a ton of soy to heal myself.  Yikes.",

      "Content": "Hi Spring Flowers, My cancer antigen was 1,278 in January.  Started Xeloda and combined a pretty heavy turmeric supplementation (per research done with those two in combo).  It went down to 601 in three months on just half a recommended dose of Xeloda.  Today at my appt. I found out it is 950.9.  I quit Xeloda and began budwig two and a half weeks ago.  I know, I know.  Everyone wants me to quit working but nobody will pay me to do so.  I did the disability route and as a consequence I was forced unto Medicare which added to my bills.  I'm alone with no support.  I did disability for a short time but it was barely enough to pay rent and groceries much less all the expensive natural remedies.  While I supplemented the disability with part-time work, they suspended me for working.  Now that I did the disability for a short time I was put on Medicare against my will and am not allowed to dis-enroll unless I want some penalties.  And the Medicare cancelled out my other insurance that I cannot go back on because of being Medicare eligible.  It's a mess.  My only hope is to get out of America.  Seriously being considered. Fortunately, my new oncologist is super sweet and not a bully.  She is thorough and a teacher.  She is still American standard of care, however, she wants to work with my naturopath and is disappointed that my insurance won't cover that.  I just got a call (as I type this!) from the naturopath physician about getting in to see her tomorrow morning!!  Talk about timing!  I originally had to wait until end of July and now with all these decisions and progression, I need her help right now! Along with quitting my job, I can't knock off any hours and have an \"easier schedule.\"  I'm already broke.  I just paid my rent and nothing left for groceries or gas!  I asked friends to do fundraising for me but they are too busy with their families.  I went back to credit cards after being out of credit card debt and those are all maxed out. I don't know if I am just experiencing the worse before the better since I got very rigorous with the natural treatments and suddenly I progress like crazy.  But how far do I let it go before my spine is all eaten up and I'm wheelchair bound??  I don't know.  Lord, have mercy and heal me.",

I've heard of the asparagus \"cure\" and have wanted to do that.  I wouldn't use Green Giant or canned food though.  Can't I just buy asparagus and do the same?  I have a really hard time with the taste of asparagus but it is better than chemo.  I used to like asparagus so I'm not sure why even the site of it is now repulsive.   The Cellect supplement I've been taking the last two weeks have greatly increased my energy.  It's a powder that contains about 150 nutrients in one shake.  It's not the best tasting thing, but it's improving me health.  I see my oncologist in two weeks.",

Even if the alternatives don't cure some people, they significantly increase quality of life and are helping people live well beyond their prognosis. It's worth it. Diet, exercise, and dealing with emotional burdens are the most important aspects in fighting cancer. Not drugs or chemo. And quite often people turn to alternatives after they've been nearly destroyed by the conventional treatments and sent home to die. Most alternative treatments don't work very fast. They are gentler and work slowly in helping a person regain their health. Quite often there's not enough time so alternatives are then erroneously considered a failure. Also, alternatives mean diligence and hard work by the patient. It's not merely popping pills or showing up for chemo. People who lack the discipline or refuse to take responsibility for their own health don't do well with alternatives.",

I started on the Budwig Protocol a little over a week ago and will see how that goes.  At least it's not destroying me or making me sick.  Breath of fresh air... My heart goes out to you, Emily.  Your friend is so very fortunate and blessed to have you.",

My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily God is in control.  I'm a BC survivor for ten years recently I have bone mets and in my spine and liver. I still work full time and have been on chemo.  Chemo combinations are not working now.  But I know he is in control.  I never wanted to share my story to anyone.  But I know that I am able to stay alive only because HE Lives and prayers.  My doctors are still optimistic and I manage with a healthy diet, juicing and eating one healthy meal. I'm glad she has a friend like you.  That is all she needs someone to talk to and pray with her. There has to be a cure.  I'm still searching and am hopefulMaithili, I'd love to hear your story and connect. I have a similar situation and will be deciding by next week if I will continue with any conventional. It just makes it worse...and working full time, running around to useless appointments, insurance hassles, side effects. If I keep going like this the tx and all it's stressors will kill me before the cancer does. My only hope is God, and I've been hitting the non-toxic therapies pretty seriously now. I tried to get three oncologists to allow me to do integrative care but it's their way or the highway. All three have even become angry toward me and seem frustrated with my questions/refusals of certain TXs. I can't keep battling the cancer industry, I have a cancer to fight and an income to earn. Emily, Someone before said this and I wholeheartedly agree - no matter what the prognosis is medically, treat your friend like a survivor. When my friends reacted like I was dying and wanted me to face that \"reality,\" I became so depressed and wanted to give up. I no longer talk to those unbelieving friends who have refused to give me any hope. And the people who hang their head in sorrow around me are annoying. Treat your BFF like she's just like you and be very positive. Be her rock. It may be slim, BUT there is a chance of her being cured. Believe in that chance and help her to keep going. I have a friend I can call and cry about feeling like it's the end. She remains strong and will correct me. I can pick myself back up and keep going strong.",

      "Content": "Just some examples from the WORD of God where Jesus addressed some people: Jesus answered them, Did I not choose you, the Twelve? And yet one of you is a devil (of the evil one and a false accuser). (John 6:70)  Note: Jesus was addressing one of his disciples whom He hung out with all the time. You are of your father, the devil, and it is your will to practice the lusts and gratify the desires which are characteristic of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a falsehood, he speaks what is natural to him, for he is a liar and the father of lies and of all that is false. (John 8:44) There are times in the WORD of God where Jesus says it like it is.  He didn't mince words.  He didn't prance around being Mr. Sunshine and everyone is okay because God is love.  He addressed the devil any time the devil was working through someone.  I know speaking of sin, of the devil, of God's just nature freaks out a lot of \"Christians\", but read your WORD and learn from Him.  Not just the lovey dovey scriptures - all of it. And, you can put down your stones now.  In your judgment of my words, you completely overlooked my post where I apologized and responded \"in love\" to Breast.  Breast has some issues that she is spilling out on cancer compass to intentionally attack others beliefs.  (I know.  I know.  We all have issues so I had no right to refer to hers. Sigh.) And, maybe you overlooked the part in the bible where Jesus chased people out of the temple with a whip and overturned tables.  There's a lot about Him we all tend to overlook because we want to see Him like we want to see Him instead of seeing Him as He is.  And, did you overlook the scriptures where John the Baptist called religious people a brood of vipers because they were coming to be baptisted by him?  Wow.  What a meanie.  He should have just told them how God loves them. And, Jesus rebuked his buddy, Peter, by saying; \"Get behind me satan.\" Now, I will take the rest of my time to edify the believers and encourage unbelievers to be free from condemnation through Christ Jesus.  The truth is, the Lord loves Breast very deeply, but she has no love for Him yet.  It is in Christ where you are free from condemnation.  It is when you genuinely walk in Christ that you are free. Romans 8: Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. 3 For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 5 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 6 For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace, 7 because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, for it is not even able to do so, 8 and those who are in the flesh cannot please God. I have been, even in tears, praying for Breast.  I care for her and I care about her eternity.  I'm not going to let her walk off a cliff just so I don't offend.  Her \"God crap\" comment and cutting down the person offering comfort in Christ was of the devil.  Plain and simple. Breast, I am diagnosed as terminal and you are as well.  The invitation is open to you to be free in Christ and live in eternity with Him.  He loves you and waits for you.  Turn it all over to Him.  Do not face death without knowing you will indeed spend eternity with Him. Please consider this.  Ask God if He is real.  He will show you.  Life here on earth has been tough, real tough; but it's in Christ where we can have peace and acceptance.",

The best thing I have done with great results was to clean up my diet.  I stopped eating processed foods, fast foods, soda, store-bought juices, etc.  I started juicing which is such a blessing.  Eat a lot of raw veggies, berries, seeds, nuts, no read meat or pork, small amount of organic chicken.  Drastically cut down carbs like breads and pastas (preferrably stop consuming them altogether).  I honestly think conventional treatment, especially Tamoxifen, screwed me up so I feel like I'm worse off and starting all over again in my fight.  And while I did conventional tx I cheated on my eating habits all the time because I believed the chemo would make up for my crappy eating.  Hmmm... Olive leaf extract is great for BC.  I just started taking it a day ago so time will tell.http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2013/jun2013_Unexpected-Benef I just started the Budwig protocol and after one whole week I'm feeling a ton better.  I plan on starting with Cellect as soon as it comes.  www.cellect.org Young Living Essential Oils are amazing!  I wish I would have found them at diagnosis time.  There has been scientific research proving sacred frankincense's efficacy against breast cancer.  It must be therapeutic grade, not store-bought oils.  They also have oils to help with emotions, sleep, anxiety, and much more. Another really, really good source for diet changes iswww.hacres.com .  Rev. Malcom beat his colon cancer.  There's a lot of great info on his website including testimonials of those with BC. From my experience and research, don't just throw a bunch of supplements at her that promise to \"cure\" cancer.  Some of it can actually make the cancer grow, especially if she has estrogen positive cancer. There is not a one-shot deal with a supplement.  It will take some time for her to detox her body and get it in balance.  It will take patience and time.  I highly recommend finding a naturopathic physician who works with women with breast cancer.  Make sure they have professional skills with working with breast cancer! Chiropractic care is a good idea too.  Maybe schedule a consult to see what a chiropractor has to offer. And.. I've heard of baking soda, but not impressed.  I'm not saying it's bad or doesn't work, but I just don't think it will help (but I thought the same about Budwig protocol and I'm doing that now!).  Have not heard of Fucoidan.  If you use wormwood, you should do it under a doctor's care only. Lord bless you on this challenging journey! Carrie",
