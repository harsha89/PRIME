    "Content": "Hi, I am 33 years old, In march of this year I found that my left breast got larger (right breast has always been the slightly larger one)and hangs a lot lower than the right all of sudden. When I returned from my business trip, my husband also said it didn't look normal at all. I had it checked then they said lets watch, no lumps or anything. Within the week I broke my ankle bad, was in the hospital 13 days and had 2 surgeries since. Put the breast issue off. Went and had it checked again because now my nipples aren't lined up at all, drastically different, no pain. Dr. felt 2 lumps.... There has been no trauma, no major weight gain or loss. Ultrasound was last week that day. Shows complicated masses. Dr. says wait six months. I am getting a second opinion and still have to wait 2 months because this Dr.'s report didn't show urgent concern. Anyone advice in getting checked sooner? ( in NY or PA?) Has anyone else experienced a major change in their breast prior to breast cancer? Anyone else have knowledge of complicated mass? Scared in NY.",
