      "Content": "hi Stephanie, this is my first time writing to this site. I was just diagnosed about 3 months, with recurrent breast cancer, it spread to my bones, neck, spine , ribs pelvis, lungs and a few other places. i too find that ibuprofin helps alot when i take it with loritab, nothing really takes the pain away altogether but it does take the edge off. they put me on herceptin and taxotere once a week so far.In 1999 i had a lumpectomy with none in lymphnodes, so i thought i was out of the woods, well i didnt know to much about bc then, anyway it came back like wildfire, they would not give me herceptin then because at that time it was new and not given to stage 1. anyway this whole thing has really got me down. they dont hold out much hope for me either. but it helps to read about other bc survivers who have made it past a few years. they're out there. so as ive been told by so many, there is hope. i will pray for u, god bless, Stephanie (im a steph. too)",
