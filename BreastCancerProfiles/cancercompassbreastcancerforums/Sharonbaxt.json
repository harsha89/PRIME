      "Content": "hi julia thank you for keeping me in your thoughts ,first chemo has gone ok so far ,im still in shock though about all this ,but im beginning to deal better .m have a body scan next week which im terrified of the results(ive never had a body scan up till now)wondering if its got to anywhere else. this is all such a rollercoaster of emotions, For all im dealing better ,i still sink into deep thoughts of disbelief and i do cry. had fun picking out a wig etc then got home upset that i needed one . my friends are so good ,i can talk to them but them i have some who say \"dont talk like that \" if i need to talk realistically about my future and what the outcome is gonna be ,i will be more positive once i come to terms with the fact my BC was caught so early without node involvemnet ,then all of a sudden ive liver mets .oh i am trying to be positive ,i have friends who think im so brave ,but underneath i dont feel brave at all, im as frightened as the next . Im having EC chemo and am still waiting to see if im a candidate for herceptin, until my scan and results about me being able to take herceptin i feel im hanging again ,hope you understand my feeling here ,but it does help to hear your story to , thhanks so much for the rely hugs sharon",

      "Content": "hi julia im sorry its been awhile since ive managed to post ,just had mt 4th chemo and im not to bad ,head is still all over the place but im coping . chemo has been copable ,had some bad days but im doing ok . saw my oncologist last week ,and she tells me my tumour markers are down from 1000mark to 400 ,still a long way to go but she think s im responding well to chemo . my her staus came back and im her2+ which means she can use herceptin ,but seeing as she thinks im responding so well to my chemo she ll hold back for a little while before im put on it . im terrified to let myself have false hope but things do seem to be slightly favourable according to my onc . so im plodding on trying to keep positive , i know its been awhile since i last posted but i think ive been on another planet for a couple of months , but hey im back now . anyway julia how are you doing ? lol sharon from uk liver mets x",

      "Content": "hi Julia S oh this is really something to take in isnt it ,im still in disbelief .my liver cancer wasnt caught by routine scaning ,i had breast cancer 3 years ago with a very good prognosis.so was only on yearly checks ups ,i felt unwell for quite a few months before i could pinpoint definate symptoms by time i got to the doctor it was fairly advanced and the news absoloutely devastated me ,saw my oncologist last week and she cautiosly confident chemo may shrink the tumours and get me into some sort of remission ,but of course no promises .so i begin chemo on thursday ,i havent give up hope but i cant put myself through false hope either ,if you understand what i mean .the news is still sinking in and im trying to be realistic . im assuming you are in the states ,where i believe there are more treatment options than here in the uk. i have good friends who are trying to help me through this ,but its so scarey for me .if youd like to email me --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
