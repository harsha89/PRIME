    "Content": "I stopped Arimidex without telling my ONC. because of my cognitive dysfunction.   It's been only been a year since I started on it.   My cancer is estrogen related and had not gone on any radiation or surgery.   I have been doing a lot of seraching for a better way to deal with this and I came across the Budwig Protocol.   The miracle of Cottage Cheese and Flaxseed Oil.  The testimonials I read from cured patients who tried this is mind-bloggling.   Read them at www.healingcancernaturally.com .   What I want to know are feedback for those that are on the Budwig Protocol without the Arimidex bec. with this protocol NO Drugs or Supplements should be taken.",
