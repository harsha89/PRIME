    "Content": "Hi I was the caregiver along with my Mother for my precious Dad who passed away in May 08 after an horrendous battle with stomach Cancer . Our stress levels, as many of you will know hit the roof many times. I am 44 years old and recently found a lump in my left breast, I have been to the specialist breast unit and they said they thought the lump was ok but wanted to do a fine needle aspiration .  I was told to return just to get the results.  When I got there I was told to undress from the waist up.  I thought it rather strange , so I asked what was wrong.  I was told I needed a core biopsy done under ultra sound.  What does this mean ?  Are they airing on the side of caution.  My friend who also had a lump had fine needle aspiration and was told that they would send her results in the post.   I know I shoudn't worry yet but I re live the day my Dad got told he had cancer over and over again. I need to get a grip on this situation so was just wondering if anyone else had experienced a similar situation.  I know they say 80 % of lumps end up being benign.  My lump is a moveable lump but quite big. Thanks for listening.   Gail  ",
