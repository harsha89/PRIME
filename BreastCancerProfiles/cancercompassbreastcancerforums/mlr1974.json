    "Content": "I s/o know how you feel.  I was terrified of the chemo.  So far I have completed two cycles(adriamycin and cytoxan combo) and it has not been anything like I imagined.  The doctors told me I would have nausea, fatigue and of course hair loss.  They said typically the nausea is comparable to the level experienced during your pregnancy.  For me that was good news because I did not experience severe nausea during my pregnancy and thankfully the nausea from the chemo has in fact been similar to the levels I had while pregnant.  The worst pain I experienced from the chemo process was the pain associated with the Neulasta shot you get the day after the chemo.  The pain comes about a week later and is like flu pain times 10.  Nobody warned me about this so I was totally freaking out but once I got some pain medicine I was able to sleep it off.  The doctor said the pain is from the rapid reproduction of the white blood cells and it only lasted a day and a half for me.  Good luck with everything.",
