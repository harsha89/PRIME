    "Content": "The \"cancer smell \" subject is interesting. I had colon cancer ( to be specific originating in my appendix ) My husband for years nagged me I should get my breath investigated but I felt it must just be stress, or maybe I had not been flossing enough, or maybe I drank too much milk ! and I guess i was always to embarrassed to discuss it with my doctor. Anyway since I had my surgery for the pelvic mass which turned out to be cancer the bad breath dissappeared completely. Just recently it reappeared and I mentioned it to my oncologist, she was pretty dismissal of it. However just this week research scientist in Isreal have come up with a study showing that nano particles in breath odour useful for diagnoising cancer ! so odour is definitely significant.",
