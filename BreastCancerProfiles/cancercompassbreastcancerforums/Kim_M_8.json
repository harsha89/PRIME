      "Content": "My mother began taking tamoxophin in Septeber, 1999; she was asked to participate in a study following the death of her twin sister and took the drug for 5 years. She died of endometrial cancer on December 4, 2008 (only 11 weeks after my father died of lung cancer) most likely caused by taking the tamoxophin for that length of time. Has your mother had a hysterectomy? If not, I would definitely do more research before taking this drug.

She has recently been experiencing bouts of diarrea almost on a daily basis. The diarrea occurs after breakfast while she is doing grocery shopping or errands. Is this typical or expected? What can be done to alleviate her distressing condition?  ",
