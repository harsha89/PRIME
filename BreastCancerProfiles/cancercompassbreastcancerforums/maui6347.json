    "Content": "I'm 5 weeks out of a double mastectomy (ILC-Stage2 with lymph involvement), 4 days from starting chemo and I found out tonight that my mother's breast cancer has reappeared in her liver and lungs.  (She's 6 months shy of being a 5 year survivor.) When I signed up for this site, there wasn't an option other than \"I have cancer\" or \"My parent has cancer.\"  But that's what we're facing here.  Two women with breast cancer at the same time, back to back generations.  I am 40, my Mom is 67. I can't get my head around this, other than to realize that my mother's life span is now encapsulated into a much more limited amount of time than we thought a week ago. I'm looking for help.  Any help.  Good doctors,  Homeopathic choices.  Anything.  Anything to help lift my loved ones out of the deep deep despair we are all feeling.        ",
