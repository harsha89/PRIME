    "Content": "You have to do what seems right you, making the best choice you can with the information you have. All of the information I have read, and the information posted by the people on this site, suggest that aside from the \"sunburn\" and \"weeping skin\" the worst of of the side effects is progressively worse tiredness, but even that isn't always the case.  My \"best friend\" did 5 1/2 weeks of daily radiation for stage IV rectal cancer.  He did 6 months of FOLFOX (it's an every other week infusion) first, then rested up, then surgery, then radiation.  He just got his ileostomy reversed.  In three weeks we find out what the next step will be.  His radiation was to a part of the body where \"the sun don't usually shine\" and he is extremely pale complected to boot, and yet he hardly even turned red. Your doctor has told you that you'll be doing radiation first.  Everyone reacts differently to every treatment, and not all people experience the same side effects, so right now it's just IMPOSSIBLE to predict how you might feel during and after treatment.   ",
