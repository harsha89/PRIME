I have mets to lung and medistinal lymp.nodes(they surround the lungs) and also up in my neck area..it was found solely by accident when I had surgery last summer on my elbow..a routine chest xray discovered a nodule which led to a biopsy and which led to the mets findings..my orig. br. ca. fight began in 01, with just a tiny 1.6 cent. tumor..surgically removed then and followed up with chemo&radiation..I was axillary node neg. hormone neg. but overexpressed on her 2..a local recurrence is what I watched for..well it snuck up on me like a sneaky monster..never had an inkling that I had anything going on in my body except for a cough that just wouldnt go away.. My onco dr. just didnt believe that it was my br. cancer that had come back, he said it shouldnt have taken it 6 years to do so since it was an aggressive kind of stuff..but it did..it didnt follow any of the normal protocal for recurring without notice..it was not a textbook case at all..so cancer is differant in everyone..we are as unique as the cancer that invades our bodies.. I had my last of a 4cycle of chemo today..hopefully..I will have a petscan on the 5th of Feb. and then see the dr. on the 13th for results..if cancer is gone, no more chemo for now..if it is still actively getting around in my body and causing trouble then more chemo..(yuk!)  My heart goes out to you.  Yes if it is mets then yes it is more serious, but if they get mine under control then they should be able to for you as well.  I was a sceptic at first..didnt think the treatments would be able to help me..but something has caused my coughing to cease, and the tumor in my lung has disappeared..so now i can say good things about the avastin and taxotere that my dr. put me on..and it was a low doseage, and I havent been all that sickly..just bouts of things here and there that were very manageable..  SO, cheer up, and I pray for good news when you get your scans...but if the news isnt good, then know that there is medicine that will calm your feers..mets carries a high mortality rate, but hopefully if it responds to treatment it can be controlled for a while before things get really bad..our bodies can take alot before they finally say enough..I am a firm believer in that now.. take care..God's Blessings your way..with lots of prayers too!
