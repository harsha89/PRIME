    "Content": "Hello everyone. I'm a new member here and I'm hoping someone out there can give me some hope and inspiration during this time. My 75 y/o mother was just diagnosed with IDC just yesterday and we're all just dealing with so many emotions! But fear is number 1. We're scared that my woderful, loving mother won't make it through the surgery. We're praying to God to give her the strength to fight this horrible disease. If there's anyone out there that had /has this and would like to offer some advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you and may God Bless you and your families, Maria",
