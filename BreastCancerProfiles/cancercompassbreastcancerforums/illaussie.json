      "Content": "How long have you been on the Letrozole?  I started it 6 weeks ago & the only side effect I've really had is lots of aches & pains, particularly in my hands.   My onc has just changed me to exemestane to see if it lessens them. Not everyone gets every side effect (thank GOD) but I HAD been warned of hair thinning with Letrozole - not necessarily falling out - and i don't think that had started on me, tho only on it for a short time before the change. Were you post menopausal when you started Letrozole?  I was, so the hot flashes didn't affect me at all - it is 10 years since i went thru menopause & I had 10 years of hot flashes, depression and most other 'common' side effects from age 45.  :(    A real pain!!  Thank GOD I've been fine for the last 10 years, til diagnosed with BC in Jan this year.",

      "Content": "I am sorry you are still itching 6 months after finishing chemo - my husband's itch basically stopped pretty quickly after going off the Xeloda. In Australia, the red rash & itching is always associated with Xeloda & patients are warned of it before they go onto it. If the rash/itch is too bad the patient can be taken off the Xeloda for a while, to let it subside. We asked for this, but the oncologist was keen that he see the whole cycle thru uninterrupted. He would exercise by way of stretching (40 mins a session) and when he felt well enough went for a walk or small jog - but that was earlier - after the surgery & before the rash really took a hold.  The rash was exacerbated by contact with the sun - almost blistering immediately, so he was completely covered with gloves & long sleeved shirts & long trousers & big hat when he had to go outside for appointments etc.  He was on Xeloda for Stomach Cancer & was one of the first to have it approved, as previously, it was used more, as you say, on breast or colon cancer.  It is 12 months since he finished chemo & is back competing in triathlons again, hoping to compete in the World Championships next year.  He was competing within 4 months of completion of the chemo! In my husband's case, the itching was nothing to do with his diagnosis of cancer - it was NOT evident prior to going onto chemo and is well documented here in medical circles that Xeloda in particular causes the condition. I hope that the itching stops for you soon ,  Whippleschmiple and hope that you continue in good health illaussie",

      "Content": "Hi Marty Sorry to hear of the Itch Syndrome - my husband had it whilst undergoing chemo for stomach cancer, following  the removal of most of his stomach.  It was the Chemo treatment (Xeloda in particular) that contributed to the itch. The best results for him was using Cornflour (if you are in the USA it may be called 'Maizeflour') a 'non wheat' flour that is used in cooking in stead of plain wheat flour.  He would rub it over all the affected areas (pretty well his whole body.)  He stood in the shower recess, so that it was easier to wash away the left over cornfour & it also didn't make as much overall 'mess'.  Cornflour is much finer (almost slippery to the touch) and is used universally in chinese cooking.  In the past it has also been used as an alternative 'powder' for baby nappy rash!  In Australia, we can actually purchase it in the supermarket, in the Baby Powder section! My husband found that he itched MORE at night & had to use the cornflour every hour or two, less often during the day, but more so throughout the night! Assuming you can find some, it would be easier to apply if it were actually put INTO an empty powder shaker.  It has helped many people control the itch.  It is 100% pure and has no additives. Sometimes, the cornflour wasn't as useful, so he would alternate treatment & use a moisturiser called 'dimethicreme' that was available from the pharmacy. Good luck & I hope your recovery is a complete success. illaussie",
