      "Content": "Hi there,  I had bilateral mastectomies a couple of years ago.  I also did chemo but not radiation and was ER- so didn't take any other meds.  I found that my libido disappeared, too. It is really hard to move on with life \"normally\" (whatever normal is, wink) when still experiencing side effects of cancer treatments.  Talk to your OB-gyn to find out if there are options that could help you.  That's what I did.  I'm still trying to see what helps best, but there are some possible things you could do.  All the best to you and hang in there!  ",

      "Content": "I agree with you 100% that it is not really terribly concerning that more women are choosing bilateral mastectomies. I was diagnosed with BC at the age of 32, while 7 months pregnant, later to learn that I also carried the BRCA 1 mutation.  I opted to have both breasts removed at the same time and have never once looked back and second-guessed my decision.  Both breasts are gone, but I am alive and well (knock on wood).  Perhaps some men (not all) can't imagine a woman living a full life breast-free, but if someone told them that removing only one testicle might be enough, but no one could be sure, we might hear of a whole lot of men choosing to have both removed! When it comes to life or death, there is no shame in erring on the side of cation! Who knows if my other breast would ever have been infected, or if my decision has improved my life expectancy, but I am living proof that it was the right decision for me, as I am very happy and loving my life, breast and cancer free now for 2.5 years!  All the best to all women and support for all decisions...we know what is best for ourselves!",

      "Content": "Hello there, I am glad you asked your questions here. I think this is the perfect place for all of us to \"go there\" and aks the questions only we all can relate to.  I don't know anyone else in my age group who can relate to what I have been through, so yes, ask away here and don't be shy to get personal. We are all on the same team! I will let you know my situation and can only speak for me, but I am married and have 2 little girls. When I had bilateral mastectomies my husband was extremely supportive, thankfully, and made it as easy as is possible under the circumstances. I'd be lying, though, if I said it was all easy and no problem at all.  I have no breasts, which is weird for anyone, myself included, much less for my husband to wrap his head around! One thing that really helped us, as far as getting used to the \"new me\", was for me to be very open right from the start, letting him see how I looked, not hiding my scars,etc. I figured that the longer I kept him from seeing me the harder it would be when inevitably he would see me naked. I let us both get used to seeing me together, and we talked openly about how weird it was and how we never imagined us going down this path! Personally I have moments still of really feeling sorry for myself, especially when I see beautiful women with lovely breasts. I grieve my loss and the loss for my husband. I wish it had not come to this, but then after allowing myself a bit of a pity party, I suck it up and remember how lucky I am to be alive and with my family. I think finding balance between accepting the loss and also learning to accept the new me has taken time and really will likely be ongoing.   Some days are better than others. I waited 3 years to finally go and get fitted for breast prostheses, which was just a personal choice.  Now that I have them, I am so glad I do! I feel beautiful in them and don't think anyone out there can tell the difference! I feel like they allow me to wear prettier shirts and they do restore a sence of femininity that I hadn't really realized I'd lost.   They feel really real and you wouldn't believe how many people have asked to touch them just to see how they feel (only my friends and family, of course, not strangers at the bus stop, wink) and no one can believe how real they look and feel.  I am content with them and admit to loving having the option to take them off or just not wear them whenever I feel like just \"being natural\".   The funniest thing is that my little girls, aged 3 and 6, LOVE to wash my \"boobies\" for me when they take their bath each night! Each girl gets one to wash and play with, gently as the are not cheap!, and then I dry them and tuck them away till next time I want to wear them! | think it has helped my girls to see me being comfortable with them and that I have not hidden this experience from them at all.  I really want them to grow up seeing that I am comfortable with my body and to learn that we are pretty no matter what our body type, etc.  Does any of this help? I sure hope so! If  nothing else, you'll see it's okay to be open and personal about this issue withme, so please write anytime!  All the best to you. Mar.",

      "Content": "Hi there, Just wanted to respond to your message.  I had bilateral mastectomies a few years ago and opted, like you, for the flat look.  I only recently got fitted for breast prostheses, to wear in my sister's wedding, but rarely wear them in my daily life.  I have found that I have become increasingly comfortable with the flat look. At first I was always aware/self-conscious about it but eventually just got used to it and often forget about it completely, which is freeing!  I love not dealing with bras, and I wear any shirt/top that I feel good in.  I started off always wearing baggy shirts, but now will wear tanks, summer shirts, bathing suits, anything!    I wish you all the best! You are a strong woman!  Take care. Pinkribbonmar.",
