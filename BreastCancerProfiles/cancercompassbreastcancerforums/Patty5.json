    "Content": "Hi Kmabecca,                   I am on this message board because of my mother. She has cancer. It runs in my family, both sides. I have been in your shoes before. I was even sent for a biopsy. But when I went for the biopsy they discovered it was a water filled cyst. At that same time my mother had breast cancer. She beat the breast cancer. It was caught early. She now has cancer of the esophagus in stage 3. I just wanted you to know they scare the crap out of you with the letters in the mail but most of the time it is not cancer. Sometimes they just need a better picture. Good luck and please let us know how it turns out. Pat ",
