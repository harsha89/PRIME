    "Content": "I had Breast Cancer in 1995 which resulted in a partial mastectomy followed by 24 radiation treatments. Just had a mammogram that shows irregularities in lymph nodes under each arm. Dr. says that I should have another \"mammo\" in 6 mos. \"to keep an eye\" on any changes. He says that my mammogram 1 yr. ago showed abnormality. The spots he is watching are on the chest wall. Is this a normal course of \"treatment\"?",
