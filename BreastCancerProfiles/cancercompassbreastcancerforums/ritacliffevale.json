    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April last year. I had a lumpectomy and a lot of lymph nodes removed. The cancer had spread to one lymph node.I had eight months chemo followed by 15 radium treatments. Apart from an abcess on the operation site, I managed the treatment quite well. (Even the cold cap which I found very painful, but I kept my hair.) My problem now is the awful pain in my joints due to the Arimadex.I know there are a lot of people out there with this problem, but I am finding it hard to cope. I have tried various methods of pain control without success, and at present am on a high dose of slow release Tramadol, but it makes little difference. I wonder if anyone has tried either acupuncture or hypnosis for alleviating pain.",
