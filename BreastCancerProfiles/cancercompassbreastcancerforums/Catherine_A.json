    "Content": "I have recently 7/02 been diagnosed with Mets to the bone upon having surgery for a recurrence. Since finding the bone mets my oncologist has me on a pomidrinate (Aredia) and Tamoxifen. I am very unsure of this since there was also some small lesions in my lung and liver. Has anyone had good luck with this type of therapy? Or should i request that she switch me to our original plan of action, Taxotere with Tamoxifen to follow?? Any info will be helpful. Thanks!",
