      "Content": "I have been recently diagnosed, stage 3 with early diagnosis, aggressive and resistant to chemo. luckily- my nodes are clear but my Dr. is recommeding a mastectomy, she doesnt think radiation is going to help. She has gone in twice in 7 days, only to find more cancer. My sister in law thinks SO many procedures are unwarreneted and thinks I should get a 2nd opinion. I am concerned that waiting might allow this to spread even more. Any thoughts, please?",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy and tram flap recontstruction on June 19th. On July 23, I showed my plastic surgeon that my belly was distended, red and warm to the touch, so much that my skin was peeling. One month later of antibiotics, cultures show no infection. I had a drain in on a  Monday, by Thursday, it had failed, (the drain lead was too small and became clogged). The next day, Friday, my surgeon put a new drain in, the following Monday it failed and fell out. It had been draining over 60 cc's of fluid in a 24 hour time period.  Now my belly is full of fluid again, and I have some red spots back, but now I have pain along with it. Has anyone else experienced this? Any comments, help, suggestions? I am going back to see him  again this coming Tuesday, Sept. 2nd, and I would really like an answer. He said it is \"wierd, he has never seen anything like this before\"....   Betty",
