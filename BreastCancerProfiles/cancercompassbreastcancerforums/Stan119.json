    "Content": "For anyone interested in alternative medicines, do some research on mangosteen juice. It is a juice from Thailand that has wonderful antioxidant properties as well as cancer fighting qualities. Do not take my word on it...check out the American Cancer Society website and do a search for mangosteen. There are also articles about the qualities of mangosteen on the government site www.pubmed.gov (it is a little harder to understand, but usually toward the end of the article there will be some plain english). Also, there are plenty of testimonials on the web. Simply do a search on google or your favorite search engine for mangosteen and your specific condition. Hope this info is of use to someone. God Bless and good luck!!",
