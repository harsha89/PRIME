    "Content": "Hi, just started taking both 2 months ago, in soooo much pain in legs & feet, it is so hard to get out of bed in morning but once I get going it's okay. Doctor says this is a very common side effect from Arimidex, not sure of side effects from Zolidex. I, too, will have ovaries removed but developed a blood clot in lung and on Coumadin and have to wait for surgery.",
