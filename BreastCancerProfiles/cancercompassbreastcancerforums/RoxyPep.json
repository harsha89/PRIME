    "Content": "I believe it is caused by the Aromasin.  I am a breast cancer survivor, I was diagnosed April the 8th 2009 the day before my birthday.  Some birthday present huh?  I went through a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction.  I have taken about all of the cancer meds.  Femara, Aromasin, Anastrozole and Arimidex.  The only thing I haven't taken is Tamoxifen and I doubt I will even try that after reading the side effects sheet on it.  All these medications give me severe joint pain and swelling.  I'm just tired of feeling like I'm 90 when I'm only 50 years old. ",
