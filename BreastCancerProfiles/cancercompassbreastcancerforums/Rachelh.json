    "Content": "Hi, I am a one year post chemo, post radiation of stage 1 breast cancer. I hear you sister! My marraige was so bad and I was so depressed that I deliberately didn't get mammograms for 4 years because I thought if I died it would be the only way out. I never complained, and made up stories about my husband so my kids would think he was wonderful. After he moved out (after I found out about his long term girlfriend) I realised I needed to take care of myself and that is when I was diagnosed. In my journey there were two things that I know to be true. 1. Don't stay in a relationship that brings you down. There are no rewards at the end for sticking it out. 2. Ask for help. Again, there are no bonus points for trying to do it all by yourself. Let people help you.Ask for help! Take care of yourself. love, Rachel  ",
