    "Content": "About a month ago, my mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer.When I found out I was so scared. I am only 13. No one in my family has ever had Cancer before. I have talked to my parents about it and I have already told all my friends. I want to talk to someone about it though. I want to talk to my friends about it but I'm scared that I will annoy them. Also, how can I best relieve my mom of stress? I am too scared to ask her to do anything for me. Thank you all so much and please reply.Â ",
