      "Content": "Tracey, In this day and age, there are so many milestones which have been taken to battle breast cancer, as compared to when my mother first discovered hers some 19 years ago. She has had many good years, cancer free, and several set backs along the way which she continues to deal with. Keep the faith, follow thru with your treatments, be completely confident with your medical team, and if not, get a second opinion from other specialists in your area, and DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. With good medical care, and a positive attitude as difficult as it may be at times, you are going to live many years to come, and with a good quality of life. Best wishes, Christine",

      "Content": "My Mom also has stage 4.....met to the bones, and most recently to the brain. She has recently completed a round of Tomotherapy (radiation) which has completely knocked her out, hair loss as well, but I am optimistic that after she recovers from the effects of the treatment, she will get back on her feet. One of the advantages to Tomotherapy is that if necessary further down the road, the same area can be re-treated again. Explore all possibilities with your medical team, and find the strength and willpower to go forward. Don't lose hope. Best Wishes. Christine ",

      "Content": "Dear Maui, So sorry to hear about you and your Mom, and Tre has given you alot of good advice and encouragement. My Mom is 69, was diagnosed 18 years ago with breast cancer, dbl mastectomy and radiation, and after many years, the cancer reappeared as a drop cell, then metasticized to the bones and currently to several spots on the brain. She has recently completed a round of Tomotherapy, and although she is pretty down from the treatment, I am optimistic that she will again bounce back into a state of remission. Consider all possibilities for your treatments, be confident with your medicle team, and keep fighting. Everyone is different, and at times, the cancers reappear, and then again go back into remission. Every day there are more advances being made with the genetic studies and methods to treat and hopefully one day cure breast cancer. Don't loose hope for you or your Mom,... you have each other to lean on and to fight together. Get as much information as you can and make what you believe the be the right educated decisions with regard to your treatments and care. Best Wishes and don't give up, you or your Mom. Christine",
