    "Content": "My Doctor felt a ridge feeling on my left breast beside my nipple and suggested that I have a mammogram, since I was long over due for one, (46 years old) and it had been 10 years. Friday they did the mammogram and stated I might need to come back for a diagnostic exam and today they called and want me in tomorrow morning. Problem is, I have a very serious medical problem going on right now that has me already so stressed that this has just knocked me to my knees today. I have had 3 cerebral aneureyms surgeries and currently have a intercranial left carotid artery disection going on that can't be operated on because of the location. I am scheduled for an arteriagram next Wednesday to check the status of it. Now WHAM!!! How serious it is when they say \"we found a small nodule and need to do a sonogram\". My family history is Great-grandmother (mom's side), grandmother (mom's mom)Â and cousin on my moms side all have had breast cancer, good news is only my cousin lost her battle with cancer. My grandmother passed away right after her second bout with it, but she also had heart problems and was 79 years old. She was a fighter all the way!!! I have been through 3 brain surgeries (had my had shaved and all) and was never as scared as this, here I am waiting to find out if this stupid disection in my brain is healing on its own and then God throws this at me. WOW! Should I be this scared or am I just overeacting because of everything else that is going on? Are they common, are they usually benign? I know I am really ranting right now, my husband is the only one who knows about this, could not bring myself to add anymore stress on my kids and my mom until I know more. And support would be greatly appreciated right now. I know God never puts more on your shoulders than you can bear, but my shoulders are getting slumped about now. Gin",
