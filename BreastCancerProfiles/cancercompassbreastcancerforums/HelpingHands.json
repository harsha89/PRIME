    "Content": "I have experienced the loathing for what my body used to look like before I had to deal with breast cancer. My dreams of sustaining my body aesthically got replaced with desperate and drastic measures to maintain my body for survival. I am extremely thankful I survived and the cancer and it is out of my body, but, I felt resentment because the aftermath left my figure permanently affected. I tried many prosthetics and nothing fit right. I went to a company super gel products and they made me a specialty enhancer that aligned my figure and they had patience with me when determining how the back of the prosthetic shapes up to my body. It's easier to feel like the breast cancer is somthing that was here and gone when I wear a proper custom prosthetic. If somone were going through a similar situation, I would recommend they try super gel products because they were relatively inexspensive, understanding, and worked with me, plus you can actually trim them with scissors because they are bagless. They could also make the back concave to perfectly fit to your body. I hope this helps sombody, and thank you to everyone else participating to inform and bring troopers together and share.",
