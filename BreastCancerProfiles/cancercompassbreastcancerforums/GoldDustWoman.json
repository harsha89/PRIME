I've been telling my husband for years that too much sugar and processed grains (in other words, carbs) are killing us.  Much love to all ~ Gold Dust Woman http://www.drweilblog.com/home/2012/1/26/starch-and-breast-c",

      "Content": "I am not surprised you are so tired you can't wake up to an alarm.  I think the body responds with exhaustion and a need for sleep in response to extreme stress.  You know, I read a book about Iwo Jima and how as they were approaching in the first landing boats, some of the soldiers who were told of the bloodshed and danger they'd face, fell asleep.  The author wrote about how crazy it was to him that in this time of extreme fear and stress, some men were sleeping and had difficulting waking.  That's much more extreme I know, but honestly, it sounds like your body is doing the same thing.  I too experienced intense stress while caring for my husband.  I posted it on the Caregivers Message Board - it's called \"Stress for the Caregiver\".  Pull it up and maybe there's something there that would help you.  If nothing else, I hope it helps to know that what you are feeling is normal and you are not alone.   Here's the link for that post: http://www.cancercompass.com/message-board/message/all,55479  ",
