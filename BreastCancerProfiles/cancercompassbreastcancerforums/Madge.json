My stomach seems to have grown and not sure why except that i have not been walking a lot and sitting. The doctors told me once that people confined to wheelchairs or low mobility often have their bodies morph to different shapes due to this. I do not feel bloated though. So just wondering what to watch for here. thanks",

      "Content": "Hi. This is my first time writing. I need some advice so i can talk more intelligently with my oncologist. Br tumor that never grew there but went to spine. After lumpectomy and spine radiation i was put on femara. My mets have been stable for 2 yrs time but the tumor came back in the breast. Had a modified radical at thanksgiving and doing well for an 83.5 person. Doc was originally going to keep me on femara because all the bone mets are stable and no tumors in any other organs. He was pleased. BUt his colleagues suggested a switch to Aromasin thinking femara must have stopped working. I am trying to find clinical data to see if aromasin works after femara or if i should just stay on femara. Any suggestions of where i should look or what to ask my doc would be helpful. Still full of spirit and fight. Have been in a nursing/rehab home for 2 years and hope to go home next month. Thanks to anyone for your thoughts.",
