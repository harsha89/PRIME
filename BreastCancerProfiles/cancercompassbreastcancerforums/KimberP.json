      "Content": "wow..I read your message and got so choked up. I have invasive ductal carcinoma also, (stage 3) and I remember so very well that morning as I tried to look at myself with staples running across the left side of my chest where my breast used to be. I counted them...there were 26.  My partner helped me unwrap my chest and I stood there facing the mirror, not looking up at my reflection, hearing her say over and over in my ear, \" baby you are ALIVE. You are Alive and I love you, don't be afraid to look\"....I let her hold me for a few minutes more, being more scared than I've ever been in my life at that point. I turned around and I gasped, I choked, I cried.....she cried....but we both found in that moment that strength we needed to fight this ugly disease. I wrote a poem about it...and I'd love to share it with all of you.... The Mirror I'm watching a woman from behind a door She has no idea I'm there. Stepping out of her shower a towel goes around her, Her hand smooths her newly grown hair. I look at her body as she begins to dry off The scars tell a story of pain. She rubs in the lotion in a soft, fluid motion Her tears start to fall like rain. She touches the scar across her chest The place where a breast used to be. I catch my breath and wonder how close to death I realize she looks just like me. She begins to get dressed and put makeup on A smile goes across her face, \"One battle down, and I'm still around!\" I'm in awe of her beauty and grace. One more look in the mirror for her I step out and ask her name. She smiles and says \"look, can't you see?\"  You and I are one and the same. ~~ Kimberly Pratt 12/2/02  Zanesville, Ohio God bless us, every one........",
