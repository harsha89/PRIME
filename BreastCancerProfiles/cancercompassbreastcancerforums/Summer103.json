      "Content": "after reading your replies I have decided it is probably better I take the Arimidex. I go to a new oncologist in Dec. Maybe I will feel better by all this with a new dr. My current dr did nothing to encourage me. This whole experience has been quite an eye-opener for me. I was so upset after my last visit that I was really dreading the next visit. This new dr came highly recommended by 2 people who are currently his patients. Thanks for your input.",

      "Content": "I don't want to take these drugs and would like to know how many of you are refusing to take them. My thoughts are that they are altering the natural way our bodies work. I was stage 1, very small tumor, lobular, no nodes, and did radiation. Maybe I am flirting with danger, but am really afraid to put these drugs into my body. Anyone out there doing what I am doing?",
