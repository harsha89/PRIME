      "Content": "Hello ISantana I reciently finished my 6 quimios and still with that concern... I went to a few oncologyst here in my country (Ecuador) and all they said I should take that hormotherapy treatment (so far I dont know if is tamoxifen)... but honestly I dont feel that secure that will decrease a big chance of reapareance the cancer. Talking about your family ovarian cancer, for you can be sure if you have a high riskÂ  (or you are guessing)theres an exam you can take (it is expensive but woth it i think) the genetic test, with that you have the real information of haveing cancer genetic inherited. Im totally disagree to take a pill which in a future can damage my other organs.. :( but so far still like you searching for a light in this topic. Good luck for you too and if you have any new or if you decided to take it, please tell me the symtoms you feel God bless you Irma",
