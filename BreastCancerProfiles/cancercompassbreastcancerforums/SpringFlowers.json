No, milk, sugar, best to stay on a natural foods diet.  Cancer is due to PH negativity in the body, keep your body PH at 6 or above and cancer cannot live or thrive in an oxygenated enviornment.  I have done much research in the 6 yrs since being DX'd.  I've found most oncologists are in the dark explaining what cancer is, why it thrives and how to get it out.  I was told I would not see 2012, and I needed to consider putting my affairs in order and visiting friends and family....otherwords, go plan my funeral.  If i'd listened to oncologists, I would be in the ground.  When first dx'dw/DCIS,pr/er positive told I need mastectomy, chemo/radiation/reconstruction, the routine...well, i'm not one for body mutiliation, so I did research, found an oncologist/breast surgeon in NewYork who has been doing Laser Surgery.  Has been named doctor of the year twice in NY State, results show a better outcome with hardly any recurrence of cancer vs. standard surgical removal.  Also, less chance of cancer cells escaping into the body and reestablishing new territory.  As for the cause, I had genetic testing, long interviews...I'd had lyme disease, then ChronicFatigue Syndrome, then debilitating arthritis, which I still have, but it is INFLAMMATION that causes most diseases, heart disease, and I believe also cancer.    I wish you all the best, but do stay focused on YOU, do the research, learn all you can - Read:  Genocide -The Cancer Coverup/Kathleen Deoul, If I can help further, please buzz in.  God Bless....( LaserBreastCancerSurgery.com )I immediately called and went....no paid, no cutting, no body mutiliation, I kept my breast, removed the tumor, got clear margins, got  up off the table after surgery, went to dinner that night, flew  home 3 days later.   My reports had stated I was already Stage 4 - thanks to a misread mammogram that missed the tumor, so why would I believe more garbage from oncolgoist????  I saw my scans, read the reports.  I had 8 -9mm tumors in my lungs,liver, all soft tissue, plus invasion in my spine, pelvis, ribs.  I opted for natural, within 3 months I had rid my body of all soft tissue tumors and pronounced secondary remission, I still had invasion in my spine and pelvis, but the ribs invasion was gone.  I then opten for CSCI, I've had reduction with this remedy, but will have to go through it again, still, it beats the misery of medical hacking.  Yes, i'm a bit snarky, but it was the brilliant medical world not paying attention that caused this misery, then they want to further inflict more misery.  Cancer is all about the money...many of us on this site have learned that secret.  I'd advise you google Mina Bissell/TED--she is a top cancer researcher, then go to Ben Goodacre, listen intently, learn what cancer really is and how to beat it.  It can be done.  I am now healthy, no fatigue, no health issues, my tumor markers are all normal, all stats/bloodwork are normal.  Onco's said it couldn't be done without chemo -  But, they don't tell you chemo kills more people than the actual cancer.  Causes heart attacks, host of problems, radiation causes the heart muscles to harden and leads to heart failure.  Keeping the body PH in check is the secret.  I got all my soft tissue void of tumors using the Kelmun Protocol and also the Aspargus puree - which is same ingredients in Indole 3/Carbinol, which you should be taking, along with other cancer fighers, keep your immune system in good working order and it will do more to cure the cancer than anything any onco can offer.  They know it, but who wants to give up a million or more to keep the cancer industy going than admit there are other ways to health without the miserable side effects.  I still have cancer, but it is completely under control and I will not let it rule my life, my onco is amazed, asks me what i've done, I know that research and learning everything possible is the key, not following protocol that brings in the big bucks.  You have to be determined and learn everything there is about the enemy, and you can win.  I have and I will continue to do so. ",

Calcium,Selenium, Iodine, Ascorobic Acid.   These alll got my tumormarkers in normal range, and the cesium is eradicating the bone mets.  Something doctors could not do.   I was told i'd be gone as of last Nov/2011 - here I am a year later, all bloodwork perfect, vitals, etc, TM's normal and doctors know it is only due to MY own alternative sources.  They know they let people die, but they make sure they drain every available penney before they give up.  I always wonder how these \"people of bought industry\" atone for these sins; do they not believe in a judgement day?   Do they not feel they will have to face those souls they allowed to die because of selling their own soul to pharmaceutical protocol, the AMA, FDA, Big Cancer Industries?   Yes, I go to doctors, I take meds, but very cautiously.  I am fortunate to have a GP who also believes alternatives are necessary, we're old enough to remember when doctors were \"real\" doctors, had the best concern for their patients and would do anything--including house calls and showing up at ER if you called.  Today, seems  all they do is diagnose, sometimes in error, look on the slide chart, match colors to \"Disease, then match coordinating color to Cure\" and standard procedure-surgery, chemo,radiation, meds, etc.  Most oncologists don't even do a chemo sensitivity test,  most times chemo doesn't even show signs of helping, but hey, at anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000 a pop, that's what you'll be prescribed.   ALSO- Don't let anyone talk you into a Clinical Trial.  Oncologists get BIG $$ from signing patients, average $5,000 a patient - geez, WE should be getting the $$, we're the guinea pig!  I would never submit, no idea what's in those new drugs!   Yep, it's all about the money.   Ii appreciate CTCA providing this site, but if you are on Medicare only, try becoming a patient.  I am medicare w/PPO Insurance and they won't take me as a patient, they only want to bill the big bucks to insurance....and, they say it's not about the money?   Well, what is it about - it's surely not about helping the cancer victim.  So, at least we are the enlightened ones, we know we have to take control of our future if we are going to have one.  Stay strong, love hearing from you and others that really are in search of the truth and found, sadly, we aren't getting it from our doctors or the medical world.",

My tumor markers dropped like a brick from the nutrients I took, now 2 are below normal, the CA-25-27 is 50, only 10 pts over normal.  I went on cesium chloride to get this gunk out of my bones and it is working, nothing in my ribs, pelvis is clearing as is the spine invasion.  Sadly, it's all about the money and following protocol set by pharmacy co's to keep the big money rolling in.  My oncologist actually got angry when I told him I was going alternative, but he wasn't doing anything to save me.  It is disgusting.  Read-Genocide, the CancerCureCoverup/KathleenDeoul.  IT's sickening how we are being left to fend for ourselves, at least those of us who aren't robots that listen to these brainwashed oncologists.  We can cure ourselves, I had the laser which cleaned out my chest wall and zapped any cancer that could be detected.  If you read Mina Bissell at TED conference, she is a top cancer researcher, they now know it is the immune system that will cure cancer, chemo causes more cancer than it cures...as with Robin Roberts.  We have to find the truth, it's so unfair your sister died so young.  I am 68, very active and by golly, I'll be here for a long time, otherwise I am very healthy, i've never had a bad bloodwork/vitals, there is no excuse for your sister to die with Stage 2, someone didn't give her the proper care.  God Bless, stay well and safe.",

      "Content": "Alady - If you have breast cancer your best bet is LaserBreastCancerSurgery.com    I, and few others on site have gone and had the procedure.  It is painless, bloodless, and most times you don't lose your breast, I have mine, slight indent where the tumor was, but same bras as before.  No trauma, wake up and walk off the op table, go to dinner that evening, it's amazing - AND - gives a better cure than traditional slice/dice mastectomy.   I have had no chemo or radiation, opted for natural- DIET is #1, get  your PH to 7 or above, cancer cells cannot live in alkaline enviornment.  DIM/Indole3/Carbinol, Tumeric/Curcumin, Fucoidan, Shitake/Reishi,MaitakeMushroom,  several others...Get your tumormarkers and your Stage and from there go to CancerTutor.com , read up on best protocol.  I am/was -who knows, doc's are stumped, but dx'd at Stg4.  Since there is no Stage5, guess you know what that means, but now no tumors anywhere in my body soft tissue, had lungs, liver, thyroid, ribs, spine and pelvis, now only spine and pelvis light up, but as of last scan, they are diminishing...so thanks to CesiumChloride to get inside the bone it is working.  Doc's roll their eyes, pharmacy co's threaten to have you executed and on and on....but, no one is trying to save you once you hit Stage 4, you aren't a good viable source of income and they just want you to disappear. Think it's horrid here we can't use many of the european standards, the Laser is used in Israel and Italy and other countries, but poo'd here as too cheap and easy, can't makek the avg costof $150,000 for the procedure.   I dropped all hormones, they aren't beneficial, but you might need Effexor to halt your hotties if a problem.   CesiumChloride is a bit like MMS, it's not too hard a protocol to follow, sure beats chemo any day, no hideous side effects at all.   I just cannot understand the refusal of so called mainstream medicine to constantly throw aside remedies that have been proven to work and allow the bodies to pile up without even giving these cures a chance.  All I know is I'd hate to be the one facing my Creator on Judgement Day.   Keep me posted on your progress.  Wishing you all the best, you do have support.",

      "Content": "None of us ever think BC can happen to us....I'd had mamm's & testing without fail each year, then whoops, after receiving an all OK, 14 mo's later discovered the so called fatty tumor was indeed cancer and I was already Stage 4.   Talk about being angry and disappointed, then sitting and listening to an oncologist say well, it will help to have the breast & tumor removed, do some chemo and dadadadada...no thanks, already been nailed to the wall by so called genuis doc's.  I opted for Laser Surgery to have my tumor removed, so simple, no cutting, no chance of cancer cells escaping into the body, lots of pluses, especially the NO PAIN AND NO BODY DISFIGUREMENT.   I read all I could, did the research and what I found is absolutely disgusting.  It's a game, Stage 1 & 2 are not very hard to cure, Stg 3 & 4, a bit tricky, but it can be done as well.  ME, I had tumors in my body 9mm...lungs, liver, thyroid, basal cell carcinoma on my scalp, pelvis, ribs and spine. So....I was pretty well toast, i've been told by 7 different oncologists to get my affairs in order.  First I was told Oct 'll, then March '12, then maybe I could last til the end of 2012.   Well, it's now May, 2013, all tumor markers are normal, some even below normal, bloodwork, stats all perfect, no cancer can be detected on scans other than a small reduced spot in the spine....I am still working on that with Cesium Chloride.  I've read over 50 books, some very detailed and needed medical help to decipher, but Suzanne Sommers book : KNOCKOUT will give you more info that most I can suggest.   I've read and found that the way American Cancer and NCI make up stats is enough to make one gag.   They'll put a patient on a 6 mo chemo and study program.  If the patient dies before the 6 mo's, they aren't counted because they didn't complete the study....if they die even a day after the 6 mo study, they aren't counted because they arent in the study program....how does that make sense?   Many of the minerals and nutrients are poo'd by physicians and pharmacies because they cannot make money on them, as in the book, GENOCIDE - The Cancer Coverup, a statement reads:   Well, we know that works, but we can't figure out how, so we won't approve it.  Who cares if you can't figure it out, it saves lives.   For me, I'm done with doc's.  I've gone alternative, had great results, feel great, do anything I want, never been sick a day, go for ckups 6 mo intervals, still no cancer invasion.   Why?  I have no idea, but i've always been one to follow my own path, I've had great results with the research i've done, first is diet, cancer is Anaerobic, it is not a virus or bacteria.   Some doc's evidently don't know this.   So....diet is the only thing that will cure this ill...you have to repair your immune system and let your body heal itself.  It will.  Then add DIM - Indole 3/Carbinol, Curcumin/Tumeric, B17 Laetrile, eat few Apricot pitts daily, the cyanide is not human body toxic but will go after the cancer cells.   Keep your body PH as low as possible, apoptsis will set in and kill the cancer cells.   Also, ck out the Kelmun Protocol, get on ASAP, that was what I did that cleaned out all my cancer in the soft tissue.   I am only telling you what I did, also know two other people who did this and they too are having great results...they both have leukemia and their white cell count is dropping like a rock.   You have to avoid sugar, milk, soy, cancer feeds off these, get on whole foods, keep your ph low and you will see positive results.  I've never had any chemo or radiation.  My oncologist is dumbfounded, but he agrees that whatever i'm doing, keep at it.  I do.  Best of luck to you.   ",

      "Content": "Hi Grace, big hello here.  You really have been yanked around.  So thankful you averted an unnecessary surgery.  I do hope I don't sound anti-med/doctors - we've all had that rather \"unkind\" experience, sometimes made to feel we are inferior beings w/no brain.  Doctor knows all and unless you cooperate, they aren't too concerened w/care.   It's happened, I know, but then there are staff and doctors who do go out of their way, overall, we have to be our own advocates.  WE know our body better than anyone....and, do any of you feel that it's \"Slide Card/Tab\" medicine today????  Remember the cards with problem, then you slide the tab up or down, match the color for the solution???   Seems that's what medicine is today, tell the symptom, they slide the tab and give you what the card shows for medicine and treatment.   I'm bit older, I remember when doctors actually \"touched\" their patients, started at the head, looked in your eyes, ears, throat, felt back/front neck, rotated arms, legs, full body, looked at your tongue, your hands, mashed your fingers/fingernails, now it's lucky they look at your face....or, is it me???   Cancer for sure would need more than a quick readout, know on day I got the Dx, it was immediate:  Off with the breast, out w/the lymph nodes, chemo/radiation, then reconstruction....hey, give me a minute to digest that I have cancer! - And, it's your fault!  You (medical) misread, or didn't read, the mammogram and said all clear, now herding me like cattle into a bin!   No matter what or how we got here, we are here.   Think we all agree no matter what therapy we choose, we must keep our body in best shape possible w/nutrition/diet/supplements and healthy lifestyle.  Grace, Do want to say thank you for all your service to cancer patients during your working career w/oncologist.   I can only imagine what an impact seeing so many suffer has made on your life, then to be hit with the \"beast\" adding harshness, tho glad you are here to share, always give any health tips, I hope every day to learn something new.  Still trying to learn more re: Anaerobic disease.  Had wondered what cancer is, then finding what it isn't - Virus or Bacterial, wondered how you fight it, it's a very strange disease.  Read \"Emperor of All Maladies\" a biography of cancer.   Reinforces our path of diet and nutrition.  It is the key.  Only one renegade cell can go haywire and cause all this distortion in our health.  Also radiation, can fracture DNA, then it produces fractured/diseased cells that continue to multiply and destroy our tissue.  Take IODINE to offset damage to body from radiation.  Why doc's don't tell us that is another mystery.  You'd think anything that helps w/cure would be forthcoming, surely whole foods, purified water, no sugars, etc. would be standard instruction.  Maybe we can be that crying voice in the wilderness, but if we are heard, we know it will be helpful.   We are all one, we share more than a common enemy, and we can win by sheer determination --- and good diet!   Cheer!",

I literally got up and walked off the op table, no cutting, no recuperation time, no PAIN,  I just cannot understand why anyone would chose traditional over Laser.   Very inexpensive, only the laser not covered by insurance, all else is covered---anaesthesia, breast wire localization to pinpoint areas, etc.  I would sell my house, or kids if I had to (joking about the kids). Quick trip to NY, was like a vacation since no pain involved, in/out/done = even went out to dinner that night. Not a single problem since.  Since then,did research, been on disease specific nutrients...DIM/Indole3/Carbinol, Fucoidan (U-Fn), MaitakeMushroom, etc.   if you want the entire list, just buzz me.  My onco here, even tho I can tell he is perturbed that I am improving on my own and he can't take credit, continues to ask \"Now, tell me again what is it you are taking\" - I am only on Xgeva per mo and daily Aromasin, neither of those are cancer killers, the Aromasin only represses Estrogen production, Xgeva strengthens bone.   I was given 18-24 mo's at best, 8 mos' at worse.  I've overstayed one brilliant doc's forecast,( Ive had 5) know it irritates them.  All bloodwork perfect, vitals, etc. TM's all dropped like lead balloons, the CA25-27 was over 100 and now 60.  CEA & CA15-3 both below the norm levels. We can beat this beast if use our head....Good diet, the right supplements.   Don't ever think you are alone, you aren't.  I've been so ridiculed for going to Laser, doing the nutritional route, who cares, I'm still here.   I have attended 3 friends funeral in last year, 2 breastcancer, 1 pancreatic.  One friend only had Stage 3 and I know it is the chemo that kills, sorry whoever doesn't like hearing it, but when your body is screaming \"you are killing me\" only way it can, from vomit, sores, hairloss, rashes, black urine, on and on...what do you think?  It may suppress cancer for awhile, but from what i've seen, when it comes back, and it usually does --- ummmmm....I'm fortunate to have good friend in cancer research, you'd regurgitate if you heard some of the stuff she tells me, so don't despair.  I'm no genuis, I just want to continue to breathe as long as I can, enjoy my family and friends.   I know the med way can't guarantee success, nor can I , but i've come to a very good place on nutrition and diet.  My friends only lasted a year or less.   By the way, i'm in this pickle jar because the fabulous medical profession misread my mammogram--got an ALL CLEAR, 14 mo's later i'm Stg4! No idea what happened to 1 -2-3!    Keep in touch, let me know how you are faring and if I can help, just buzz...stay positive and don't let anyone deter what your heart and mind tell you, we were born with a conscience and inbred abilities to know right from wrong, if you don't feel something is helping, keep searching til you get to that \"comfy\" place.   It's your body, you live in it, and it is special!",

I was Dxd Jan/2011 at Stg4, opted for laser to remove tumor & any cancer detected, doing nutrients/diet, all soft tissue now free of mets, only in spine and as of Oct went on Cesium Chloride and feel it is helping rid the bone of invasion.  It immediately stopped all backpain, unbelievable. So good to not have that misery following me everywhere.   Next scan due in Feb, so we'll see if it is indeed getting the remaining cancer.   I hope you will continue to improve.   The more i read, the more I realize chemo does very little to rid the core cancer from the body, so why go thru the misery.   The cesium is easy, tastes pretty yukky, but a quick down the hatch & something good to eat takes care of that...I got excellent results from supplements, especially Fucoidan, Maitake/Reishi/ShitakeMushroom, curcumin and of course the LaetrileB-17.   Please share any additional info, we must all stick together to fight this creepy beast.   God Bless and good luck, stay positive. ",

I've heard of the asparagus \"cure\" and have wanted to do that.  I wouldn't use Green Giant or canned food though.  Can't I just buy asparagus and do the same?  I have a really hard time with the taste of asparagus but it is better than chemo.  I used to like asparagus so I'm not sure why even the site of it is now repulsive.   The Cellect supplement I've been taking the last two weeks have greatly increased my energy.  It's a powder that contains about 150 nutrients in one shake.  It's not the best tasting thing, but it's improving me health.  I see my oncologist in two weeks. you are right - always use \"fresh\" rather than canned.  Know some areas have hard time finding some vegs, but they are the best bet.  It's a wonder I don't turn yellow with all the carrots I eat, i've heard sometimes it can happen! Just know you aren't alone, do try the Asparagus, goodyou like it, I do too, sure worked like a charm for me.  Let me hear how you do on your next visit to the Naturopathic doc!  Best to you! ",

      "Content": "Well, i'm getting close to year 6, but I always give most of the credit to being alive to having laser surgery rather than traditional surgery for mastectomy.  Has a much higher cure rate and even higher rate of a no recurrence.  I have been on Aaromasin for 5plus years.  I did get all the tumors out of my soft tissue, then used csci(cesiumchloride) in an effort to rid my metassis in the bone....some success, but not completely.  Last visit I had the faslodex shots - 2 shots, and NO, they do not hurt, little more than a flu shot, but nurse kept saying people cry, scream, etc.  I was expecting the shots from hell, but they are not that painful.  The invasion in my spine is near to my spinal cord, my onco now wants to bombard me with radiation, but I've ck'd into PROTON POSITON theraphy and plan to go to one of the centers next week.  It is a direct beam which only affects the cancer, doesn't spray radiation all over you.  I know radiation is very harmful, can cause all sorts of problems, may not appear immediately, but will in time...tho many do suffer burns at time of radiation, plus hair loss and possibly heart damage, as radiation can cause muscle tissue to harden.  For supplements that do help:  IP6 -Inositol, Tumeric/Curcumin, B17/Amigdalin, Beta Glucan, U-fn/Fucodian, Reishi/Matiake/Shitake Mushroom, Calcium w/D3, Magnesium-time released is best -Magnesium is a wonder nutrient.  Sure there are a few others, but mostly, keep your diet ph negative.  Remember - cancer cannot live or thrive in a ph neg enviornment...Add peroxide drops to beverages, will help keep your ph low....Eat natural foods, no SUGAR, milk or soy - soy is detramental after cancer strikes, causes more problems than good it does.  I've learned so much since being hit with this bomb, but mostly i've learned onco's don't know as much as they should, if not for Protocol, they'd be lost as a snowfake - that's their little slide card, if you have this, then match the color to the disease and do this, this, and this....then, hope for the best!  I've also learned that when onco's were polled at an oncology convention nearly 90% said if they or family got cancer, they would not do chemo, yet they wantn to spoon feed it everyone else.  You have to stay informed, then you can make really good decisions.  It's YOUR body, you live in it, it's the only one we get, so don't be bullied.  Learn all you can, stay diligent and determined.  Google-Mina Bissell/TED, she knows what cancer is - she is a top cancer researcher.  Also google  Ben Goldacre - too funny, but he too \"gets it\".  Good luck.  Let me know how you do!",

I did Kelmun, Asparagus, CSCI, nutrition and supplements. I'm here, My TM's are in range, all bloodwork/stats are perfect. So, yes, people who have had good results do post. I'm one of them. I will NEVER do chemo, it is thoroughly destructive to the body, maybe that is why when oncologists were polled if they would take chemo, 78%  said no, yet they love to spoon feed it to everyone else.  Everone has a choice, I exercised mine, all should be free to do the same, but yes, alternative therapies can and do work.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Dintle---I've been on Ufn nearly two years.  I was Dx'd Jan/2011 at Stg 4 (due to misread  mamm).  I opted for LaserSurgery (LASERBREASTCANCERSURGERY.COM) to get the tumors out, had them in lungs, liver, basal cell on scalp, ribs, ---you name it, it was there.  Was told I'd never make it past Nov/2011 as so widespread.  Well, here it is June, 2013, all tumors in soft tissue gone, nothing in the body except the spot in the spine, but it has not appreciated in over 2 years, after a small reduction.   I know the LaserSurgery put me on a much better road than standard mastectomy.  I've had NO chemo or radiation, I've opted for naturo path and I have outlived 2 friends, one dx's same time as me, another nearly a year later, so I feel I made the better choice.  First, go to Kelmun Protocol and silly and simple as it sounds, I know this got most of the cancer mets, then stay on the Ufn, which is highly potent cancer killer.  Fucoidan (Ufn) is an extract from brown seaweed.  Even Sloan Kettering Cancer Center using as they have seen the good results in patients.  Also, not sure what your particular type cancer is, but for DCIS as I have, I've found the following very effective as well.  DIM (Indole3/Carbinol) Curcumin/Tumeric, Maitake/Reishi/Shitake Mushroom capsules (these are amazing, hospitals now waking up to the power of mushroom to fight and eat cancer) Iodine,Selenium, B17/Laetrile, Beta Glucan, try to find Apricot Pittseed, eat 3 -4 daily, these contain a veg cyanide and will kill cancer cells, unharm healthy cells, just lots you can do to keep yourself ahead of the beast.  I have and i'm doing fantastic.  All bloodwork perfect, stats, scans.  Have good energy level, even my onco is amazed, said old age will get me before the \"beast\".  So, just know there is lots you can do.  Get on a good alkaline diet, cancer cannot live in an alkaline enviornment.   Remember when people used to say,Oh, if they cut you open, the cancer will spread, the oxygen will feed it - WRONG!   Oxygen kills cancer.  All the diets you see touting HydrogenPeroxide; baking soda, etc. are right, they create apoptsis in the body.  Doc's will say, well it can't kill all the cancer----well, neither can chemo, but chemo will kill the good cells as well and the natural substances will not kill healthy cells and give the immune system the punch it needs to destroy cancer.  I've done the research, I don't do just anything, I see the progress i've made, and as mentioned, I wouldn't be in this cancer boad had the medical genuises done a better job of reading my mammogram.   But, then I think, had they found it sooner, I may have been exposed to the debilitating misery of mastectomy mutilation, chemo/rad/reconstruction.  I bypassed the misery.  Laser is MUCH more effective, gets all the visible cancer, plus whereas the onco's had said they would take ALL my lymph nodes, I only had 4 positive, they took 5 and the 5th was clear, so I don't have the worry of lymphodema, nor did I have to experience the misery of recuperation.  I literally got up and walked off the op table from laser surgery, went to dinner that night, and now, 3 years later I am in perfect health.   Love yourself, you can win this battle.   Godspeed.",

considerate and sincerely concerned for the care of the patient.  WHen I first recvd my diagnosis, like all, I was nearly hysterical.  I was online day and night until I found alternative to the mutilation that lay ahead, at 2am in the morning my husband was begging me to please come to bed, but I was so distraught I couldn't even think, then I noticed  blue light on my computer was blinking, I knew I had turned it off, so got up to turn it off again, when I did, up on the screen pops \"Laser Breast Cancer Surgery.  I could not wait for daylight, then I called his office at 8am, then  8:30, close to 9am, Linda, his receptionist at time was answered.  I could not speak intelligently, I was blabbering on,  I will always remember her telling me,\" Everything is going to be fine , no  need to be concerned any longer, I'll have Dr. A call you as soon as he walks in,  he understands the anguish,  anxiety and concerns, he has daughters.  She went on to tell me she had had the laser surgery for her BC.  Shortly thereafter, Dr. A called me.  He is the most calming soul I have ever talked with in my entire life.   I was immediately at ease and a peace like i've never experienced came over me.  He called me three or four times to answer all my questions.  Don't know about you, but no doctor I know will even give the time of day without first getting payment before talking! Within a few days I was in his office with my daughter, she was now my care-giver and did quite an excellent job of mothering me.  No wonder I have such wonderful grandchildren!  I had the surgery, woke up, no pain.  My daughter and I went to dinner that evening, enjoyed some NewYork shopping, then flew home in 2 or three days.  My only problem was some leakage from having the lymph nodes removed, that area will be the only discomfort, but he will give you pain meds, I think I took two!  What can I say?  Don't doubt you have made the right decision, He is fantastic.  I credit his treatment/surgery with saving my life.  No chance of fluids escaping into the body to set up new cancerous areas.  I had been told here locally, unless I did the surgery,  the chemo, rads, etc. I would not live to the end of the year.  Really?  I'm here, in very good condition, all TM's in normal range, bloodwork, stats all perfect.  I am doing alternative, I watched my friend who was diagnosed same week as me.  She had the surgical mastectomy, chemo, radiation, reconstruction, she went through torment.  She also had a funeral.  I am angry, why are we not told there is an easy remedy, one that is not disfiguring, painless, easy, better cure rate and better non-recurrence?   I've learned---it's the money.  Breast Cancer can bring in over a million dollars from diagnosis to end day treatment, of which there really is no end.  That's why I do believe that cancer is the gift that keeps on giving - to the medical industry.  I am angry for every woman who has had to endure the misery and anxiety and pain, difigurement, every misery that is attached to this beast.  It is just not necessary.  I am not special, I am no genius, but i'll be dogged if i'll turn myself over to medical staff without doing my own research first.   Every improvement in my fight is due to my own research,  i've always said if this beast wants me it is going to have to  fight lots harder before it takes me down, and damn, if it does, at least my friends and family will recognize who it is in the casket.  I cannot say the same for my two friends  lost to this beast.  Cancer is never satisfied with the destruction it creates, we then  lost our son, only 41, to this beast.  He  died from lung cancer - a non smoker, a joy to all who knew him.  So since my Dx,  my worry is for my husband, we've been married now little over40 years, this beast killed his first wife at her young age of 36 (BC) leaving him with two small boys, one of which that hellish beast took from us at his young age of 41.  Cancer destroys life, the person stricken, the family and the friends and also leaves an unfinished life that could have brought so much joy to others.   You call Dr. Ansanelli tomorrow - I guarantee it will be the best gift you can give your wife and yourself....My best wishes to you, God bless and keep you both safe and well.      ",

Jesicahshope & Diana have very good insight, I am putting my 2 cents worth in -  I've never had chemo or rads; told i'd never last by Nov 2011, here it is going into 2014 and feeling great, doc's now ask what i'm doing.  I find oncology leaves much lacking, all doc's trained to do the standard 1 -2 3, seems they cannot think for themselves, all of us are different, even w/same cancer we will react differently to treatment, yet seems onco's will stick to the prescribed theraphy no matter if the patient is deteriorating or making progress.   Remember too that radiation can cause very serious heart problems in women, causes lots of thickening and hardening around the heart, not to mention the adverse radiation and common burns.  For me, staying PH balanced with diet after the Laser had proved very beneficial. We all have our immune system to keep us battle ready, keep it in good working order and it will do as nature intended.  Wishing you & ur mom all the best.",

      "Content": "Suebo, Yes, there are many alternative sites, and many are to be very wary of.  I didn't just dive in without indepth study and many questions, just as you.   I think it's best to look for cures for your 'cancer specific\" type...brain, breast, etc.  As well as with me, breast cancer--DCIS.  I know that inflammatory breast cancer and Triple Negative are really beastly and need a very strict regimine.  Looking back on what i've done, don't think I had such a bumpy road.  I figured since 5 oncologists had already told me to \"prepare\" with at most 18 months, I had nothing to lose.  Here it is 36 months later and all tumor markers are normal, two under the normal, all bloodwork, stats perfect, no fatigue, no pain and if I don't think about that beast, hardly know I've been bitten.  I'm certainly not bragging, I am just thankful God has smiled on me and allowed me to find the right road to travel.  Cancer is nothing to be \"bravado\" about, it is a disgusting, low life beast that robs not only the sufferer, but destroys friendships and family ties in many instances.  I have been lucky that I have good family that has hauled me up on those miserasble days.  My daughter was with me from time I was DX'd, never fails to call.  My son as well, and my dear daughter in law.  I have the best husband I could ever hope for, so considerate and caring....I feel awful for him.  This is our second marriage, he lost his first wife from breast cancer; she was only 34, leaving him with 2 small boys....and not a clue where to pick up, but we put a wonderful family together with my two and his two, then again the scum beast reared it's ugly head and took our son at 42 with lung cancer, such a dear young man in his prime with so much to live for...so, I am not frivilous in my thinking.   I do know from all the books i've read that cancer is indeed Anaerobic, and only a good diet can combat that particular illness, so immediately I went on strict diet and have kept my body alkaline.  It was a bit hard at first, but now just seems natural.  I can only tell you what i've done, be wary of those clinic's in Mexico, they will bleed you dry and you can do the same thing at home for a few hundred dollars where they will charge you upwards of $50,000 - yes, Fifty Thousand, plus, plus, plus.  I know people who have gone and they are no better off.  Just do the simple things i've done, they work just as well.  I can send you a copy of my scan report and tumor markers/bloodwork.  I do not lie about such a serious condition.  First, start with the Jim Kelmum Protocol...google it.  That got all the cancer out of my soft tissue, lungs, liver, etc.    If you want me to send you list of nutrients, will be very happy to do so.  Very simple, and as I mentioned, very inexpensive.  I may have spent around $80.00 to get started, then just replenish as needed.   If you've heard of IPT therapy, such as the Linchitz Clinic in NewYork-LinchitzWellness.com     Jim Kelmun Protocol is much the same, only dirt cheap, but it works.  If you've had any chemistry, even high school, remember how baking soda activates in liquid and creates oxygen...does the same in your body.  Cancer cells are killed by oxygen.   Just let me know if you want the entire \"what I did\" will be glad to email to you....no, money not involved, just a bit wordy and don't want to take up so much room on here, also, you'd be surprised how hostile people are when you say alternative, yet I don't see any great cures with chemo.   Nor did my friend who was Dx'd same week as me.  She went the whole way, mastectomy/Lymph node removal, chemo, radiation, reconstruction, then death.   She was only Stage 3 when Dx'd, I was Stage 4.  She passed a year later, i'm still here.  I take NO joy in that, but I do know doc's are painting everyone with the same brush from the same paint can knowing it doesn't work.  I opted for LaserSurgery to have my tumor and all the smaller tumors and splatters as well as only 5 lymph nodes removed and I know that was the saving grace.  Without what I call the Mother Ship spewing cancer cells into the body, seems easy to understand why i've had such good results.   Anyone can, i'm no genuis, but I love myself enough to want to know, learn and then do all I can to enjoy my family and friends as long as possible.  I know Christ is my goal, but I think He put a brain in our head to use at times like these, and i've sure been thru the lessons.    Just let me know if you want a list of the nutrients and what I did, very simple, easy and for me, very effective.   Blessings.",

Orig dx Jan/11, refused traditional slice/dice mastectomy/lymph node removal, but did opt for laser surgery and had partial mastectomy and 5 lymph nodes removed, only 4 pos.  Wow, so easy, no cutting, NO PAIN, even tho mets in body, i'm better off as didn't have to go thru the misery of surgical recuperation.  I refused chemo and radiation.   I can tell you that in June'11, had scans that showed mets everywhere, liver, lungs, pelvis, ribs, spine, splatters throughout as well....then in Sept '11, my follow up scans showed NO Tumors, all bone mets gone except tiny spot on my T-7 area spine, but reduced greatly....so, of course medical will say, see, Zometa, Xgeva and Femara working, yeah?  Well, you told me i'd be dead if I didn't do the Chemo or Radiation and i'm doing great, all bloodwork, vitals perfect, tumor markers falling like a rock, My CEA 2.7 (norm 3.4), CA-15 down to 60 and CA25 down to 80, so how do they account for that???- I credit Curcumin w/Tumeric, Indole 3/Carbinol, Fucoidan, Iodine and other ssupplements.   When you read up on these you see they actually go after cancer cells, in fact now Sloan Kettering doing big time studies w/Fucoidan.  I can send you links if you like, but to get back to denosumab, don't worry, unless you have serious dental problems or renal problems, you'll be fine.  The bloodwork will show if you are or are not a good candidate.  As for me, at this  time will stick w/Xgeva, just wishI could ditch the Femara....it's the boogeyman that hides under the bed, only it's for real.   Good luck.",

I know the radiation trmts are giving you misery too, I refused chemo & rad, but i've been with dear friends thru their battle, the pain can get quite intense.  Be sure to get Iodine supplements, they will kill the free radicals in your bod after all the radiation exposure you've been thru.  You should be taking Vicodin or something that will ease that discomfort, don't be afraid to speak up, you need something to ease your pain, will help you relax and get thru those moments.  Hate you are having nausea, thats horrid, i've not had that delight, but i'm enjoying watching my hair fall out....who put these blasted spells on us anyway?   You just hang in there, know you have great support here and aren't alone in this stew.  ",

Place a child in a loving and healthy enviornment, best chances it too will become healthy and loving.   Just remember --cancer cannot thrive or live in an alkaliine enviornment (oxygenated) enviornment.  You can do it if you are determined.  Any good, basic, sugar free, soy and milk free diet, heavy on fruits and veggies is all you need to do, plus get the right supplements. I'm no genuis, but when I read how influential pharmacy co's and medical doga determine our course of survival, I'm just not willing to place my life in some disinterested party's hand.  Sadly, if you research,  you will fiind it is all about the $$$  Cancer is the gift that keeps on giving, cancer dx can bring in a million plus, yet with no guarantee of success.  WEll, so can a healthy diet and it doesn't destroy the body in the interim with poisonous chemo drugs.  It's all about choice, just as life is, we  make our choices to do or not do, which to me is the greatest gift we ever receive in life.  Who loves us more than ourselves?  We live in this body, no one else has the same investment.  My doc has finally admitted that I have done an amazing job at keeping my body healthy and thriving.  How long?  Who knows?  For sure onco's don't.  All I know is I am healthy today, plan to be tomorrow and i'll just be d-----d if i'll let someone who doesn't know me or care about me or my family tell me to go home and plan my funeral.  Hey, I can tell them the same thing!  Get good supplements and a good alkaline diet and start beating the beast back into it's underground cave.  Remember, there is only one of you and you are important and you count!   God Bless.",

In future, look at Proton therapy.  I am now considering as SE's are few and far between.  Try to boost your immune system as best you can to reboot your entire body.  Get on a good diet and check with a nutrition specialist for supplements that can repair some of the damage.  Best of luck, once the onco's are done with us, luck is really all that's left.  As in any war, truth is the 1st casualty, certainly true in cancer. ",

Had it bad.  Was driving long distance and had to ck into motel as could not hold wheel of car, had stopped an hour prior, but still no relief.  As of six mo's ago I just quit everything!   Last scan showed no deterioration, bloodwork still perfect, tumor markers have not risen, in fact were down couple more poiints.  I've been normal for over a year now.  I chosse to use Strontium to protect my bones, and to heck with the Aromasin or Femara, I had been taking Premarin for over 20 years, I'm in late 60's, very active, mtn climbing, danced for 30 years, then taught, excellent swimmer, lots of stamina, so I could not bear to be incapacitated.  The Aromasin, prior the Femara, had just put me in torment, I thought arthritis was bad, well those are a real \" itch\" .  To me, if I needed Premarin because I had NO estrogen, why do I need either the Femara or Aromasin to stop production of Estrogen if my body isn't making it???  Just seemed a bit ridiculous.  I'd had the tumor removed, nothing is showing in my body, so I don't think I've done anything foolsih.  I've done mounds of reading up on cancer and what I find is a bit ridiculous....most oncologists can't even tell you what cancer is, i'm so tired of the same old verse ' Well, it's lots of things' - well, for each person maybe, but what is my particular cancer???  I've found it is anaerobic, so only a balanced immune system will kill it and it will.   I'dhad a bad case of lyme disease - due to treking in the woods, back in late 80's, then that set me up for Chronic Fatigue, I know that was the destruction of my immune system, siince then i've gotten on a very good diet, did the Kelmun protocol, which I know got my tumor markers under control....and, they were over the moon.   So....maybe if you discuss w/your doc that the drugs are killing your body with pain they can find a rememdy....and my dear, Vicodin is not going to give you respite....DEMAND percocet   I've had prescription over a year, I do not abuse,  I take 1/2 in morning, then 1/2 around 2pm and anothere 1/2 before bedtime.   It can make a world of difference.   Some days I don't even need it, but if you do, do not be bashful.  I'm not a druggie, I've never done pot or any drug, never smoked a cigarette my entire life, maybe had 2 - 3 glasses of wine a YEAR, never touch alcohol....so, exercise your rigths, you live in that body, no one can know the pain but you!   Sending wishes for a big improvement, stay strong.   Blessings to you.",

      "Content": "Easy to get cancer out of soft tissue.  Go to Kelmun Protocol.  It does work.  I had many tumors, some 9mm, but constant use of Bkg soda/maple syrup (laugh all you want, but it works), will devour cancer - good to take a 75mg coated asprin, causes cancer cells to congregate together...know several people who have used, we're all doing well.  For mets to bone, cesium chloride, but you need the right cesium, must be pure & from good supplier- add strontium & other select minerals, rubidium, etc.   DMSO is good for pain, the rub on w/rollerball head works best.  Glad the news was good, just keep the info in an if needed compartment...",

      "Content": "Hi, I have stg4/BC, also in my bones. Dx 2/11, had laser surgery partial mastectomy.  No way I could do the slice and dice and mutilation.  Got fantastic results, clear 2 in margins, no pain, no cutting, no disfigurement.  Scans showed ribs, pelvis and spine tumor, plus nodes in chest, and liver.   I started Zometa and Femara.  Of course told the 2 yr survival, maybe more w/trmt. Well, just had CT scan 6/6/11 - my doc shocked!  No involvment, all tumors disappeared, only one left on my spine and it is reduced 60%.  I've only been on Zometa & Femara 90 days prior to this last scan....but, I take lots of supplements that I feel help...especially the Curcumin/Tumeric and Indole3 with Carbinol, plus lots more....Also, don't give a figs seed what doc's or medical say, I do the Asparagus religiously....Green Giant or Organic canned, bring to boil, puree in blender, cool in ref, take 2 -3 tsps twice day, been doing this 5 mo's., Also take Bicarbonate Soda w/Honey or Maple Syrup (Maple Syrup usage needs cooking, so I use Honey), 1 part Bicarb to 3 parts Honey, 1 Tblsp twice daily.  Who knows, it won't kill me, and something sure worked.   I cannot believe, and neither could my oncologist, but i'm sitting pretty.  Will continue w/regimine and go for scan again in Jan or Feb.  Don't give up, but Don't be too quick with the chemo....once your immune system is destroyed with chemo, there is no going back, from all i've researched,  chemo doesn't really help breast cancer...do some research, only 2% chance, you'll do better with naturopathic, but must be your research and your choice.   Do read Suzanne Somers Book..Knockout.   Keep positive. ",

      "Content": "While there are many \"good & caring\" onco docs out there, I find they all seem to have hearing problems; meaning they are always on Transmit and not on Receive.  They just don't listen....you have to be insistent and take control or they will treat you like a number and not a living child of God.   Already think they took too many lymph nodes since you only had two positives.  Ask what she means by\"below\".  Some chemo does not work on breast cancer,  can  destroy your immune system and if you go in remission, good, but lots of \"ifs\" if it should return....some chemo will not work on return. If you are post menopausal, you can use the Femara or newer pill forms to keep cancer at bay, no harsh side effects as chemo-no hairloss, upchugs, mouthsores, etc, plus you need a bone enhancer to keep cancer from further invading bone--- Zometa, a vien IV which takes 15-20 minutes once a month treatment, or Denosomub which is injection, also once month.   I had the laser surgery for my partial mastectomy, only 5 nodes remodes but they had pathology immediatley to test and 4pos and 5th neg so they stopped removing....hospitals/doc have the power to say \"Well, we did what was best protocol\", my question is \"For whom\"? It's  US on the operating table and not THEM.   Hopefully with only 2 positives you will have good outcome, but anytime bone is involved, as with me, you get bumped into that Stg4 category and tho it's the same ball game, the rules shift.   Wish I could be there with you, but be strong and don't be bashful to ask and have them explain any fruther procedures.    I'm now investigating IPT therapy for myself.  If my tumor numbers haven't come way down by Novemeber, i'm going for it.   USed in Europe and here, not covered by insurance, but it has a very high success rate and people walk away cancer free.    Re the drain for your lymph nodes....you need that drain for a week or so, why did she take it out so early?   It should be a small flexible strawlike tube, you can pull it yourself, I did mine.  Just keep it very clean (hydrogen peroxide) and keep bandaged.  Keep us posted.   we have to be each others' support team and just know you do have great support here and we do care.   Best to you.  ",
