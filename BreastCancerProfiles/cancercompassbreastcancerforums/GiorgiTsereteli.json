      "Content": "Hi, my name's george. My father is literally starving from that back pain u wrote about and i jut saw your interesting and very helpfull comment but i have a question about it and if you know something about it and can answer me it would help me and my father of course very much. My dad finished chemo about 3 weeks ago and he's been having back pain for about two weeks already, I found about chondroitin and glucosamine but my father had pancreatit cancer so it seems like it's harmful for him to take glucosamine. I found some articles about glucosamine destroing pancretic cells and right now I'am wondering whether to give it to my father or not. So if you know some helpfull information about it it might help me a lot. Thanks in advance.",
