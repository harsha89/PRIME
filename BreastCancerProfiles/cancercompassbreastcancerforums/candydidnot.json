      "Content": "I am 58 and had a mammogram on Monday, which was followed by additional views and then an ultrasound.  They found a 1.3 x 1 cmm mass with some calcification.  It was classified as a bi rad 4 and I have a biopsy tomorrow.  I am scared to death.  The radiologist gave me no information and the concerned look on the doctors face have me totally freaked out.    I have no idea what any of this means.  Maybe someone can help me.",
