    "Content": "I was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer in 2002, and it had spread to 4 of 8 lymph nodes.  I had chemo (A/C & Taxol), and radiation after having a lumpectomy.  (I had a sentinal node biopsy, which suggested that my nodes were clear.  It was wrong.)  So, thank God, I am now a 5 year survivor, against all odds.  My daughter and I started a MBC support group, and we're looking for others who have been diagnosed with this very rare, very aggressive form of breast cancer.  We are a small group of women from all across the US, one in Canada, and one in Budapest, Hungary!  We have also put together a database with our pathology info, treatments, mets info, hospitals and doctors treating us, etc..  We share this with doctors or anyone interested in helping us fight and gain attention to our plight.  We've lost several sisters from this awful disease, and others are in a battle for their lives as I write this. Please leave a message if you are interested in learning about metaplastic breast cancer or are suffering from it, or are someone able to help us.  We're working on a new website that will be up and running very soon.  http://metaplasticbreastcancer.org  . Thank you for your help and interest! Donna              ",
