      "Content": "I've been diagnosed w stage 2 invasive lobular carcinoma and they will be operating around the 28th of this month.  I'm wondering if I should just have the mastectomy now---w no reconstruction or do the reconstruction at the time of the surgery?  Input is welcomed from those who've gone thru it already.  I'm not a large breasted woman and never wear a bra--I am deciding which way would be best.  ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your input--and if I were having bilateral I don't think I would have any reconstruction either--but they are just taking off one and I hate bras so I would LOOK funny--although I'm not super big--I'm big enough-- so its something I'll have to consider--maybe just walk like John Wayne (one shoulder down and sideways) for the rest of my life! LOL~",

      "Content": "Thank you Nancy for the reply--right now my feelings and instinct is to go w reconstruction at the time of the surgery if there are only 2 or less lymph nodes involved--more and I will just wait for the reconstruction.  I know I will have a hormone blocker but don't know which drug will be recommended as of yet.  I just had cervical cancer last year and the radiation/chemo was just horrible for me--I'm hopin they cut it all out w no other treatment necessary but this I'll have to find out later~ again thank you for your input~",
