    "Content": "I finished my radiotherapy on the 26th January and have just started having pins and needles in the breast that was treated. It's not enough to reach for painkillers, but it does feel a little weird. I was told to expect it though, but if it gets too much, I intend to contact the support nurse at the clinic who has been an aboslute gem. I also find the exercises they suggested good for keeping the skin supple, and have been exceedingly lucky in experiencing nothing worse. Good luck, and I hope it doesn't become too much for you.",
