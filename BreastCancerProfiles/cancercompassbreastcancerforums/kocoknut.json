      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2008. Had mastectomy and chemo. The tumor was triple negative , si it was not responsive to hormones. Chemo ended in March 2009.  Started having rt rib discomfort and shortness of breath in Sept 2009. CAT scan showed Mets to liver. I've had chemo for the past 5 months and will have CAT scans the end of March. The weird thing was , when I went to see my surgeon in Sept with those symptoms, he made me do some movements with my legs to see if I had a hernia, and since I did not, he had me sit up and told me I was fine - to go home , eat well and exercise.  The next week was the CAT scan which had been scheduled months before, that showed liver metastasis. It made me lose faith in my surgeon. He never even palpated my abdomen, or he would have felt my enlarged liver. Doctors make mistakes.",
