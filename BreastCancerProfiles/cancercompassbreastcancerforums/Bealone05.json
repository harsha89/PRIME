      "Content": "I am brand new to this message board thing but I like the idea of pouring my heart out somewhat anonomously. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in the summer of 04 and completed her treatment by June the next year, only to find out that her cancer returned in the most agressive form less then a month later. As she goes on with another round of chemoand another round of radiation she grows weaker and weaker, her prognosis goes from bad to worse. She just had to be admitted to mayo clinic and will stay there till January when her double masectomy is sceduled. I am at college and have no way of seeing her often, or seeing my younger siblings who are by themselves for a week at a time. My friends dont know how to be supportive and I don't know how to let them be, but more importantly, how do I be there for my mom? I am begining to see no hope for her future and I think she feels the same way. What should I do? I'm so stuck. Any support or suggestions would be more then welcome. ash",

      "Content": "Thank you for responding. I really appreciate it. My moms cancer is in late stage three and is proving to be even more agressive then we thought. She is now recieving more chemo and it is taking its toll. I wish I could be with her but the idea of me leaving school is very upsetting to her. I see her when ever I can,and my family takes care of her. It was the stress of catching my dad cheating that I think made her sick again.Through out her sickness he left her side to, well, screw around or what ever the hell he was doing. xxxxx .I guess I just have to do what ever makes her happy. If you feel like it, anyone who reads this should tell me about themselves, it will be fun. Why are you on the cancer boards? Where are you from? Say something about your life experiences. Any thing. I really like to learn about people, especially people in similar situations, but any situation is interesting.",
