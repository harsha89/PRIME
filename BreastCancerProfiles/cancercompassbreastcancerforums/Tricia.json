      "Content": "Thank you for your comments and good wishes.Yesterday I saw my oncologist again, and he said after closer examination of my tumor reports that I am hercep2pos or however you say it. He started me on Herceptin, and has decided to switch from the Xeloda to Navalbine. They started the Herceptin and will add the Navelbine next week. It is a little disconcerting because now I need to do some more research on this. I will still stay on the Femara. Does anyone have experience with the Herceptin and Navelbine? I appreciate this message board tremendously! It helps not to feel so alone and frustrated!Thanks! Tricia",

      "Content": "I have just found this website and am so pleased to have a chance to discuss my situation with people who have \"been there\"! I had breast cancer and a mastectomy in 1985, it returned in my spine in 1990, have been okay till now. I was on tamoxifen for 5 years, no chemo or radiation. Had a heart attack June 30,last month, and when preparing for open heart surgery a CT scan found cancer in my lungs. The heart surgery has been put on hold. I am on Femara and the oncologist wants me to start oral Xeloda. I have used Simonton's visualization for years, and believe in it. My husband is a clinical psychologist, Christ-centered therapy, and I have a PhD in counseling psychology, with a specialty in hypnosis and psychonueroimmunology, which is what the visualization fits into. My concern is using chemo. I would like to hear from people who have used Xeloda, how it works, side effects and so on. Do you reccommend it? Are there other things that work better with it or instead of? I think the plan is for lighter oral chemo because of the heart damage. I would appreciate corresponding with anyone who cares to. Thank you so much! Tricia",

      "Content": "I have just been diagnosed with her-2pos breast cancer and would like info on herceptin and chemo. I had breast cancer in 1985, did surgery, no radiation or chemo. It returned to T9 and T10 vertebra in 1990, used only Tamoxifen and visualization, was cancer free until July ,last month. THe cancer in both lungs was discovered because I had a heart attack. A CT scan before planned open heart surgery found the cancer,so the heart surgery has been postponed while we fight the cancer. Yesterday the doctor said the tumor is her-2pos so started me on Herceptin. Next week he'll add Navelbine. Am also taking Femara. Has anyone had experience with these meds? Appreciate so much this message board.Thank you! Tricia",
