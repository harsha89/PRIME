My spread to my bones and liver which the liver keeps getting more tumors. Also Xolota has worked for alot of my friends with stage 4 and you still have alot of chemos ahead.

      "Content": "Hi Jodie. How sorry I am to hear of your reoccurence. But if you have over expressed Her, shouldn't you be on Herceptin? I am confussed about the Her+ and -, I think,  so I may be of no help in this area as I have mets to the bone and my 1st dx was ER+ so thats what we are sticking with again. You can always biopsy a spot....if they can get to it.  Then you will know for sure. My suggestion is to get a 2nd opinion.  Xeloda is a newer chemo and I hear good things about that one and I believe it comes in a pill. There are the taxotere chemos that you can try....but your doc should know all these and if he doesn't....a 2nd doc would be helpful in catching what the 1st missed. Hang in there and know you are not alone and you have LOTS of options!!!!  Warmly, Kat",

      "Content": "Hi. I have mets to the bone and CA 27-29 was 178. The \"norm\" is supposed to be in the 30's. I amnow at 116 as I have started treatment. Not all onc docs like to use tumor markers as they can be inconclusive, like yours. So other tests should be used in conjunction with this test. There are also CA 15's as well. So it is per doc.  I think yours seem just fine! Good Luck!   --K in PA",

      "Content": "Hi Hana. I am so sorry to hear about your mom. This must be very difficult for you and your family.They can't tell you how long your mom has because they just don't know.  I have a couple of women I know that have far outlived their prognosis and are still kicking. Every year they come out with a new drug or chemo. So I think it is all about hope and doing the best with what you have.  Your mom could live for years as long as they can control the cancer. Enjoy the times you have with her. And remember to laugh. The best thing you can do is to show your mom your smiling face everyday. Good luck and email any time!",

      "Content": "Ladies please.  Did anyone even answer this poor mans question? He asked about remaining intimate with his wife and living without having cancer take over their lives. Reply to each other personally if you have a problem with each other. Replense and Revive are over the counter applications that can help with your wife's painful sex issue. The lining of the cervix gets thin with less estrogen (which is what your wife wants if she is hormonally + but not so good sexually). So it will help give back moisture. Second, KY can help in congunction with the other and neither have estrogen. Time. Time and relaxation. Your wife may need extra attention and care as this is a change for her as well as you. Good Luck!",
