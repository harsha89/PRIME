      "Content": "Hi Cathy - I am now 41 and was diagnosed w/ breast cancer in 2000 at age 35,(Stage 11), on 1/30/06, after I was expecting and \"all clear\", I was devasted to learn that the cancer had spread to my liver and bone. I have a wonderful doc that is nothing but positive. I'm being treated w/ Abraxane (family to taxol) and Avastin. This regiment started in Aug 2006 and my liver counts are within normal and my tumor markers are within 20 points of normal Originally, my tumor markers were in the high 200's and have dropped after 8 treatments to 51. Normal being 31<. My doctor and I are hopeful and he is a big supporter of Avastin... I am also on Zumeta for bone strenthening 1x per month. Good luck with your mother.",

      "Content": "Hi Alicia - Sounds like my story - in 2000, age 35, i was diagnosed w/ Stage II, no nodes involved. Fast forward to 2006 age 40, wasdiagnozed with Breast Mets to bone and liver. I'm having a hard time coping, because when I feel good, I think i over do it and pay the next couple of days. It's very frustrating and like you, want my life to return to normal or at least know when that might happen. I guess we have to remember that the treatment is brutal and that is what makes life difficult. Once treatment has put cancer in remission, we can hope that we'll start healing and feeling better each day....keep the faith and stay informed, everyone has something to share and it may or may not work for you. Whatever oncologist you see, I recommend a good nutritionalist. What you eat, how you eat can make a difference. All my best to you.. Beth",
