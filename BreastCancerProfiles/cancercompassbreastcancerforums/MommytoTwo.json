    "Content": "Hi there!! I am 23 and turn 24 next month. I have a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer. I'm currently waiting on genetic testing to see if I carry any mutations. Anyhow... I had an MRI done 7 months ago that showed, \"A 4x3 mm progressively enhancing nodule 6 cm deep to the nipples at 9' o clock position of the left breast. Breast lesion appears benign, especially for this age group.\" \"Non pathologically enhanced axillary lymph nodes seen bilaterally.\"So my doctor said that I was fine and no biopsy was needed. I wasn't a little worried considering the strong family's history, but I just brushed it off and went on my way. Well, two weeks ago I had gotten out of the shower and was doing my hair. My husband immediately says that there is something weird looking about my breast. The lower half of my left breast is flat. Instead of doing a U shape like my right breast, is does a _ right under the nipple. Plus it looks like someone grabbed my nipple and turned it where the bump is turned and not straight like my right nipple. So I went to the Women's Health Clinic to get seen. The doctor was amazing and did a visual and manual breast exam. She said that if I didn't point it out she might have missed it, but she could totally see what I was talking about. During the manual exam she said that she felt a marked difference between the left and right. She said she felt a \"pulling of tissue\" in my left breast. She explained that something was causing my tissue to pull. So she put in a referral for me to see a surgeon and ordered a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. The radiology department told me that they wanted to go straight to the ultrasound. Now I'm waiting for them to call and schedule me because they have to work with the radiologists because they want to be in the room to read it while its being done. So I guess I have a few questions. 1) what benign conditions cause the breast to pull in or indent like that so fast? 2) could the small mass they called benign actually be cancer? Anyone have this happen? 3) did anyone only have a pulling in or indent as their only symptom? I am just anxiously waiting the phone call. They said they will have me scheduled and seen within less than a week. Thank you!!",
