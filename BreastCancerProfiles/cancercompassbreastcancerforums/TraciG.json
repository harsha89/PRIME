      "Content": "I had somewhere between a lumpectomy and mastectomy on both breasts 2-1/2 weeks ago.  I had immediate reconstruction.  I don't have any pain under my arms, but both breasts are VERY sensitive and painful.  They still feel numb to the touch, but they hurt from the inside out all the time.  It feels like every nerve in my breasts is raw and exposed.  Sometimes it feels like I get the chills across them.  Has anyone else had this and is it normal.  Please tell me it goes away.  I'm ready to stop thinking about my breasts all the time, but it's hard when they always hurt!",
