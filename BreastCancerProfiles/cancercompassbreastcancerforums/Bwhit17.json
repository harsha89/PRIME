      "Content": "I agree with the post above. Before you do anything else I'd try a natural healing approach....Did you know that cancer cannot survive in an alkaline internal body environment?  Have you ever contemplated the effects of bad diet on health? Our bodies are designed to thrive on raw fruits veges nut seeds and pure water, not the basic Western diet of animal protein starch and refined sugar.  Are you eating right?  Here's another checklist to consider: These should be eliminated as best as possible: Cow milk & dairy, drug medications. refined sugar ( breakfast cereals), coffee, processed foods /animal protein, most all VITAMIN AND MINERAL  SUPPLEMENTS, vaccinations, starch carbohydrates ( bread, pasta, white rice white potatoes)aspartame, splenda, MSG, soda, flouridated water or toothpaste, tap water, soy, whey, baby formula, microwave ovens, partially hydrogenated oils, Adkins OR ANY FAD diet, , margarine, sunscreen, tanning salons, teflon pans, table salt, flu shots, silver amalgam dental fillings ..... I also suggest a good green foods supplement and exercise. Best wishes, Byron ",
