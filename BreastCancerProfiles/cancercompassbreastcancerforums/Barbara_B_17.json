I have been on Adriamycin, Taxol, Taxatere, Novalbine, Doxil and now the Dr. wants me to start Gemzar on Friday. I just had 3 Doxil treatments and ended up with a severe skin reaction all over my body. I am very hesitant to try another drug but he wants to keep my cancer under control. My cancer is in lymph nodes in the back of my abdomen from breast cancer in 1983. Plese let me know how you are doing...Barb",

All my other chemo drugs have been covered at 100%, I just paid the Dr. to administer them. Now I will be administering it myself by taking it orally and they won't cover it. I don't know if I will be able to afford it on a long term basis. If any of you had this problem, please let me know how you coped with it. I feel I don't deserve more stress in my life.",

      "Content": "Sandy, Thank you for your response. I did speak to the drug company and they were very nice, unfortunetly I do not qualify for their assistance program. It's not that I can't pay for the Xeloda, its the fact that other bills will hve to wait while I do. I did appeal with the decision to only cover Xeloda thru my prespcription plan and lost the appeal. Even though my medical plan covered all the other chemo drugs at %100 I have been on, because this is dispensed in pill form, medical does not cover it. So it costs me about $300 a month. it does not seem fair. Well, hope you are doing o.k. on Taxotere. I took that for a while and responded well to it. Best of luck!..Barb",

I started another round of chemo yesterday with Methotrexate. This will by 10th chemo drug. I just hope it works but I am not so sure. I was on Xeloda for 2 months and the tumors went from 1 to 14 so I am not very confident this drug will work. Good luck to you. What type of treatment are they recommending to you? Barb",

I am gong thru my 4th different chemo regimen for inflamed lymph nodes in my abdomen from my breast cancer. In the past, my numbers have always gone down but now they are stalled and I have had 14 treatments of Navelbine and am getting frustrated. The Dr. wants to keep me on Navelbine a little longer since my latest CT scan is table and doesn't show any growth. Would love to hear from someone with a similar situation. Barb",

They did go up after my 1st treatment and now the have beeen stalled for 4 months and it has me concerned. The Dr. did say they can go up at first since the chemo is disrupting the bad cells like it should I guess that makes logical sense. Next week I see the Dr, and we will talk about possibly switching to another chemo drug or something...Barbara",

The only problem I have had is I am also on chemo (Navelbine) and when I get chemo and the shot on the same day, I am really dizzy on and off for the next couple of days. We started breaking them up and I think I'm better off that way. Unfortunetly, my tumor markers are not going down, as my Dr. hoped they would on Faslodex. I was on Tamoxifin, Arimidex, and Aromisen before Faslodex. The shot does hurt going in, but its only once a month. I hope it helps you get better...Barb",
