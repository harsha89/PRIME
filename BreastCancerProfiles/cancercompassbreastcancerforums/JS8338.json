    "Content": "As with most challanges in life; the end is more important than the journey. If hair loss is inevitable it can be dealt with in many happy ways and #1 sounds like it's already in place..... 1) A loving and supporting husband. 2) The Cancer Society offers a free wig per person; as do many hospitals. I had 3 almost my natural shade and look but slightly different. When finished with them I donated them back with my fingers crossed. 3) I bought a \"Bang\" hairpiece from a local wig store and pinned it to a head band which slipped onto my bare scalp. Then tied colorful kerchief scarfs over the band and looked \"cool\"...\"young\"....\"chic\". Someone told me I may have to use double-sided tape; however, I never did. Eventually I found another free wig and cut another front bang off to have an extra. 4) Another woman undergoing chemo with me borrowed and purchased wigs in several colors & styles and enjoyed her friends giggles as she showed up for social outings looking like a movie star. Short, red, spiked.....long, straight black.....curly, long and sexy blonde.......... ===================================================       I didn't realize I would also loose my eyebrows and most of my eyelashes which were harder to deal with. The American Cancer Society suggested a make-up class that they held at various hospitals and it was very informative...plus we received lots of free makeup.I would be glad to help with any questions you may have. You must all give this time because there will be many of emotional, physical and hormonal changes. Eventually it will all be over and precious life will go on.",
