      "Content": "So sorry to hear of your mum's battle Asma. I too had taxol for awhile and it was a rather rough chemo. I wish I could tell you I am very knowledgeable about the best cancer centers, but I chose to go to one in the state I live which is Washington. It has been a good experience for me at Cancer Center Northwest in Spokane, however, I chose it because it was only a 2 hour commute from home. I pray, your mum has been able to endure her rough treatment and is improving. Sending positive thoughts your way.  Sandie",

      "Content": "Hello Suzanne,   I too was diagnosed with breast cancer with mets to liver and bone a couple years ago. I had a mastectomy last year and have been on a variety of chemos over the last 2 years. Like you I get a monthly infusion of Zometa. I was intrigued to read about the Essiac Tea you take and plan on getting some. Thanks for sharing. As for working, I am the director of Nutrition Services at our local hospital and can't imagine not working. It truly keeps my mind busy and I am glad for being surrounded and supported by my wonderful caring staff and so many others in the hospital. I feel that by serving and helping others, it can alleviate many of our own personal fears. I hope this may help in some way.  Thanks, Sandie",

I am scheduled for chemoembolization next week and I am wondering if anyone has any personal experiences to share regarding this treatment. Thanks, Sandie",
