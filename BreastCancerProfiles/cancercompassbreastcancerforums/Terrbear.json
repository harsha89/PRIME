Had the masectomy, TAC chemo, and 6 weeks of radiation. It was found in my sternum and breast area 3-06. Inoperable and did 12 treatments of chemo -Gemzar and Taxotre along with 6 more weeks of radiation. Finished radiation in October, had a CT to find out the cancer has spread into the lungs and liver. I have been told it is aggresive because the lesions are innumerable and resistant to the chemo I just completed. Now I have Completed 2 weeks of Xyloda pill form of chemo.1500mg 2 times a day. I need to know what is in store for me. Please anyone who has been through this let me know what to expect. I have an 8 year old whom I am trying to prepare about death. Pain was something I did not think about and I am now questioning, quality of life issues. Most Sincere.Bette   Hi Pinkribbon, Our bodies sure do have to go through alot of stress and pain just to stay alive. So sorry to hear about your aggressive cancer and how it keeps spreading. Makes me kind of angry at the way life treats us. We try so hard to help ourself out of this horrible cancer problem and it seems we just get kicked right back in the face with it. I was on my last two treatments of paxcell but asked to stop it. I could hardly stand anymore. Couldn't hardly eat anything, just felt awful all the time. They tell me they din't see any cancer in me any more acording to the pet scan, yet my other scans say I have a 1.? centermeter in my lungs, and my bones hurt alot. So I feel it is not gone yoe., but I will not give up yet. I will move on, but I am also trying to prepare other familymembers around me that something go go wrong and I won't be here as long as they think so.  Just help you little one to know how much you love him , give him your best days you might have left if it comes down to that. Just let him know you are sick, and sometimes that happens to people we love most, but you will always be with him in heart, soul, and mind. Your love for him will never die. May god bless you and keep you safe for a long time, hang in there and give it your all kid. Good luck,  TERRBEAR",

I go every week, take herpercin and toxal.  Lost hair, no biggie. Feel tired alot of times. It is hard for me to get out alot because when I start walking my liver area hurts. Went into hospital during newyears because I was freezing, my head, shoulders aand across the face. Could not get warmed up. I finally got out of the hospital after a few days they gave me alot of antibotics. My  chemo study lady was not to happy that they gave me antibiotics. Too bad, it worked. Very confused about the liver mets, what do I expect from this area. It swells up a little sometimes. Hurts more when I walk around. My doctor seems hopeful, doing a muga scan next week. Hope to see if it is shrinking the mets. At least I'm not throwing up any more. My doctor lets me take something for the pain in my liver which helps. I know the liver is a vital organ to our bodies, so what should I do to help myself?    ",

I'm scared of dying to soon before I've had a chance to see everyone. I miss my grandbabies, and family in Mich. I'm in Florida. I want to see my grand babies really bad but can't because liver is making me sick. I start chemo next week, on a brand new drug especially made for HER 2 I will be brave and go for it. Why not, what more do I have to lose. I think the new drug is Myocet. On third phase, then they go to FDA to be approved.I hope it works, I don't like my liver being so painful as it is. This treatment will go once every three weeks, for three months, recheck me, and go for another three months. Then they tell me they might have to do low doses of it for awhile. I want to know is the liver and the bone the worst part os metastic breast cancer? Liver is very important for living, I don't want it to spread to any more bones. I don't want to be doing chemo forever. Off and away with a wing and a prayer I guess. Terrbear",

I think I am on the first stage of metastatic cancer, they did not tell me anything yet about stage I'm in. It is a good question to ask my doctor. I know I have a very good doctor. He cares alot about his patients, and their feelings. That makes me feel so safe with his group. Good luck to you on your treatments. My thoughts are with you. Bless you for helping me.",

Three years I decided to have a Mastectomy on my right breast, because of reoccuring lumps. Did breast reconstruction 2004. They just found metastatic cancer going through my body. I'ts has nodules in both lungs,several clumps of nodules on my liver. They have me on Arimidex 1 mg. They have just told me of a study program for people that have HER 2 also. It will get rid of the cancer faster then waiting for years on Arimidex. My problem is that I have no support to help me get through this. My husband informed me that he could not give me the love and attention that I need so desprately right now. He feels he has nothing to offer me, because we've had to indure the loss of two teen sons, we both had cancer at the same time, which he was very ill .I stood by him. I don't know now if I should do this new drug.I will be much sicker, and bald. I have been there and done that. No problem for me . I had the support of family then, but we have no family here. Any answers? Have you ever heard of the new drug program.? Myocet. It is only a research study program. I'm willing to take the risks, I will be all alone through this. HELP!",

No I haven't taken anything to build up my immune system, but that is a very good idea, thank-you! I'm a little afraid for you by not taking chemo treatments, Sounds like you had more cancer than I had. I did chemo, radiation, everything and I still get this stupid stuff. Chemo wasn't bad I wasn't ill at all. Thank God for that. They gave me the right concocksion of different drugs. It was a good thing, because my husband had cancer the same time did. It was alot worse for him. I got very strong and forgot about myself and concentrated on him to get healthier. I appreciate all the help you gave me. Good luck with your treatments, Bless you , Terrbear",

I'M HER2 positive They told me the cancer was gone, but that can't be true, why do they say that? I know I still have cancer or I wouldn't be feeling so ill. Now they tell me my bones are acting up. I have bone mets in alot of different areas. mostly spinal area, I went to a radiation place so we can tell if there is anything we can do. I'm trying to stay positive, but I haven't been out of the hou hardly for months.  If I do leave it is only for a short time, because I fell sick or exhausted. Dose anyone know abour bone mets? I need information about to expect from it.  All I know is I just want to feel better so I can go see my family in Michigan, I'm in Florida, Any answers?  ",

Went through chemo, radiation, and supported my husband at the same time, because he got second hand cancer on his tongue. That is a big mess. Ok, back to helping you. Is your cancer hormon related? Is that what created it? I suggest you do all you can to help your self. Sometimes we have to fight for our selves. You can do this. So what if you have a little mark on your breast, no one will se it but you. You should see all the scars I have now, no big deal. I'm still here. My problem is that even after going through that, and taking tomoxfin for my hormon treatments. I did not take them for the full five years only four. Now I have metastatic cancer going through my body. What a b.... If you cancer is hormon related try the newer drug Arimidex. It is great, no side affects. It is a chemo drug along with slowing the hormons down. Good luck, write me again if you need a friend. TerrBear",

      "Content": "Summer, I had Breast Cancer in 2001, I did a lumpectomy, They gave me Tomoxafin to take for five years. Well I cheated and only used it for three to four years. Big mistake. Arimidex does the same thing Tomoxifin. It controls our hormons because that is what created cancer in the first place. I've done more chemo, radiation, then more lumps came to RT. breast I finally had the right breast removed, did breast reconstruction,no I did not finish my five years of tomoxifin and now I have stage five breast cancer, metastic breast cancer in both lungs, my liver, my bones. Boy I was stupid. Hormons are very dangerous to creating more breast cancer. I did not realize that I had hormons all over my body. I had a full hysterectomy done so I thought I was safe. Now I am having major problems. I'm on arimidex and deciding what treatment to do now. Think careful before you say no. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Hey Tina 1963:      I know of all the hard choices we have to make in such a short time. I've learned that you di what you have to do! If you want to live longer do all you can. I had a lumpectomy done on my breast in 2001, It was only in right breast, no lympnodes, thank god. It was like yours. Did chemo every three week for 4 segments, then did radiation for 6 - 8 weeks everyday. In 2003 lumps came back same breast had them biopsyed no cancer they removed them anyway, only a few months later 2004  lumps returned, they were called fibrosis tumors. I then decided I wasn't going to put up with any longer and did a masectomy on the right breast, I'm glad I did becaude the Doctor said they were the kind to becomer cancerous. I waited till 2005 to have a breast reconstruction done, I did a tram flap from tummy. Looks great but it hurts for a long time, still have a sore tummy area, so think on your choices good. For some reason the Doctors did not really inform me of metastic breast cancer could result at any time without us knowing about it. I found out I had metastic breast cancer by luck after going through surgery in 2006 on my neck for crushed vertabres. Did not even know I had cancer spread to both lungs, my liver, and some bones on ribs, and spine. Now I have a smaller chance of survival but I won't give up. I'm doing chemo again, herpicen, and toxil. I do this every week for over 6 months I guess. Thats rough because I have an hour and a half dirve to my cancer center there, then  an hour and a half back. After 4 hours of chemo. Why cancer came back after doing everything possible still is baffeling to me. I will do what I have to do, was pretty sick for the first couple of months, not from chemo just after they did the liver biopsy. Very painful results afterwards. Feel pretty good now I don get sick form chemo, I just feel cold all the time. So I guess I am saying ask all kinds of questions, follow ups with doctors, I did and it still go me again. I am HER 2 positive from over active hormons. Good luck to you, and give it al you got even if you have to slow down some. Terrbear",
