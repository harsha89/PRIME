    "Content": "I am a medical researcher specializing in women's health, focusing on breast cancer, and the compiler and author of the widely-cited EBM (evidence-based medicine) site Breast Cancer Watch (http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com), whose original content I author, and which publishes evidence-based systematic reviews and critical appraisals of the latest breast cancer treatment research findings, providing up-to-date evidence-based breast cancer guidance for use by co-researchers and clinical oncologists at many leading cancer centers. As part of a recently completed evidence-based systematic review of the latest breast cancer treatment research findings, both for Breast Cancer Watch and for my sister site, Osteoporosis Watch, I addressed extensively the issue of ONJ (Osteonecrosis of the Jaw); unfortunately although some the recommendations I have published are to be incorporated into pending evidence-based guidelines, this final form of the guidance is not yet available. However, much of the information I have provided exists in two online-accessible forms: (1) an extensive patient-orientation discussion thread in which I participated on the Breastcancer.org forum; link at: http://www.breastcancer.org/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Board=UBB7&Number=236454&Searchpage=1&Main=228435&Words=osteonecrosis&topic=&Search=true#Post236454 (2) a technical discussion for health and oncology professionals on my Breast Cancer Watch site, at: http://breastcancer.evidencewatch.com (select \"treating Side Effects\" on the blue navigation bar, then select \"Jaw Osteonecrosis and Bisphosphonates\"). After reviewing either or both of these sources, if I can assist and answer any questions or concerns remaining, please let me know.
