    "Content": "Biopsy is not that bad.  I've been through several.  The hardest part is the wait.  Make sure you bring someone with you for the results appointment in case you get bad news.  If you do get the news you are dreading, know that you can beat it.  I was young, although not quite as young as your sister, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I am a survivor.  Three years out now... It can be beat! A great source of information is American Cancer Society.  You can call them 24/7 or send them an email and they will answer any and all questions.",
