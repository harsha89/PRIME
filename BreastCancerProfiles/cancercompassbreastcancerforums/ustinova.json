      "Content": "Hello, I would like to hear from anybody if you have any experience personally or through your friends about the treatment of breast cancer in Hoxsey clinic. My cousin who is 44 and a mother of two has a breast cancer, she had a surgery, they removed a breast and she feels good now but I offer her to try some alternative treatment instead of chemo therapy. I read about Hoxsey clinic but never spoke to people who've been there. Please tell me if it's worth trying. Thank you, Tanya.",

My sister is from Ukraine. And yes, please tell me the impressions of your father as well. I fish him to recover soon ! I am sure if he believes he will recover.
