    "Content": "Hi I had invasive breast cancer last year and had chemo, radiotherapy and on Tamoxifen.  I am 45.  Had ultrasound recently and it showed 8mm cyst deep in the same breast I had cancer in.  I was told it looked like a simple cyst with smooth edges but to have ultrasound repeated in 3 months.  Is that reasonable?  Should I have it removed?  Can it turn cancerous? ",
