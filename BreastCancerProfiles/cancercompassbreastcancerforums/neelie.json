    "Content": "Hi,  I had my regular annual physical about 6 wks ago with a manual breast exam.  The Dr gave the all clear, reminded me of my need for an annual mammogram but no dire or pertinent need.  A few days ago I found a hard bump on my back (mid back,left side) thought it was strange. It's hard, doesn't move when pushed and doesn't hurt or feel tender.  My husband and I \"decided\" it was probably on the bone.  Strange enough - the next day while doing a self breast exam I found a lump in my left breast!  This definetly freaked me out.  Also being on the left side...I called the Dr and got an appointment for next week, and a mammogram appointment for 2 wks.  My question is this...is two weeks too long to wait or am I feeling impatient and anxious? If this is breast cancer how aggressive is it that it developed in just 6 weeks.  It's about the size and shape of a bean (Campbell's baked bean -lol).  Should I insist on a sooner appointment?",
