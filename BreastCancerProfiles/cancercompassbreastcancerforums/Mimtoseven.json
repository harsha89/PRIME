      "Content": "Hi: I am very much interested in finding someone to share and converse the good & bad points of this strange form of cancer that so few of us seem to have, there is so little information out there. I think part of my concerns with this cancer is the not knowing what to expect and the doctors just give me the same old answer, they do not know. I was diagnosed a year ago and had a double mastectomy so no radiation was required & I went through the chemo and taxotere. I feel so well now but I do know that this form can so easily be ready to invade my body with a vendetta. Not knowing what to expect is just so hard.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with this type of breast cancer in July, 2005, had both breasts removed and had 4 rounds of chemo, followed by 12 rounds of taxotere. I have had a rough year but I consider myself well, maybe for just a little while, but who knows, so little is known about this type breast cancer that you must do a lot of research for yourself, go online to the American Journal of pathology. Prognosis not that good without treatment so think many times before you decide not to take treatment. I was like the typical cases listed, my lymph nodes were clear, but that is the way this cancer acts. If you are interested I will give you more research information. I am also estrogen negative so no pills are needed.",

      "Content": "I got through taxotere in April and am doing fine but I do know where you are coming from. I had 4 rounds of A/C at 3 week intervals then had to wait 6 weeks and start a round of 12 taxotere treatments every other week. I had no problems with the redness you describe but I did have trouble accepting it at first, on my first treatment of taxotere I became semi-conscious but luckily a friend was with me & able to alert the chemo nurse; during my hard rounds of chemo they had used the anti nauseau drug aloxi but felt zofran would be all I needed for taxotere, wrong!!!!, so I again went back on aloxi and had to take the taxotere slower, but still a small price to pay for this reach for complete recovery. After losing my hair last September I had begun to see a few tiny hairs in the six week interval before taxotere,and was told I probably would continue to get hair growth, wrong again, what little that had come back came out again and I did not have a hair on my body until after I finished treatment in April. Go to the druggist and get a bottle of tea tree oil for your finger nails and toenails, it helps some but you can expect discoloration, and it takes a long time for your nails to get back to normal, in fact my nails still are not normal, but I did the womanly thing and kept plenty of polish on them to hide the discoloration, they looked like I had dipped my fingers in nicotine or worse, except they have more of a greenish hue. But still a small price to pay. I consider myself well, for how long no one knows, maybe forever, but hey. good things still come out of everything, my attitude on everything has really changed for the better. Hope you can tolerate the treatment. Anxious to hear from you. Mim",

      "Content": "Hi Steph: I am so glad you answered me, we girls need all the support and uplifting we can get. Please answer and keep me informed on what the Doctor says, and how your treatments go. I am finding that I can get 10 times more information online than from the Doctors, besides what I get online is first hand, the Doctor just knows how to treat it, but it makes a lot of difference if you have been down that road yourself. Go buy yourself another wig, I have 9; and 58 hats, but at least I have found something to enjoy. I plead that I am a shopaholic. Good Luck & God Bless, Mim",

      "Content": "I had the nuclear injection before my double mastectomy, there was not that much discomfort with it, they explained it was just more like a road map, making it easier for the surgeon to find the nodes, and in my case less damage to the chest area. It has been a year now since surgery and I have never had any swelling or pain in using my arm and the Doctor says it was made easier because of the injections to locate everything. Just think of it this way, the discomfort will save you much soreness and let you use your arm freely. Always a silver lining to every old bad thing. I see so many breast cancer survivors having to wear a wrap to keep down the swelling, not me!!!!!, thanks to that old sentinel locator. Hoping everything goes well. Mim",
