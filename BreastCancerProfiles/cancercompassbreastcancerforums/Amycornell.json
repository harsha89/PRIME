      "Content": "Hi: My mom had been in and out of remission for 9 years then about 2 years ago the cancer came back to her bones and her pelvis.  My mom had a couple spots in her lungs too.  The cancer spread to her brain and she had her tumors removed (painless procedure suprisingly).  The doctor wasn't concerned that much with the tiny spots in her lungs.  Taxotere and herceptin combo worked really well for her and if your mom goes on it it might shrink her tumors too.  **but your mom has to tell the doctor if she is symptomatic (coughing a non-phlemy cough) because that is very important for the doctor to monitor her in between her cat and pet scans.  My mom has some trouble walking but can get to work and she is a teacher so she gets through the day (sometimes barely, but does it!). Oh by the way xeloda didn't work for my mom but taxtore did. Everyone is different so keep that in mind. you can ask me anything else if you want and I will try to get information. ((HUGS)) Amy",

      "Content": "Hana, It is normal to be scared, but I think that you are a long way off from the end.  I think my mom was in your mom's position 2 years ago.  My mom is still working although she is in a lot of pain sometimes and has very little energy.  I asked my mom's doctor and she said that patients can live with the disease for many years, as long as they can respond to a medicene. The statistics are old because in the last several years more meds have come out. But regardless of that, it is SCARY!!! I am 27 and sometimes I cry all day. I will be at the gym and almost cry on the stairstepper. But my cousin always tells me, we are just going to make my mom's life as easy as possible and get her the best treatment. What else can we do? Just help your mom as much as you can around the house. Go visit as much as you can, clean the house. Speak with her doctor and research things online. That will make you feel less helpless. That helps a bit for me. You are not alone! Luv, Amy ",

Here is the problem, and here are the steps we are taking to make the situation better. I am 27 so I am young too. I am only home a couple times a year too. If you are smart and are able to provide insight, you will be able to help in the process. You would be surprised how much you can help by suggesting things for the doctor to think about. Amy",

Now she has another brain tumor and it is 1.5 cm.  Has anyone had a recurring brain tumor who can tell me about that? Love, Amy",

Ok, my mom takes zometa for her bones. It strengthens them. Do me a favor and tell me the name of the chemo your mom is on. I can tell you what my mom's doc is telling her. my mom goes to sloan kettering in nyc. Find out what she has tried already. In the last few years, new meds have come out. when did you last speak with the doc? Amy",
