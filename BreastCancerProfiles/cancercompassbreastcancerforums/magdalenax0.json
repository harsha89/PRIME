    "Content": "Hi, and thank you to whoever replies to my discussion! I've been worried for quite some time now since I felt a lump under my breast. I noticed it when my bra started feeling very uncomfortable for quite sometime. I felt the lump and it was very very sore, and its oval shaped kinda like a grape. Its not visible to the eye only to the touch. I tried researching and a lot of people stated that if its cancer it would hurt. I lost my cousin from my dads side 5 months ago to breast cancer. It freaks me out sometimes thinking about going for a mammogram i'm too afraid. P.S I also noticed that once my period is done it kinda shrinks and the pain isn't there.Â ",
