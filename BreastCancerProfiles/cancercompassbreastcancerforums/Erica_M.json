    "Content": "I too have mucositis. It is indeed extremely painful. I received it because of the radiation treatment to my buccal salivary gland. The entire right inside of my mouth is covered in sores, bumps and inflammation. It is under my tongue, on my tongue and my cheek is covered in the sores. My radiation oncologist gave me xyloxine (a swish and spit mouthwash) that numbs my mouth enabling me to eat soft foods. He also gave me tylenol codeine for the pain (though it doesn't seem to be working). Finally after a week dealing with this, my rad. onc gave me amoxicillan because it became a bacterial infection. I also know that if your sores are of a fungal infection, that diflucan would work great. I hope this helps because I can definitely understand the pain you are in. Erica",
