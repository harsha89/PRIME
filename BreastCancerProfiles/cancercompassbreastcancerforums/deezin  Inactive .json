Mine is on the left side so as I drive it just hurts so bad that I have to put my arm over it so that just the waist part is on correctly.  As for the lidocaine isn't that like the stuff they give you to put on your port site before you get the chemo.  I think I still have some. Well for all our sakes I hope we never have to see the site of a port ever again. mine is on the left side also so the seatbelt goes right over it. I still use the port pillow when it is hurting I guess I will be using it even when it's out for awhile . You should get a port pillow it works great if you are crafty it is easy to make or go to your local breast  cancer support and they will give you one.",

Hi, Have you been given your diagnosis yet?  Your case sounds very similar to mine, depending on what type of cancer you actually have.  You can click on my profile to read about mine, but the bottom line for me is that having Stage IV LOBULAR breast cancer (which was determined by a biopsy to a couple of my vertibrae) is not such a bad thing, so don't panic.  I was diagnosed in July & thought I wouldn't have much time so I gave away a lot of things that I wish I had kept since I really feel just like I did before I knew I had cancer.... some aches & pains, but mostly just fine.  I have no symptoms at all & have been told I can \"live for years\" with this disease & that seems to be the way Stage IV lobular breast cancer works because I've heard from others who are the same. If your diagnosis is the same, I can go into more detail as far as treatment goes.  I'll be hoping for the best for you.  Write me....... Toni sorry to hear of your diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Breast Cancer but was told it can not be staged until after surgery. I am so confused about this.  Dr. did say because of the size it is stage II but won't know till later. I am doing 6 tretments of chemo then told full mastectomy, then radiation then 5 yrs. on some kind of pill.  Mine is not mestastasized. Any info on staging would be greatly appreciated.
