      "Content": "I started chemo for breast ca last September. I am Her2 positive, so I've had to continue with Herceptin iv every 3 weeks. I will finish that in 5 more treatments. I am having awful body aches and pains. Sometimes to the point I can hardly move and, worse, I wake up in the middle of the night in horrific pain (8-9 on a pain scale and I have a very high tolerance for pain). Is anyone else experiencing this while getting Herceptin tx? I have run through Arimidex, Aromasin, and Femara, and due to pain and constant itching, I have been taken off for the time being. Please, if anyone could offer ideas, input, etc. I would be so grateful!",

I don't know what type of pain medicine you are taking, but I can tell you that, even though I didn't like taking it, Percocet works great. I would take it at night so that I could get some rest without pain. I do know that you can't accomplish a lot when you're in pain. My surgeon even talked to me about a pain patch...thankfully it never got to that, but I considered it. I have an 8 year old special needs son that doesn't walk independently and it was difficult to pull and tug at him...even to put his shoes on him was exhausting. Do whatever you need to get out of pain and you will deal with life a lot better. Know it's not permanent and there is an end in sight. I hope after all is said and done in treatment that you are still a cancer survivor 30 years from now, as well! Take care.",

      "Content": "August 30th was my last Herceptin treatment. When I asked my oncologist if he thought the pain would decrease now that I was coming off of it, he said, \"I guess you'll tell me.\" I would like to say it has gotten much better. I was also told by my gynecologist to increase the amount of vitamin D3 I was taking. I now take 4800iu twice a day...what a tremendous difference that has made. I do still have some slight pain, but more stiffness in my back, pelvis, hands, and fingers. However, I do have really severe pains in my legs and my surgeon said that was very common since I am taking Arimidex. I do know that my liver is very toxic and needs to be cleaned out...simply from the very toxic drug Herceptin...working on healing.",

      "Content": "I am so glad to know that my pain is NOT in my head. Thanks so much for the information. My gynecologist is really into homeopathic medicine and wellness, even though she does still have her medical practice, she also has a wellness center where she develops a plan for vitamins, diet, and exercise that is healthy and healing way of living. As you well know, I'm sure, our bodies were not meant for this type of poison and even though I am finished with treatment my body is still very toxic. I am trying to do a lot of vitamins and detox my liver. I will certainly take your suggestion and look into accupuncture. Stay well, be blessed!",

      "Content": "I, too, am having bone pain. Even though I have been off the Femara (same as Arimidex, Aromasin, Tomoxifen) for 3 weeks, I am still having pain. Has your wife tried percocet at night. That has been, so far, the only way I can sleep. Then, in the morning, I have to take an antiinflamatory med such as ibuprofen. Helps to some degree. Just had conversation with MD yesterday about this. One option if it gets really bad is a Duragesic patch with low dose pain medicine to even out peeks and valleys. So sorry she's experiencing this pain. Hope things get better.",

She is as type A as they come, and I'm much more laid back, but the thing that is getting me is that she is SO angry, 24/7, at everything and everyone. Nothing is right, everyone sucks. She is the Pres. of her family business, I'm there too as a VP, and staff are coming to me saying they are ready to quit because of her behavior. I'm sick to my stomach as I write this. She's saying I don't support her and help her, but she doesn't ask (she considers it \"begging\") and I don't read minds and then she goes into bitch mode when things aren't perfect. Tell me you're going to lay down and I'll take care of the rest. Don't lay down and get furious when the kids are jumping on you and I'm downstairs. I have resorted to just staying away from her because of the nastiness. We have four beautiful, creative, caring, smart kids (10,7,5,3) who know about the cancer (Mommy's boo boo) but are often the focus of her anger if the house isn't tidy enough (when IS it with four kids?). I need some guidance here...I am NOT perfect, I forget things when I am extremely busy (as we are in the business), but I don't believe I deserve the daily blasts I get. I fear for the company (and our house) and our marriage. Dear Mazuret, I was diagnosed with BC in 2011. I had spent my entire life taking care of my mother 9 (emotionally then physically), married a horrible alcoholic (didn't know it was that bad at the time), then gave birth to special needs child...then got diagnosed with this! My life stayed in anger mode because of always being the caregiver. I, too, am a textbook Type A. When I was diagnosed, I was not only angry at God, afterall, He allowed me to be diagnosed, but angry at life. Soon after, when I let myself down by getting sick, I became devastated, severly depressed, and extremely sad. I do know that steroids, which is part of the protocol for certain chemo drugs, can horribly alter one's personality. Please try to understand things from her point of view...she is no longer able to the thousands of things she used to be able to do in a split second. She is now forced to either ask for help, do it herself, of just get mad that she cannot do it anymore. Please try, no matter what her level of irritation is, to communicate in a loving manner. Usually, when you're kind, even though she isn't, it will bring someone to their knees. Ever heard the old addage...get more flies with honey than vinegar. I know you're thinking SHE needs to remember that, however, someone needs to be the hero. It just cannot be your wife right now. In time, this will pass, she'll calm down. Maybe you should just ask her to come away from the office while she is going through treatment. Don't know if she'll take that suggestion, but, it doesn't hurt to ask. I would also ask the staff to please be patient. If she was never this angry before, hopefully, they will understand. They all should put themselves in her place. It is a horrible place to be while going through this...for everyone. Life changes constantly, but this...changes things forever. Best of luck to you, your wife, and your children. You married her for better or worse, in sickness and in health...it will get better.",
