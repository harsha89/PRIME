I think that you are amazing to put yourself out there and offer help after your recent pain. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 9/05 and have had 8 rounds chemo after partial mastectomy and now facing 7 weeks rads. I am so anxious about mets as I have extensive lymphatic invasion(lymphangitic carcinomatosis per path ) which noone seems to be able to tell me anything reassuring other than not to worry until something shows up. I have been dizzy and unable to sleep well for the past 2 weeks and am told it is probably anxiety. Thanks for any input Becky",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in 12/05 with a 2cm tumor 2 lumpectomy and a partial mastecomy. I had a complete hysterectomy 1/06 due to disfuntional bleeding and a ca 125 of 77. Cancer is lobular and ductal invasive with extenxive lymphatic invasion positive er/pr, HER neg. My sister was diagnosed 12 weeks after me and has already had a single mastecomy. I am very concerned with the lymphatic invasion and have very large breasts which they say makes it more difficult to diagnose. I have had 8 cycles chemo 4 a/c and 4 taxotere. Tried Taxol but had severe reaction. I am allergic to the dye for MRI and CT scan. I went for my first of 35 treatments with radiation and decided that I can not live with what ifs and asked to see a surgeon to have bilateral mastectomy. I have been asking this for this from day one and my oncologist just says NO. I do not want to be in the conservation study as I have encountered more people with mets than I can believe. Does anyone have any experience or knowledge that could add to this. Thanks for any help",

This just makes me more sure now than ever to get this surgery done. thanks again Becky",

They are also doing bilateral sent. nodes and a biopsy of my leg. I have since developed red pathces on the right breast (left is the cancer). I am trying not to get too nervous about this new development and feel that is is just another sign that I am doing the right thing. I am so glad to hear that is was not too painful. I tend to tollerate pain well. I will post as soon as possible after surgery. I love this message board and the people are so wonderful! Thanks again Beck",

My 0oncologist that has ben against this from day one is a female. I feel that she is really wanting to add me to the statistics for breast conservation but I on the other hand want to be free from cancer. t was explained to me that the survival rate is unchanged in breast conservation but the recurrence rate is not. I do not want to spend every other year in treatment if I can get throught the mastectomy and be disease free. I do not want the surgery and am not ready but I would rather know that I have a substantally reduced risk of recurrence. Your note validates my feelings even more which as you know is a god thing when faced with such a huge descision. Thanks again Beck",

I personaly had a suspicious mass 2 years ago that was later said to be nothing. I am now in the midst of invasive lobular and ductal carcinoma that has extensively invaded the lymphatic system. No radiology is 100%. I hope this helps without scaring you too much but better be safe than too late. Becky",

      "Content": "I was scheduled to have the bi lat mastectomy when I went for an ultrasound of the axila. TO my surprise the large palpable mass that I fealt was not the concern the tech found 3 3 centemeter tumors. She brought in the radiologist who collected 3 fine needle aspirations. She said I have a 50/50 benign or malignant. These findings are on the oppsoite side of my original tumor that was 2 cm in the left breast. I have a feeling that they already know that they are malignant but I have waited the 2 days that was indicated for test results and they say the report is not ready yet. Now I have to wait through the weekend to find out. This is so frustrating and I need to vent. As we all know the waiting game is so hard. The radiologist mentioned that additional chemo may be needed post mastectomy which I process in my racing imagination as malignant results. Any comments or thoghts or experiences welcme.

When I had mine done I was aware of the stinging from the lidocaine, so I decided that just getting the injection for the dye would be better than enduring the lidocain. For me it wasn't that bad at all although I had the same fear that you have now. I did ask for something for the anxiety. My Best to you! Becky",

On the practical side things that you can physically do, I know that when I was in chemo and even now I don't always have the energy to do all the houswork I want and need to. Maybe a cleaning day, a trip to the movies or just a encourage her to go out for a short walk with you. A little comfort time goes a long way. You sound like a very loving daughter. Beck",

I do not know of any testing facility that will test without an order. I would check the local hospital for a referral to a breast center or ask if they can recomend something for you. In MA we have the womens health network that will help even moderate income families attain screening and diagnostic testing. I think that is federally funded so they may have something along those lines. Do not wait! I waited 3 months because I did not havde insurance and it is not a good thing to do. Hopefully it will turn out to be a clogged mammary or something but better to be safe. Good luck Beck",
