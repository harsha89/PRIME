    "Content": "Can anyone tell me anything about mucinouscarcinoma of the breast? My best friend was dx with it in 2008, she has since had a total masectomy. now she has been dx again for cancer. The doctors are saying it is the same as her breast cancer ( mucinouscarcinoma). Actually 4 pathologist said it was a different cancer at first, but seems it wasn't. ( how the heck can 4 pathologist misdiagnose? ) Anyways, sorry to ramble on. This is what I was wondering about it. Everything I have read said mucinouscarcinoma of the breast is a rare cancer and a very slow growing cancer and usually always has a good outcome. Has anyone ever heard of this cancer spreading so fast so soon? It seems to have spread to her head & jaw bone in the mouth.  Her lymph nodes were clean so they are saying it must have travelled through the blood. For some reason I just have the feeling they may have misdiagnosed again!!! Can anyone tell me anything about this cancer?  Thank you and my prayers are with you all.",
