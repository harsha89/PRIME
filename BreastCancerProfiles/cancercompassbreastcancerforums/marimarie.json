      "Content": "Kbrown56- Wow then it makes sense -   I did not read where your bone mets are.  I had radiation to my humerous (the upper arm bone) in January of this year. They diagnosed after three months of pain and weakening. Radiologist felt the lesion on my humerous was consistant with metastatic Breast Cancer. The Radiation Oncologist said it would take a few months but,  the Radiation to my arm would cause the bone to repair itself, and I would gain full use of my arm and be pain free. It worked. Ask your doctor about taking Xgeva or Zometa to prevent further bone loss. It can also help repair. I am on Abraxane for liver/bone mets and Zometa. While on Aromasin therapy alone it got to be so painful I had difficulty getting in and out of the car. If I sat too long--  I had pain getting up to walk.  I could not sleep because my hips hurt. I did not have this pain before taking Aromasin, and my bone scans did not show the deterioration my bones show today. I went off Aromasin, and started Abraxane/Zometa treatment--  recent CT and Bone Scans show favorable response  -- and the pain described above is gone. ",
