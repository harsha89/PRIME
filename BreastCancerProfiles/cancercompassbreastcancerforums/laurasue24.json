      "Content": "Hi - I'm sorry to hear about your side effects.  I had problems with Armidex as well.  I had trouble sleeping (vibrating body when I laid down), joints ached and developed \"trigger finger\" in my left hand.  I talked to my dr about it and decided to take my chances and stop taking it.  My BC was stage 1, ten years ago, estrogen negative.  She felt like the pros of taking it were not greater than the side effects I was having.  It has taken about 2 months for my body to feel normal again (except the trigger finger is still there) but I'm glad I made that decision.  IF my BC was definitely being held at bay because of it, I would have continued.  But since my Dr felt it wasn't making a significant contribution to my health, I quit.  Talk about it more with your Dr...there are other drugs out there.   ",

      "Content": "Hi,  I took Arimidex for several months and started having the numbness, then tingling in my fingers and toes..finally felt like I was vibrating every time I laid down at night.  It's a very odd side effect.  My dr took me off of it, but my symptoms have remained almost a year later.  I'm still not used to it...creeps me out.  I have found that caffeine amplifies the side effects so steer clear of it late in the day. ",
