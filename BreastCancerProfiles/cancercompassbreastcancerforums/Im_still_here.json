    "Content": "I too stuggle with constipation due to the large dose of morphine that I am on.  What I do is take 2 senna/docusate tablets twice a day, drink lots of water and I also take Miralax, once a day, it is non-addictive and works like a charm.  The biggest thing is to stay on top of it.  If I haven't had a bowel movement in 2 days I take a glycorin suppository to get thing going.  If you wait to long it builds up quick.  Also, eat lots and lots of fruit.  I hope you find this helpful, I truely understand the discomfort and the pain.  Best wishes.",
