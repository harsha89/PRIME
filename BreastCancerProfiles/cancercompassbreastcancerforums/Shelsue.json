Isn't 5 years the standard maximum? I took myself off Aromasin the first of March. This was approved by my oncologist. However he wants to put me back on Tamoxifin. I really don't know if I will do this. I am just starting to feel good again. Its such a difficult decision but is it really necessary after 4 years of medicating? I would definitely want a rest if I were you. And I would find out why so many years of meds have been prescribed.",

      "Content": "Congradulations on arriving at the 5 year mark. I am now on my 4th year. Today is my first day without Aromasin. My knees and lower back hurt so much, I have gained too much weight, I have shortness of breath (does anyone else have this?) and much less energy.I also have started having frequent hot flashes. I decided to see if I could take a vacation and I was told that would be okay. I really want to see how I feel without this medication in me. The woman who wrote that she felt better after two weeks is inspiring. I can not buy into being told that I'm getting older. Almost 56 isn't old. Any comments on this are welcomed.",

      "Content": "On 3/2/2007 Suzq53 wrote: Hi... Congratulations on being four years out! I can totally relate to the lower back pain you are having. I had serious back pain during radiation, related to a pinched nerve and sciatica (spelling?). My lower back has hurt almost constantly ever since. I so want the pain to go away. I know it will take time for the aromosin to get totally out of my system. On March 5th, I will have been off it for two weeks. I have to say that I already notice some differences in how I feel. More energy, less emotional. It might be pychological, because I wanted to \"be better\" so badly...but I'll take it! I'm 54 years old -- so we are near the same age. I, too, don't believe that these aches are age related. Also, I had terrible hot flashes from the time of chemo, and they didn't go away until this last year. I know that chemo put me into menopause, and that resulted in the hot flashes -- but, for sure, the Tamoxifin and the Aromosin had an effect too. Best wishes to you and thank you for posting your message. I'm sorry you have the pains -- but it is reassuring to me that possibly the pain is drug related and there is hope that it will subside. Dear SusQ53, Thanks so much for writing. You sound like a person I would like to know. Too bad we can't exchange email addresses on this site. You have my kind of inner energy. It is now 9 days without Aromasin. On Monday I see my new oncologist for the first time. I don't know what I will do if he tells me to go back on the meds. I just might say \"no\". It is hard to say if I'm feeling any different. My knees still hurt but it has only been 9 days. I know psychologically its great. The hot flashes are very perplexing to me. They are relatively new. Why have I just begun to have flashes when I have been on these meds for 4 years? Did menapause just kick in? And if so, why is that? Just as an aside, I want to say that meditation has made a big difference in terms of bringing a calmness and sense of having more control over my life. I have also just started to study Tai Chi as a form of exercise and help with mental and physical balance. Though I am not part of that \"I'm grateful for cancer\" group, cause I certainly could have lived without this, Cancer has made me much more respectful of my physical self. Having been an intellectual type, my body was dismissed. I hadn't had health problems and I was thin. I believe now that I am paying for that with osteoporosis and possibly the cancer related to a great amount of stress that I kept within. I now deeply respect the \"Mind-Body connection\". Anyway, much good luck to you and please keep me posted on your progress. Wishing you good health and happiness. Shelsue",

I am just beginning to believe that this pain is from the meds. I am 55 and feel like an old lady and I am becoming angry that I have to feel this way. So the qluestion is: Do I have to feel this way? Does anyone know an alternative or a treatment? What would really happen if I just stopped taking the meds? Any feedback is appreciated.",

      "Content": "On 2/19/2007 Lesee Puu wrote: My joints hurt, too, and I have been wondering the same things.  I feel like I'm 104, especially in the morning when I first get out of bed.  I started taking Arimidex in September 2005.  I experienced hot flashes, vaginal dryness, but worst of all was the joint pain/stiffness and trigger finger in several of my fingers and both thumbs.  My oncologist switched me over to Aromasin in January 2006.  Sideeffects have remained pretty much the same, except that the trigger finger has subsided significantly and I'm having significant pain/range of motion limitations in the thumb/wrist area of both hands. Now I am going to try Femara (February 2007).  Maybe I'll do better on it.  Have you tried any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Celebrex, etc.)?  They work for some, I have heard.  Unfortunately, I'm allergic to all of them, so I can't try them.  I'm going to try the new Tylenol Arthritis product.  Maybe it will work for me. There is some talk that a low level of vitamin D might have some connection to the joint pain.  My oncologist just had my vitamin D level tested and I'm waiting for the results.  Tonight, while searching the web for something that would get rid of this joint pain, I ran across a suggestion to try accupuncture.  I think I am to the point where I am willing to have someone poke some needles in me if there is a chance it might help.  One of my concerns is that I might be doing some long term damage to my joints.  What I've heard is that once you stop taking this stuff, the pain goes away, but how can something hurt sooooo bad and not be doing any damage? Well, I don't know that I really have any answers for you (or me), but I guess there is some comfort in that there are a lot of us out there with similar sideeffects looking for answers.  -Lisa    Thank you Lisa for all the information. I did not know about \"Trigger Finger\". Now I have a name and explanation and see that it is common. It seems that the meds causes rhematoid arthritus -like symptoms. I think I might give those anti-inflamatories a try, though I am a very anti-drug type person. As for Vitamin D, I take Calcium and Vitamin D. Can you keep me informed about what you find out about this? I am also taking a high dose of acidophilus and I quit a very stressful job! Every day I wake up hoping that miraculously all these symptoms will disappear. Your question about permanent damage is a good one. Who would know this? I become discouraged by the number of doctors that one can go to for all these problems and their useless answers. Occassionally I find a doctor who seems to enlighten me, such as a endochronologist who just recently diagnosed me with a malfunctioning parathyroid gland. (Unrelated to cancer I'm sure.) Another symptom I have had that my gynocologist and GP doesn't have a clue about is a burning like, fleeting sensation in my pelvis that seems to be followed up with a hot flash. For the longest time I tortured myself with the fantasy that I had cancer in that area. Now I've given up that form of torture but I sure wish there was an explanation. The hot flashes have definitely increased. And what is this bellly fat? I was still menstruating when I began Tomoxifin and hadn't yet experienced menapause. Would this had happened naturally? I was a thin person before cancer. I am going to try acupuncture. It doesn't hurt so unless you are very sensitive to needles, don't worry. I am also going to try a form of Chinese massage. I believe in Chinese medicine. I wonder if people are writing about the side effects of these medications? There is a lot of attention given to breast cancer but I don't come across articles on the quality of life issues caused by these meds. I still want to know what would be my chances of reoccurance if I stopped this medicaiton? I'm sure there are no answers but I am now 4 years clean and had early detection, stage 1. Anybody out there with thoughts? Thanks again Lisa. Good LUck to you. Any further info. is greatly appreciated. Shelley",
