My doctor has given me the option of mastectomy (single or double with reconstruction) or lumpectomy with 3 weeks radiation (Canadian protocol) and 5 years of Arimidex. I decided to go with the lumpectomy, but now I reading horrible things about the medication and the radiation. I am booked for an October 4th surgery. I am wondering if I have made a mistake. The doctor clearly was encouraging the lumpectomy, but did say it was my choice and not to worry--insurance would pay for it and my quality of life and prognosis numbers would be virtually identical. I am confused. This may get to you later than your surgery decidion. Here it is. My name is Annmarie. In 2003 I was diagnosed with breast cancer on my left breast. I was given the choice of a lumpectomy and mastectomy (single). I decided that my best option was a lumpectomy. I was to be 5 years on tamoxifen. I did 2 years on tamoxifen because it has a tendency of causing bladder cancer after 5 years.  After the lumpectomy and decided to learn alternative/holistic medicine.  I need it to  have something to use for prevention and western medicine does not offer that but holistic medicine does on many platforms. I decided to go to school and get my degree on holistic health.  Today I am able to help many people. My decision was the best I've ever made. It has been 14 years and I am still cancer free! and I will continue to be cancer free! Annmarie F,  HHP",
