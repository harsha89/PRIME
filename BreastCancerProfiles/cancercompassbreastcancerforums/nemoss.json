      "Content": "Malignant breast tumors are NOT painful. The radiologist can tell from the ultrasound and mammogram if these lumps are suspicious.  If you want 110% peace of mind have the doctor send you for an MRI of your breast.  It is a simple screening, and it will see anything the size of a pin head. Push the doctor, he will send you for the MRI b/c of the breast pain.  Your medical insurance has to cover it.",

I had radiation for my breast cancer in 2007.  My ribs are still tender to the touch.  It is a side effect that can stay with you for life.",

I took tamoxifin for one year in 2006, then I was put on Femara.  the aches and pains were terrrible. I had my annual check up with my onc, on 6/18 and I was finally taken off Femara.  My joints in my hands elbows, feet and my legs and arms ache more now then when i was on the Femara.  I always had body aches but I don't see improvement and they seem to have gotten worse.  How long after going off the Femara before you see improvement?  Is there a chance that these side effects are long lasting. I am praying for some relief!  Does anyone have any suggestions?",
