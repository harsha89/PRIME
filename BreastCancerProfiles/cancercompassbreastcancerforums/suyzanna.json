It was found in the lymph nodes and 13 out of 14 were positive. I had chemo and radiation and went to a naturopath in Canada for herbs and IV Vit C treatments -- 50 grams 3x/wk for one month. The recurence is inflammatory in the breast and 2 small spots in the sacrum and pelvis. so far all else is good. I am undergoing chemo - avastin and abraxane - going on week 7. I really want to do VIT C IV !! but am having a hard time finding someone in Central NY State that does it. Does anyone know of an MD who does this? Naturopaths aren't allowed to do it in NY. Thanks - I am also taking avemar and a lot of other vit/suppl;ements. Liz Hi Liz, I know someone in Queens who'll do the VitC drip. My mom is tarting it tomorrow. The only thing is, she needs an okay from the oncologist. If you're interested I'll get you the address, # and name of the clinic. ~Suyzanna",
