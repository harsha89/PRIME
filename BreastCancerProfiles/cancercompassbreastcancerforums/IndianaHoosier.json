      "Content": "I had bilateral mastectomy Oct 2008 with immediate expanders. The pain was worth it. I am 52 and breasts look pretty good although you are correct, no one really tells you what you will end up looking like.  I have not had nipples done. It is scheduled but I am on the fence.  I am thinking a good tattoo may be the way to go. One expander placed too high, that breast has not settled so why have nipple done if it may go south in a few months.  My luck would be that one nipple will flatten and not the other.  \"Real\" breast are not perfect and I don't expect the new girls to be either but I hope for at least similar look.  I had lots of angry nerve endings on one side following mastectomy. This has subsided and feeling is very good. No sensation yet at incision site but I expect it to come back slowly.  Good time for a tattoo I think. As for going braless, my new breasts are not equal and not shaped the same.  I need a bra to even them out.  Congrats to anyone who gets a matched pair.  Has anyone found a bra that fits the shape of our new breasts?  Mine are round and not much protrusion.  One side more protrusion than other, hence need for a bra to camouflage the difference. Is your pain from chemo or radiation? I would want to get the pain issue addressed before going on with reconstruction. I was off all pain meds except an occassional Lortab on day of expansion refill.  Your muscle causes the pain not your skin. Minor contractions really. All in all, I feel and look normal, no more sag.  I am confident I chose correctly for my situation.  No regrets.",
