    "Content": "What is MGN-3? My husband has lung cancer. He went thru chemo and radiation 9 months ago. The Oncologist told him he is stable. If it should start spreading or growing there is nothing they can do. They were not able to remove it because it spread to the lymph nodes. Can someone tell us what MGN-3 is and who to contact about it? Thanks.",
