    "Content": "After being diagnosed with breast cancer on 12/31/09, undergoing a double mastectomy and currently receiving chemotherapy every two weeks, I am feeling like my husband and I are growing further and further apart.  I constantly wonder if he is having difficulty finding me attractive or even appealing, especially since I have no hair or breasts.  He seems to avoid one on one time together, but denys that is what is happening when I question him.  I feel very alone in a time when there are more people willing to do whatever I need than ever before in my life.  There is only one person that I want to spend time with and that his my husband, but I deel like he would rather be anywhere but with me.  Can anyone relate to this feeling and if so, where do I go from here?",
