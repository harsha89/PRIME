      "Content": "Dear MyChallenge, I'm sorry to hear of your diagnosis. I'm an employee of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and am writing to share some information on radiation therapy and how to manage its side effects. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and American Cancer Society (ACS) both offer some good information on their Web sites:  Fact sheets on managing the side effects of radiation therapy: http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/wtk/index Radiation Therapy and You http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/coping/radiation-therapy- Radiation Therapy http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/Tre I hope this information is helpful and wish you the best of luck as you move forward with treatment. -Esther",

      "Content": "Hi, Sabine, sorry about that. For some reason this site messes up links when you post them. Try going to mskcc.org \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mskcc.org and typing \"essiac\" in the search bar. It will be the first result that comes up. Here's the link again without the www in front of it...maybe it won't get jumbled this time: mskcc.org \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mskcc.org /mskcc/html/69215.cfm Hope this helps! -Esther",

      "Content": "Joeys mom, I'm an employee of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NY and came across your post requesting information about essiac tea. Our web site has a great resource called \"About Herbs\" that offers evidence-based information about herbs, botanicals, supplements, alternative regimes, and other agents, including purported uses, warnings and interactions, and published research. The resource can be found on www.mskcc.org /aboutherbs. I took the liberty of looking up essiac tea and wanted to share the listing with you: www.mskcc.org /mskcc/html/69215.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mskcc.org /mskcc/html/69215.cfm Of course it's most important to check with one's oncologist before taking anything that he or she has not prescribed. I hope this information is helpful as you gather information about this topic. -Esther",
