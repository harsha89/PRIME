    "Content": "Hi, The first signs of my partners brain mets were bad migraines in Jan 2006. They found multiple mets on the CT, treated them with 5 wks radiotherapy. A year later she was suffering from flashing lights in her eyes and bits missing from her vision. She had her first seizure while we were in Venice in March this year. After another CT in Italy, it showed only 1 remaining met. She had Gammaknife treatment on the last remaining met in June this year and had no further seizures. Sadly it also spread to her liver and she passed away 10 days ago. The brain met symptoms can vary for everyone, it really depends on the part of the brain the mets are affecting. I wish you strength in the wait for the results. That is the hardest part i believe. When you know what you are dealing with, you can approach it with courage and hope. Steve",
