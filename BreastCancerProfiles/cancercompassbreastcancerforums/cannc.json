Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! Hi.  I do not want to worry you, but I would not quit until you know for sure. I had several mammograms and ultra sounds and was told repeatly by several doctors that there was a lump, but it did not feel like cancer nor did it look like cancer, therefore, it was their diagnosis it was not cancer.  I had this gut feeling it was something and I have the most wonderful doctor that believed that I believed there was something there.  He sent me to a breast surgeon and she confirmed, along with her assistant it was not anything, but to make me feel better she ordered an MRI.  Then, the roller coaster began.  It turned out to be a very aggressive tumor that called for immediate surgery and a week later I was back in the hospital with a second surgery for the removal of the rest of my nodes by my left breast.  This followed with several chemo treatments and over thirty radiation treatments.  The good news is it has been five years this last December and I am still cancer free.  I would not be here if it were not for the Herceptin drug. I would push for further testing just to make sure. All the best to you. Ann",
