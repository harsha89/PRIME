    "Content": "I have had a discharge from my left nipple and it has recently changed from yellow to a dark reddish-brown. I mentioned this to my company doctor at my physical, and she insists that I immediatedly have a mammogram done. Is she being overly pessimistic, since I am 27, or do I have a reason to be concerned? Please help me, as everything I have read on the internet suggests breast cancer.",
