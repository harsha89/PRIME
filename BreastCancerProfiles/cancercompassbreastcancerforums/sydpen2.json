    "Content": "Good Morning! I was originally diagnosed in 2003 and had been doing fine.  Now I have been diagnosed again 2008 with mets to my liver and bone.   I just finished Taxol which successfully shrunk my liver mets in half and lowered the intensity level quite well.  My bone cancer is no longer showing active!!!  The only downside is that the Taxol has just stopped working for me.  I almost had the intensity number down to where I could stop chemo and switch to a pill but it didn't quite make it.  So, Friday I start a new chemo Ixempra which we are hoping will take off where the Taxol left off.  The Taxol is a very good chemo!!  Good results!!   Please let me know how it works for you....
