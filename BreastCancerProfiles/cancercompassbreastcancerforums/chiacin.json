    "Content": "Hello, I too had a lumpectomy, followed by chemo and radiation.  A few months later I started having pain in my lower rib under my breast.  After complaining for months to my doctors (radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and surgeon), they sent me for a chest x-ray which showed nothing.  Finally, after 3 years of pain, my radiation oncologist was leaving for a job in another state, and she admitted to me that yes, this was a side effect of the radiation and that it would go away eventually.  I am six years past radiation, and yes, it did go away.  However, one interesting note... when I mentioned to my surgeon that the radiation oncologist told me that the pain was indeed from the radiation, the surgeon said she was surprised the RO admitted that to me.  I felt like they were keeping information from me, and caused years of needless worry.  All not to admit to a side effect???  Is this a conspiracy?  This led me to do a lot of my own research on side effects, which led me to this website.  Other side effects of radiation are thyroid problems, and bruising.  If you bump yourself on something, you could have a sore spot for months.  I hope this has helped you.  Good Luck with everything, feel better and stay healthy. :)    ",
