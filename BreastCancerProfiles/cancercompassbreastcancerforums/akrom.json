      "Content": "Dear janr888, thank you so much for your responce. Yes, it's been helping me. Last January, I watched my husband dying of lung cancer in a hospice. Watching him passing away made me extremely angry. When diagnozed, he had stage 4 with metastases all over. He refused to have any treatment at all, he ate what he wanted, lived the way he pleased himself - no diet, no restricitons. He began to smoke again. And when it was time for him to go, he was closer to a mummy than to a human being (God forgive me for those words). Watching him slowly departing, I thoght, I'm watching my future death. And that was the moment that made me extremely angry and aggressive, kind of, towards myself. By then, I already had had stage 4. I felt like I was being led by that terrible desease like a lamb to the slaughter. And I decided I'd do whatever possible and impossible not to go this way and stay on this earth as long as I have might. That anger supported me in starting and staying on that diet. My daughter is a holistic nutritionist. I had her use her knowledge to find proper nutritions, supplements, vitamins, diet, and so on specially for me. That's she who told me about liposomal vit C and Dr. Mercola company. I was not a big fan of vegetables, and the amount of them I eat is not enough, but I include them every day. Probably it's as important what I eat as it is what I don't eat any more. Make a disent online (or ask a librarian to help you) reaserch on such types of cancer treatment as hydrogen peroxide, liposomal vit C, different special diets including making fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies (I believe in them more than in juicing though both are very, very good). I don't mean you have to refuse your traditional treatment, I'm still on it. But help yourself, help your body to fight, traditional doctors won't do it for you. They don't want to know about possibilities of other treatments. They don't want to lose their money. Fight! No one else will do it for you. And one more thing since you mentioned coming radiation. I don't know what stage you are, but when I had it, mine was stage 3, and it burned my body all the way through. I had burns on my back though they gave it to my front only. It's normal reaction, don't be scared. Just before starting it, buy from a regular fruit store (hispanic or chinese) a huge leaf of alloe, it's some kind of cactus, they are really big, or a simple alloe plant in a flower shop. Inside of those leaves, between the skins you'll find very juicy, soft tissues. When you get burns, put those tissues on your burns, cover, and keep them on for an hour, or several hours, or over night. Change them when they dry out or disappear. Iit's a great treatment. Of course, prior to that, clean them very neatly, cut off the pricks, and if it's a big leaf, cut off only a little of it and cover the cut side with an extra skin that's left. And it's not \"less sugar\", it's no sugar at all. Buy organic raw sugar (brown won't do it) or raw coconut sugar, organic maple syrup, and use just to trick yourself to belieave you drink \"sweet\" tea or coffee. Do it. What ever info you need, let me know. You have my total support. It's like jumping off the tallest cliff. Scary. But it's more scary to keep going the same path. Praying for you and all of us. Always.",

She has a mass in the middle of her chest which will soon cut off her air way to a lung and eventually block blood to her heart and lungs.  The Dr. told us she has weeks to months to live. I don't take that at face value because of all the stories I hear about people having an expiration date and they outlive the time given.  My problem is, I am feeling like I have failed as a son. I thought I would be ok with this but after we were told, I haven't stopped crying. I wanted to do so much for my mother but was always so busy with my own issues.  I am so lost right now and just want to shut down and not do anything or see anyone. I am currently in the middle of obtaining my MBA and I have lost all interest.  I'm not sure what to expect here but I just needed to get this out. I don't want my mother to die, I want her to stay here so I can be a better son.  I'm so lost... I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. Had surgery, chemo, radiation. Was told I was cancer free. A year later they found metastases in my bones which makes it stage 4. I began taking chemo pills. They kept growing though very slowly. Finally, at the beginning of this year, I added holistic treatment and drastically changed my diet. Since cancer tumors feast on sugars, I stopped consuming sugars, no carbs (they become sugars after being diagested) including bread, white or brown rice, corn), no processed foods, a lot of vegetables(the brighter and darker color the better), not much of fruits because of sugar but enough berries. I eat grains - quinua, millet, buckwheat, sometimes oatmeal, raw nuts (they have to be raw). I take lyposomal vitamin C 10,000mg daily. Other supplements. Two months after I began it, I had scan done and it was much better, my cancer markers became within normal limits. It's hard to give up food you used to eat your whole life but life is worth it. Lyposomal vit C I order from Dr. mercola.com pany mercola.com they are very reliable. Let me know how your mom is doing. I'll prey for her, you and your family.",
