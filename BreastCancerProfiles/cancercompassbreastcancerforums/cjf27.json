    "Content": "Has anyone had this type of cancer? I had surgery in Sept. 2013 with a mastectomy of the right breast and clean margins. I have gotten three different opinions on treatments and one said no further treatments are needed. Scan to be performed every three months. I am retired,but need to work part time to meet my bills. I have heard the this is covered under disability, but don't know if I fall under that with collecting SS. If anyone has any information I would sure appreciate your experience with this rare cancer. Thank you so much.",
