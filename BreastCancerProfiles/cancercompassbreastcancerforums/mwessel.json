    "Content": "I started Femara in May. . . had terrible itching in November. . .was switched to Arimidex middle of december.  . . .started losing large amts of hair shedding around January, 3, 2011.  Feel the hiar loss is due to femara not arimidex but who can say. I've been off 3 week & still duck every time I pass a mirror.  How long did yours last?  Now I'm on tamoxifen but wonder if I'm just susceptible to this no matter what I'm on and like you,  is it worth the 10% increased survival rate. . . I still have over four years to go.",
