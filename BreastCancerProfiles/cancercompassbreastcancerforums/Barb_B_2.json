      "Content": "I am 72 years old and have been taking Arimidex for four years. I am a walking side effect for Arimidex and I don't think I can take much more of the pain and side effects. This is not a quality of life - this is merely existing. I am planning to stop take the Arimidex and just take my chances with the caner. What I would like to know is - do the side effects go away and how long does it take? I feel good but my body hurts everywhere constantly. I am literally housebound because of Arimidex.",

      "Content": "I have been on Armidex for four years and have decided that I am going to quit taking this medication. I called AstraZeneca's Cancer Support Network (1-866-992-9276) to see if they had any statistics on how long the side effects last after discontinuing and they have not done any clinical studies on this. The only information they had for me is that is takes up to ten days for the medication to leave your system. I suggested that maybe a clinical study on this part of discontinuing the medication would be a smart thing to do. They acted as if I was the only person to ever ask this question. Maybe if more of us called, they world do a study that would answer a lot of the unanswered questions we all seem to have.",
