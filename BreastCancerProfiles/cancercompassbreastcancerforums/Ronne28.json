      "Content": "I've had horrible pain and a lump in my right breast. It spread to my armpit then the other side. The pain & just strange feeling went up my right side all the way to behind my ear and also travelled down to ovary. Drs hv said I'm fine for three years. I developed another lump between my boobs and it continually emits a foul sour almost dirty feet sweaty smell and has a zit like pus. I went outside of my network & Dr found 5 nodules on my thyroid. Only biopsies one an wasn't a strong enough sample. They say I'm fine as I get sicker and weaker everyday. Three years I hv been telling them their is something wrong. Its sad that drs rely so heavily on simple blood tests that usually don't detect something so horrible.",

      "Content": "Dr's can't seem to diagnose me, but I have 6 nodes on my thyroid & have had symptoms for about 3 years that have spread down my right side. I smell & taste this horrible rotting, metallic something. It's very frustrating. All 6 biopsies have come back either fine or \"suspicious\" but not definite so drs keep pushing me off. Now I'm experiencing a great deal of pain & can also detect a different odor in my urine. I believe your body gives you signs. It's these lousy drs who can't figure anything out unless there is a report in front of them telling them what to do. I'm just so scared ....& starting to feel hopelessness.....I just keep praying & telling God He's my dr now...no one else cares.",

      "Content": "How did you get diagnosed? I feel sicker everyday. It started with pain in right breast, pressure, breast taking a different shape, swollen lymph nodes under right arm, moved to under coller bone & choking sensation around neck/throat. Found 7 nodules on thyroid, have biopsied \"one\" & only \"one\" 6 times, blood tests come back normal, now has spread to my right kidney, ovary, cramping in uterus & have burning in abdomen. Every dr says I'm fine & treats me like a mental patient (no offense to anyone). Saw an internist Monday & he told me I had hysteria because of finding nodules. Funny, I've had these syptoms for almost 2 years before finding nodules. I've become more exhausted, now nauseated & burning intense. I have fevers off & on where even my urine is hot, not like a burning irritated feeling, just McD hot coffee hot! How is all of this in my head if I had symptoms before anyone said there could be something wrong, but they can't find it? I'm so frustrated & scared it will be too late when drs finally figure it out. What drs helped you?Â ",
