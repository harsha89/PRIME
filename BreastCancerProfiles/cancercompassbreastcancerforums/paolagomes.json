    "Content": "I am having the same issues you had.  I just went for an ultrasound and mammogram yesterday and they told me that nothing is showing up. I asked if it could be a cyst and the Dr. said no, it would show up. So I asked what was next and he told me we'll wait and see until you get your next menstrual cycle. I had a total hysterectomy 4 years ago and am not on any hormonal therapy either. He said he wouldn't be concerned if he was me. I've never been in the norm as far as be diagnosed with past issues, what makes me think this is norma. I have a 2cm lump in my left breast that both myself and my gyno have felt. It's not in my head. I need to know what it is. Am I being crazy? ",
