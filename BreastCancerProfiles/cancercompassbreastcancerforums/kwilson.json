    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed last Nov with breast cancer-hormone positive. She had the mastectomy, underwent chemo and came out with NED. In August she began having terrible hip pain and after many scans we learned it had met to hip, shoulder and two spots on mast scar.  She started radiation. Last week she started having terrible pain in her side and had scans again. Now, she has multiple liver mets. She isnt going to do chemo until after christmas. My question is if the cancer changes from hormone positive to triple neg does that make it more aggressive?? She hasnt had chemo since April and this is where we are at now. There were multiple mets in liver and I am kind of concerned about her waiting to begin the chemo?? She is also having some shortness of breast and coughing. When we went to oncologist today he said she had some pleural effusion (Sp?) which could also be cancer but not be enought to worry about yet?? ",
