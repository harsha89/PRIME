      "Content": "Hi Ladies, I am 41 yrs old my mom is a 2 x Fallopian tube cancer survivor and my maternal aunt dx HER2 positive breast cancer. Two months ago while laying in bed with my iPad I felt a tenderness in my left breast where the iPad was sitting I blew it off thing I pulled something never checking my breast. I feel a fullness like when breast feeding in my left Breast. This has been 2 mo now I said it out loud to my mom who encouraged me to CALL MY DOC. I had a mamo and ultrasound that were normal 2 weeks ago. No change in breast still feels full and tender in the spot of the lump. No change in tenderness due men's trail cycle tender at all times. Any thoughts or advice? I call my GYN requesting a MRI I Have not heard back from them yet.",
