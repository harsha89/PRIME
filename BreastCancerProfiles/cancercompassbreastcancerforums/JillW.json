Hi Juie 8: I also have taken Armidex for 6 months, not a year, and the joint and bone pain was really bad for a side effect.  I ended up having to take pain medication to counteract it and that did not make alot of sense so my oncologist changed me over to Femara.  I was off of both for a couple of weeks and was improving, however Femara seems to be having the same effect no improvement so I've stopped taking it for over a week and have noticed an improved.  I have other skeletal problems so I can't blame it all on these 2 drugs - just the worsening.  We'll see.  I getting Phys Therapy one for my back and neck and another for my breast.  I'm hoping I can learn to get along with Femara because I don't even want to try Tamoxofin so if this does work I'm done for now.  Ask your DR. taht's why we have them, and lord knows we've paid for it in more ways than one.  Good Luck.",

Breast cancer does frequently recur in the opposite breast, and yes MRI of that breast is a good idea if there is some indication of recurrence.  But the cancer doesn't always recur in the breast.  Mine skipped straight to my lungs - mammogram was showing me to be cancer free, and MRI of breast would have shown the same thing, cause it just wasn't there in the breast any more.  There are no reliable predictors of where or when it might recur - at least none that I know of, or none that were made available to me. I'm not sure if this answers your question or not.  At any rate, my heart goes out to you that you are fighting this all over again.

      "Content": "This is a continuation/follow up on the alligator hard tissue issue  Last week I started having pain underneath the effected breast. Had an ultrasound that questioned the tissue which the radiologist said was okay.  Yeah right.  Then X-Rays which showed 2 fractured ribs which was caused by coughing!  The radiation has caused deformities, enlargement, discoloration, shrunk the pectoral muscles and apparently weakened the bones below the area radiated.  I'm on vacation for a month but plan to get aggresive with all the medical people involved with my treatment both present and past.  If I had to do it over again I would opt not to have the radiation treatment.  It is becoming apparent that these side effects are permanent.  Beware of the information they don't give you before treatments.  ",

Thanks for any info...   Jill Kristine sorry about the confusion.  Had cancer in left breast 2 yr ago, tumor removed & 4 weeks rad tx.  YOU WERE VERY LUCKY!  I now have a new cancer in the opposite breast and will have the tumor removed and possibly the nipple.  The 5 day tx is called Mamosite and can be found on the internet with all the info.  There are criteria that you need to meet like the margins have to be clear, they insert a balloon into the space the tumor was with seeds in it and you are radiated twice a day for 5 days.  They have been doing it for about 5 years I think. It is still experimental but the results have been very good.  Jill I guess I don't understand what you are telling us. You have had cancer removed from one breast and it is also in the other one and they want to do 5 radiation tx on the breast that still has the cancer. Why have you not had the cancer removed and no I have not heard of the 5 day tx. I just finished 3 weeks ago. I have 33 tx, 28 regular and 5 boost and the only thing I had was the last 3 days very tired. I worked all the way through and did not have any pain or skin issues. My scars on the breast look awsome, the tx make them smaller and flat and very light. I am amazed at truely painless is was. I was expecting the worst, so the few days of being tired was nooooo big deal at all.   Kristine  ",
