      "Content": "I'm pretty active in my occupation. I work construction at my brothers construction company. I do painting to roofing to building fences. Always working over 40 hours a week but lately I've noticed each week I'm having more and more trouble keeping up with the guys. When before it was no problem at all. The hardest part is that its happening so fast.I love what I do and don't want to stop but I don't know how I can continue like this.I can take prescription pain medicine but it doesn't offer much relief . so I don't see the point in taking it. My shoulder is lower and smaller than my other one.I'm afraid my arm will eventually become useless and everything I enjoy doing will be lost to me.",

      "Content": "Its been 14 years since my mastectomy and reconstructive surgeries from stage 4 breast cancer. I had a modified radical mastectomy, chemo and radiation and a new born baby. I was diagnosed at 23 years old. I've always had some pain and I could never lay on my left side offer surgery, but over the years the pain has gradually gotten worse and I learned to cope with the pain with out drugs except otc pain relievers. Now it seems the pain is getting worse on a daily basis. I feel like like I'm hanging on to a rope and I'm ready to just let go. My family doctor doesn't know what to do to help me and I don't know what kind of doctor can help me. I have cords under my arm. My shoulder has dropped. The muscles on the left side of my back are locked up. Now my neck is giving me problems and I feel as if the left side of my body is slowly been crushed. I need advise asap. Can someone please help me figure out where to go from here.",
