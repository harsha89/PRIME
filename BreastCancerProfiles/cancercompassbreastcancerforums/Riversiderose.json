    "Content": "I have a general question (at the end of a little back ground). I have (had) breast cancer and a double mastectomy, radiation, & chemo. Since then, the cancer moved to my liver and I have been undergoing chemo (carboplatin & gemcitabine) on a cycle of chemo each week for two weeks then a week off then repeat. Now, I have reached the point where my body is not recovering fast enough and I have low platelets \u2013 so low that I have had to skip several cycles and my chemo is now on an erratic schedule \u2013 given whenever my platelets are high enough. My specific concern and question is... will this erratic schedule be effective or should I simply stop for a few months and let my body attempt to repair itself and get normal counts again? My liver tumors have nearly disappeared; one is gone and the other nearly gone. Any opinions as to whether I should continue this hit or miss schedule or take a few months to recover then resume the chemo? Thank you in advance",
