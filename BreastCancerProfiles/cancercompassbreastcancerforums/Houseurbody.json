      "Content": "Our moms...I guess I am in shock over this whole thing. I feel like the doctors took too long to do anything, as far as removal of the lump. My mom told the doctors to remove her breast and not just the lump, but they didnt or couldnt...I dont know. I am just so angry right now...REALITY IS SETTING IN..it hurts to see my mom in pain like this. Even though mom says she isnt afraid of dieing, she is only afraid of dieing in pain. Because she knows if and when the time comes for her to leave us, she will be with our lord. Where there is no pain or suffering or madness. She will beat this with all of the support and with gods will...especially we wont give up hope. stay blessed to you and your mom and family",

      "Content": "Okay this is a follow up to my first oringinal posting on here titled \"when not to quit\". My next issue or concern is...We are lost and confused about whats going on with this whole treatment of chemo to take care of the breat cancer in my mom. Her primary md ordered a test for her to find out if the cancer has spread anywhere else,besides her breast. The surgeon got upset that my moms primary ordered this test and asked why did he order such a test. His words where \"why, what for?, there is no reason to do this test\". Well to find out, thank god for my moms primary...the test showed that the cancer has spread to her liver, and dx stage IV. Now if it wasnt for her primary doctor, she would never of found out this ugly cancer has spread. I know alot of surgeons think their god, or almost god because they have your life in their hands..literally. But are most this stupid not to test other areas to see if, and where? I know this surgeon feels really stupid and has his foot in his own ass. Because everytime my mom and I walk in to his office...my mom gets the royal treatment and treated as if she was the queen of the USA. If we had one..lol Has anyone else been through such nonsense doctors? please let me know if there is anything I should do? Because now she is not gonna have her breast removed, she went straight to one of the most aggressive chemotherapy treatments there is..supposively. Mom has gone 3 weeks so far, and like they say..chemo is gonna wipe her out, and once she starts to feel better, it off to another chemo treatment. Back to being sick. When is she gonna lose her hair? so far she hasnt lost any, but the cramping, constipation, nausea, and wanting to eat things she shouldnt are all there... any advice?",

      "Content": "Hello, my mom was dx with bc about a month ago, and was dx a stage 3. She since then had surgery to remove the lump in her breast. Since the surgery she has got worse condition then originally started. Her breast had turn almost a black discoloration and she says \"its hard like her forehead\". Mom says \"that a hard head, so imagine a hard breast as hard as my head\". Thank god she has her cheerful humor about it...not as usual but some what. Anyways as I was saying...She had been schedule to have her breast removed but her doctors cancelled it due to the condition of the breast. Just incase of any infection they wouldnt want to spread it. So the surgeon did a minor surgery and said there was no infection and that she had a blood clot. So he cleared it out and said wanted to reschedule. Mom has since then been in pain thats progressing more and more..she twitches as if someone shocked her body and is in discomfort. She kept telling her doctor that she doesnt feel right and there is something wrong, a wowman knows her own body. She then called her primary doctor (our family md for years and good friend) That she isnt feeling right and that she feels the other md's are not telling her something or getting the full attention she needs. He then order her a test where she would drink this color dye for the cancer to show through x-rays. We find out she now has cancer in her liver! :o( and dx stage 4. Is this common? for someone to go from feeling normal before the first surgery to being in pain and spreading of the cancer after. DID THE CANCER SPREAD AND RUN FROM BEING EXPOSED DURING SURGERY? Is there any hope for my mommy and us as a family? We are a big family with a whole lot of friends so mom has a big cheering section. She is only 56yrs old, with the attitude and spunk of a 30 yr old. All up until she had surgery. Can someone help us with suggestions or words of hope. god bless you all! stay safe and be safe always to you and your families always no matter where or what you do. David Rodriguez",
