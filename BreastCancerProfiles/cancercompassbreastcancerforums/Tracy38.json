    "Content": "In Feb. 2007 my 54 year old husband was diagnosed with stage 3b lung cancer.  He had a persistent cough and finally went on antibiotics.  A small amount of blood came up with a cough and he went to get a chest x-ray.  They found that he had a 9 cm tumor that looked to be wrapped around the pulmonary artery and no other tumors in the body.  He opted for surgery to remove the left lung.  When they went in to remove the lung they found that the tumor was also wrapped around the aorta and has grown through to the back of the chest wall.  This changed the stage to 4 and nonoperable. The oncologist recommended radiation and chemo and he felt he could give my husband 2 years but that he may be ill for 1/3 of that time. With no treatment they say he has 8 months to 1 year. My husband has opted out of this treatment and has found a treatment using PH therapy combined with Cesium and other minerals. He is not under the care of a Doc for this treatment and to me this is the same as having no treatment. I am only 38 and we have 3 children, ages 8, 10 and 14. I was hoping for some answers from people who are fighting this diease of who have fought it with someone. SO, these are my questions I hope to talk about wit you all. -Is anyone fighting lung cancer with Cesium and PH therapy? -has anyone ever heard of people using cesium? -Has anyone opted out of treatment altogether? -Is this normal for someone who is so ill to feel normal or really close to it? Thank you, Tracy",
