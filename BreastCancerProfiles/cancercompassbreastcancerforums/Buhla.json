    "Content": "Dear CMSRAD; First, I am very sorry about the cancer you have as well as your family members. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 at age 51 and my husband was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003 and died this past October at age 56. My tumor was ER/PR positive and before my hysterectomy was put on tamoxifin and afterward on Femara. I only had surgery and rads, no chemo (I was T1N0M0 - a 9mm tumor). You don't give your age or the reason your doctor put you on tamoxifin and femara if you were not ER positive. There is a new test they can do on the tumor, called oncogene or something, that better predicts your chance of recurrance and if it is high, what treatment might work. Maybe you could ask your doctor about it. I do have lot of bone and joint pain from the Femara but I live with it because I figure it is keeping me alive. Good luck.",
