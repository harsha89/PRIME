      "Content": "thanks for responding. I know I am just overwhelmed. I was totally ok until finding out I have to take chemo... I am 54, working fulltime, in school, 2 quarters away from completing a degree as a Nurse Practitioner and my plate is already way too full.  To have this... just not good.  I will push forward... I have no choice.  My mother died from colon and lung cancer 21 days after diagnosis... I will not let that happen to me!",

      "Content": "April 1 I went in for my screening mammo... long story short, after spot mammo, us, steriotactic bx, lumpectomy, re-excision.... I know find that I must have chemo, radiation and anti-hormone therapy. Stage 1 infiltrating mammary carcinoma. This has been a huge slap in the face as I was initially told that his looked like fibrocystic disease. Then told prob no chemo, ER+, PR-, HER2-... then boom the onco score came back Friday at 33! I am trying very hard to know that this could be much worse, but I cannot seem to stop the tears this weekend.  I cannot seem to shake it.  I am scheduled to have cytoxan and taxotere. Anyone have any pre-suggestions?",
