      "Content": "Hi Bahamasgirl, Let me start with I have been in your shoes! A mamo found a DCIS grade 0 (which is what DCIS is usually graded at from my understanding when it hasn't left the duct yet) and I had a lumpectomy with 33 days of radiation after. Depending on how fair skinned you are, you could blister at the site. Since you are having it done in 1 week instead of daily for 30+ days then I would expect a little blistering. Now there is another thing that I need to tell you... 1 1/2 years later, actually I was just about ready to start back to mammo's once a year instead of every 3 months, then 6 months... They found another DCIS tumor. It was the same breast, and since my mother died at age 40 from breast cancer, I had a bi lateral mastectomy...good bye girls! Now I also had what is called a tram flap during the surgery so I can have reconstruction at some point. I went to see a plastics surgeon and guess what! I can't have implants because of having the radiation done after the first surgery! Now what that means is that I can only have recon done with fat from my own body. Most of the time they take the fat from your stomach (you get a tummy tuck at the same time) but they can also use your shoulder area or the insides of your legs. Only one problem for me.....I can't gain enough weight for the surgeon to make anything bigger then an \"A\" cup. =( So I am still without breasts and eating everything that I see! It's been 1 year since the bi lateral and I've actually lost weight not gained it since then. I just need to keep working at it or give up and get an awesome tatoo. My tumor was 5cm and stage 2 this time. Best of luck to you. I just wanted to tell you about radiation and the recon factors. Take care, Kelly",

      "Content": " I was diagnosed on June 23, 2011 with invasive ductal cancer, stage1 estrogen/progesteren posative. It was an 8m tumor that escaped the ductal wall. I know that because I got the biopsy report and read it, researched it, and found out about quite a few things about breast tumors Bahamasgirl, you asked for help, and I think what you're really asking for is some kind of idea of what is going to happen. First off there are 2 kinds of breast cancer that are the tumor type. The one I had is fed from the female hormones, estrogen/progesteren. If you are post menopausal, your body will get the hormones from different sources other than your ovaries. Just FYI. Even from your fat! These types of tumors don't require chemo just surgery and RAD, then hormone blocking meds for 5 years. The other type is called HER2. Everyone has a HER2 gene, but some people have 2 of these genes and what they do is create new cells. If you have 2 of these genes, then one makes healthy cells and the other makes cancer cells. This is the one that requires surgery chemo and probably RAD and maybe meds too. I;m not sure about all that type requires as far as treatment goes. Your biopsy report is important because it will say which stage the tumor is (1,2,3 or 4) and what type it is as well. If you have the kind that I have (Estrogen/Pro posative), then I would be happy to tell you what I've gone through so far. If yours is the HER2 type, then one of the other ladies with that type would be better to explain each thing you go through and what happens. I'll check back and see what you've found out. Then if it is the same type cancer as mine, I'll post every little step that I just went through. Hopefully that will be helpful to you. Take care and you'll be in my prayers tonight. Kelly",
