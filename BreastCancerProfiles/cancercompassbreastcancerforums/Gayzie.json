      "Content": "Hi, Just answering your query regarding Arimidex. I have been on Armidiex since March 2005 and like it much better than Tamoxifen. It has less side affects for me. However, it is very difficult to pinpoint all the side affects because I have been diagnosed with \"Hypothyroidism\" caused by radiotherapy after a mastectomy after I was diagnosed with \"Invasive Ductal Carcinoma\" with lymph nodes involved. I had 6 months of chemotherapy. I had ray treatment after the mastectomy and also on my neck thus causing damage to my thyroid. Therefore, some of the side affects of hypothyroidism are similar to Arimidex. eg. wieght gain, swelling of hands, ankles or feet, feeling weak and sleepy, Thinning of Hair etc. It goes on and on. If hope that you find Arimidex agrees with you and I wish you luck in the future. We can only hope and pray!",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy in 2004. I had a 2.5cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma. I was 43 years old at the time.I went through chemotherapy and radiotherapy, skin infection, abscess and then what is called a wound sinis. All of this over a period from January to December. I started on Tamoxifen after I completed my radiotherapy which I took for 12 months. I found it terrible as far as the hot flushes and overheating were concerned. The summer months were the worst. I threatened to abandon my treatment so my Oncologist transferred me over to Arimidex. I have found Arimidex better for the hot flushes but worse for weight gain and fluid retention. I really don't know how good they are, but I pray everyday that they keep my cancer away. I know that the chemotherapy wiped out my ovaries and the ray treatment on my neck finished off my thyroid gland. I take Oroxine for my thyroid and I have since had my ovaries out as there was a cyst on one of them. Manopause has been a disaster for me and my husband and I get very frustrated with the male surgeons and oncologist that I see, as they have no idea and are not really interested in any of the aftermath of chemotherapy of radiotherapy!!! I hate being on Arimidex and I cannot wait to get off it in 2009, however I have to trust that it is for my own good. This is not what I thought my life would be like but I am very lucky to have a wonderful husband and we have have two teenage daughers to rear. I remember my husband saying, \"You can't leave me with these two girls to rear on my own, its all to hard, you are going no where\"!! I wish you all the very best with Arimidex. We just have to have faith.",

      "Content": "Linda, hope your new medication is working. I really don't think that we would be able to find anything better than Arimidex. I would consider going back to the old Tamoxifen as I certainly did not suffer from the bone pain that I have now however the hot flushes were intolerable so that is why I changed to Arimidex. One wonders weather we are doing the right thing. I too have had to have some anti anxiety tabs to help take the edge off the hot flushes. This has helped however God only knows what its doing to me. I just wish we could give them all the flick and get on with our lives. I actually take Oroxine for an underactive thyroid because the ray treatment wrecked my thyroid. I think this also has caused weight gain. Also Arimidex does cause high colesterol. I have just been diagnosed with high colesterol!!!!! I just think that I will take up drinking, smoking and gambling and chuck all my meds. You can't win. I suppose we are lucky that we are still here able to have this conversation. I will be going off my Arimidex in 2009 and I am counting down!!!Take care, talk again sometime. Gay",

      "Content": "Linda, I had a mastectomy 2 years ago grade 3/4. I have been taking Arimidex for 12 months and yes the side effects are something that I have had to put up with. Hot flushes, bleeding noses, thining hair, fatigue and weight gain!!I am soooooooo sick of it all. I would love just to go off all medication but can we take that risk???? Who knows??? It is so hard to make an informed decision. I guess its like life itself ( a gamble) Take care and I hope that you find your new drug better and that you do not suffer from the headaches too often. I am trying to raise two teenage daughters, hold down a job, and keep the house clean and tidy and my husband happy. It really is quite exhausting mentally and physically. I am 45 years old and feel like I am 90 year old. Take care Gay",
