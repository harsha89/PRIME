    "Content": "Okay, I don't know if anyone can help me or not but if someone could that would be awesome.  My right breast, which used to be my larger breast and now is smaller, started out with some wierd itching/stabbing pain inside the breast toward my sternum, took antibiotics, took antifungal, itching still there.  Now my nipple itches like crazy and is really painful it ius also slightly a different color than my left nipple.  On monday i found a ridge type mas right along my breast bone in my breast and the tissue there is thicker, this morning i found a pea sized lump right in the same area.  I have an ultra sound on wednesday but can get the results until the 18th.  Oh and the skin on the underside of my breast went numb this morning.  I was wondering if anyone ever had symptoms like those and if so what happened?",
