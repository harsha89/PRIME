    "Content": "My OB ordered a diagnostic mammogram after he did a manual breast exam on me. Has anyone else ever had this happen? He stated that the \"shelf\" of my left breast was significantly larger and more solid than my right breast. I was so blind sided that I really didn't ask a lot of questions. I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this and what to expect?",
