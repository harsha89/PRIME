    "Content": "Hi i am 17 and i have been having white discharge coming from only my right breast. And it is not milkey at all it is completely white. It only hapens when i sqeeze it. On other websites it tells me that it is normally  not bad if it only comes out when u sqeeze it but it IS bad if it only comes out of one breast. And there is not enough comming out at a time to test it sadley... it also says if there are any changes in apearence and my breasts have always been very \"perkey\" i guess u could call it but lately they have       gotten very saggy and seem to be getting smaller and            more shrivled looking.. along with that i have     also     had SAVERE headachs for a while now along   with a   sharp  pain at the base of my skull.. i have   also been extreamly tired all the time. Almost to the   point of falling over in the middle of school. I get very dissy and disoriented at times as well. And have been having very strange and viggoris heart beats as well at the most randome times. Along with some pain in my chest. I just got put of the hospital 2 months ago from having escaped air collecting in my chest cavity and under my skin. The doctors told me they had absolutly mo idea were it was coming from even after extensive testing.. I         recently have descovered that my hair is falling out    when i brush it. Literally there will be hair all over my   counter top after  brushing it for only a few seconds. All of these symptoms are extreamly confusing for me and im not quite sure what to do. I also have a history of all sourts of cancer in my family. My aunt just beat breast cancer and my other aunt and another uncle are fighting limphnode cancer right now. Those are just a few. I just would like to getting a better undrrstanding on what is goinf on. Any help it greatly appreciated!! :)",
