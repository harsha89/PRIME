    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with stage I breast cancer. I had left breast lumpectomy with lymph node removal/biopsy a couple weeks ago. Luckily, there were no cancer cells in the lymph nodes. The next step is radiation therapy. My dilemma is deciding whether I should choose prone position radiation treatment or supine position radiation treatment. I have already been to 2 radiation oncologists. One is very adamant about having the treatment in prone position and the other one is adamant about having it in supine position. I am at a loss. I have read that prone position benefits large breasted women. I am of petite completion with small breasts. Has anybody had to deal with a similar issue? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank youÂ ",
