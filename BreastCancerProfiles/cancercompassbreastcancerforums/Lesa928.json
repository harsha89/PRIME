      "Content": "Hello, I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in Oct. 2006.  It is a ER+, Her2/neuro+, and PR- type of cancer. I have undergone chemo, mastectomy and radiation.  I was taking Herceptin and Tamoxifen.  My last scans revealed cancer mets in my liver and brain and 3 new tumors have formed on my other breast.  I am currently undergoing whole brain radiation in an attempt to shrink the brain met.  I was just wanting to know if there is anyone else out there going through this or have already gone through this type of cancer and treatment. Any help and advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks!!!",
