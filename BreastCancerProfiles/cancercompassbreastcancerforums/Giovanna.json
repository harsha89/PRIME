Jodie   Dear Jodie,              I had breast cancer and we did remove the lump first then a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy and i was on herceptin for a year every 3 weeks and now I am fine.  Do not be afraid., you will be O.K.   And I am a 3 years survivor, May God bless you.  Norma   Norma: Thankyou for your reply, it does make a differance when a breast cancer fighter is able to speak with others in the same situation..   I am fearful of these chemo meds even though they are supposedly safe for the most part, there is always a small percentage of people who will experience the mentioned side effects, and unfortunately I worry about being in that percentage..  I dont want to have cancer and then compound that illness with heart disease too.. I only have one heart and would like to keep it healthy to help me fight this dreaded cancer disease..  I will check out this other website mentioned above.  I am in hopes that my dr. will put me through the necessary heart pretesting to make sure I am up to the challenge.  My heart has already been through alot of toxic chemicals in the past 6 months..  anyway, thankyou for responding so soon, it has helped me alot to feel more at ease.. I'm still not looking forward to more treatments when I was in hopes that there would be a 6 month interval in between them.  My original cancer in 01 was just stage 1, only a 1.6 ctmetr. tumor, with the usual A/C chemo and radiation.. it took 6 years for it to come back.  When it did it bypassed the axillary lymph nodes and went mets into the medistinum lymph chain.. dr. says it had to have spread before it was treated in 01..  and it having this her2 gene overexpression made it more aggressive in nature. but for some reason it stayed low for 6 years before a chest xray last May showed a lung nodule, and then one thing led to another and I found myself fighting a more serious form of this disease..  it is being stubborn too this time around.. I have had 4 cycles of the avastin/taxotere and still it has survived to start again.  Hopeing the herceptin will keep it in check.. thank you.. Jodie       Dear Jodie,             do not be afraid, the side effects are minimal and in the long run very good.  If you want keep emailing me and let me know your progres.  Love,  Norma",
