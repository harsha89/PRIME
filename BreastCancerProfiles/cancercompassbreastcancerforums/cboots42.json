      "Content": "Actually, radiation and chemo do work for some pancreatic cancers.  Every treatment is different for every patient.  My mother's pancreatic tumor was eradicated by CT scan after radiation.  It's not a common result, but it does (and did) happen.  I can't imagine where we would be be had she not had that treatment. I too believe strongly that the standard of care should be challenged.  The way clinical trials are run...they look at the population's response rather than the individual's response.  So, the standard of care may work for only 3 out of 10.  Sometimes drugs never make it out of clinical trials because they didn't help a large enough percentage of people with the disease.  Well, this isn't fair for the 3 that it did work for, right?  I'm all for anything that cures disease; whether it be chemo, radiation, targeted therapies or dancing around a bonfire counterclockwise three times.  Proper and ethical trials need to be run in order to determine efficacy and safety though.  Data is meaningful. Regarding \"big money\" and the Pharma companies, it's naive to think it's as simple as that.  R&D costs are phenomenally high.  I know many scientists at pharma companies who are there not to make the big bucks but to develop life-saving drugs and help patients.  I'm not saying they are perfect, they are not, but R&D isn't cheap.",

      "Content": "The 3/10 was just an example; I did not mean to imply that any pancreatic cancer treatment has a 30% \"cure\" rate, and I am unfortunately quite aware of the survival statistics for pancreatic cancer.  Most clinical studies do not follow patients long enough to determine whether the treatment \"cures\" the patient, but just whether there is a \"response\" over the course of some months.  \"Response\" is often defined as stable or regression of disease.  \"Cure\" is a tough one in cancer - most physicians consider you to be cured if you are cancer free for at least 5 years but you can only gather data like that for therapies that have been in use for at least 5 years. I'll check out the Kelmun protocol though, thanks!  I'm surely not against alternative treatments at all, but I do like to see what data backs them up. I also very much agree with you that the standard of care will fail many, many people.  I do understand though why physicians try these approaches first though.  They are more comfortable making a treatment decision based on something that has been studied, rather than something where there is no data available.  What if they try the latter and the patient doesn't respond when they would have responded to the standard of care?  They are typically unwilling to get creative until the best studied options have been exhausted.  They absolutely have to deal with medical malpractice lawsuits, as well.  Hopefully in the future there will be more tests that can be done on the individual to determine the best course of therapy, and maybe it's maple syrup and baking soda for some and radiation for others.  Different tumors become tumors for a variety of different reasons though, and there is no one cure for all cancers out there (though I do think one of the better contenders for a pan-cure is in the immunotherapy space). Fortunately for my Mom, the fact that radiation doesn't stop with the last treatment really helped her...she was able to receive the benefits of it for months afterward.  She had proton beam radiation, which delivers a higher burst of radiation to a more focused area, so she was fortunate minimize the amount of healthy, non-cancerous tissue that was exposed.  No side effects!  She traveled to France with me the week after her treatments were over! Best of luck to you!",
