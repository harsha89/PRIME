      "Content": "My message was also the first time to this site.  So far I have only had a little burning of my feet when I stand to long or walk for about a half an hour.  I am only on my third round of xeloda.  I am going away this summer for 3 months  and wondering what to expect.  When the syndrom occurs about how long does it take to clear up once your off the xeloda, and are you really immoblizie, as far as normal routine?  Sorry I took so long to reply I was away for 2 weeks no computer available.  Think positive, and all the best to you.    AMD Long Island, New York",
