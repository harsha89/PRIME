      "Content": "Hello, My mum has really bad neuropathy also. She finished chemo 3 months ago and she is stilll trying different pain relief methods. The intensity fluctuates greatly and sometimes it wakes her up at night. She is taking lyrica and has now added a small dose of amitryptiline.In my mums case she actually feels better when she is on the move but then she gets very tired so it is difficult. My mums oncologist referred her to a pain specialist - perhaps you could pursue this?  Hope you get some relief soon. God bless Debbie",
