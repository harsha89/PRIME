I had a skin and nipple sparing mastectomy on my right side 12 weeks ago after being diagnosed with DCIS. I was told that it was pre cancer and I would not need any chemo or radiation. I would only need tamoxifen for 5 years. I was suppose to start fat transfer reconstruction this week actually but thin...You have been through major physical and emotional trauma. You have the right to work \"through\" these feelings...just don't get stuck there. Sometimes a support group helps, sometimes low dose antidepressant...give yourself 15 min a day to be sad but then turn that energy (passion) into fighting/living/loving. Your life will get back to a \"new\" normal!!! Get a survivor buddy & hold each other accountable. Remember, cancer is just a bump in the road, not the end. CSH54",

No reason...it will rob today of the joys you might have sprinkled along the way. Are u willing to give up 5 yrs??? Take meds temporarily if necessary ... Do things that produce \" endorphins\"----normal mood elevators===plenty of Sleep, Sunshine, Exercise, Sex, and things that make u laugh....you will find joy again. C",

      "Content": "Nerves are either severed (and left causing electrical pain) which must be sealed shut and buried under the muscle. The other possibility usually is impingement or entrapment by normal scar tissue banding. Sometimes Myofascial release phy therapy can release scar tissue if caught early. Surgery can be done to release the entrapped nerve, wrap it in fat (forming something like a cardiac stent)..to prevent scar tissue compression. I know intercostal nerve blocks help some people but not me...that is a diagnostic test to see whether surgery will help. Check him out...each patient is different but he is an expert at neuro-anatomy and anomalies. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I had a mod. Radical mastectomy 2 yrs ago---woke up in recovery room with vice grip pain 24/7....not your typical post-op pain. I am a nurse so u think the time &attention your physician colleagues would extend to you. I have lived w severe pain and have run the gamut: one breast surgeon, 5 plastic surgeons, 2 acupuncture series of treatments, 3 pain doctors (& every painful procedure they could think of), long term medications (Neurotin, Cymbalta....), massage therapy, and two physical therapy groups. I have learned that the initial 2 surgeons \"techniques\" have not been used at John Hopkins since 1998!!! Top plastic surgeon at JHU took out my implant & created an autologous breast (DIEP) which relieved the pain from implant mistake. I have still been in pain a year later but spent the weekend w a neurosurgeon/plastic surgeon who discovered the \"cause\" of all my suffering & will operate in a few weeks!! During initial mastectomy, breast surgeon \"hacked up\" the major nerve branches under my armpit when doing axillary node dissection...not good. To be followed by the plastic surgeon cutting through all 3 major chest muscles (and nerves)...adding insult to injury. The serratus anterior muscle contains a lot of nerves in chest....technically leaving all these nerves ( like bare electrical wires) firing in my chest muscle 24/7!!! I was told by 2 docs I was crazy.... Please don't accept that u must live w PMPS...go see Dr Dellon in Towson, Maryland!!! Nothing will relieve neuropathic (nerve) pain except removing the cause. There is a great MD out there...dump the meds, the excuses, the lack of investigation by your MD. Your situation is NOT impossible...you just need the right doctor. CSH54",
