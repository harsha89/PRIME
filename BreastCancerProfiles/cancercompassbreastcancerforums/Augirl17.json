    "Content": "After a good report of scans in March, I have now received my Sept. results. NOt good.....back bones, neck , liver. My Doctor will start me on a drip next month......not chemo. I am confused.Worrie d about all of it but liver is frightenng. As I was alone , I feel now I have all the question. No more injections of Faslodex . I feel great. nothing hurts. I am confused, questioning faith and my sister has lung cancer...never a smoker . I have become her caregiver as she goes to radiation each day. I am at a lost. I do not know if I can an handle all of this. She has a son two hours away He has put it all on me and never even calls me to thank me. I am really at a low and questioning my faith plus is it worth living, I think of dying everday. I pray to die. I just needed to tell my story We have no family. Any ideas appreciated. Any thoughts on treatment?",
