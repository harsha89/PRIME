One lady in my support group mentioned cutting the pill (man, it is tiny though) in half and taking 2 does AM & PM helped her. I've started doing more with Omega 3 (fish oil) & glucosamine chondroitin recently. Don't know if it will help, but at least I feel pro-active!  Anyone tried this approach?  Laura  ",

      "Content": "Laura... I have been on arimedex for almost three years...still have \"heavy\" hot flashes 10-12 times a day and 4-5 at night..but my main complaint is joint pain in knees mostly.  Had minor knee surgery and new injection (Synvic) but still have discomfort, tho is much better.  I am interested in the long term effects of this drug.  If anyone knows please contact me.  I take effexor for hot flashes but not sure it helps, but if I don't eat chocolate and watch caffeine and spicy dishes (everything I love) I guess it's not too bad..( My husband says I need a new thermostat)  I'm just concerned about long term effects of arimedex.  ",
