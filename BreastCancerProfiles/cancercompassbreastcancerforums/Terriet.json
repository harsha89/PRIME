      "Content": "Anyone had a problem with having an extremely heavy period a few days following chemo?  In the last couple of hours have been passing some clots.  The on-call oncologist said really there is nothing I can do to help but that if I get to feeling really bad or the bleeding just won't stop to go to the emergency room.  He then said to call the office in the morning and that they will probably have me come in to check my levels.  Anyone have any thoughts on this or suggestions?  I am going to go get in bed and be still and hope that it lightens up in the next hour so I can feel comfortable to go to sleep.  In normal circumstances a heavy period wouldn't concern me as it is now.  Thanks for any suggestions!",

      "Content": "Just had first treatment of taxol.  Having severe abdominal pain and discomfort when urinating.  I have had about 2 qts of water today.  I am urinating so that is at least good.  So here we are the 4th of July and I don't know whether to call the 24 hour number to my oncologist.  I had to call yesterday because I was having facial flushing and swelling but the benadryl helped take care of that.  Anyone experienced this with taxol?  Also experiencing pain in the instestine with a lot of gas and loose stools.  The pain is sharp pain and achy pain and has been pretty constant now for 24 hours.  I'm exhausted.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and sentinal node biopsy on 1/30.  One of the nodes had cancer in it so on 2/27 they did a full axillary 1 node dissection.  Removed 15 more nodes (no others had cancer).  It has been 2 weeks and I still have the drain.  They said they would remove it once I have 2 days of draining under 30.  I have been right under 30 but at the beginning of last week, it started leaking quite a bit from the incision point.  I am wearing the special camisole and being very careful.  My husband helps me milk the tube when we drain it.  There seems to be some bloody tissue right at the top that is not coming down far enough to pinch it.  My nurse says it isn't clogged because I am still getting so much in the drain ball.  I am ready for this drain to be gone.  Any suggestions on the leaking?  Should I insist on going to see the nurse to have her look at it?  My husband just doesn't want it to get infected.  They didn't provide alot of instructions. Thanks",

      "Content": "I am interested in receiving the same information.  My diagnosis for invasive ductal carcinoma was received mid December.  I had a lumpectomy last Friday as well removal of the sentinal nodes.  I am waiting the pathology report so I do not have the oncotype dx rating or further information on the sentinal nodes.  They told my husband that they saw something suspicious in one of the nodes but they wanted to study it more before removing more lymph nodes.  I am anxiously waiting the results as I can't stand the thought of going back in for more surgery.  Right now the planned treatment is 6 weeks of daily radiation but I know the oncotype testing can change that.  I am curious also if anyone has chosen not to do chemotherapy and if there are other treatment options if there is cancer in the sentinal nodes.   I am 40 years old and a 2 year thyroid cancer survivor.  I have 1 aunt who had breast cancer at age 62 but that is it.  Very healthy family and I have always considered myself to be healthy.   How is your recovery going from surgery and radiation? Best regards!",

      "Content": "I am 40 yrs. old and was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in Aug 2006 with treatment being thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine treatment.  In December I was diagnosed with Stage 1 Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer (I can't remember the rest of the information on the diagnosis).  I am scheduled for a lumpectomy next Friday with at this point 6 weeks of daily radiation unless there is cancer in my lymph nodes.  There is no history of thyroid or breast cancer in my family.  Just curious if there are others on this board who have had thyroid and breast cancer.  I am being tested for Cowden's syndrome but from what I understand it is a very rare condition.  If anyone has read anything about links between thyroid and breast cancer I would be interested in reading that information.",
