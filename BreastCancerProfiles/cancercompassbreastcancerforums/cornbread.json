If I set more than five minutes I need help getting up,My arms hurt so much from pushing my self up,I think maybe I will get a lift chair.I can stand the pain but what hurts is not being able to go places as my feet stay swollen and hurt to stand on them for any lenght of time. I wonder how many more has these same problems, I would like to know as it may help me make amdecision.",
