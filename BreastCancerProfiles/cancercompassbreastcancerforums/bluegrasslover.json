      "Content": "greetings ~ It's been a month since my single mastectomy. I decided not to have reconstruction. Most of the swelling is down but my chest looks like crap. I am over weight but both ends have points and look like dog ears....it's lumpy above and below the incision line. I planned tro have a tatoo cover the area but it wwould have to be an ocean scene at this point! Feedback please!!!! Should I just give it time as I exercise and drop weight or look into plastic surgery. My insurance covers reconstruction so it might cover it. I didn't expect a lot, just a smoothe chest area . . . .  it's pretty upsetting.",

If he dropped you then he didn't have the right supportive attitude and you are better off getting a new Dr. I never expected the crap I've had to contend with in addition to getting my head around the concept of cancer. Best of luck to you.",

You have no need to know . . . . yes it is dispictable if she lied, but if she did, then what? Tell her if she needs a ride you would help but other than that,  look the other way....",
