      "Content": "Don't know if I would agree with your suregon.  4/05 I found I had Pagents of the nipple. Had mast 5/05 with 4 treatments of chemo. My nodes were clear.  Had reconst. started same time as the mast., with tissue expander put in at the same time.  Got final implant 1/06, with nipple reconst. 5/06.  I lead a very active life style too.  Taking care of our animals, carrying pails of water.  What I am saying is that my life style is back.  Yes it takes a little time to recover to say the least.  But you do what your gut tells you.  Might want to get a second from another doctor.  Can't say I agree with him, but that is my opinion.  Good luck to you. Wish you the best.",
