    "Content": "I'd like to know about the experience others have had in regard to aromasin side effects of insomnia, depression and anxiety. I have been on aromasin for about three months now, after rejecting Femara as impossible. I feel I am slowly sinking, and believe that it is the drug, not ordinary depression. I know these are listed side effects, but would like to hear if you have had this experience and what you have done. Thanks. ceegee",
