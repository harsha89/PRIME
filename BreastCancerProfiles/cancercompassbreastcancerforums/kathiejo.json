      "Content": "My oncologist warned me that constipation would be my worst side effect and he was right.  On the advice of a friend (an RN in oncology) told me to take 2 Senna stool softeners in the morning and 2 Senna -S (laxitives) at night.  I experienced only slight cramping on occassion, but found it made me regular.  I also drank lots of water and tried to walk when I was feeling up to it. Good luck - who would think with all we're going through that constipation would be so awful? Kathie Jo",

Thoughts and prayers to you as you begin chemo - with all the meds they give you, it too won't be as bad as you might imagine.    Kat",
