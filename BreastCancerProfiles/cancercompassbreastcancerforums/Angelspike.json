      "Content": "I read your message. I was diagnosed last February 2004 and it's been quite a ride. I tried Arimidex for two months but couldn't cope at all with those side effects. The doctor said the Femara would be better but I ache all over most of the time and the hot flashes makes me light headed. I also have a twitch in my eye which drives me crazy. I don't know how I'm going to continue with this drug. I don't want the cancer back but I feel like I aged 25 years since she put me on it back in October. I also get anxiety attacks because I keep thinking every ache and pain is cancer starting somewhere else.",
