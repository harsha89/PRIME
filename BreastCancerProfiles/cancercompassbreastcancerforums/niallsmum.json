When I last spoke with the breast consultant, she suggested that I might just have eczema on my nipple and to use cream on it. But it\u2019s still there after two years. And only on one nipple. Should I go back to see the consultant? I feel a bit silly if it\u2019s still only eczema.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I've had a really bad itch in my left nipple for about two months. I'm also extremely tired all of the time. My doctor sent me for a mammogram, which was clear. I then had an ultrasound and the doctor said that my lymph glands in my underarm were swollen, so she did a needle biopsy. I then spoke with the surgeon/consultant. She said that there is definitely 'something there' even though there is no lump. I asked if that ruled out cancer and she said not necessarily and to wait for the biopsy results next week. However, I have a gut feeling that there is something wrong. Does anyone know what it might be?",
