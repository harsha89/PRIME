    "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Invasive Breast Cancer, 2cms, ER+PR+ HER2-. The tumour has a Neoendocrine subtype and has been sent away to a specialist to be analysed so as to make sure I get the best treatment.Â  Has anyone ever had this type of tumour in their breast? It is very rare.....and that's all I know. I would appreciate any advice because I am kind of freaking out here!",
