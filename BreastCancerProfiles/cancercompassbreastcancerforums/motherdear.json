I've been there, am still in the process of being there, and am willing to help you in any way I can! I wish you the best.

I WAS with M.D. Anderson in Houston.  Two and a half years later, I found a lemon size tumor in my buttocks, and when they scanned me, they found one in my lung and one in my neck.  I did chemo (FAC) from September, and December 26th was my last one.  I got scanned a week later where nothing showed up.  I pray that it doesn't return and have been doing the cancer diet since September (lots of mushrooms, berries, and greens, and of course NO SUGAR).  I am now with Baylor, Dr. Kent Osborne, an amazing doctor for anyone looking for one.  If you google his name with Baylor after it, you can read a hundred of his websites,  He knows a lot about Triple Negative Cancer, which I have; I don't know if all of us with Metaplastic have Triple Negative.   Is Taxol recommended afterwards?  I have an appointment January 31 and I guess I'll find out the gameplan then, but at this point the plan is to keep monitoring me every two to three months. I am 45 with 5 kids and a great, supportive husband. Please e-mail me if anyone has any other info on this. Thanks! Terri - --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html--   I was diagnosed with metaplasic breast cancer in Oct 2007. I had a lumpectomy 11/27/07. In Dec I started Chemo adriamycin &cytoxan every other week to be followed by taxiol chemo for 4 weeks and then radiation (4) treatments. I have not met or talked to anyone with our diagnosis HER/2  or HER/3. Medical Science does not seem to know what exactly to do with us : )  I am 58 yrs old with 2 adult children and a husband  i have known since the age of 12yrs old. I would like to be around to see grandchildren. I wish you luck. If there are more  (METAPLASTIC BREAST CANCER) LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR STORIES SINCE OUR CONDITION IS SO RARE!!!    ",
