    "Content": "Hello: My Inflammatory Breast Cancer (State IV)has flowed into my bone (spine) and lungs. Anybody out there been or in my situation? Am 58, have been thru 1 year of AC and CMF, then radical mastectomy, 1 year of remission on Arimidex and now have to make decisions of where next. Onchologist suggests several options: Taxotere or AC regeime again, or Xelode. Any comments of side effects-v-success rate or whatever would be an enormous help. I have to make decision within next week. THANKYOU",
