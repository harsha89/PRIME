    "Content": "Hey all, My name is Kyle, and one of my best friends has started a grassroots project to raise awareness with breast cancer after learning of her aunt's diagnosis. I think that the simplicity of this is truly wonderful and would really encourage you to contribute! Even small voices and actions add up to create a single, unified voice to give hope and encouragement to those who are in need of it! Below I have copied information about her project. I hope you can help her out - all it takes is a quick message on a sheet of paper, the flash of a camera, and the sending of a simple email. I wish you all well. Please take care of yourself! Warmest regards, Kyle A message from a friend:       PLEASE REBLOG (And send around however possible) Hey Everyone, Right now, my aunt is suffering from breast cancer, and it has inspired me to get involved with the fight for a cure. I want to try and make a short film promoting breast cancer awareness. It won't be anything super professional, but it would be amazing if you'd contribute. All I ask is that you do one or more of the following: Take a picture (wearing something pink, preferably) holding a sign/poster type thing briefly telling how breast cancer has affected your life. Make a short video, approximately 1-2 minutes max., (again, preferably wearing something pink) telling how breast cancer has affected your life Circulate this post however you can. Reblog, copy and paste, email around, tweet, etc. Anything. Once you've done this, send the file to me via email at pink.awaren ess@live.ca   PLEASE ENSURE you give me the following information in your email: - Your first name - Your age - Your location (Town/City, Province/State)   Depending on the number of people who respond to this, not everyone is guaranteed to make it into the video, but I promise I will acknowledge everyone who contributed. Anyone can take part in this, I would really appreciate it if you would. Thanks.",
