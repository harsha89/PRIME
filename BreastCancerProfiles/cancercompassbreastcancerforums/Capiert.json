With older age we become weaker, neglecting our diet. Breuss was against recooked food, probably because if left days, infections also brewed; but he thought the nutrition was less, making us weaker. Linseed oil (omega_3) is anti_infectious, used by artists for years, without rotting, as a \"glue\" for the colored powder pigments. Omega_6 can go rancid easier. Milk will cause problems: this best food, has all 3: \"carbs\", proteins, fats; & balance 3% each, & that's the problem. Many (unwanted) things will (also) grow on it, too.
