    "Content": "Hello all posters,  I know where  you all are coming from.  Last Thursday July 3rd, 2008 I lost my mother after an 8 year courageous battle with bladder cancer, that moved into her lymph nodes and various bones.  She fought til the end when she just couldn't anymore.  I am 38 years old and have been with my mother ever since I was born.  We decided as an adult since I was still single that she would move in with me and save some cash - looking back I wouldn't have changed a thing.  I got to have a best friend, someone to argue with and someone around that would love me unconditionally regardless.  The last year of her life we fought more because I felt she was giving up when in reality she was trying not to be a burden but her body wouldn't let her go.  At the beginning of June we were told by her team of doctors that they would not have her go through anymore treatments of chemo because it had reaked havoc on her body.  From this point on we inlisted the aide of open hospice nurses which were great.  I think this gave alot of comfort to mom knowing that the burden wasn't entirely on me and that I do things and not worry (even though I didn't do that and wouldn't leave her side).  When people talk about how quickly things progress, my story is that exactly.  Just on Monday and Tuesday, June 30th and July 1st, mom was sitting up doing her checkbook joking with me about how well she was and how good she felt.  Then on Wednesday morning she woke up completely out of it.  I couldn't get her to focus I had thought she had taking too many pain meds.  I called the hospice nurse because she was sweating terribly and complained of abdominal pain.  They thought it could be more cancer and wanted to get her comfortable.  On Thursday morning she was worse, just moaning and staring up like her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  We got her comfortable and at this poing the nurse knew this was bad.  We ordered a morphine drip to start that evening because she was unable to take pills because she couldn't sit up.  I held her hand, cryed terribly and told her to let go, that I was fine and she needed to be at peace.  I know she didn't want to be a burden and knew that I would go to any lengths to not put her in a home (her parents both died very young in nursing home type of settings).  She just looked at me as if she was scared, moaned a little and looked up to the sky like either she didn't recognize me or that she couldn't look at me.  She passed on about 3 hours after they got the morphine drip in place.  The oncall nurse told me that her body was most likely free of pain and she could let go.  I really hope she went without pain because just seeing her like that for 36 hours KILLED me inside.  I spent the entire weekend in a blur - still basically am.  I am trying to keep myself busy but there is only so much you can do before you just crash and burn.  I am going back to work tomorrow and hopefully that will help.  My house feels so empty now... I look around and still think she is coming back.  I can't grasp the fact that I will never see her walking through my door again.  Thank you for letting me share my story - there is only so much your friends can understand if they havent' gone through it.   Prayers and thoughts go out to all those that have gone through this. HUGS TO ALL!",
