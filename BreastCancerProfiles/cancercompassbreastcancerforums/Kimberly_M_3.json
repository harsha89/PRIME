      "Content": "Lynn S., I had breast cancer in 2002, I am also taking tamoxifen, but I don't look at it with the same attitude as you. It is not a daily reminder to me of cancer, but more of a preventative that I am more than happy to take if it will keep the cancer from coming back. I don't dwell on what happened to me, I am happy to be alive and moving on with my life. Also I would not like a monthly pill as I would be more likely to forget to take it on time.",

I was told that I would be on these drugs for a total of five years. Now, my doctor tells me that I can stay on Aromosin for five years. I'm concerned that maybe these drugs might be doing harm that we don't know about - but at the same time I want to do all I can to prevent the big C from returning. I have had joint aches, back pain, sadness (on and off), tiredness and just not feeling \"good\" since going through this cancer experience (chemo, radiation). I'm curious if some of these feelings will go away if I stop taking the aromosin. I don't know what to do -- keep taking it, or stop. Any thoughts? My heart-felt wishes go out to all of you on this message board. Thanks for reading my message and for your thoughs. Hi,  I am 4 yrs out and after taking tamoxifin for 3.5 yrs I was put on Arimidex, bad side effects for me so was changed to Aromasin.  I experienced the same side effects that you are discribing and my Oncologist took me off of that too and back on Tamoxifin (he says for 1 yr).  I feel ten times better than when on Aromasin.  I hope you find the answers you are looking for and hope you are feeling better soon.",
