    "Content": "I so hope you enjoy your day by the window with your kitties.  So often we are so consumed by other things that its easy to forget to enjoy simple treasures each day offers.  I use to hate the wind....it messed up my hair, it didn't feel good, and so on....then one day I thought to myself that the wind is kind of like being hugged by G-d.  From that point on I haven't minded the wind quite so much.  Hugs, Rosa ",
