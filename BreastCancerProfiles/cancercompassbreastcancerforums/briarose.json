      "Content": "Dear tre, i'm responding to you because i know you've educated yourself (and us -- thank you) extensively on this subject. I've been on arimidex for 16 months -- managed side effects of joint pain with high dose glucosamine/chondroitin/msm and vaginal atrophy with topical high lignan flaxseed oil (thank you again). But now i've fallen and sustained a colles fracture of the radius bone in my right wrist which the docs tell me is diagnostic of osteoporosis regardless of bone density scan results. Apparently dexa scans can't tell the difference between calcium deposits caused by osteoarthritis, which i have, and calcium that is present in normal healthy bones. Of course fractures are a known risk with arimidex, and i'm ready to stop taking it, because i'd rather risk recurrence than live the rest of my life with bones of glass. I slipped on a pile of mud in a parking garage, put out my hand instinctively to break my fall, and my wrist snapped like a twig. I absolutely refuse to take bisphosphonates for bone less, as i'm horrified by their side effects as well, and the bone growth they promote isn't even healthy bone. Instead i'm taking vitamins d3 and k, plus a nonradioactive form of strontium, as per recommendation of my acupuncture/herbal medicine doctor and my own web research. But my question is this: if i stop arimidex, can the damage to my bones be reversed, or is it too late? The reason i agreed to take a in the first place is that one of seven sentinel nodes removed during mastectomy for stage iib invasive ductal ca had two suspicious cells that were \"lost to further study,\" i.e. the pathologist screwed up, and my cancer was missed, though present, on routine mammogram six months before it was finally found. I'm 58 years old, have no family and very little support. I am going through hell with this fracture that has rendered me functionally paraplegic until it heals. My quality of life is far worse than post mastectomy. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. My fear is that it's too late to reverse the damage to my bones, and that i will survive cancer only to sustain repeated fractures and end my life as a cripple in a nursing home. I wish to god i'd never heard of this horrible drug. I've been taking calcium citrate with magnesium and vitamin d since i was 30 because i have a strong family history of osteoporosis. I went through natural menopause at 48 with dexa scan revealing minimal bone loss in the first two years, but stable after that, so i thought i'd dodged the bullet until now. I never had much faith in western pharmaceuticals which seem to fix one problem only to cause several others. I don't trust doctors who are at best brainwashed and at worst being paid off. Each of us must make our own decisions based on whatwe feel is right for us. My best wishes to all of you, whatever you decide. Elizabeth",

It is hard now to spend 20 miles on a bike let alone 75.  So I tried to take up running.  That is going pretty good but amazingly, I find that even by just running 10 miles, my vaginal skin gets aggravated.  I haven't had a mate for years  but am sure that when I am lucky enough to be blessed with one, sex will be painful.  A lttle rubbing in that area puts holes and tears in the skin that hurt for a week or two.  Yadda, yadda, you get the idea.  My gyn is aware of the problem and a few years ago she cut the skin where the clitoris is because it was fusing over.  The skin just fused together again.  I am not even sure what I am supposed to lok like down there anymore but I am sure it is all out of whack.  I now see ads for labia surgery.  Most of it is meant to be cosmetic but I am hoping there will be some available to me that will give me comfort.  Does anyone know if this condition will improve when I stop taking the Femara?  Right now, my gyn says there is nothing she can give me to treat it while I am on the drug.  So what can happen surgically and medication-wise when I am done with the Femara.  I can't wait. Woozz Hi Woozz, and others responding to Woozz, Obviously there is a huge controversy over whether or not to use some small amount of estrogen to relieve vaginal atrophy caused by breast cancer treatment chemically-induced menopause.  That's unfortunate, because the pain is very real and women who suffer from it need a remedy that works. I have suffered from vaginal atrophy caused first by natural menopause, and then a hysterectomy for cancer, and THEN herbal aromatase-inhibitor and estrogen-blocker treatment for metastatic estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.  (The prescription anti-estrogen drugs make me very ill, so I am taking a well-researched, self-designed anti-estrogen herbal regimen, It's not prescription, but it still causes estrogen depletion severe enough to result in vaginal dryness and a lot of pain.) I have done extensive research on phytoestrogens  and their effect on breast cancer.  Many clinicians are coming to the the conclusion that very strong phytoestrogens, like soy, can be used by cancer cells for growth, whereas very weak phytoestrogens - like quercetin, and flax lignan - can act as estrogen-blockers, thus depriving cancer cells of their estrogens.  Once I realized that my pelvic pain might be in large part due to drying of delicate vaginal tissues, I asked my family doctor if she thought a non-prescription low-strength phytoestrogen salve might be effective to replenish moisture and restore elasticity without feeding my cancer.  She said give it a try, that the phytoestrogen would work locally but doubtful such a small amount would make a difference systemically, and getting relief of this pain is very important. so I did more research and came up with my own remedy for vaginal dryness.  Flax seed is very often recommended as a phytoestrogen supplement to alleviate menopause symptoms, so I took a close look at flax oil.   The lignans from flax seed hulls contain low-strenth phytoestrogens that have actually been shown in clinical trials to work against breast cancer.  I found a flax oil that contains the lignans - Barlean's Organic Flaxseed Oil (there are others on the market, but Barleans is what I can buy here.)  I mix no more than 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of Barleans with at most a tablespoon of vaseline, and I apply enough of it to cover my fingertip vaginally as needed. This mixture has worked so well, that while at first I was using it several times a day, within 2 months I was using it at most once or twice a week. Flax oil should be kept away from light, and it needs to be refrigerated or it will turn rancid.  I refrigerated my flax/vaseline mixture at first, but discovered it got very watery and then didn't work as well.  Now I mix only as much as I will need for 7 - 10 days and keep it in an air-tight container in the medicine cabinet, away from light.  I make sure to use clean hands when applying it, and I've had not problems with infection or irritation.  If I have any suspicion that the oil is going bad, or that the mixture may have been contaminated, I simply throw it away, clean my container vigorously with soap and hot water, and mix some more.  Very simple, very easy, and very cheap. In seeking herbal treatment for fibromyalgia, I found something mostly used in traditional chinese medicine that I think has also contributed to restoring my  delicate pelvic tissue health: white mulberry leaf extract, or just plain mulberry leaf.  So much of women's diets today make our bodies very acid, and that is really not good for our urinary tracts and reproductive tissues.  Urinary tract irritation and drying can contribute to vaginal irritation, so it makes sense to take good care of our bladders.  White mulberry is very alkaline, acts as an agent to leach out toxic crystals that irritate the bladder, and makes the urine more alkaline.  I have not been able to find any indication of side effects to mulberry leaf, although I would recommend not taking it if you KNOW you are allergic to mulberry, or if you get a rash or have problems breathing after starting to take the supplement. I take standardized white mulberry leaf extract when I can afford it - 500mg of mulberry leaf, plus iminosol and quercetin/isoquercetin which both help my FMS , twice a day.  If I need to save a little money, I just get the mulberry leaf and take one cap twice a day.  It still provides 500 mg mulberry per capsule, but the iminosol and quercetin are not listed on the label.  Two caps a day is the  recommended dose per the product label - it seems to work pretty well for me. I could only find mulberry leaf extract online, and only 3 or 4 places that carry it, I'll give the name of my supplier, but if it is deleted when I post, if you will message me privately with your email address, I will send the url to you.  I get my mulberry and most of my other herbs and supplements from swansonvitamins.com.  They offer great discount prices and excellent service. As for my cancer, my PET scan a few weeks ago looked promising, so I really have no worries that my use of a tiny little bit of flax oil very infrequently is counter-productive to my herbal regimen against cancer.  and it's great to be able to sit for a while, or to pee, etc, without hurting! I hope this information will help some, or all of you.  If you have questions or comments, please feel free to private message me. Sincerely,  Tre  ",

      "Content": "Thank you, Tre, with all my heart, for your suggestion about local application of high lignan flaxseed oil. I've been on Arimidex for 1 1/2 years following mastectomy for stage IIB hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Not only had my sex life gone completely down the tubes; my vaginal tissues were so irritated that it hurt to sit down for any length of time. My oncologist and my surgeon both were willing to prescribe an estrogen cream because my symptoms were so severe, and were not helped by the usual OTC moisturizers -- they said it's a quality of life issue -- but for me its a life and death issue, and I am not willing to ingest estrogen or even a strong phytoestrogen like soy. I love my life, and if I had to live it lying down or standing up, and celibate, then so be it. But I kept looking for alternative solutions, and I am so happy to have found yours. After conferring with my doctors, I started doing as you suggested about two weeks ago. The only thing I'm doing different is that I'm using K-Y Jelly instead of Vaseline because I am sensitive to petrochemicals and I was afraid I might have a reaction. I am ecstatically happy to report BIG improvement in just two weeks. I'm using the high lignan flaxseed oil/KY combo every other night and Replens vaginal moisturizer on alternate nights. Already my tissues feel less fragile and more responsive than they have in years, even before Arimidex -- so much so that I was actually able to enjoy lovemaking with my partner, with only minimal discomfort near the end. I'm sure even this will diminish if not disappear with continued use. When there's a will, theres a way! I know sex is not everything, and to me not worth risking recurrence of my cancer, but I honestly don't feel, after reading the research, that I am putting myself at risk -- and yes, my quality of life is much enhanced by the return of physical intimacy...not to mention being able to sit comfortably. I'm even going to get my bicycle reconditioned and get out there and enjoy these beautiful spring days. Good luck, ladies. My very best to everyone. Elizabeth",
