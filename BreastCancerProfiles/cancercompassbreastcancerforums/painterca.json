    "Content": "I'm so sorry that you and your wife have to fight this battle again. I have primary angiosarcoma of the breast and have found an online community through facebook with many other angiosarcoma survivors.  We discuss treatmens, side effects, general experiences and sometimes just life in general. Your wife has many available options for treatment, please either join our group or have her join so you can gain from the collective experiences of many of us going through this same terrible ordeal. On facebook, it's angiosarcoma cancer. We also have a charity that we set up and links to useful information regarding angio at angiosarcomaawareness.com Please tell her that she is not alone, we're here for her, going through the same thing, looking for the same answers and finding comfort and solace in each others wisdom.
