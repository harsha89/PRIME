    "Content": "I too had side effects on taxatere. After two treatments both my hands and feet turned a dark red/purple color and then the skin began to peel of off them. The dr. put on 75% for the 3rd treatment. It got so bad that I could not walk or use my hands. They did not give me the final treatment as by that time I would have refused it. I had no more chemo after that. I just moved on the the radiation. I had stage IIB with 1 positive lymph node.",
