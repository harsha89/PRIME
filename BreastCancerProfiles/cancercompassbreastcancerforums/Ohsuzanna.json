      "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 4 months. I was told to lose weight because this will help my cancer from returning-something to do with fat and hormones. Just can't get the weight off and am even gaining weight. I am vegan and exercise and have not been eating enough to gain. Yes my feet hurt bad, i have difficulty getting up from sitting and squating. My hips are not as flexable and i hurt. My ankles swell too. After i am up walking say 20-30 steps i seem to loosen up and is not as painfull. My oncologist says that the first 3-4 months will cause pain but sometimes it subsides. I had a partical masectomy in Dec. 2005 and radiation in Feb. 6 weeks. I elected not to have chemo. I had the ONCO test and was scored at 18 which is right on the line to have the chemo. I want to take the arimidex if this will keep the cancer from coming back but not if it is going to weaken me phsically and give me bone problems, weight gain and constant pain especially if it continues to get worse. Any thoughts out there? Ohsuzanna!",
