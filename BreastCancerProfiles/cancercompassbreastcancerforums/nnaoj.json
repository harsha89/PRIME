Don't worry too much about the chance of hair loss with Femara...it probably won't happen to you...even if it did...we are still here.  Best of luck to you with your treatment.  Keep your chin up and enjoy every day with or without hair. Best Regards, Linda Lou Thanks Linda for the quick response.  it is not so much loss of hair I am worried about; I do not have my hair back yet after chemo - it did not even start to come back as I am still suffering of the effects of the Taxol I had - I just wonder if it will have a chance to come back with having to start on the Femara immediately.  I know it is for the best: my tumour was oestrogen, progesteron and HR  (  is that what it is called, I am not sure!) receptive and it was the second time I had it, but the idea of never getting my hair back is very unattractive as I can not wear a wig without getting a headache.  I suppose I'll just have to wait and see and hope for the best.  At least your hair came back when still being on treatment and that gives me hope. Take care of yourself, and thank you again for finding the time to think about me,  all the very best, Annemarie I am sorry about your hair...I understand as I too am bald from the chemo . I have a fine halo of fuzz all over my head now yet I am so desperate for my hair to grow back....this has been a very hard experience. I hope it all works out for you and your hair grows back even better than before.   joann  ",
