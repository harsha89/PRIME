    "Content": "I have a cousin who was diagnosed in May with tubal bc. she has already had a masectomy and is taking chemo and radiation. She is 50 y\\o. This is my second, 1st cousin with breast cancer and my mother died of inflammatory carcinoma at age 52. It seems to be a very genetic cancer....obviously. does anyone know much about having an elective double masectomy to prevent this horrible cancer. Steph",
