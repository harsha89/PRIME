    "Content": "Hello Shrlaud, I was writing you a reply to your first post. Wow I can't beleive this is the same person. I wanted to tell you I'm glad you wrote what you did back in 2011, because I think you might have open a few eyes. I am not a cancer PT but I have had taken care of my husband who died 2010 of bladder cancer and bone cancer. He was only 44 and I was left with a 2 year old and a 11 year kids. I hate everything and everybody. I didn't notice the date you wrote that but I was going to give you my phone # so if you needed to talk I would be able to listen  to you. My dad was told he had lung cancer May 7 and passed away July 23 2013. I was able to go take care of him the last month an a half to help my step mom or he would had to go to a nursing home. So I can't say I know what your feeling but I can say I am the person in that post 2011. I lost a BF while all this was going on with my dad, She tells me I'm sorry you lost your father but you can't be mean to people and think it just going to be ok. So I guess my best friend was nothing but a fake. Sorry to poor my story on you but I looked when the last time you posted something and found this. I hope your doing good and my heart goes out to you. I hope I can find myself not hating the world and be normal... But looking at myself it's gonna be a long time for that. Take care Alison",
