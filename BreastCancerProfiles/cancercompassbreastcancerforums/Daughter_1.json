    "Content": "I'm am so sorry to hear of your mother's death.  I will be going through the same thing in the next few months.  She has been diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer, they have surgically removed 90% of her stomach but cancer cells were found in her lymph nodes and liver.  The oncologist is only giving her 3-6 months to live.  She is 86 years of age and up until this all started about 6 weeks ago, was very healthy physically although her mind was going.  When you spoke of building a shrine on your mantle, I felt compelled to let you know what I plan on doing when my mother passes.  My mom taught me love of flower gardening... even if it is just a little strip around the house.  So, on the day of her death and on each anniversary thereafter, I plan to buy either a day lily or iris and plant it in a corner of my garden.  This will be Mom's Garden... a place for me to sit and remember fond memories of our time together.  I told my mom of my plans and it brought a smile and a small tear to her eye even though I'm sure she didn't remember it 5 minutes later.  I hope your mantle shrine brings you peace.  Daughter #1",
