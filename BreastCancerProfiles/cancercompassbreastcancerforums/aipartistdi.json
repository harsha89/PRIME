    "Content": "Sunnygirl in Feburary 2008 I was diagnosed with stage III 2 node invation ifiltrating ductile carcinoma/Her2+. I was 44 years old. Had double mastectomy with reconstruction and nipple reconstruction with areola tattooing. Treatment has been tomoxifin for 2 months could not tolerate then switched to Arimidex every other day with Lupron shots every three months. No chemo because I was hormone receptor positive. My total therapy has been 2 an a half years now. But just recently the Arimidex has reached new heights of side affects to the point of me taking other meds to combat the side effects. To many meds quality of my life was getting really bad.I decided to go off the Arimidex for a month of course all side effects are gone but the doctors recommend that 5 years is teh magic number for me. So now I am headed to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute at Faulkner Hospital in Boston. There is a great Doctor there I met in the begining of my treatment and sent me to another wonderful doctor at the Megee Womens hospital in Pittsburgh PA. Between the information that I recieved from both doctors and my own research my treatment has been effective up until now. So I am heading back to the Dana Farber Cancer center in Boston to get this doctors opinion. The Faulkner hospital in Boston gets more information on breast cancer form other contries other that the US so they can give you more up to date data on medication therapy and there effectiveness so you and your doctor can come to a better comprehensive treatment for your specific desease. If any one would like the names of these doctors I will be happy to give them to you. Cancer is a nasty desease but if we find the best treatment we are comfortable with and it makes sense to us we are more apt to go the duration. Once you have all the facts infront of you you can feel that YOU are making the best decision you can for yourself and then let it go and live your life. You have done the best you can do for yourself thats all you can do.",
