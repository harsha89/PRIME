    "Content": "Lisa,  i have  late stage 3 breast cancer. I also have had bilateral radical mastectomy. My husband of 37 years has divorced me. He was a nightmare. Told me i smelled, said he could catch cancer from me. He also told me it was100% my fault called me a loser wished i had died and stated if he could kill me with a push of a button he would. This was when i was under going surgery chemo and radiaton.      i have been away from him almost a year. I can wake up with out crying. I feel good about my self. I pray every day. God has sent so many good people my way. It is very difficult but i must make the most of each day. Don't talk to him or surround your self with people who can't or won't support you. Get a good lawyer and pray every day.                                                          love trisha ",
