    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with breast cancer on March 26, 2018. I've had 2 surgeries one April 16 and one April 23. I will but starting radiation treatments in about a week. They put me on Arimidex on April 30. I have been having chills for the past few days. I don't have a fever, highest was 99.3, but has been normal lately. I'm not sure what the chills could be from. I normally have sweats, which I still get off and on. Has anyone ever had chill issues? Thank you",
