      "Content": "I don't blame you for being stressed out - you should not have to worry about bills on top of all your treatments. I had the exact same diagnosis - 4 years ago and today - so far - I am fine. I am from British Columbia, Canada and everything for cancer is paid for by our medical services plan (goverment run). Still, as a single mother with a mortgage I was off work for a year and could not pay my mortgage.  My friends arranged a silent auction and dinner and raised enough for me to live on.  That took away a lot of the extra stress. I wish you the best of luck - but have faith in your friends and family and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.  People come together in a time of need.       ",

      "Content": "I had a aggressive form of breast cancer four years ago. I had chem and radiation treatments. 4 months ago my thyroid gave up and now I am on syndroid. Yesterday, I was diagnosed with having a Cornea Ulcer. Two different physicians told me the same thing - my immune system is fighting good things in my body now. Has anyone else experienced this?  Should I be concerned with what is going to happen next? Right now these little things are minor annoyances but I worry about my immune system attacking other good things that I need to live. I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks Colleen",
