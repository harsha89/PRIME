    "Content": "Here's a well-written first-person account of finding and dealing with a breast lump, posted on a citizen-journalism website... Â http://www.orato.com/node/2626 Quote: \"I first discovered The Lump when I was about 18 years old. It was in my left breast, over my heart. I\u2019d recently been through a tumultuous adolescence, and so, still shaken, I was convinced I had cancer. I knew I was technically too young to have breast cancer, but the trauma of my teen years convinced me that I was one of the unlucky ones. I went to the doctor. She had trouble detecting it with her hand and said it was likely just fibrous breast tissue, which is normal. Unconvinced, I located it with my fingers and guided her fingers to it. It was her turn to be unconvinced. She said it felt fine, so of course I moved on to other anxieties. From that point on, every time I was stressed, I\u2019d feel a pinching pain over my heart in my left breast, which I attributed to paranoia.\"",
