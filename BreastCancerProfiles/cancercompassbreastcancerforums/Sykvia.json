      "Content": "I was diagnosed with bc one year ago.  Had a lumpectomy.  The lump was 2.5 centimeters.  Then had chemo and radiation.   I toyed with the idea of mastectomy, but was encouraged by my doctors to do only the lumpectomy.  I am so glad I did.  The chemo was worse than the radiation.  During radiaion, I used the gel they gave me repeatedly throughout the day.  My last radiation treatment, the doctors could not believe that my skin looked so good.  I, too, sunburn easily.  September 3 was my last radiation treatment.  I still have the \"tan\", but am doing very well.    ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer January 2008; had biopsy and lumpectomy.  Subsequently we did the genetic testing, which I did mainly for my daughters.  I have strong cancer tendencies in my family.  Both of my sisters, who are younger than I have died from cancer.  I thought I was going to be the lucky one, but no such thing. I am glad I did the testing as it showed me I did not carry the gene and therefore, my daughters did not have it either.  I did not have it because of mastectomy.  As far as insurance paying for it.  I have two insurances.  One of them paid and the other one did not.  Ask your genetic testing people to verify coverage before you do the testing and get the name of the individual who tells you what that coverage is prior to doing the testing.  Good luck. ",
