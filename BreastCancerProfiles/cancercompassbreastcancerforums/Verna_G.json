    "Content": "I was told by a nurse that alternative treatments usually work if you stay on them, but if you stop juicing or taking the supplements, the cancer will start to grow again. I know a lady who did the juicing and her tumor disappeared. However, after she quit juicing the tumor came back and she has since passed away. Another thought, I am taking Fosamax along with the Arimidex, because it is important to help prevent bone loss.",
