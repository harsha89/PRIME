      "Content": "I have hormone related ovarian ca (GCT)--occurrences2001, 2007, 2009, and 2012.  Also had a breast DCIS in 2008.  The hormone secreting GCTs probably caused the breast ca.  Went on Arimidex because of the 2009 GCT recurrence and had progressively increasing joint stiffness-pain.  Switched to Femara (Letrozole) when the 2012 recurrence was discovered.  So far so good this year! On Femara the past 2 years I've had minimal side effects so have found it much easier to be on than Arimidex.  It's also a little more successful in most of the studies.  SO-- might be worth a try to see if you have less problems on this.  Also found the generic Letrozole much cheaper than the Arimidex.

      "Content": "Try it for sure.  I was on it for 2-1/2 yrs for an ovarian cancer (GCT) until I recurred.  Joint pains were becoming a problem by then.  Switched to letrozole (Femara) which has kept me tumor free for over 5 yrs now.  Also much less joint pain.  Others have more problems with letrozole.  They are in the same class of drugs but are not the same.  If your tumor is ER+ your survival odds will be improved by taking one of these.",
