    "Content": "Question about breast cancer scare. I am 42 and went over 2 months ago for one of those mobile ultrasounds given by herscan. It came back clear. I am not really buying it. Here is the background. I noticed 2 lumps before the scan in upper inner right quadrant on right breast. They feel kind of like hard beans.It caused that part of my breast to be sore as well. My right breast is larger now and swollen. It kind of \"hangs\" lower about a 2 cm.   This started about 4 months ago. I also suddenly started to feel like a \"presence\" in my right armpit a little over a month ago.  Maybe it is swollen. That is pretty constant and above my right breast under collar bone has become thickened and tender. This is the newest symptom. It is kind of swollen. If I press on armpit, breast, or upper chest it is sore for days. I also have some faint soreness down my right arm like the bicep inner elbow area. I also notice my right breast can become flushed by heat much easier and lasts longer. What I don't have: dimpling, discharge, skin changes (except easily flushed). I have an appointment on Wednesday, but insurance doesn't kick in until January. Getting a clear ultrasound makes me feel paranoid. What else could this be?",
