      "Content": "Thank you for the prayers! Through all of the panic and fear my daughter found away to make a positive.  She is a cheerleader and cheers with young ladies from the age of 15-18.  My daughter & I told her coach what was going on and explained she would not be able to cheer for about 2 weeks after the lump is removed. (the lump is located on a muscle near her under arm...obviously tumbling and lifting is out for awhile) anyway her coach was concerned and surprised. She is a young woman herself (probably 26-ish) anyway she stated it wasn't something she even thought of often.  My daughter and her coach took 15 minutes at the end of last nights practice to share my daughters story and talk about breast self-exams.  Amazing how many of the young women had no clue!!  No matter what happens with my daughter she feels great that she was able to help 20 other teens understand the importance of breast awareness.  Guess no matter how bad and scary things seem, there is always a positive!   ",

      "Content": "Hi, I was hoping someone could help.  Has anyone ever heard of or known of any teenagers with breast cancer?  My 16 years old daughter has a solid mass in her breast that will be removed in a couple of days.  I'm very nervous for her.  I am not finding to much information regarding teens and breast cancer.   I was told that it would be rare but could happen.  My daughter has an extensive medical history consisting of a kidney disorder, hypothyroidism, major menstrual problems, heavy prolonged bleeding, cysts on the ovaries and painful cramping. Recently she had to have her gallbladder removed as it only was functioning at 5%.  Her great-grandmother had breast cancer and both of her grandparents passed away at an early age of cancer.  I worry because my daughter has had her share of illnesses, most of which people don't get until later in life.  My rational mind tells me it is very unlikely...however I can't stop feeling panic.  Fear for her! Has anyone ever heard of a teen having breast cancer?  All of the testing and doctor visits have happened very quickly, if that common when a lump is found...trust me my daughter has been through many medical situations. This is the fastest process I've ever seen...that also makes me nervous.  Can a doctor tell by feeling the lump if there is a problem?  Please help ... I'm a mom in panic ",
