      "Content": "I don't know how long your mother is in her treatment, but I would like to tell you about my weight loss/gain. After surgery (radical mastectomy) I lost about 15 pounds too and since I had been normal weight, it made me look very sickly. When I finished 5 rounds of chemo, my taste and appetite came back and I started to really eat. After I gained the weight back, I cut down on the food, but the weight still kept piling on! I now take only Tamoxifen pills (1 a day for 5 yrs) and am still about 10 lbs over my normal weight. The only reason I'm not heavier is by strict dieting and exercise. So all I want to tell you is that weight gain is a big problem in breast cancer patients. I wish I had known that before. I wouldn't have been so worried during my low weight periods.",

      "Content": "Also about food: The best things to eat are bland ones. You can get quite a few calories from them also. I really liked things like hot cereal for breakfast like oatmeal or grits. Cream of wheat would be good too. You can add butter to them for more calories if you dont have high cholesterol. Cooking fancy foods was always a disappointment in the end, so keep it simple and healthy. Please be patient. Your mother will get her appetite back eventually! Good luck! You sound like a very caring son.",

      "Content": "It is terribly upsetting to lose your hair. I was bald for about a year and while I had a wig I rarely wore it. Somehow I felt like I was hiding or in a \"costume\" when I had it on. I noticed that I was acting shy and holding my head down. Finally I decided on a bolder look: a little gray chemo cap and on top of that a long scarf knotted at back of head with the ends reaching the small of my back. I wore make-up and high heeled boots. I swear people thought I was making a fashion statment and I felt great after that. Please be patient. When you get your hair back, you slowly forget about the baldness. I also learned who my real friends were. Some were embarrassed to be with me so they said things like \"We'll go out when you're better\". Well, I wanted to go out right then! So I did. Keep living your normal life (except the 5-7 days right after chemo of course). Good luck!",
