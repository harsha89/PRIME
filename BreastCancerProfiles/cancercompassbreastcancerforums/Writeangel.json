      "Content": "I hate to be a nit-picker, but as an editor and journalist, I guess I just have a thing about wording. I am a three-year bc survivor. After being diagnosed, I got all the facts and figures, etc.etc. etc. and then they said \"And your chances of a five-year survival rate is 93% without chemo and 96% with it. Needless to say, I went for the chemo -- but that's not the aggravation with this term. My immediate question was \"So, if I get the chemo, I'm still only have five years left. Is that what you're saying?\" Of course the answer was no -- what they mean to say -- and a term that should be used more often is that there's a 96% chance that the cancer will not RECUR in the next five years. Which, of course, is terrific! I know doctors and researchers are not always linguists, but I wish they would be more careful about how they describe survival vs. recurrence.",

      "Content": "I agree that \"survival\" is a wonderful word. But when they say \"with this treatment, the five-year survival rate is 96%\" for example, that really means that the chance of you making it for the next five years is 96% -- then you're going to die. Granted, that's a lot better than them telling you that you only have a few months or years to live, but the correct term would be that the chances of having NED for the next five years is 96% (and the chances of a recurrence is 4%) NOT that the treatment gives you another five years.",

      "Content": "You are very nice to be looking out for mom this way. Having a wig and feeling good about yourself is very important to helping mom get better. First, I'd suggest that you go to the \"Look Good, Feel Better\" web site at http://www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org/. This is an organization that offers free meetings with a wig and makeup consultant who will be able to help mom. (I went about 2 weeks before starting my chemo and the best part was meeting other women in my situation!) Anyway, the consultant or one of the women at the session may be able to help find a place that offers wigs at a discount. If there's not a session scheduled in the near future, just ask someone at the main phone number and they should be able to help. Also -- and this is really important -- make sure mom gets a prescription for the wig -- it's called a \"cranial prosthesis\" -- cool, huh? Depending on the insurance -- even medicare -- she should be able to get reimbursed for at least part of the cost. I was shocked that Aetna, our insurance company, paid $750!  Hope this helps!

      "Content": "Great article about how important it is to be an informed patient. Only problem is that doctors don't want to hear from informed patients. If you've talked to another doctor or nurse, read something in a magazine or on the Internet, or spoken with a survivor, it doesn't matter. The truth of the matter is that YOUR doctor is going to tell you that a)  you can't trust what you've heard or b) it's true, but it doesn't apply to your case. I'd love to believe that that self educating I've done about breast cancer has helped me in some way. The truth is that all it does is tick off my doctors.",
