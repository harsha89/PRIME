All depends on how well the surgery goes - how well you tolerate the anesthesia, etc. Reach for Recovery may be providing mastectomy camisoles.  Your surgeon's office may likely have contact info for local Reach for Recovery representatives. I think that if you contact the American Cancer Society, they could give you information on that also: http://americancancersociety.org/docroot/home/index.asp I wish you the best with your surgery and recovery. Please let us know how you are doing. Sincerely, Tre Thanks Tre, for your response. I will check with Reach for Recovery..Pat",
