    "Content": "I had a a sentinole node biopsy. This is where they stick your breast with lots of needles. I heard before I had it done that it was extremely painful and I would not get any kind of pain meds except what they put on my breast topically. Meaning some kind of lotion. I was amazed at how little I did feel. I was waiting on horrible pain when I only felt a slight stick and some irritation. I finally ask the Doctor when he was going to start and he told me he was through. I had more problems preparing myself for the pain than I did th e procedure itself. Good luck and I hope it goes as well for you.",
