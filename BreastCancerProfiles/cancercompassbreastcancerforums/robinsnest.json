    "Content": "Hi, I don't know how much I can help but I had a double mastectomy 6 weeks ago for agressive stage 3 + invasive ductal carcinoma.  My mastectomy \"wounds\" have healed without any physical pain. I am 58 and had no problem with my decision nor did my husband who only wants my life.  I am lucky in that I think!  Your mom needs to seriously talk with her oncologist - and if he or she doesn't give her the answers she needs, then she needs to get a different oncologist.  I consulted 3 oncolcogists before I found the one I felt comfortable with.  Believe me, they are used to it, regardless of how the receptioness may make you feel.  YOU are paying for this and YOU are in CHARGE. Ask all the questions you have and don't stop until you have all the answers you want.  I don't know where you live, but where I am ( in Iowa) I have acess to a Cancer Clinic Counselor who has helped me so much to navigate the cancer system.  I'm sure you have a similar system where you are - if you can't find it, let me know - I will find it for you.  There is help for us - it's just not always easy to find!  Love  to you   Robin",
