    "Content": "Noel: I have had breast cancer twice, both caught early. God has blessed me. I now have ovarian cancer also caught in stage 2. I want to tell you to get this product that I am taking.  It is called Ambrotose by a co. called Mannatech. Look it up on the internet. If you can't find out how to order it contact me thru this by private reply. I do not sell this, but it is a life saver. It will protect your cells and make your immune system healthy so you can fight this cancer. I know  more than one person who is cancer free now after being terminal. I, myself have not yet been sick.  My tumor markers are going down, not up!!  I feel compelled to let everyone know about this because it is manna from heaven. It works. It is not medicine. It is a supplement. Gluconutrients.  Another thing that works is prayer.  Pray often and trust God to heal you. He led me to this product. Four different people contacted me about taking this starting before I even knew I had cancer again over a year ago.  None of them related in any way. I wish you the best and will pray for you and your son.  I have 9 grandchildren , the youngest is soon to be 4 and the oldest is 23. I do not wish to leave my precious ones either and I know, as a mother, how agonizing it is to think you're not going to be around to see them grown, but have faith. Hang tough and don't even think of dying as a possibility. Just put it in God's hands and let him take care of it. Then go on about your life. I have never worried about dying, never lost any sleep over it, and have not suffered any pain, had no chemo or radiation, no medicine yet and have not thrown up, lost any hair or any of that stuff. I may still have that ahead, but this started in 2002 and this is my third type of cancer. I don't mean to sound as if I'm bragging, I just am saying God is great and there are other things we can do to help ourselves!!!!! Poly MVA is another choice. I took it the 2nd time I got breast cancer. It works also. Look it up on the internet. IT IS YOUR LIFE. YOU SAVE IT!!!  I love you. God bless!!!            ",
