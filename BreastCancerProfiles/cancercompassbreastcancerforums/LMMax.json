Does anyone have any suggestions for lotion to sooth the skin that is left feeling raw from nerve endings that are trying to find a new home? Also, they put expanders in \"just in case I can have implants\" but these things hurt, they neglected to tell me that part.",

On Taxol as well. My pain goes across both hips and down my legs. I take a hydrocodone at night so I can sleep, the pain is so bad. At least twice a day I lie flat on the bed with pillows raising my feet about 3'. Doesn't seem to help but it doesn't hurt either. Also us a heating pad on my lower back. That I can tell has helped. My problem has been the overall swelling. I've  gained 30 lbs in two months. I look like the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man, literally. You know, those no-neck football players, except mine is not muscle. And when I get done with my little list of exercises that they gave me, my hands are blue. Can't wait to see my Onco this week. Usually what I get is, \"Usually people tolerate Taxol very well,\" or \"nausea and diarrhea are not side effects of Taxol.\" Because of the neuropathy they lowered the dose and have changed my schedule to two weeks on and one week off. Personally, I think it makes the symptoms worse after you have had a week off. Has anyone else experienced the overall swelling? I've been told it can't be lymphedema because the swelling would only be in the effected arm(s), and that my knee and hip pain can't be related to the neuropathy, neuropathy is only in the hands and feet.",
