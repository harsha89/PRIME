      "Content": "Even giving breast cancer patients Herceptin, a study from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Cancer 2003 Jun 15, 97(12):2972-7) identified central nervous system metastases in women who received trastuzumab-based (Herceptin) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Central nervous system disease is defined as one or more brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastasis. Central nervous system metastases was identified in 34% of patients at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and 6 months from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease frequently developed brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin. An editorial by Drs. V. Valero and G.N. Hortobagyi in the March 15, 2003 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology (21(6):959-962,'03), reviewed all of the large, prospective, randomized trials published comparing taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. They concluded that none of these regimens have increased either complete response rates or overall survival, with median survivals remaining at two years or less, or precisely the same results which were being obtained over thirty years ago. Life has been shortened by chemotherapy. The most likely mechanisms for this life shortening are toxicities of the drugs on the patient's body, such as immunosuppression and organ damage, and the mutagenic effects (changes in form) of chemotherapy on the genetically-unstable tumor, driving the tumor into a state of more aggressive behavior (like metastasis). A chemo-induced gene mutation can happen when the original chemo received does not work. The cancer comes back. When it does this, the cancer comes back more aggressively. The mutagenic effects (changes in form) of chemotherapy on a genetically-unstable tumor, drives the tumor into a state of more aggressive behavior. You might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more agressive fashion. Like when chemotherapy on an ER+ cancer brings about a remission, but in the process also causes any remaining cancer to become ER-. All the more reason to test the tumor first. This can be done by drug resistance testing.",

It was presented at the 27th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December (abstract 6014). What drawn my attention was the possibilities of the German technique to quantify circulating tumor cells, may show promise in utilizing circulating tumor cells for assay-testing (chemosensitivity testing) on solid tumors (that's another subject we'll hear more about). This study seemed to apply to another study (Carcinomatous Meningitis: Taxane-Induced, American Journal Clinical Oncology 2002;63:6-15) which found what is called \"dissemination after taxane-based (taxol) chemotherapy. These results of these kinds of studies are coming out slowly and quietly (now that taxol is off-patent) and indicate that taxol-containing regimens didn't prolong survival over other more conventional and less expensive cytotoxic drugs. You may indeed get a clinical response (tumor shrinkage), sometimes impressively, however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a response to taxol are often dramatic. Is taxol the Vioxx of cancer drugs? Who knows? Hope we will find out! I've been researching for five years, the association of dose-intense taxol and brain mets within one to two years after adjuvant therapy. I stumble across this.",

      "Content": "Jeanne. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them. One approach to individualizing patient therapy is \"chemosensitivity testing\" (look for postings on this board with that title). Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body. Somewhat more effective therapies have recently been coming into the pipeline. Targeted cancer therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in carcinogenesis (the process where normal cells become cancer cells) and tumor growth. Some of the oral chemotherapy agents for breast cancer are capecitabine, vinorelbine, idarubicin and oral cyclophosphamide. Chemosensitivity tests have vastly more documentation of strong predictive value for both response and patient survival than exist in the case of most laboratory tests used to aid in the management of cancer patients. When Medicare convened an expert panel of physicians to consider reimbursement for these tests, several pathologists on the panel made statements such as \"there are few, if any, laboratory tests which have ever been shown to improve the results of treatment\", \"the documentation for these tests exceeds that of most of the tests used in cancer medicine\", \"if we don't approve these tests, then perhaps we shouldn't approve bacterial culture and sensitivity tests as well.\" These cell culture assay tests provide much more powerful prognostic information. They tell you that a given form of treatment has an above average probability of being associated with a clinical response and/or with being associated with above average survival. Likewise, they indicate that given treatment is associated with a below average probability of response and/or survival. I hope some of this information will help you in your endeavor to gather more information about cancer treatments, so as to be more informed before making a decision.",

      "Content": "In the March 15, 2003 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, there was an editorial by V. Valero and G.N. Hortobagyl (J Clin Oncol 21(6): 959-962,'03) which reviewed all of the large, prospective, randomized trials published comparing the newer, taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. These authors concluded that none of these regimens have increased either complete response rates or overall survival, with median survivals remaining at two years or less. This is precisely the same results which were being obtained 30 years ago. In the September, 2002 issue of The American Journal of Oncology Review, there was a commentary by Lawrence N. Shulman, M.D., Vice Chair for Clinical Services/Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer institute (Harvard Medical School), Boston. His commentary described the complete lack of progress in the chemothereapeutic treatment of metastatic breast cancer since 1970. The results of nearly 30 years of clinical investigation in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, neither standard or high-dose chemotherapy had done a great deal to improve the outcome of patients with this disease. For over the past 20 years, we relentlessly combined chemotherapy agents in various regimens with ever-increasing dose intensity and the survival for patients participating in these studies was exactly the same, less than two years. Not a hint of significantly improved survival. Dr. Shulman noted that a retrospective comparison, well-characterized standard-dose database with a less well-characterized high-dose database suggested that there was increased early mortality for high-dose therapy. Highly selected patients whose tumors are responsive to chemotherapy can have long-term remissions from standard-dose chemotherapy. One large randomized trial showed no difference in survival for patients treated with standard-dose versus high-dose chemotherapy. The median survival for both groups was two years, and no subset of patients seemed to benefit from high-dose therapy. Even if one were an optimist and concluded that the high-dose data suggested that a small subgroup of patients benefited from this approach, one must remember that the patients participating in these studies are already highly selected for age, performance status, response to induction therapy and other factors. At best, it must be helping only an incredibly small percentage of the patients with this disease. Clearly, more effective therapies are desperately needed for women with metastatic breast cancer, and after 30 years of investigation aimed at intensified multi-agent chemotherapy, we should look for other avenues of study. The fact that regressions of breast cancer had no influence on overall survival must reflect the inadequacy of present-day chemotherapy. How the use of chemotherapy which induces responses in some patients, cannot have affect in overall survival? Does chemotherapy shorten survival of some patients, while prolonging the survival of others? In an era of ever-increasing numbers of partially effective cancer therapeutics, there is an obvious need for technologies to better match treatment to a patient. In the field of chemosensitivity testing, there is substantial literature that has not been recently reviewed and which the vast majority of clinical oncologists are not familiar. Approximately 10,000 individual patient specimens are currently being submitted for testing by more than 1,000 cllinical oncologists, surgeons and pathologists annually in the United States. The tests engender uninformed reactions and opinions from various clinicians within the referring medical centers. This is a timely and important topic for review, consideration and debate. I think it is time (over-due) to set aside empiric one-size-fits-all treatment in favor of recognizing that breast, lung, ovarian and other forms of cancer represent heterogenous diseases, where the tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. Source: Human Tumor Assay Journal",

      "Content": "A breast cancer treatment developed by University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) surgeon V Suzanne Klimberg, M.D., has been shown in a clinical trial to reduce the need for repeat surgery following lumpectomy by 86 percent. Klimberg, director of the breast cancer program at UAMS' Arkansas Cancer Research Center, is the principal investigator of a multiphase clinical trial for the new procedure called Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)-Assisted Lumpectomy. The findings of the study were presented this week at the American College of Surgeons 91st Annual Clinical Congress in San Francisco. The RFA procedure, which sears a one-centimeter margin, or perimeter, of soft tissue following standard lumpectomy removal of a breast tumor, is intended to give the patient a cancer-free area around the site where the tumor has been removed so that a second surgery in the area around the lumpectomy and/or radiation therapy are unnecessary. Currently, about 40 percent of patients require a second surgery to remove additional malignant tissue. UAMS is the first hospital to use RFA-assisted lumpectomy to treat breast cancer. Klimberg's recently concluded trial involved 25 breast cancer patients. Klimberg is chief of the Division of Breast Surgical Oncology at UAMS and a professor in the Departments of Surgery and Pathology. She is a staff physician in the Women's Oncology Service at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System as well as director of Breast Fellowship in Diseases of the Breast and director of the Breast Cancer Program at UAMS. The RFA-assisted lumpectomy begins with standard removal of the tumor. Then, an RFA probe is inserted and heated to 100 degrees for 15 minutes, creating a one centimeter zone of dead tissue around the cavity. \"Since 90 percent of local breast cancer recurrences are at the site of the original tumor, the RFA procedure gives women added assurance that they will not need a second surgery to remove cancer at the same site,\" Klimberg said. \"The success of this procedure is important not only for UAMS, but for every woman who experiences breast cancer and every doctor who treats it.\" Of the 150,000-200,000 patients who undergo lumpectomies each year, about 25 percent refuse or are unable to receive follow-up radiation treatment. Through the use of RFA, the area around the lumpectomy cavity is eradiated during surgery. \"With the use of RFA, we are more successful in eliminating the cancer during the first surgery. We also can prevent the need for a second surgery, reduce or eliminate the need for additional radiation treatment and improve the cosmetic result,\" Klimberg said. \"Ultimately, any patient eligible for lumpectomy may be eligible for treatment with breast-sparing RFA.\" Other UAMS physicians and staff participating in the study were Soheila Korourian, M.D., associate professor, Department of Pathology; Julie A. Kepple, M.D., oncology fellow; Ronda S. Henry-Tillman, M.D., associate professor of surgery and director of the UAMS Cancer Control Department; Aaron Margulies, instructor of surgery and second-year Breast Fellow; Laura L. Adkins, project program specialist; Scott Ferguson, laser safety officer; and G. Shafirstein, Ph.D., assistant professor, Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery.

      "Content": "A surgeon at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has developed a new procedure to prevent one of the most common side effects associated with breast cancer treatment \u2013 lymphedema or swelling of the arms due to faulty drainage of the lymph nodes. V. Suzanne Klimberg, M.D., director of the UAMS breast cancer program, led a study funded by the Tenenbaum Breast Cancer Research Foundation of breast cancer patients at risk for developing lymphedema. Her findings were published in the February issue of the Annals of Surgical Oncology, and she will present the study March 17 at the Society of Surgical Oncology 60th Annual Cancer Symposium in Washington, D.C. \"The removal and analysis of the lymph nodes under the arm remains the most important factor in determining the severity of disease in breast cancer patients,\" Klimberg said. \"In the past, surgery to remove the lymph nodes and most of the fat and tissue in the armpit often resulted in complications, including lymphedema.\" Five percent to 50 percent of women undergoing surgical treatment for breast cancer have developed lymphedema, mainly dependent upon the extent of surgery. At the ACRC, surgeons determined that the draining of the first lymph node, known as the sentinel lymph node, is capable of predicting if the cancer has spread to the remaining armpit lymph nodes, known as axillary lymph nodes. This is a less invasive surgery and reduces the likelihood of complications. However, the lymph node system is at risk of disruption during either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or an axillary lymph node dissection, which often leads to swelling in the arm. To prevent the arm swelling, Klimberg has developed the Axillary Reverse Mapping (ARM) procedure. The new technique evaluates the ways in which fluid drains through the lymph node system in the arm through the injection of blue dye. The dye is used to map the drainage of the arm. \"Mapping the drainage of the arm decreases the chances of unintended disruption of the lymph node system during surgery and reduces the risk of developing swelling in the arm,\" Klimberg said. \"We are the first to study lymph node drainage in the arm and are now using the ARM procedure as standard procedure at UAMS. Klimberg will soon begin conducting training seminars on the procedure throughout the country. The seminars will be sponsored by the global medical device company Ethicon, a branch of Johnson & Johnson. Klimberg is chief of the Division of Breast Surgical Oncology at UAMS and a professor in the Departments of Surgery and Pathology. She also is director of the Breast Cancer Program at the UAMS\u2019 Arkansas Cancer Research Center as well as director of Breast Fellowship in Diseases of the Breast at UAMS.

      "Content": "Circulating cell-free DNA carrying tumor-specific alterations (circulating tumor DNA) is more effective at monitoring metastatic breast cancer than current biomarkers approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and circulating tumor cells, according to a proof-of-concept study. The study, led by Sarah-Jane Dawson, PhD, from the University of Cambridge and the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, in the United Kingdom, was published online today in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Metastatic breast cancer is incurable but treatable with serial administration of endocrine, cytotoxic, or biologic therapies,\" Carlos Caldas, MD, also from the University of Cambridge and one of the study authors, told Medscape Medical News. Monitoring treatment response is essential and can be carried out with biomarkers such as cancer antigen (CA) 15-3 and circulating tumor cells, using the CellSearch (Veridex) test, but we are seeking better biomarkers, Dr. Caldas said. \"Effectively, genomics provides a new type of very specific biomarker for monitoring tumors in response to therapy. In other words, the mutations that each tumor accumulates are an individual genomic 'barcode' that we can then use to monitor tumor burden and response to treatment,\" he explained. The researchers used targeted or whole-genome sequencing to identify somatic genomic alterations, and designed personalized assays to quantify circulating tumor DNA in serially collected plasma specimens. They also measured CA 15-3 levels and numbers of circulating tumor cells at identical time points. They found that circulating tumor DNA was superior to the other 2 blood tests. Circulating tumor DNA was successfully detected in 29 of the 30 women (97%) with metastatic breast cancer receiving systemic therapy in whom somatic genomic alterations were identified. In comparison, CA 15-3 was detected in 21 of 27 women (78%) and circulating tumor cells were detected in 26 of 30 women (87%). In addition to its superior sensitivity in detecting metastatic breast cancer, circulating tumor DNA had a greater dynamic range, which correlated with changes in tumor burden. The test also provided the earliest measure of treatment response in 10 of the 30 women tested, Dr. Caldas said. He added that most laboratories equipped to do molecular testing can do this test using circulating tumor DNA; however, these are usually only located in major tertiary care centers. \"I think this...will be a landmark report, and circulating tumor DNA is going to be one of the highlights in medicine in 2013. The test will definitely be used in clinical research immediately, although generic use in cancer patients will have wait until diagnostic companies release tests for use,\" Dr. Caldas said. In a press release issued by Cancer Research UK, which funded the study in part, chief clinician Peter Johnson, MD, was quoted as saying: \"These results hold the promise of a system that could allow us to modify someone's treatment as their cancer changes, and they suggest an exciting way to quickly get hold of the personal details of a cancer, to target it for the most effective therapy.\" \"One of the things that will help our scientists design better cancer treatments is a way of measuring early on which ones are working and which are not. If we can find the molecular footprints of cancers during treatment and see how they change, we hope we will be able to track them down and remove them much more efficiently,\" he added. Approach Has \"Remarkable Potential\" In an accompanying editorial, Marc Lippman, MD, from the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Florida, and C. Kent Osborne, MD, from the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, agree that this test has definite possibilities. There is remarkable potential for this approach, they write, but they also list some concerns. \"All patients with breast cancer have mutations in their tumor DNA, but without very intensive sequencing strategies, a specific probe or probes for each patient may remain elusive or very costly,\" and a standard 'panel' is unlikely to work for all patients,\" Drs. Lippman and Osborne write. Also, the number of patients in whom an objective response to treatment was seen in circulating tumor DNA was limited, so the \"laudable effort\" to compare the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA with circulating tumor cells and measures of CA 15-3 \"was more encouraging than definitive.\" The editorialists conclude that this study provides proof of the concept that circulating tumor DNA is \"a sensitive biomarker of tumor burden,\" and add that studies showing that it can be used to improve the care of patients with metastatic breast or even other cancers \"in a cost-effective manner\" are needed. The study was supported by Cancer Research UK, the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, the National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, and by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council R.G. Menzies Early Career Fellowship to Dr. Dawson. Dr. Caldas, Dr. Lippman, and Dr. Osborne have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. N Engl J Med.

      "Content": "Researchers have been focusing on the development of sensitive assays that allow the specific detection of single tumor cells or small amounts of cell-free tumor DNA in the peripheral blood of cancer patients (Annual Review of Medicine Vol. 63: 199-215). Quantification of circulating DNA by real-time PCR may be a good and simple tool for detection of cancer with a potential to clinical applicability together with other current methods used for monitoring the disease (DNA Cell Biol. 2008 Aug;27(8):415-21). Doctors hope to use this to assess how a patient's tumor responds to treatment. Circulating tumor DNA might give doctors an earlier warning that a drug isn't working. The test might allow patients to stop taking a harsh drug that's not working, sparing them months of side effects. Doctors could then prescribe an alternative drug, although there's no evidence yet that switching drugs sooner would help people live longer. Is this six of one and a half dozen of the other? The test is \"prognostic\" and not \"predictive.\" The biggest point made by Dr. Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is that cancer patients shouldn't expect their doctors to test their tumor's circulating DNA anytime soon. Genomics provides a new type of very specific biomarker for monitoring tumors in response to therapy.

      "Content": "Direct anti-tumor and anti-vascular effects were studied of Tykerb, Nexavar and Avastin in fresh biopsy specimens of breast cancer and presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Symposium on September 5, 2008. While the other clinically-available 'nib' drugs have been shown to have anti-vascular activity, anti-vascular activity of Tykerb has not been previously reported. Angiogenesis studies are limited by the clinical relevance of laboratory model systems. They don't do \"real world\" studies under \"real world\" conditions. Patient outcomes need to be reported in real-time, so patients and cancer physicians can learn immediately if and how patients are benefiting from new drug therapies. Cell culture detection of microvascular cell death in clinical specimens of human neoplasms and peripheral blood can identify the activity of both single drugs and combinations of drugs at the level of individual patients with individual cancers. It works by measuring drug effects (real-time) upon endothelial cells which make up blood vessels. Drugs like Avastin had striking anti-microvascular effects but minimal anti-tumor effects. Tarceva and Gleevec had mixed antitumor and anti-microvascular effects. Anti-microvascular effects of Tarceva and Iressa were equal to those of Sutent and Nexavar. Anti-microvascular additivity was observed between Avastin and other drugs on an individual basis. Conclusions of the study had shown that Tykerb has antivascular activity superior to that of Nexavar. Avastin + Tykerb may be the first clinically-exploitable antivascular drug combination. High dose, intermittent 'bolus' schedules of Tykerb to coincide with Avastin administration may be clinically advantageous, even in HER2-negative tumors. The system utilized for the study was a functional profiling assay, which may be used to individualize antivascular therapy. It can be adapted for simple, inexpensive and sensitive/specific detection of tissue and circulating microvascular cells in a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions, for drug development, and individualized cancer treatment. The cell-based assay can accurately sort drugs into categories of above average probability of providing clinical benefit on one hand and below average probability of providing clinical benefit on the other hand, based both on tumor response and patient survival.

      "Content": "Tykerb (lapatinib) is one of the first oral agents with the potential to compete directly with the IV drugs which is both a high-volume and high-revenue part of office-based practices. Early use of Tykerb will likely be limited to patients whose breast cancer is refractory to Herceptin (trastuzumab). In the longer term, it could supplant or perhaps find a place in combination with Herceptin. Of course, will patients be able to afford the cost of these drugs? Herceptin's wholesale price on an annualized basis is approximately $45,000 per year. Tarceva, $40,000 per year. Nexavar, $60,000 per year. Avastin, $47,000 per year. Will the price of Tykerb approximate these novel agents or exceed their costs? The problem is not unique to these drugs, but also to all of the new molecularly-targeted agents. Lee Newcomer, former chief medical officer and currently an executive with United Health Group, stated at the 12th annual conference of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, that \"Avastin improves outcomes in about 20% of patients, but we have no idea which cancer patients will benefit from a course of treatment. Because Avastin is included with numerous drug cocktails, it costs $354,000 per year of life extended with Avastin because of today's 'cookie-cutter' approach to chemotherapy. You don't know in advance who is going to respond.\" Everyone is scared to death (and rightly so) at what is going to happen to the healthcare economic system with the introduction of increasingly expensive new drugs that benefit only a small percentage of patients who receive them, hence the headlong rush to develop tests to identify molecular predisposing mechanisms whose presence still does not guarantee that a drug will be effective for an individual patient. Nor can they, for any patient or even large group of patients, discriminate the potential for clinical activity among different agents of the same class. Profit is a powerful motivating force. Among medical benefit payors, the profit motive is entirely consistent with the goal of developing a molecular test, which is to identify efficacious therapies irrespective of drug mark-up rates. The FDA finds themselves under increasing pressure to allow new drugs into the marketplace, while at the same time protecting the safety of potential recipients of those drugs and also the financial interests of those who will have to pay for them. The pressure is so great that companion molecular diagnostics approved often have been mostly or totally ineffective at identifying clinical responders (durable and otherwise) to the various therapies. It should be in the FDA's interest in saving the healthcare system perhaps billions of dollars a year (and thereby the healthcare system itself) by ensuring that expensive treatments are used appropriately. It should serve their interest not only in discovering new cancer treatments, but also using currently-available cell culture technologies to improve the effectiveness of existing drugs and save lives today by administering the right drug to the right patient at the right time. The methods of cancer medicine during the last thirty some years are coming to haunt the \"one-size-fits-all\" establishment. Technologies, developed over the last twenty years by private researchers, hold the key to solving some of the problems confronting a healthcare system that is seeking ways to best allocate available resources while accomplishing the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.",

      "Content": "Maybe, for these reasons. Cells are the most basic structure of the body. Cells make up tissues, and tissues make up organs, such as the lungs or liver. Each cell is surrounded by a membrane, a thin layer that separates the outside of the cell from the inside. For a cell to perform necessary functions for the body and respond to its surroundings, it needs to communicate with other cells in the body. Communication occurs through chemical messages in a process called signal transduction. The purpose of these signals is to tell the cell what to do, such as when to grow, divide into two new cells, and die. Targeted cancer therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in carcinogenesis (the process by which normal cells become cancer cells) and tumor growth. By focusing on molecular and cellular changes that are specific to cancer, targeted cancer therapies may be more effective than current treatments and less harmful to normal cells. However, the monoclonal antibodies like Herceptin and Erbitux are \"large\" molecules. These very large molecules don't have a convenient way of getting access to the large majority of cells. Plus, there is multicellular resistance, the drugs affecting only the cells on the outside may not kill these cells if they are in contact with cells on the inside, which are protected from the drug. The cells may pass small molecules back and forth. Exciting results have come from studies of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, \"small\" molecules that act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells, like Tyberb and Sutent. Targeted \"small-molecule\" therapies ruled at the recent annual ASCO meeting of oncologists. The trend is away from the monoclonals to the small molecules, a trend in which a new predictive test may be able to hasten. The EGRFx (TM) assay is able to test molecularly-targeted anti-cancer drug therapies like Iressa, Tarceva, Tykerb, Sutent and possibly Nexavar, because of being small molecules. The EGFRx (TM) assay relies upon a technique known as Whole Cell Profiling, in which living tumor cells are removed from an individual cancer patient and exposed in the laboratory to the new drugs. Basically, Whole Cell Profiling measures the response of the tumor cells to drug exposure. Following this exposure, it measures both cell metabolism and cell morphology. The effect of drugs on the whole cell, resulting in a cellular response to the drug, measures the interaction of the entire genome. A variety of metabolic and apoptotic measurements are then used to determine if a specific drug was successful at killing the patient's cancer cells. The whole cell profiling method differs from other tests in that it assesses the activity of a drug upon combined effect of all cellular processes, using several metabolic (cell metabolism) and morphologic (structure) endpoints, at the cell \"population\" level (rather than at the \"single cell\" level). Other tests, such as those which identify DNA or RNA sequences or expression of individual proteins often examine only one component of a much larger, interactive process. Whole Cell Profiling measures genes before and after drug exposure. Gene Expression Profiles measures the gene expression only in the \"resting\" state, prior to drug exposure.",

      "Content": "Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (Carcinomatous Meningitis) The most common cancers to involve the leptomeninges are breast cancer, lung cancer and melanomas, and now, because of dose-intense combination chemotherapies, even ovarian cancer is more common. Unfortunately, cancer cells are too small to find on any scans unless they have grown into a lump. There can still be cancer cells in the body even though scans may have indicated that all the cancer had gone. Carcinomatous Meningitis (Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous) is caused by cancer cells getting into the thin sheets of body tissue that surround and protect the brain and spine. These sheets are called the meninges. Meningitis means inflammation of the meninges and Carcinomatous just means acting like a cancer. Most people are familiar with meningitis caused by an infection. But with Carcinomatous Meningitis, it is the cancer cells in the meninges that cause the inflammation, not an outside infection. Cancer cells do not always develop into an active secondary tumor when they have spread to a new site. Sometimes they stay inactive for many years. Even after a cancer appears to have been successfully treated, some cancer cells may still be elsewhere in the body. No one knows why some cancer cells stay inactive or what triggers them to form a secondary cancer. Tumor cells reach the Meninges (or leptominges) by hematogenous (blood) spread or by direct extension from pre-existing lesions and are then disseminated throughout the neuroaxis by the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients present with signs and symptoms from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion into the brain or spinal cord, alterations in blood supply to the nervous system, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways or general interference with brain function. Diagnosis is most commonly made by lumbar puncture, although the CSF cytology is persistently negative in about 10% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Radiology studies may reveal subarachnoid masses, diffuse contrast enhancement of the meninges or hydrocephalus without a mass lesion. Doctors estimate that about 5 out of every 100 patients who have cancer develop carcinomatous meningitis. It is most common in breast cancer, but it can occur with any type of cancer. The cancer cells in the meninges can cause a range of symptoms, including confusion, headaches and weakness. This condition is very difficult to treat. The main aim is to help control symptoms and not cure the disease. Chemotherapy injected into the spinal fluid (via Ommya Reservoir in the brain) or radiotherapy to the brain are both treatments for Carcinomatous meningitis. Some patients respond to these treatments, but the prognosis is generally poor. There are no set guidelines for treating this condition as oncologists don't really know which treatments work best. Without treatment, the median survival of patients is 4 - 6 weeks and death occurs from progressive neurologic dysfunction. Radiation therapy to symptomatic sites and disease visible on neuroimaging studies and intrathecal chemotherapy increases the median survival to 3 - 6 months. Major favorable prognostic factors include excellent performance status, absence of serious fixed neurologic deficits, normal CSF flow scans and absent or responsive systemic tumor. Oncologists have been looking at using different combinations of chemotherapy drugs to treat Carcinomatous Meningitis secondary to the primary cancer. They found that giving both chemotherapy injected into the bloodstream and chemotherapy given directly into the spinal fluid improved the outlook for some people. However, aggressive therapy for this disorder is often accompanied by necrotizing leukoencephalopathy which becomes symptomatic months after treatment with radiation and intrathecal methotrexate. Current available therapies are toxic and provide limited benefits.",

Abstract Background: Central nervous system (CNS) disease as the site of first relapse after exposure to adjuvant trastuzumab has been reported. We carried out comprehensive meta-analysis to determine the risk of CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant trastuzumab. Methods: Eligible studies include randomized trials of adjuvant trastuzumab administered for 1 year to patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who reported CNS metastases as first site of disease recurrence. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using fixed-effects inverse variance and random-effects models. Results: A total of 9020 patients were included. The incidence of CNS metastases as first site of disease recurrence in HER2-positive patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab was 2.56% (95% CI 2.07% to 3.01%) compared with 1.94% (95% CI 1.54% to 2.38%) in HER2-positive patients who did not receive adjuvant trastuzumab. The RR of the CNS as first site of relapse in trastuzumab-treated patients was 1.35 (95% CI 1.02\u20131.78, P = 0.038) compared with control arms without trastuzumab therapy. The ratio of CNS metastases to total number of recurrence events was 16.94% (95% CI 10.85% to 24.07%) and 8.33% (95% CI 6.49% to 10.86%) for the trastuzumab-treated and control groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found based on trastuzumab schedule or median follow-up time. No evidence of publication bias was observed. Conclusions: Adjuvant trastuzumab is associated with a significant increased risk of CNS metastases as the site of first recurrence in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

      "Content": "The genetic analysis of Oncotype DX predicts which women will have a greater chance of breast cancer recurrence. The test looks at 21 genes that influence the behavior of breast cancer cells. Until this test, it had been difficult to pinpoint which women would benefit most from chemotherapy, and those which wouldn\u2019t. MammaPrint is another genetic test that could help patients with early-stage breast cancer predict their chance of relapse, information that could save many patients from unnecessary chemotherapy. This test looks at the expression of 70 genes linked to breast cancer with an accuracy level of 96.7% as determined by a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These new gene expression profiling tests enable the oncologist and breast cancer surgeon to more accurately determine who should be treated and who should not be treated with chemotherapy, but they cannot predict chemo response. These laboratory tests are a tool for the oncologist. The oncologist should take advantage of all the tools available to him/her to treat a patient. And since studies show that only 25-30% of patients do respond to chemotherapy that is available to them (and even less for \"targeted\" drugs), there should be due consideration to looking at the advantage of molecular and cellular assay tests to the resistance that has been found to chemotherapy drugs. These tests can enhance the ability to distinguish between \"low\" risk and \"high\" risk patients. Patients in the high-risk group, who would benefit from chemotherapy can then be pre-tested with a \"functional\" bio-marker to see what treatments have the best opportunity of being successful, and offers a better chance of tumor response resulting in progression-free survival, while those in the lower-risk groups can be spared the unnecessary toxicity, particularly associated with ineffective treatment. These new genetic tests have enormous implications for the short-term future of cancer research in general, and is one of the truly great cancer breakthroughs of our time. These DNA microarray will prove to be highly complementary to the parellel breakthrough efforts in targeted therapy through a cell-based assay using an EGFRx™ Anti-Tyrosine Kinase Profile. New anti-cancer drugs selectively \"targets\" cells within the body that have a specific molecular defect that is believed to cause dangerous cell behaviors such as uncontrolled proliferative growth and high metastatic potential, behaviors that are associated with aggressive cancer. The defect occurs within the interior of the cell in a region that is called the tyrosine kinase domain and it involves a complicated chemical process called EGFR signaling. The drugs are called anti-EGFR drugs or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. When the drugs work, they can be highly beneficial, causing tumor shrinkage or promoting stable disease and extending survival. However, targeted therapy drugs like tyrosine kinase inhibitors only work for a small percentage of the patients who receive them. Further, the drugs are expensive and have been associated with toxic side effects. No molecular (gene-based) test has been proven to tell reliably who will benefit from anti-EGFR treatment. The EGFRx™ Anti-Tyrosine Kinase Profile assay can prospectively report to a physician specifically which chemotherapy agent would benefit a high risk cancer patient by testing that patient's \"live\" cancer cells. Drug sensitivity profiles differ significantly among cancer patients even when diagnosed with the same cancer. Knowing the drug sensitivity profile of a specific cancer patient allows the treating oncologists to prescribe chemotherapy that will be the most effective against the tumor cells of that patient. Every breast cancer patient should have her own unique chemotherapy trial based on consultation of pathogenic profiles and drug sensitivity testing data. Research and application of these tests are being encouraged by growing patient demands, scientific advances and medical ethics. These tests are not a luxury but an absolute necessity, and a powerful strategy that cannot be overlooked.

      "Content": "During the past decade it has been frequently observed that patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen, either in the adjuvant setting or in the metastatic setting, presenting central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the only evidence of disease progression. More studies were therefore interested to evaluate the incidence of CNS metastases in patients with early and advanced breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and to identify predictive factors for CNS relapse. More recent studies reported that breast cancer patients who received a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen had a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen (Breast Cancer Res. 2006;8(4). There are also data indicating an increased risk for brain metastases in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin). A study from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute identified central nervous system metastases in women who receive trastuzumab-based (Herceptin) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Central nervous system disease is defined as one or more brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (carcinomatous meningitis).  Central nervous system metastases was identified in 34% of patients at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and 6 months from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease frequently developd brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin (Cancer 2003 Jun 15;97(12):2972-7). Trastuzumab for Breast Cancer Linked to CNS Metastases Women with HER2-positive breast cancer who receive adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech/Roche) have a significant risk for metastases in the central nervous system (CNS) as the site of first recurrence, according to a report published online March 4 in the Annals of Oncology. \"While adjuvant trastuzumab has dramatically lowered the risk of recurrence in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, clinicians should be cognizant of CNS disease as the first site of relapse and monitor survivors closely for worrisome neurologic symptoms,\" lead author Erin M. Olson, MD, from The Ohio State University in Columbus, told Medscape Medical News. It has been suggested that the CNS is a sanctuary site for micrometastatic disease, either because trastuzumab does not penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier or because of the loss of HER2 overexpression in breast cancer cells migrating to the brain, Dr. Olson said. In previous work, she and her colleagues found an increasing incidence of brain metastases in patients with prolonged exposure to HER2-targeted therapies. This discovery prompted her team to explore the incidence of the CNS as the first site of relapse after exposure to adjuvant trastuzumab. They analyzed 4 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA, and PACS), which involved 9020 patients in total. Of the 4921 patients who received adjuvant trastuzumab, 125 developed CNS metastases as the site of first recurrence, for an overall incidence of 2.56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.07% - 3.01%). Of the 4099 patients who did not receive trastuzumab, there were 78 CNS events, for an incidence of 1.94% (95% CI, 1.54% - 2.38%). For patients treated with trastuzumab, the ratio of CNS metastases to total recurrence events was 16.94% (95% CI, 10.85% - 24.07%). For those not treated with trastuzumab, that ratio was 8.33% (95% CI, 6.49% - 10.86%). Additionally, the team found that the overall relative risk of developing CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence with 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, compared with no trastuzumab, was 1.35 (95% CI, 1.02 - 1.78; P =.038). Dr. Olson noted that there are several limitations to this study. Among them is the fact that data were abstracted from published clinical trial results; as a result, individual patient information was not available, making it impossible to determine the timing and subsequent outcomes of the recurrences. \"Establishment of clinical risk factors associated with the development of CNS metastases as the first site of recurrence after adjuvant trastuzumab is not possible in this analysis,\" she explained. Dr. Olson added that other HER2-targeted therapies, such as pertuzumab and T-DM1 (which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration), might confer a similar risk. \"There is likely to be a similar risk with large antibodies that do not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, such as pertuzumab and T-DM1, but lapatinib has been shown to have some activity in patients with CNS disease and, therefore, the risk of CNS relapse is unknown,\" she said. Study Confirms Previous Observations Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told Medscape Medical News that this study confirms what has been known for a decade. \"Trastuzumab, being a large molecule, doesn't get into the sanctuary sites, such as the brain, and therefore is unable to affect the development of brain metastases to the same degree as it affects the development of other distant metastases,\" Dr. Hortobagyi explained. He was not involved in the current study. This increased risk for CNS metastases is \"an indication of success,\" he maintained. \"The increased risk of CNS metastases is, therefore, an indication of the success of trastuzumab in prolonging the life of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and giving them more opportunity to develop CNS metastases. In other words, the longer you live after developing breast cancer, the greater the opportunity to develop CNS metastases,\" he said. Dr. Hortobagyi agrees that the use of published aggregate data, and not individual patient reports, is a limitation. \"It has limited granularity. Also, it includes several studies of somewhat different design, different chemotherapy regimens, and different follow-up times. It doesn't provide information about subsequent metastases beyond first metastases, so it is just a larger sample size to confirm earlier observations about this same phenomenon,\" he noted. Some European breast cancer experts also weighed in on this study. Evandro de Azambuja, MD, PhD, from Jules Bordet Institute in Brussels, Belgium, and Matthias Preusser, MD, from Medical University of Vienna, Austria, told Medscape Medical News by email that the study highlights \"once more\" the issue of developing brain metastases in HER2-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. \"HER2 overexpression is definitely a risk factor for brain metastases, and the vast majority of available systemic treatments are not able to cross the intact blood\u2013brain barrier; therefore, even if the disease is systemically controlled, the risk of brain metastases remains,\" they explained. The inclusion of only published data might not be the real problem. Other limitations include the fact that there were only a small number of published trials available, most had short follow-up periods (generally 4 years vs the most recent 8-year follow-up data), and brain metastases only as the first site were analyzed, Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser noted. They added that it is particularly important to note that the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial group recently published data on CNS relapses in 3401 patients in the observation and 1-year trastuzumab groups (Lancet Oncol. 2013;14:244-248). \"The incidence of CNS relapse as the first site of relapse was 2% in both arms. The HERA authors also looked at a cohort of 413 patients who had died and for whom a specific questionnaire was returned, They found that 129 patients (57%) in the observation arm and 88 patients (47%) in the 1-year arm experienced CNS relapse prior to death, Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser explained. \"Therefore, reporting CNS as the first site of relapse does not fully capture the effect of CNS relapse on breast cancer outcomes. This highlights the importance of capturing CNS relapses at any time during the study, including the active phase and follow-up, in all clinical trials including HER2-positive breast cancer patients,\" they added. It is not possible to say that trastuzumab increases the risk for brain metastases, \"but rather that trastuzumab controls extracranial disease systemically and does not effectively cross the intact blood\u2013brain barrier, allowing for a longer time before brain metastases develop,\" Drs. de Azambuja and Preusser noted. They emphasized that HER2 overexpression itself seems to be a risk factor for CNS tumor spread, although the exact mechanism has not been established. \"New therapies focusing on the prevention of brain metastases or on increasing the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier to allow systemic therapies to reach the brain should be sought,\" they concluded. \"There is an urgent need for high-quality basic and translational research to better understand how and when tumor cells reach the brain and grow into it, and who are the patients at the highest risk of developing brain relapse.\" Dr. Olson, Dr. Hortobagyi, Dr. de Azambuja, and Dr. Preusser have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

      "Content": "The American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) says oncologists should make chemotherapy treatment recommendations on the basis of published reports of clinical trials and a patient's health status and treatment preferences. How about published reports of clinical trials? More chemotherapy is given for breast cancer than for any other form of cancer and there have been more published reports of clinical trials for breast cancer than for any other form of cancer. According to NCI's March 31, 2006 official cancer information website on \"state of the art\" chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, it is unclear whether single-agent chemotherapy or combination chemotherapy is preferable for first-line treatment. At this time, no data support the superiority of any particular regimen. So, it would appear that published reports of clinical trials provide precious little in the way of guidance (1). In the total absence of guidance from published reports of clinical trials then, what basis are treatment regimens selected instead? ASCO says that this should be further based on a patient's health status and patient treatment preferences. So what is being done? Recently published in the journal Health Affairs is a joint Harvard/Michigan study entitled, \"Does reimbursement influence chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients?\" The authors documented a clear association between reimbursement to the oncologists for the chemotherapy of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer and the regimens which the oncologists selected for the patients. In other words, oncologists tended to base their treatment decisions on which regimen provided the greatest financial remuneration to the oncologist (2). A March 8, 2006 New York Times article described the study. One of the more interesting aspects of the story was a comment from an executive with ASCO, Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, who disputed the study's findings, saying that cancer doctors select treatments only on the basis of clinical evidence (3). So ASCO's Dr. Bailes maintains that drugs are chosen only on the basis of \"clinical evidence.\" Yet, Dr. Neil Love reported in a survey of breast cancer oncologists based in academic medical centers and community based, private practice medical oncologists. The former oncologists do not derive personal profit from the administration of infusion chemotherapy, the latter oncologists do derive personal profit from infusion chemotherapy, while deriving no profit from prescribing oral-dosed chemotherapy. The results of the survey could not have been more clear-cut. For first line chemotherapy of metastatic breast cancer, 84-88% of the academic center-based oncologists (who are motivated to keep off-protocol patients out of their chemotherapy infusion rooms to reserve these rooms for on-protocol patients) prescribed an oral-dose drug (capecitabine), while only 13% prescribed infusion drugs, and none of them prescribed the expensive, highly remunerative drug docetaxel. In contrast, among the commuity-based oncologists, only 18% prescribed the non-remunerative oral-dose drug (capecitabine), while 75% prescribed remunerative infusion drugs, and about 40% prescribed the expensive, highly remunerative drug docetaxel (4). There are patients who have progressive disease after first-line therapy, only to enjoy a dramatic benefit from second or even third line therapy, and these patients would have been much better served by receiving the most probable active treatment \"the first time around.\" The existence of this profit motive in drug selection has been one of the major factors working against the individualization of cancer chemotherapy based on Cell Culture Assay Testing (a test to pre-identify which chemo drugs would benefit the patient). While being faced with a large number of choices of otherwise equally acceptable therapies, oncologists select the treatments which generate the most income for private practices or generate the least inconvenience for the clinical research institutions. In the absence of Cell Culture Assay Testing, oncologists will continue to base their drug selections on reimbursement more than on any other single factor. Absent assay testing, they are free to choose the most remunerative therapy (5). By utilizing Cell Culture Assay Tests, they do so either because they want to choose the treatment which is most likely to work or that is what their patients want. Afterall, even ASCO endorses \"patient's treatment preferences.\" Either way, they are forced to consider information going beyond reimbursement.

Isolated Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (Carcinomatous Meningitis) after Taxane-Induced Major Remission in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Christos Kosmasa, Nikolaos A. Malamosa, Nikolas B. Tsavarisc, Melina Stamatakib, Achilleas Gregorioua, Sofia Rokanaa, Maria Vartholomeoua, Minas J. Antonopoulosa aDepartment of Medicine, Medical Oncology Unit and bDepartment of Cytopathology, Helena-Venizelou Hospital and cDepartment of Pathophysiology, Medical Oncology Unit, Laikon General Hospital, Athens University School of Medicine, Athens, Greece Abstract Objectives: To identify the incidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC), as the first site of systemic progression, in breast cancer patients after having obtained a major response (CR or near CR) to first-line taxane-based chemotherapy and compare these findings in retrospect with a matched-pair group of historical control patients from our database treated with nontaxane regimens. Patients and Methods: Patients with histologically proven breast cancer having either metastatic disease or high-risk locoregional disease that were entered into treatment protocols with first-line taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) plus anthracyclines or mitoxantrone combinations and developed LMC as the first evidence of progression after major response (CR or >80% PR) were analyzed in the present study (n = 155), and compared, as regards the incidence of LMC, to a matched-pair retrospective group of 155 patients treated with nontaxane regimens in our unit. Results: Seven patients with a median age of 54 years (range 40-70) developed LMC as their first evidence of progression after taxane-based regimens with a median interval of 6 months (range 2-18) from start of treatment to diagnosis of LMC. Five patients received intrathecal (i.t.) methotrexate treatment and whole brain radiotherapy (RT), while 1 patient received i.t. methotrexate and RT to the lumbar spine. Two patients responded to treatment for LMC, while 2 achieved stable disease and 3 progressed. Two patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid tumor markers (more than serum marker levels) that proved useful in monitoring response to treatment. Median survival after LMC was 3.6 months (range 1-17+) and correlated positively to the interval from the initiation of taxane-based therapy to LMC (r = 0.84, p = 0.019). Seven out of 86 responders (8.13%) in the taxane group versus 1 out of 72 responders (1.4%) in the non-taxane-treated group developed LMC as the first sign of progression after a major response to first-line chemotherapy (p < 0.1). Conclusions: LMC after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased, but not significantly so, when compared retrospectively to non-taxane-treated patients. Prospective evaluation of the incidence of LMC after taxane versus non-taxane-based treatment from large randomized multi-institutional trials is warranted and identification of potential prognostic factors might help to identify patients requiring appropriate prophylactic therapy.

      "Content": "Some cell-based assay labs have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors, alone and in combination, in actual human tumor primary culture micro-speheroids (microclusters), in breast and other cancers. In these investigations, the lab applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. As seen with PARP inhibitors, mutations work with other proteins. Genes do not operate alone within the cell but in an intricate network of interactions. To date, one lab has observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. Work is ongoing with these BRCA1 positive patients as wells as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future. The PARP inhibitors are turning out to be very useful. On April 3rd, Dr. Robert Nagourney, medical director at Rational Therapeutics and instructor in Pharmacology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, will have a Poster Session at the 102nd Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Orlando, Florida on the most recent findings on novel compounds that target two parallel pathways in cancer cells. Dr. Nagourney will report the results of functional analysis with the mTOR/P13K and MEK/ERK inhibitors, BEZ235 and AZD6244, alone and in combination in human tumor primary culture micro-spheroids (microclusters): Exploration of horizontal pathway targeting. While the profiles of each drug alone are of interest, the profiles of the drugs in combination are better still. The phenomenon of cross-talk defines an escape mechanism whereby cancer cells blocked from one passage, find a second. When clinical therapists have the capacity to block more than one pathway, the cancer cell is trapped and often dies. This is what has been observed with these duel inhibitor combinations. What is interesting is the fact that the activities cut across tumor types. Melanomas, colon cancers and lung cancers seem to have similar propensities to drive along these paths. Once again, we find that cancer biology is non-linear. Moreover, cancers share pathways across tumor types, pathways that might not intuitively seem related. This is the beauty of cell-based functional profiling platform. It allows the exploration of drugs and combinations that most oncologists wouldn\u2019t think of. It is these counterintuitive explorations that will likely lead to meaningful advances. Functional profiling measures biological signals rather than DNA indicators, which plays an important role in cancer drug selection and is demonstrably greater and more compelling data currently generated from DNA analyses. The results of their investigation support the clinical relevance of targeting the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways and more importantly, suggest \"dual\" pathway inhibition (horizontal) to be a productive strategy for further clinical development. Disease specific profiles and sequence dependence are being explored and will be reported. Most solid tumors reveal complex interactions between signal pathways that cross talk at points of commonality. To examine the clinical potential of BEZ235 and AZD6244 - inhibitors of PI3K and MEK/ERK pathways - they applied cell function analysis of programmed cell death to tumor micro-spheroids (microclusters) isolated from 24 patients. Drugs were tested alone and in combination. According to researcher, Professor Alan Ashworth, director of the Breaktrhough Breast Cancer Research Centre in London, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in a repair pathway for double-strand DNA breaks that occur very close to each other. An elaborate mechanism called homologous recombination fixes some of these double-strand breaks, and BRCA2 and BRCA1 are critical for homologous recombination. PARP is a very active enzyme involved in the repair of single-strand breaks in DNA or modified bases. It binds to DNA damage and adds multiple sugar molecules to the DNA that act as a beacon to recruit other components of DNA repair. Emerging work on assays (PARP levels correlating with response to PARP inhibitors) have shown pretty good response with PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients and in some triple negative patients. There has been some results combining the PARP inhbitors with mustard alkylators, platins and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. These molecules have also been the subject of investigation using functional analysis in the laboratory of Dr. Nagourney. As will be reported in the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Nagourney found activity for Olaparnib and Inaparib, in patients with BRCA mutation and in some triple negative breast cancer patients. This is a fertile area of investigation and a highly informative application of human tumor microspheroid analyses. Source: Robert A.

Methods: The medical files of patients with early breast cancer (n = 253) or advanced stage breast cancer (n = 239) as well of those with other solid tumors (n = 336) treated with or without a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen during a 42-month period were reviewed. HER2/neu overexpression was identified by immunohistochemistry, whereas cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) mRNA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood were identified by real-time PCR. Results: The incidence of CNS relapse was similar in patients suffering from breast cancer or other solid tumors (10.4% and 11.4%, respectively; P = 0.517). The incidence of CNS relapse was significantly higher in breast cancer patients with advanced disease (P = 0.041), visceral disease and bone disease (P = 0.036), in those who were treated with a taxane-containing regimen (P = 0.024), in those with HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors (P = 0.022) and, finally, in those with detectable CK-19 mRNA-positive CTCs (P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis revealed that the stage of disease (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.007-0.23; P = 0.0001), the HER2/neu status (odds ratio, 29.4; 95% confidence interval, 7.51-101.21; P = 0.0001) and the presence of CK-19 mRNA-positive CTCs (odds ratio, 8.31; 95% confidence interval, 3.97-12.84; P = 0.001) were independent predictive factors for CNS relapse. Conclusion: CNS relapses are common among breast cancer patients treated with a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen, patients with HER2/neu-positive tumor and patients with CK-19 mRNA-positive CTCs. Breast Cancer Res. 2006;8(4) ©2006 BioMed Central, Ltd. During the past years it has been frequently observed that patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen, either in the adjuvant setting or in the metastatic setting, presenting central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the only evidence of disease progression. We were therefore interested to evaluate the incidence of CNS metastases in patients with early and advanced breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and to identify predictive factors for CNS relapse. Recent studies reported that breast cancer patients who received a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen had a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen. There are also data indicating an increased risk for brain metastases in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin). In the present study it was also possible to confirm the initial clinical observation that breast cancer patients who receive a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen have a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen. The reasons for the association between treatment of breast cancer with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and an increased incidence of CNS involvement could be that taxanes are very lipophilic, their concentration in the CNS is very low after their intravenous administration. Taxanes are unable to penetrate the intact blood-brain barrier, the concentration of radiolabeled paclitaxel in the cerebrospinal fluid is found to be significantly lower than in other organs, and thus undetectable in the brain, in the spinal cord or in any other site of the CNS. Also, paclitaxel is exported from the p-glycoprotein and other ATP-binding cassette transporters placed at the luminal membrane of brain capillaries, as an explanation for the low concentrations of taxanes in the CNS. Furthermore, the detection of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) and of mRNA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer is correlated with increased incidence of relapse. The aforementioned data suggest that taxanes may not penetrate well into the CNS, and therefore the CNS may represent tumor 'sanctuary' sites for taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens. A difference in the incidence of CNS relapses between patients with breast cancer and other solid tumors treated with taxanes was observed. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/543766",

      "Content": "As we enter the era of \"personalized\" medicine, it is time to take a fresh look at how we evaluate treatments for cancer patients. The very idea of \"personalized\" medicine scares the hell out of the pharmaceuticals. It represents a radical departure in the pharma business model. Thanks to advances in biology and genetics, upcoming and existing technologies for personalizing cancer diagnosis and drug treatments are very real. The key hurdle for these technologies is overcoming the pharmaceutical industry's prevailing blockbuster economic model of the last twenty years. As one peruses the internet, they can see drug companies and so-called industry experts rush to suggest that personalized medicine and their blockbuster model are incompatible. Tests to identify individuals most likely to benefit from chemotherapy will certainly cut into their old and antiquated model. The spate of recent blockbuster \"miracle\" drugs has failed to show statistical survival benefit anywhere close to a majority of patients. These drugs actually did work miracles, in \"some\" patients. How do the drug companies respond when tests show their drug to be highly effective, but only in 11% of the potential patient population, a fraction of affected patients? Charging significantly more for those therapies will only work to a point. Personalized medicine will take the wind out of the sails of big pharma. Pharmaceutical companies and their industry shills will try to buck the trend as long as they can, but many realize that personalized treatments are inevitable and are making their way into a new paradigm of cancer treatment. The pharmaceutical industry will need to transform itself as \"business as usual,\" it will no longer be good enough. The old pharma \"blockbuster\" business model is incompatible with personalized medicine. Diagnostics will almost certainly trump pharmaceutics.",

      "Content": "Neoadjuvant Taxol Chemo May Cause Breast Tumor Cell Release Using the CellSearch technique that quantifies circulating tumor cells, German investigators have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel (taxol) causes a massive release of cells into the circulation, while at the same time reducing the size of the tumor. The finding could help explain the fact that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from solid tumors and entered the blood stream. This can begin the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, CTCs travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ. In the study, breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy gave blood samples in which epithelial antigen-positive cells were isolated. Such cells are detected in most breast cancer patients but are rarely found in normal subjects. The investigators measured the levels of cirulating tumor cells before and during primary chemotherapy with several different cytotoxic agents. What this recent study has shown is that in three different paclitaxel (taxol) containing regimens, as the tumor collapses (a clinical response, not cure), it produces the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. The study has not looked at any other combination regimens. The tumor shrinks, but more cells are found in the circulation. This corresponds with a high pathologic complete response during paclitaxel treatment, but in the end, this is not reflected in improved survival. These cells are alive in the circulation. The results indicate that monitoring of circulating tumor cells can contribute to understanding of tumor-blood interactions and may provide a valuable tool for therapy monitoring in solid tumors. The results of this kind of study are coming out slowly and quietly and indicate that taxol containing regimens didn't prolong survival over other more conventional and less expensive cytotoxic drugs. It may indeed give clincial response (tumor shrinkage), sometimes impressive, however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a response to taxanes (taxol) are often dramatic. Even if one or more chemotherapy regimen is identified as being likely to work on a particular cancer, has the science advanced to tell us whether application of the chosen chemotherapy regimen will not cause other changes that also cause cancer to later return and perhaps be even harder to treat? Is it a case of chemotherapy being bad, in cases where it apparently works? Traditional chemotherapy is mutagenic (changes in form), you might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more agressive fashion. These studies tell us that much more work needs to be done, and oncologists need to adapt treatment to the patient. There are over 100 chemotherapeutic agents, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing individual properties of each patient's cancer. (Oncol News Int'l, Vol 14, #5, May '05)",

The two assays are Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx. Today's announcement is the result of a collaboration between Dako and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. The collaboration was initiated in early 2012, and later the same year Dako submitted applications to the FDA requesting approval of the two Dako assays as companion diagnostics for Genentech's drug candidate for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Genentech's Kadcyla, an antibody-drug conjugate, and Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx have received simultaneous approvals from the FDA. Dako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx will serve as diagnostic tools to identify cancer patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who may be eligible for Kadcyla treatment. \"At Dako, we focus on advancing cancer diagnostics, because patients' lives depend on it,\" said Lars Holmkvist, CEO of Dako and senior vice president, Agilent. \"Partnering with companies who are also relentless in their commitment to fighting cancer is an important element in achieving this goal.

HER2 IQFISH pharmDX is a direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, It uses breast carcinoma specimens (FFPE) stained with HER2 IQFISH pharmDX.

These tests serve as a companion diagnostic tool to identify cancer patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who \"may\" be eligible for Kadcyla treatment. Because the results of the IHC test can sometimes be ambiguous, many doctors suggest the FISH test for a second opinion. Tumors that are 3+ positive by IHC and those that test positive by FISH are most likely to benefit from HER2-inhibitors. Tumors that test 1+ by IHC are considered HER2/neu negative and those that test 2+ are considered equivical, in which case FISH testing is done to make the determination. Tumors that test negative for HER2/neu by FISH are \"unlikely\" to benefit from HER2-inhibitors. Either test examines \"dead\" tissue that is preserved in paraffin or formalin. According to a professor of translational genomics at the Scripps Research Institute, specimens obtained from biopsy or surgery are formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE). FFPE ruins sequencing capabilities, denatures everything, and ruins the samples. How is that going to be predictive to the behavior of \"living\" cells in spontaneously formed colonies or microspheres? Can it describe the complex behavior of living cancer cells in response to the injury they receive from different forms of chemotherapy? There is a big difference between \"living\" and \"dead\" tissue. All the gene amplificaton studies can tell us is whether or not the cells are potentially susceptible to this mechanism of attack. They don't tell you if one drug inhibitor is better or wrose than another drug inhibitor which may target this. No gene-based test can discriminate differing levels of anti-tumor activity occurring among different targeted therapy drugs. Nor can an available gene-based test identify situations in which it is advantageous to combine a targeted drug with other types of conventional cancer drugs. The cell is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems\u2019 response to drug treatments, not just one target or pathway.",

      "Content": "After reading the article on \"Fewer Breast Cancer Patients to Get Chemo\" from AP and receiving an email from one representative of Genomic Health, Inc. the originators of Oncotype DX, I was told that \"Oncotype DX had been incorporated into NCCN Breast Cancer Clinical Guidelines as well as reviewed by ASCO to be considered by oncologists for treatment planning for the validated eligible patient population.\" Speaking to another respresentative of Genomic Health, I am told that \"Oncotype DX has not been incorporated into NCCN Breast Cancer Clinical Guidelines as well as reviewed by ASCO to be considered by oncologists for treatment planning for the validated eligible patient population.\" To that I ask, Why Not? What a cancer patient would like ideally, is to know whether they would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. If so, which active drugs have the highest probability of working and are relatively non-toxic in a given patient. By testing the gene expression markers of a patient, oncologists can identify those patients unlikely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy from those that would. If the patient needs adjuvant chemotherapy, by testing the patient's tumor cells and testing the patient toxicity tolerance, the oncologist can select drugs that have a higher probability of being effective for an individual patient rather than selecting drugs based on the average responses of many patients in large clinical trials. The gene expression markers (assays) actually can be calibrated to provide information both about the possibility of recurrence and also chemosensitivity. The problem is dissecting one from the other. Studies to date have just looked at whether people had a recurrence. You can identify gene expression patterns which correlate with this. But it can be hard and even impossible to tell what exactly you are measuring. Is it intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor? Is it the sensitivity to adriamycin? The sensitivity to cyclophosphamide? To taxol or tamoxifen? You find a gene expression panel which correlates with something, but picking apart the pieces is hard. You can begin to do this if you combine gene expression studies with cell culture studies. Use the cell culture as the gold standard to define the difference between sensitivity and resistance. Then see which pattern correlates with which for individual tumors and individual drugs. It can theoretically be done (and certainly will be done, over time), but it's not easy. And then you come to the 1,000 pound gorilla of a question: What effect will the different individual drugs have in combination in different, individual tumors? This is where cell culture assays will always be able to provide uniquely valuable information. But it's not one versus the other. The best thing is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. One month's worth of herceptin + avastin costs $8000. That's without any docetaxel and blood cell growth factors and anti-emetics. Just what is it going to take ASCO and NCCN to bring cutting-edge technology from under the bushel basket and into the light? They have single-handedly done more over the past 20 years to keep this technology from standard treatment. It has ultimately hurt literally hundreds of thousands of patients. We'd be further along and technology would have improved, even more accurate. New treatments would have been discovered and targeted immediately to the people who could most benefit from them, and spare those that do not. This has been one great lost of opportunity in clinical cancer research. If nothing else, we can't afford too much trial and error treatment.",

      "Content": "I've heard from breast cancer patients who were bumped from the T-DM1 clinical trial because of disease progression, which meant that their cancer was growing despite the drug. Bumped off the trial because of disease progression? Wonder how many more patients there were like this? Response rates (how much a tumor decreased in size) can be inflated when excluding patients during clinical trials (evaluable patients). Patients not considered \"evaluable\" are often those who do not get the benefit of an entire treatment plan. The response rate is calculated after removing patients, who die or have been excluded, from the calculation. This inflates the response rate. But clinical oncologists want to publish their papers. They need to report on the outcomes of their experiments, but if they had to wait for survival data, it could take years until all the data was aggregated. That wouldn't bode well for them to participate in pharma-sponsored trials in the future. Response rates give clinical oncologists the opportunity to take a more optimistic look at therapies that have limited success. They can describe results as being complete remission, partial remission or simply clinical improvement. If they treat all patients for three weeks, they can fairly evaluate the efficacy of a compound, which takes that lone (on average) before it can be regarded as effective. If they disregard all patients who die or were excluded after onset of therapy, and include only those treated three weeks or more, they can improve their data. To justify their existence, they have to publish papers. That's what they do. http://cancerfocus.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3768",

      "Content": "Guidelines unveiled at the Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium suggest far fewer women getting chemotherapy for their cancers. It calls for choosing a treatment based on each woman's particular type of tumor. Hornone status becomes the single most important factor in picking treatment. Chemo was described in a media release as being a sledgehammer, killing all rapidly dividing cells whether they are out of control cancerous ones or healthy ones that naturally grow quickly. That's why chemo causes so many side effects. Dr. Robert Carlson, one of the physicians who led the guideline-writing group, says that several developments in recent years help doctors pick who really needs it. One is the realization that breast cancers have different causes, arise from different types of cells, are driven by different genes, and tend to be different in women before or after menopause. So \"one-drug-fits-all\" is not the solution. A new lab test can help doctors sort it out. It is called Oncotype DX. It can measure the activity of dozens of genes and reveal which ones are most active and what treatments would work best. The test is expensive, but many insurers cover it because it often prevents even more costly and unnecessary chemo. Dr. Larry Norton, breast cancer chief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, compares it to lab tests that pinpoint a germ so the right antibiotic can be prescribed, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing (see Chemosensitivity Testing post). http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051210/APA/512100677 A comment about the Oncotype DX testing and the approval of it by ASCO and NCCN. There is nothing wrong about the Oncotype DX, just the double standard by ASCO and NCCN. ASCO and NCCN wouldn't even consider the data for predictive accuracy of Cell Culture Drug Resistance Testing (CCDRT), which is the only data existing to validate the Oncotype DX test, which wasn't even a prospective study and certainly wasn't a \"real world\" study. And the Oncotype DX test hasn't been independently validated by any more than the original laboratory group which published the results. And yet ASCO and NCCN concluded that the Oncotype DX test may be used and perhaps should be used (a truly double standard). If documented clinical \"efficacy\" is the standard to be demanded of non-proprietary laboratory tests, then clinicians should abandon all tests currently used in their practices. It will be interesting to see which standard is applied in the future to other laboratory tests associated with the prediction of drug resistance. I can't believe that the Journal of Clinical Oncology has now published three comprehensive reviews, all of which were largely the exact same paper in which there was no consideration whatsoever of the only type of data which existed to validate any other laboratory test. It just boggles the mind. In other words, the exact same qualifications that ASCO and NCCN used to accept the Oncotype DX test are the exact same qualifications that ASCO and NCCN disqualified the use of Cell Culture Drug Resistance Testing (CCDRT). The greatest poison in all the world is an overdose of certitude. As the number of possible treatment options supported by completed randomized clinical trials increases, the scientific literature becomes increasingly vague for guiding physicians. Almost any combination therapy is acceptable in the treatment of cancer these days. Physicians are confronted on nearly a daily basis by decisions that have not been addressed by randomized clinical trial evaluation. Their decisions are made according to experience, new basic science insights, bias or personal preference, philosophical beliefs, etc.. I think that the concept that some \"authoritative\" organization (made up primarily of practioners and researchers with built-in conflicts-of-interest) should determine the \"correct\" approach to cancer treatment has been harmful to progress. We need to aim higher!",

      "Content": "The FDA just approved the new treatment for about 20% of breast cancer patients who have a particular form of the disease that overproduces the protein HER-2. The drug now called Kadcyla, combines the Herceptin with a powerful chemotherapy toxin and a third chemical linking the medicines together. The chemical keeps the drugs intact until they bind to a cancer cell, where the medication is released. The cost of the drug is about $9,800 a month or $94,000 for a typical course of treatment. It is about twice the price of Herceptin itself and similar to the price of some other new cancer drugs. The label of Kadcyla has a warning saying the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity and death. It can also cause serious birth defects or fetal death for women of childbearing age. http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/uc The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla, Genentech), also known as T-DM1, for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. T-DM1 is indicated for patients who were previously treated with the anti-HER2 therapy trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and a taxane chemotherapy. This product offers a new twist on an older product; it is an antibody\u2013drug conjugate in which the HER2-targeted antibody trastuzumab is chemically linked to the cytotoxin mertansine (DM1). The antibody homes in on HER2 breast cancer cells, delivering the chemotherapy directly to the tumor, which reduces the risk for toxicity. T-DM1 \"delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression, and prolong survival,\" said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products at the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press statement. \"It is the fourth approved drug that targets the HER2 protein.\" In the pivotal phase 3 EMILIA study, patients receiving T-DM1 survived nearly 6 months longer than patients receiving the standard therapy of lapatinib (Tykerb) plus capecitabine (Xeloda) (median overall survival, 30.9 vs 25.1 months). Also, there were fewer grade 3 or higher (severe) adverse events with TDM-1 than with standard therapy (43.1% vs. 59.2%), according to the company. The approval represents a \"momentous\" day in breast cancer, said Kathy Miller, MD, from Indiana University in Indianapolis, in her Miller on Oncology Medscape blog. \"Our HER2-positive patients with metastatic disease have another very powerful therapy that offers the real hope for prolonged disease control with less toxicity,\" she said. \"This is the classic light-beer scenario; it's less filling and tastes great,\" she summarized, adding that T-DM1 was more effective in EMILIA than standard therapy on every outcome: overall response rate, disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival. However, another expert sees T-DM1 in a less dramatic light. Steve Vogl, MD, a private practitioner and former academic who practices in the Bronx, New York, called T-DM1 a \"nice\" drug when he discussed the product in an online essay last year. T-DM1 causes \"no alopecia, little neutropenia, and only moderate thrombocytopenia. It requires only a short infusion every 3 weeks, lacks cumulative toxicity, and has a response rate as first-line chemotherapy that is about the same as that of docetaxel and trastuzumab, with apparently longer remissions,\" he wrote. However, Dr. Vogl called the EMILIA control regimen (lapatinib and capecitabine) \"distinctly suboptimal\" and not a standard of care, even though it is an FDA-approved treatment option in this setting. \"TDM-1 does not meet [the] goals of a major advance,\" wrote Dr. Vogl, who explained that such an advance must cure some patients, increase the rate of clinical complete remission, or produce a high rate of very long partial response. TDM-1 does not provide a \"major change in prognosis\" for women with metastatic disease who have progressed on trastuzumab treatment, he wrote, adding that it is likely to be \"very expensive.\" Study Data and Boxed Warning The international open-label EMILIA study involved 991 patients with HER2-positive locally advanced breast cancer or metastatic breast cancer who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane chemotherapy. The study met the coprimary efficacy end points of overall survival and progression-free survival (assessed by an independent review committee). Median progression-free survival was longer with TDM-1 than with lapatinib plus capecitabine (9.6 vs 6.4 months). In addition, patients treated with TDM-1 lived significantly longer without their disease getting worse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; reduction in risk of disease worsening or death, 35%; P < .0001). The risk of dying was 32% lower with TDM-1 than with lapatinib and capecitabine (HR, 0.68; P = .0006). For patients receiving TDM-1, the most common adverse events (occurring in more than 2% of participants) of grade 3 or higher were low platelet count (14.5%), increased levels of enzymes released by the liver and other organs (8%), low red blood cell count (4.1%), low levels of potassium in the blood (2.7%), nerve problems (2.2%), and tiredness (2.5%). T-DM1 was reviewed under the FDA's priority review program, which provides for an expedited 6-month review of drugs that might provide safe and effective therapy when no satisfactory alternative exists, or that offer significant improvement over comparable products on the market. T-DM1 is being approved with a boxed warning that alerts patients and healthcare professionals that the drug can cause liver toxicity, heart toxicity, and death. The drug can also cause severe life-threatening birth defects, so pregnancy status should be verified prior to starting T-DM1 treatment. Dr. Vogl has disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Dr. Miller reports financial ties with Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AstraZeneca, Roche, and Clovis Oncology. Citation: FDA Approves New Treatment for Metastatic HER2 Breast Cancer. Medscape.

      "Content": "The most common cancers to involve the leptomeninges are breast cancer, lung cancer and melanomas, and now, because of dose-intense combination chemotherapies, even ovarian cancer is more common. Unfortunately, cancer cells are too small to find on any scans unless they have grown into a lump. There can still be cancer cells in the body even though scans may have indicated that all the cancer had gone. Carcinomatous Meningitis (Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous) is caused by cancer cells getting into the thin sheets of body tissue that surround and protect the brain and spine. These sheets are called the meninges. Meningitis means inflammation of the meninges and Carcinomatous just means acting like a cancer. Most people are familiar with meningitis caused by an infection. But with Carcinomatous Meningitis, it is the cancer cells in the meninges that cause the inflammation, not an outside infection. Cancer cells do not always develop into an active secondary tumor when they have spread to a new site. Sometimes they stay inactive for many years. Even after a cancer appears to have been successfully treated, some cancer cells may still be elsewhere in the body. No one knows why some cancer cells stay inactive or what triggers them to form a secondary cancer. Tumor cells reach the Meninges (or leptominges) by hematogenous (blood) spread or by direct extension from pre-existing lesions and are then disseminated throughout the neuroaxis by the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients present with signs and symptoms from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion into the brain or spinal cord, alterations in blood supply to the nervous system, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways or general interference with brain function. Diagnosis is most commonly made by lumbar puncture, although the CSF cytology is persistently negative in about 10% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Radiology studies may reveal subarachnoid masses, diffuse contrast enhancement of the meninges or hydrocephalus without a mass lesion. Doctors estimate that about 5 out of every 100 patients who have cancer develop carcinomatous meningitis. It is most common in breast cancer, but it can occur with any type of cancer. The cancer cells in the meninges can cause a range of symptoms, including confusion, headaches and weakness. This condition is very difficult to treat. The main aim is to help control symptoms and not cure the disease. Chemotherapy injected into the spinal fluid (via Ommya Reservoir in the brain) or radiotherapy to the brain are both treatments for Carcinomatous meningitis. Some patients respond to these treatments, but the prognosis is generally poor. There are no set guidelines for treating this condition as oncologists don't really know which treatments work best. Without treatment, the median survival of patients is 4 - 6 weeks and death occurs from progressive neurologic dysfunction. Radiation therapy to symptomatic sites and disease visible on neuroimaging studies and intrathecal chemotherapy increases the median survival to 3 - 6 months. Major favorable prognostic factors include excellent performance status, absence of serious fixed neurologic deficits, normal CSF flow scans and absent or responsive systemic tumor. Oncologists have been looking at using different combinations of chemotherapy drugs to treat Carcinomatous Meningitis secondary to the primary cancer. They found that giving both chemotherapy injected into the bloodstream and chemotherapy given directly into the spinal fluid improved the outlook for some people. However, aggressive therapy for this disorder is often accompanied by necrotizing leukoencephalopathy which becomes symptomatic months after treatment with radiation and intrathecal methotrexate. Current available therapies are toxic and provide limited benefits.",

      "Content": "The only light I can shine on this, unfortunately, is that an article in the May 2005 issue of Oncology News International (Vol. 14, No.5) reports that neoadjuvant chemotheray with paclitaxel (a taxane) causes a massive release of cancer cells into the circulation. Katharina Pachmann, M.D., of Friedrich-Schiller University in Germany said that ironically, paclitaxel produces the greatest degree of tumor shrinkage but also the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. Dr. Pachmann said that this observaton corresponds with results found in patients, that tumor response does not mean increased survival. In three different paclitaxel-containing regimens, circulating cell numbers massively increased, whereas tumor size decreased. The results indicate that monitoring of circulating tumor cells can contribute to understanding of tumor-blood interactions and may provide a valuable tool for therapy monitoring in solid tumors. Another study reported in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2002;63:6-15) by Christos Kosmas, M.D., of the Medical Onoclogy Unit at Helena-Venizelou Hospital, Greece said that Carcinomatous Meningitis (or Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous) after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased when compared retrospectively to non-taxane-treated patients. Results of these kinds of studies are coming out slowly and quietly (now that taxol is off-patent) and indicate that taxol-containing regimens didn't prolong survival over other more conventional and less expensive cytotoxic drugs. It may indeed give clinical response (tumor shrinkage, not cure), sometimes impressive, however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a response to taxanes are often dramatic. Even if one or more chemotherapy regimen is identified as being likely to work on a particular cancer, has the science advanced to tell us whether application of the chosen chemotherapy regimen will not cause other changes that also cause cancer to later return and perhaps be even harder to treat? Is it a case of chemotherapy being bad, in cases where it apparently works? Tradiational chemotherapy is mutagenic (changes in form), you might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more aggressive fashion. Is taxol the vioxx of cancer drugs?",

      "Content": "Wow! There has been some activity on this thread. As I stated in one of the previous postings, the Kosmas study indicated that this disease after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased when compared retrospectively to non-taxane-treated patients. And the Pachmann study has found out, by using a technique that quantifies cirulating tumor cells, that three different paclitaxel-containing regimens produce the greatest degree of tumor shrinkage but also the greatest release of cirulating tumor cells. Circluating tumor cells are cancer cells that have detached from solid tumor and enter the blood stream. This can begin the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. My wife's recurrent ovarian tumor was poorly-differentiated and never should have been treated with taxol. She should have been treated with single-agent carboplatin, particularly since it is the same mechanism (alkylating agent) that affects tumor cells like the Chlorambucil (Leukeran) she received twenty-five years prior for her original ovarian cancer. And years later, I find out about the Pachmann and Kosmas studies. A disturbing study from Dana Farber Cancer Institute identified as many as 34% central nervous system metastases in women who receive Herceptin therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy frequently develop brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin. While my wife's Carcinomatous Meningitis was from ovarian cancer, I had a relative that had the exact same disease at the exact same time as my wife, except from lung cancer. He stayed at the local community hospital and expired some two months later. I yanked my wife out of the same community hospital and took her to a University Hospital. She lived for another fourteen months. She received the intrathecal methotrexate treatment without whole brain radiation, but needed spinal radiation for three mets. One has to remember she was already suffering from the side effects of whole brain radiation two years prior, which has some similar symptoms to Carcinomatous Meningitis. She had much of the same symptoms as others described on this thread. Minutes before she expired, her temperature was normal, her blood pressure was normal, but her pulse was 150 (tachycardia). Her heart was racing to keep up with the lack of brain function and finally quit (she blew an embolism). This was after two weeks of her curling her hands into a fist. I would roll up wash clothes into little footballs and place them inside her hand to keep her from breaking the skin. Two weeks before, her daughter said to me, \"I look into mom's eyes and I don't see her in there anymore.\"",

      "Content": "Hi too stoutej I am also sorry to read about your wife's situation, particularly after reading this morning about the TV actress Valerie Harper being diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (another name for it) from lung cancer. I had a relative who had LC from lung cancer, at the very exact same time my wife had LC from ovarian cancer. If you read my paper on Taxol at cancerfocus.org , yes, Taxol is a culprit (dissemination after taxane-based chemotherapy). Taxol produces the greatest degree of tumor shrinkage (which got it FDA-approved in 1992 with only 30% efficacy), but also the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. And my wife also had a non-further evaluated lesion on her vertebrae (L3) from the year before. Same as my relative. When I asked about this lesion the year before, I was told it was nothing and not to worry about it. That was well before I investigated the radiation oncologist and found out how incompetent he was. That's what may happen when you go to a local community cancer center as opposed to a teaching institution. DepoCyt is a cytarabine liposome injection (Ara-C) for intrathecal use only, along with Methotrexate and Hydrocortisone. Ara-C is a clear liquid that can be dripped into a vein (intravenous infusiong), into the spinal fluid (intrathecally), or by an injection just under the skin (subcutanesously). There have been some clinical trials using Temodar (temozolomide) instead of Methotrexate, Ara-C, or combination Gemzar (gemcitabine) plus Thiotepa in treating patients with this disease from a solid tumor. There are a few reports of remission with Xeloda (capecitabine). There is a Pilot Study of Avastin (bevacizumab) for neoplastic meningitis and Alimta (pemetrexed disodium) in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with leptomeningeal metastases.

The lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is commonly used to look for malignant cells or elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. That's how they verified my wife's disease. Assay labs have only received about a half dozen specimens over the years. Of those, actually only one specimen had sufficient tumor cells for testing. The problem is that it's not safe to take more than a few ml of it, and there are typically not enough cells to test more than one drug, if that. The yield of tumor cells is too small. Sure, there may be a few tumor cells there, but not of sufficient quantity to be useful for cell culture testing. You can get, at most, several CCs (maybe a tenth of an ounce) of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. About 500 - 1000 ml of fluid with a tumor cell percentage greater than 30 and the ratio of tumor to reactive cells should be greater than 2:1 with 20,000 units of heparin per liter. If there would be another site of the disease (lymph node, pleural fluid, ascites), then that could be analyzed. The biology of the disease, in all probability, would be similar to that of the lymph node, pleural fluid, ascites. You can get hundreds to thousands of CCs of pleural fluid or ascites, and the number of tumor cells per CC is typically much greater in these fluids than in cerebrospinal fluid. Unfortunately, there is more and more cases of this disease being reported. Many doctors do not understand this disease. However, I do not feel that it is just one of the terrible trade-offs in treating cancer. cancerfocus.org /forum/showthread.php?t=648\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cancerfocus.org /forum/showthread.php?t=648",

      "Content": "Unfortunately, cancer cells are too small to find on any scans unless they have grown into a lump. There can still be cancer cells in the body even though scans may have indicated that all the cancer had gone. Leptomeningeal metastasis (Lepteomeningeal Carcinomatous or Carcinomatous Meningitis) is a condition caused by cancer cells getting into the thin sheets of body tissue that surround and protect the brain and spine. These sheets are called the meninges. Meningitis means inflammation of the meninges. Carcinomatous just means acting like a cancer. Most people are familiar with the type of meningitis caused by an infection, but with carcinomatous meningitis, it is the cancer cells in the meninges that cause the inflammation, not an outside infection. Cancer cells do not always develop into an active secondary tumor when they have spread to a new site. Sometimes they stay inactive for many years. Even after a cancer appears to have been successfully treated, some cancer cells may still be elsewhere in the body. No one knows why some cancer cells stay inactive or what triggers them to form a secondary cancer. Tumor cells reach the meninges by hematogenous (blood) spread or by direct extension from pre-existing lesions and are then disseminated throughout the neuroaxis by the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients present with signs and symptoms from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion into the brain or spinal cord, alterations in blood supply to the nervous system, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways or general interference with brain function. Secondary cancers from a primary cancer can develop in different parts of the body, including the brain or spine. Cancer cells do not always develop into an active secondary tumor when they have spread to a new site. Sometimes they stay inactive for many years. So, even after a cancer appears to have been successfully treated, some cancer cells may still be elsewhere in the body. No one knows why some cancer cells stay inactive or what triggers them to form a secondary cancer. Diagnosis is most commonly made by lumbar puncture, although the CSF cytology is persistently negative in about 10% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Radiology studies may reveal subarachnoid masses, diffuse contrast enhancement of the meninges or hydrocephalus without a mass lesion. Doctors estimate that about 5 out of every 100 patients who have cancer develop carcinomatous meningitis. It is most common in breast cancer, but it can occur with any type of cancer. The cancer cells in the meninges can cause a range of symptoms, including confusion, headaches and weakness. The condition is very difficult to treat. The main aim is to help control symptoms and not cure the disease. Chemotherapy injected into the spinal fluid (via Ommya Reservoir in the brain) or radiotherapy to the brain are both treatments for Carcinomatous meningitis. Some patients respond to these treatments, but the prognosis is generally poor. There are no set guidelines for treating this condition as oncologists don't really know which treatments work best. Without treatment, the median survival of patients is 4 - 6 weeks and death occurs from progressive neurologic dysfunction. Radiation therapy to symptomatic sites and disease visible on neuroimaging studies and intrathecal chemotherapy increases the median survival to 3 - 6 months. Major favorable prognostic factors include excellent performance status, absence of serious fixed neurologic deficits, normal CSF flow scans and absent or responsive systemic tumor. Oncologists have been looking at using different combinations of chemotherapy drugs to treat Leptomenigeal Carcinomatous secondary to the primary cancer (Chemosensitivity Testing may help in this process). They found that giving both chemotherapy injected into the bloodstream and chemotherapy given directly into the spinal fluid may improve the outlook for some people. However, current available therapies are toxic though, and provide limited benefits. Approximately 50% of lung and breast cancer patients who survive more than one year with Leptomeningeal metastasis treated with repeated injections of intrathecal methotrexate develop leukoencephalopathy which includes confusion, dementia, somnolence or focal neurologic signs. This usually occurs when intrathecal methotrexate is combined with irradiation and this combination should be avoided if possible. The leukoencephalopathy may improve if intrathecal methotrexate is discontinued, although it may also progress to coma and death. Leucovorin is a faster acting and more potent form of folic acid. It is used as a rescue after dose-intense methotrexate therapy to lessen and counteract the effects of methotrexate toxicity and other folic acid antagonists. A medical oncologist involved with Chemosensitivity Testing has stated that their lab has only received maybe four Lepomeningeal Carcinomatous specimens over the years. Of those, only one specimen had sufficient tumor cells for testing. The problem is that it requires a specimen of cerebrospinal fluid, and it's not safe (with LC) to take more than a few ml of spinal fluid, and there are typically not enough cells to test more than one drug, if that. If there would be another site of the disease (lymph node, pleural fluid, etc.), then that could be biopsied. The biology of the disease, in all probability, would be similar to that of the lymph node, pleural fluid, etc. tumor. If an assay test could not be performed and the disease had to be treated empirically, one protocol could be giving intrathecal thiotepa plus systemic gemcitabine (the gemcitabine given prior to the thiotepa). Thiotepa may be safely given intrathecally. Gemcitabine can probably be given intrathecally (it is somewhat similar to cytarabine), but it is thought that no one has ever done a clinical trial to prove that this is feasible and safe. In principal, the best shot would be to give intrathecal gemcitabine + intrathecal thiotepa. Another alternative to Methotrexate is Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) or Ara-C. It is an anti-metabolite (like Methotrexate) which stops cells making and repairing DNA. Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA in order to grow and multiply. Ara-C is a clear liquid that can be dripped into a vein (intravenous infusion), into the spinal fluid (intrathecally) or by an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). http://pathology2.jhu.edu/ovca/story.cfm?PersonID=33",

      "Content": "Larry Weisenthal, MD, PhD The last issue of The ASCO Post reports encouraging results with platinum-based treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (September 15, 2013). We predicted these findings 4 years ago in a presentation at the 2009 Breast Symposium.1 We compared the activity of a series of agents (platinum, taxane, alkylating agent, and anthracycline) tested in cell cultures of fresh biopsy specimens of triple-negative breast cancer, in comparison with the activity in non\u2013triple-negative breast cancer, previously untreated ovarian cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and late-relapse ovarian cancer. We reported the following conclusions: 1. Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer is dramatically more sensitive to cisplatin than is ER-positive breast cancer. 2. HER2-negative breast cancer is slightly more sensitive than is HER2-positive disease. 3. ER-negative/HER2-negative breast cancer is more sensitive than is ER-negative/HER2-positive disease. 4. Poorly differentiated breast and ovarian tumors are more sensitive than are moderate and well-differentiated tumors. 5. Non\u2013triple-negative breast cancer subsets are more resistant to cisplatin than are cases of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. 6. Triple-negative breast cancer is equally sensitive to cisplatin as is previously untreated ovarian cancer, and cisplatin is the most active of the four tested drugs in triple-negative breast cancer. It is gratifying to see the clinical validation for our prediction based on cell culture testing. With regard to the \u201cexciting new assays coming down the pike to help us identify which patients may respond to platinum agents,\u201d there is a very impressive peer review literature confirming the predictive value of fresh tumor cell culture assays with cell death endpoints to reliably predict for the clinical benefit of platinum agents in human neoplasms. These latter tests are already available from licensed clinical laboratories; however, in the absence of results from individualized cell culture testing, the markers that best identify breast cancer patients for platinum therapy are ER-negative, HER2-negative, and Bloom-Richardson Grade 9/9 (data shown in abstract.1) Disclosure: Dr. Weisenthal reported no potential conflicts of interest.

      "Content": "Replies to comments regarding personalized cancer treatment, as published in the December 15, 2013 \"ASCO Post\" (American Society of Clinical Oncology publication). By Larry Weisenthal, MD December 15, 2013, Volume 4, Issue 20 Dr. Mason states that I implied that Dr. Telli supports the routine application of chemosensitivity assays. I have no knowledge regarding Dr. Telli\u2019s views on this subject, nor did I in any way attempt to represent her views, much less imply that she was supportive of anything relating to chemosensitivity assays. Dr. Mason also raises the issue of conflict of interest. I am an expert in chemosensitivity testing, with 35 years of largely full-time experience with the relevant technologies. Dr. Telli stated that her group was working on predictive markers to identify the best candidates for platinum treatment in breast cancer. I quoted our data presented at the 2009 Breast Cancer Symposium, which prospectively identified the best candidates for such treatment as being patients with triple-negative disease and a Bloom-Richardson score of 9/9. My laboratory provides neither marker studies for triple-negative disease nor Bloom-Richardson scoring. Obvious vs Nonobvious Conflicts Let\u2019s imagine that I were a pathologist, who pointed out to Dr. Telli that there was prior work suggesting that the above routine pathology markers could be useful in identifying candidates for platinum treatment. Would this be a conflict of interest? Dr. Mason seems to be implying that any expert/specialist who provides a service related to his/her comment should declare a conflict of interest. Thus, a radiotherapist commenting on a surgical study should declare a conflict of interest, a chemotherapist commenting on a radiotherapy study should declare a conflict of interest, and so forth. In my case, it was obvious from my letter that I performed chemosensitivity testing, as I quoted my own work in this field! In a similar vein, pathologists, radiotherapists, and chemotherapists generally make note of their own specialties in their comments, as workers in a particular field typically have the most relevant knowledge base, and their conflicts of interest are likewise obvious. One generally makes a formal conflict of interest declaration when one\u2019s conflict is not obvious, eg, most typically in disclosing a relationship to an entity not obviously related to one\u2019s medical practice, such as a relationship with an outside pharmaceutical company.  I am going to hazard a guess that Dr. Mason would state that the difference between an oncologist providing chemosensitivity testing and a pathologist providing estrogen receptor testing is that the former testing is considered to be \u201cinvestigational/not recognized by ASCO,\u201d whereas the latter is considered to be noninvestigational/recognized. But is this a fair distinction? Double Standard? To date, ASCO has provided two formal reviews of chemosensitivity testing.1,2 In both reviews, the sole criterion being assessed was \u201cefficacy,\u201d meaning the existing data relating to the question of whether the use of this testing improves clinical outcomes. In both reviews, no attempt was made to assess the considerable data documenting the accuracy of chemosensitivity testing, where test accuracy is the only criterion ever used to \u201cvalidate\u201d any predictive laboratory technology, specifically including the triple-negative tests (ie, for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2). This double standard has had the effect of halting virtually all progress in the field of chemosensitivity testing since the late 1980s. Critics have labeled the technology \u201cinvestigational\u201d and have then failed to support the investigations they have demanded, as readily evidenced by the complete absence of NIH grant\u2013supported publications in the American literature over the past 2 decades. The technologies are largely in the public domain and labor-intensive, and there has accordingly been no serious private sector money to compete with pharmaceutical company funding for clinical trials. New Development Just this year, however, there has been a new development. A large-scale (777-patient) prospective, randomized trial in chronic lymphocytic leukemia was published, supported by the British Leukemia Research Fund.3 I would ask fair reviewers to compare and contrast the quality and results of this trial with what is the self-proclaimed \u201cbest\u201d trial ever performed to \u201cvalidate\u201d estrogen receptor testing4 (estrogen receptor negativity being the most powerful contributor to platinum sensitivity in patients with triple-negative disease in our 2009 study).5 Comparing the chemosensitivity test study with the estrogen receptor study, the former had a greater number of patients and stronger predictive correlations, and used real-world test conditions (real-time processing and prospective reporting, as opposed to post hoc batch-processing and retrospective reporting). Additionally, for the first time ever in all studies of predictive markers used for treatment selection in cancer, the chemosensitivity study showed an improved clinical outcome for patients randomly assigned to test-guided treatment selection vs non\u2013test-guided treatment selection. (Patients in the empiric therapy arm had a 2.5-fold greater probability of being dead at 1 year, compared to the patients in the test-directed arm.) Lost Opportunity I view the lack of support and overt hostility to chemosensitivity testing as being the single greatest lost opportunity in clinical cancer research over the past 25 years.

      "Content": "A small molecule drug may be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Small molecule intervention can be beneficial by dissolving through the capillary cell membranes and absorbed into the brain.   What may be another alternative is high doses of two small molecule EGFR pathway drugs, Tarceva (erlotnib) and Iressa (gefitinib), given together. It might cross the blood-brain barrier and some patients may get a long-lived remission with these drugs.   High-dose tamoxifen could then be given continuously as a potentiator and an anti-angiogenic effect. This suggestion comes from cell function analysis.   There has been clinical trials with molecularly-targeted Iressa for Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous from NSCLC. Iressa and Tarceva are very similar drugs, small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, a key intermediary in the EGF cascade pathway. They act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells. EGF is epidermal growth factor. EGF is a receptor on many normal tissues/cells, and also on many cancer cells. It is a growth hormone, locally secreted by cells. It attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). It then activates signalling pathways withing the cell (a cascade of biochemical events). One type of enzyme which is involved in the pathway is called tyrosine kinase. Targeted treatments like Iressa and Tarceva take advantage of the biologic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells by \"targeting\" faulty genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and development of cancer. So, in different tumors, either Iressa or Tarceva might get inside the cells, better or worse than the other. And the drugs may also be inactivated at different rates, also contributing to sensitivity versus resistance. I'm sure that Tarceva or Iressa would be more tolerable than Methotrexate, a mean and nasty drug. And you don't have to take Tarceva intrathecally.",

      "Content": "As our understanding of breast cancer biology continues to advance, this disease has come to be understood as many different diseases. Original categorizations based on histology lead to lobular versus ductal subtypes. Thereafter, recognition of estrogen and progesterone status, and finally HER2 status provided further subcategorizations. Over the past decade, molecular subtypes have characterized this disease into a series of signatures characterized by luminal, basal and other groupings with distinct prognoses. Within the context of these categories, the triple negative breast cancers have emerged as an important target. These patients whose tumors do not mark for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 on immunohistochemical or FISH analyses, appear to carry features that segregate them into a BRCA1-like biology. This is of great interest clinically for it offers the opportunity to treat these patients with drugs found active in the BRCA mutant populations. Among the most active drugs in these patients are the PARP inhibitors. The excellent results with PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutants have been followed by striking response and survival data combining PARP inhibitors with carbo-platinum and gemcitabine. PARP inhibitors by inhibiting DNA damage response can enhance the effects of ionizing radiation, mustard alkylators, topoisomerase inhibitors, platins, and intercalating agents. We have explored the biology of PARP inhibitors in breast and other cancers. In these investigations, our lab to applies the functional profiling platform to understand how PARP inhibitors enhance the effects of drugs and drug combinations. To date, we have observed good activity for the PARP inhibitors as single agents in BRCA1 positive patients, and in some triple negative patients. More interesting, will be the results combining the PARP inhibitors with mustard alkylators, platins, and drug combinations to optimize PARP inhibitor combinations. This work is ongoing in triple negative and BRCA positive patients as well as other tumor types where the PARP inhibitors may prove useful in the future.

      "Content": "Robert A. Nagourney, M.D. Medical and Laboratory Director Rational Therapeutics, Inc. Long Beach, California I recently had an interesting conversation with a physician regarding her patient with an aggressive breast cancer. A portion of tumor had been submitted to our laboratory for analysis and we identified activity for the alkylating agents and the Taxanes, but not for Doxorubicin. After our report was submitted to the treating physician she contacted me to discuss our findings, as well as the results from a genomic/proteomic laboratory that conducted a parallel analysis upon a portion of the patient\u2019s tumor. The physician was kind enough to forward me their report. Their results recommended doxorubicin while ours did not. The treating physician asked for my input. Here, I thought, was a \u201cteachable moment.\u201d Our discussion turned to the profound difference between analyte-based laboratory tests e.g. genomic and proteomic, and functional platforms like our own (EVA-PCD). Genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic platforms measure the presence or absence of genes, RNA or protein. Gene amplification, deletions or mutations and protein and phosphoprotein expressions are examined. These platforms dichotomize patients into those who do and those who do not express the given analyte, with cutoffs for gene copy number or intensity of staining. These platforms have worked very well in diseases where there is a linear connection between the gene (or protein) and the disease state, e.g. BCR-ABL in CML for which imatinib has proven so effective. These tests have worked reasonably well in EGFR mutated and ALK gene rearranged in lung cancer, but even here response rates and response durations have been less dramatic. However, they have not worked very well at all for the vast majority of cancers that do not carry specific and well-characterized targets. These cancers reflect polygenic phenomena and are not defined by a single gene or protein expression. Functional platforms look at cellular response to injury at the systems level and measure the end result of drug exposure to gauge the likelihood of a clinical response. Our focus on cell biology allows us to determine whether a drug or combination induces programmed cell death. After all, regardless of what gene elements are operational, it is the ultimate eradication of the cancer clone (its loss of viability) that results in clinical response. As we reported in a recent paper in non-small cell lung cancer, patients who revealed the most sensitive ex-vivo profile to erlotinib (Tarceva) lived far longer than the general clinical experience for those patients who were selected for erlotinib by EGFr mutation analysis alone. Some of these patients are alive at 5, even 9 years since diagnosis. We live in a technocracy where process has taken precedence over results. We are enamored with complex scientific technologies sometimes at the expense of simple answers. A metallurgist, familiar with every last detail of the alloys used in a Boeing 747 wouldn\u2019t necessarily be your first choice for pilot. A skilled pathologist, intimately familiar with the most detailed intricacies of human diagnostics would not likely be your preferred surgeon for cardiac bypass. Cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment are two distinctly different disciplines. While we use the ER (estrogen receptor) status in breast cancer to select treatment, few oncologists would select Tamoxifen for their NSCLC patients even though many NSCLC patients express ER in their tissue. ER + NSCLC does not respond to tamoxifen and V600E BRAF mutated (+) colon cancer patients do not respond to vemurafenib, the very drug that works so well in BRAF V600E (+) melanoma. Cancer is contextual and responses are not solely predicated upon the presence or absence of a gene element alone. We must use a broader brush when we paint the likeness of our patients in the laboratory, one that encompasses the vicissitudes of human biology in all of its complexities. Where I took issue with the report, however, was its \u201cevidence-based\u201d moniker. The evidentiary manuscripts cited to support the drug recommendations, with titles like \u201cOverexpression of COX-2 in celecoxib-resistant breast cancer cell lines\u201d provided little evidence that a (+) COX-2 finding by IHC on this patient\u2019s biopsy specimen would offer any real hope of response. It seemed that with all of the really interesting science going on here, no one had taken the time to do the hard work to figure out whether any of these observations had a basis in reality. The failure of ERCC1 expression in lung cancer to correlate with response and survival or the Duke University debacle with gene profiling in NSCLC are just the most recent examples of how \u201clovely theories can be spoiled by a little fact.\u201d As we and our colleagues in cell profiling have actually taken the time to correlate predictions with clinical outcomes we have shown a 2.04 fold higher objective response rate (p 0.001) and significantly improved 1-year survival (p=0.02). (Apfel, C. et al Proc ASCO, 2013). To the contrary, it is of interest to examine the comparatively scant published literature on genomic and IHC profiling for drug selection under similar circumstances. While one group reported an underwhelming objective response rate of 10 percent in their study, (Von Hoff, J Clin Oncol 2010) a more recent study is even more illuminating. A Spanish group used genomic profiling in 254 colon cancer patients to select candidates for gene-targeted agents (KRAS/BRAF/PI3K/PTEN/MET) and provided therapy for 82. They reported a significantly shorter time to progression for targeted treatments compared with conventional therapies 7.9 vs 16.3 week (P<0.001) and an overall objective response rate of 1.2 percent, yes that\u2019s 1.2% (1/82). Human tumor biology is many things, but simple is not one of them. Reductionist thinking is not providing the insights that our patients desperately need. While we await the arrival of a perfect test for the prediction of response to cancer therapy, perhaps we as physicians and our patients should use a good one, one that works.",

      "Content": "A study was presented at the 2009 American Society of Clinical Onocology (ASCO) breast cancer symposium in San Francisco about progress in drug selection through the use of cell-based functional profiling. It delt with the so-called \"triple negative\" breast cancer (TNBC), which is estrogen receptor negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (RP-), and Her2 negative (H2-). When breast cancer presents as locally advanced disease, it is customarily treated with neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy, followed by definitive surgery. At the time of surgery, the specimen is assessed to determine if all visible tumor has been destroyed by chemotherapy. When this happens, it is said to be a \u201cpathological complete response\u201d (pCR). Data shows that obtaining a pCR is everything. Get a pCR, and the survival is excellent. Don\u2019t get a pCR and the survival, especially for TNBC patients, is very poor. How can the pCR rate be improved in TNBC? The speaker went through all the database of breast cancer cell culture assays (using cell death endpoints) and tried to see if there were any drugs which appeared to be uniquely active in TNBC vs non-TNBC. There were no major differences between the activity of most drugs in TNBC vs non-TNBC, with one glaring exception: cisplatin, which was dramatically more active in TNBC than in non-TNBC. The speaker went on to present a lot of data further dissecting which specific markers were most associated with TNBC sensitivity to cisplatin.  But, essentially, the major markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were estrogen receptor negativity and very poorly differentiated tumors. The minor markers for platinum sensitivity in breast cancer were Her2 negativity and progesterone receptor negativity. The data compared TNBC to other types of tumors. It\u2019s known that renal cell carcinomas are very resistant to cisplatin (less than 10% response rate), and that is reflected by the cell culture (cell death endpoint) data. It\u2019s known that previously-untreated, poorly differentiated ovarian cancers tend to be very sensitive to cisplatin (70% response rate), and that\u2019s also reflected by the cell culture data. When ovarian cancer patients relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have only a 25% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. When ovarian cancer patients relapse greater than 6 months following discontinuation of chemotherapy, they have a 50% response rate to re-treatment with platinum. These clinical findings are also nicely recapitulated by the cell culture assay data. Now, breast cancers which are either estrogen receptor positive and/or more than very poortly differentiated (Bloom Richardson score of 4 to eight) tend to be even more resistant to cisplatin than are previously treated ovarian cancer which relapse soon (0 to 6 months) after discontinuation of chemotherapy. In contrast, Triple Negative Breast Cancers tend to be as sensitive or more sensitive (especially when also Bloom Richardson 9/9) to cisplatin than are previously-untreated, poorly-differentiated ovarian cancers. The data clearly showed the utility of cell culture assays in \u201ctargeting\u201d chemotherapy to patient sub-groups who are most likely to benefit from treatment with given individual drugs. It is hard to see how molecular profiling tests could have produced similar insights. Genomics is far too limited in scope to encompass the vagaries and complexities of human cancer biology when it comes to drug selection. Efforts to administer targeted therapies in randomly selected patients often result in low response rates at significant toxicity and cost. While researchers continue to develop molecular probes to select candidates, the cell culture analysis platform serves as a functional profile capable of examining the nuances of cellular response to drugs. To exploit the full potential of targeted anticancer therapies, physicians will need laboratory tests that match patients to specific drugs. Cell culture assays are able to accurately predict how an individual patient's cancer cells will respond to an array of drug combinations. It is able to quantify synergistic drug combinations and individually tailor treatment.

      "Content": "Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) or \"low dose chemotherapy\" makes cell membranes more permeable and increases uptake of drugs into cells. IPT selectively targets tumor cells, which ususally have more insulin receptors than normal cells. Makes tumor cells more susceptible to chemo by modifying cell metabolism. As a result, cancer patients can greatly reduce chemo dosage (reduce it to only about 10-15%) and eliminate most side effects while increasing the effectiveness of chemo (chemo synthesizer). <p> Insulin is a powerful hormone with many actions in the human body, a principal one being to manage the delivery of glucose across cell membranes into cells. Insulin communicates its messages to cells by joining up with specific insulin receptors scattered on the outer surface of the cell membranes. Every cell in the human body has some of these receptors. <p> A healthy cell has about 1,000 insulin receptors per cell. Cancer cells have approximately 10,000 insulin receptors per cell. Cancer cells have a voracious appetite for glucose. Glucose is their unique source of energy and because of the relatively inefficient way cancer cells burn this fuel, they use up a great deal of it. Because cancer cells require so much glucose, they virtually steal it away from the body's normal cells, thus starving them. <p> When using a Pet Scan, a technician will give a cancer patient a solution of radioactive glucose (a radioactive tracer or tagged glucose). Since cancer cells consume 15 times more glucose than normal cells, the cancer cells will absorb 15 times more of this radioactive glucose than normal cells. The result is that when they do the Pet Scan, the cancer cells show up in the x-ray. <p> The Doctor lowers the patient's glucose level to around 40 and then administers approximately 15% of a normal dosage of chemo, laces it with glucose and the cancer cells receive it. It has little effect on a healthy cell. Patients do not get sick, lose their hair or anything like regular doses of chemo. <p> Having ten times more insulin receptors than normal cells means that the effect of administered insulin will be ten times greater on cancer cells than on normal cells. With this difference, combined with actions of insulin in Potentiation Therapy, doctors are able to deliver an effective dose intensity of chemotherapy drugs to the inside of cancer cells, with a sparing of normal tissues. <p> The principal role insulin plays in IPT is that of a biologic response modifier. It modifies the biologic response of cancer cells in such a way that lowered doses of anticancer drugs, administered in conjunction with insulin, will kill the cancer cells more effectively. Insulin modifies the cell membrane allowing more anticancer drugs into the cell. It also modifies the growth characteristics in tumors making more of the cancer cells vulnerable to anticancer drug effects.",
