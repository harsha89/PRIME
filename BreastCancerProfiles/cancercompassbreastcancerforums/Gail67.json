      "Content": "You never said what your daughter-in-law's problem is? Why is it such a chore for her to let you take care of your grandchild? Have you not gotten along with her in the past? Have you not been close to your son?Honestly he does not sound like a good and caring son. Your time on this earth is probably limited and one would think they would be trying to make you happy instead of being so mean. Your daughter-in-law does not sound like a nice person and neither does your son. I had about the same problem years ago. If I said one thing my daughter-in-law did not like and beleive me it did not have to be much. I had my 2 grandchildren taken away from me for months. Fortunately he is not with her anymore and he has a wonderful wife now and I have 2 grandchildren 3 and 5 whom I can see anytime I like. Also I am very close to my 2 other grandchildren now that they are grown. I understand though because I did alot of crying back then.",
