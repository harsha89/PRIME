    "Content": "Hello Nicole! I am so very sorry you are struggling so much and feeling alone. Let me share a little about myself with you please; I am 65 years old. I was born and raised in England. When I was 23 years old I met and married my American husband and came to live in the United States. My husband and I have two adult children and 3 young grandchildren. We have carved out a good life for ourselves. Sadly, my blood kin were all the way across the globe, in the UK . So during times of illness or emergencies, we only had each other to count on. My husband's parents lived in Florida and we are in Illinois is you see. So I know what it is like to be solitary in times of trouble! My only sibling, my sister Carole, age 56, died of terminal kidney cancer late last November. I am still broken hearted! Grief is a journey and I think mine will be a long road! She had conquered breast cancer six years earlier by the way. So we were all STUNNED with the new diagnosis! In England , they have National Health. Which alas, these days, is nothing more than rationed healthcare! So it took several,months for my sister to be diagnosed; after which, she only lived 4 weeks. My sister was very brave. She spoke openly about her death. She told me \" if it's like falling asleep, I'll be okay! \" She didn't want to die of course. But she somehow accepted this was her fate. She had 4 adult children, but the youngest child was only 17 years old. So that daughter did discuss the fact that her mother would not be at graduation. Would not see her wed, etc etc they spoke about little things her Mother hoped my niece would include in her wedding ceremony, whenever she does marry.and things she hoped her daughter would pursue in a career. We had some funny discussions believe it or not! We painted my sister's nails and played favorite music, which we harmonized to! We took silly photos, which are now especially treasured by all of us. After my sister died, which was quiet and calm and we were all there, I was reluctant to return to my home here in the US. I was grieving, as was the test of my family in England. And I worried I would feel too alone here, where my sister's loss was not so palpable! Three weeks afterwards, I decided I needed to return home and allow my sister's immediate family move on at their own pace, in their own way. It has been tough for ALL of us! But we try to be supportive of each other. I will not lie to you, you do have difficult days ahead. But I hope you will be able to permit your Mother to speak with you candidly about her forthcoming death and allow her to tell you she is sad she will not get to see you as a wife and Mother. You see, she is grieving that right now. I will pray for you . You can write to me any time. I will always respond. I am sure others at this site feel the same way too. Please do not feel completely alone. I promise you, you are not. Bless you! Ann",
