      "Content": "I will be having a sentinel node biopsy, stereotactic needle localization and lumpectomy on Monday, April 24th. I was wondering how painful the first two procedures will be, as I will be awake. How painful is the lumpectomy when the pain meds wear off? I am a very big baby and am terrified of needles. I had a stereotactic biopsy under a local and the novacaine burned terribly when injected.",

      "Content": "I just read your message on the board and wondered how you were doing. It must have been a very stressful 2 months for you waiting to find out. I was just diagnosed with ductal carcinoma an d know how it feels to hear the news. The first doctor, (the one that did the biopsy) recommended a mastectomy, but I went to Sloane Kettering in NYC to get a second opinion and he felt it was too agressive a treatment. On Monday I will be having a sentinel node biopsy and lumpectomy followed by radiation, performed byt he third surgeon I went to. How painful was the sentinel node when they put the needle in your nipple? I am such a baby with needles and pain. Hope you are on the road to recovery and all is going well for you. Lisa D.",
