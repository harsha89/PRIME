You won\u2019t want to go through it again, and when it\u2019s over it\u2019s over. They have had the reconstruction and it looks great. I know you\u2019re scared but there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. God Bless Linda  http://www.lindakuhney.com/",

      "Content": "Awww I'm sorry you're going through this, I know that a lot of the insurances cover the two breasts now so I don't think you need to worry about that. And it is true that they do wait to put the implants in untill you heal but they do start right away with expanders. You go each week and they expand the breast, which make them full and then when you are healed they place the implants in. It's going to be ok, you will look back on this and be surprised at how strong you are. And you have us all here for you! and the Lord is by your side. Linda http://www.lindakuhney.com/  ",
