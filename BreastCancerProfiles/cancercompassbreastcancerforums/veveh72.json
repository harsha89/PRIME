    "Content": "More than three weeks ago I found a lump in my right breast. Then the next night I had intense burning and itching near my areola on the same breast. Three days after I had a clinical exam with my gynecologist who also ordered a diagnostic bilateral mammogram and ultrasound as she was certain it\u2019s a cyst. Last week I went in for the tests but they also did digital tomosynthesis which I believe is a 3D mammogram. I was relieved when the radiologist came in and told me that based on both exams I had a single 2cm cyst. Later that day, my gynecologist called me to confirm the radiologist's interpretation. I'm 36 years old and has three children but no family history of breast cancer. I'm concerned that this is more than just a cyst. What should I do? Should I get it aspirated? Am I making something out of nothing?",
