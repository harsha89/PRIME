    "Content": "Hi everyone, my name is Libby and my sister-in-law's mother has battled recurring breast cancer for years, which is how I've come to know this site. She's doing fantastic right now and we are all grateful. My thoughts and prayers, respect and admiration go out to all women battling breast cancer. Currently I'm researching Inflammatory Breast Cancer, and in particular, why when I asked 90 college-aged women if they had heard of IBC, not a single one said yes. I am researching and trying to write a story about IBC, its confusing symptoms and how women can recognize those symptoms early and protect themselves. Would anyone be willing to talk to me about this? I'd love to try to make a difference, even if it's a tiny one. If anyone with IBC or with knowledge of IBC is willing to chat, I'd be eternally grateful and do my absolute best to get my story out there and hopefully save some lives through cancer education. You can call me or email me 24 hours a day at --Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address and phone number removed. Consider private reply.
