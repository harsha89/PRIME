      "Content": "thanks Sue. I think I will show my Mom to a good psychiatrist. I hope he helps. She was diagnosed for breast cancer 4 years back. She is treated successfully but just these issues like fatigue and aggresiveness and having doubt on everyone is making us worried.  Thanks for your help.",
