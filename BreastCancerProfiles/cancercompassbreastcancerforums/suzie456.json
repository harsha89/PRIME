    "Content": "My 90 year old mother in law has 2 cancers (B1 grades 2 and 3) in her left breast not measuring more than 1 cm across each.  Her choices are removal, radiotherapy or do nothing. (She also has mild dementia, has been diagnosed this year as a high stroke risk, had a heart attack three years ago but fully recovered now, broke her hip two years ago but is also fully recovered from this)    If we do nothing the cancers could grow outside the body and get ulcerated, smelly etc...  BUT she may die of other causes before the cancer becomes too much to deal with.  Surely the cancer would grow very slowly at her age?   If we remove the breast then it could be too much for her body to cope with (although the anaesthetist has said she is frail but fit enough for the op).  My Mother also has mild dementia so she may awaken each day after the op distressed and not entirely remembering why she has lost her breast.   If we do radiotherapy the cancer may return in a year or so and this time the anaesthetist may say she is too old to operate.   At the end of the day her quality of life and comfort are our main concerns.  What should we do for the best?   Any advice would be much appreciated.",
