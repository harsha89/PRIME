      "Content": "Hello,  I know you have had this post for awhile and I am hoping your mom is holding her own.  My mom had stage iv bc and passed last year.  During her last month or so, she could hardly walk and wasn't really eating anything, just like your mom.  However, shortly before she passed she seemed to try and walk and ate a bit.  But thereafter it went downhill.  I know you are a nurse, so it seems you will be more prepared than I was.  I feel for you.  It is simply devastating.  I can tell you that my mom was without pain and in deep sleep when she passed.  At the moment of her passing, she opened her eyes for the first time in a week, looked clearly where the wall meets the ceiling and mouthed the word \"Mama\" over and over again (her mom had passed many years previously).  Such was her last gift to me, to allow me to see that she was in good hands and would be alright.  Peace to you and your mom during this painful journey.",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Mary.  My mother also has stage IV breast cancer to her liver.  She started out with a mastectomy 5 years ago, followed by chemo and arimidex.  Yesterday, we had a consultation with her dr. who suggests Faslodex to contain the cancer.  Perhaps also a light chemo to start with, but you can't do both chemo and Faslodex at the same time.  Her dr. did say she can live many years.  They have 16 drugs in their breast cancer arsenel to attack these tumors.  So please know that there is much hope for a fulfilling life.  I am so glad your mom got into MD Anderson - a premier cancer center!  You are doing all of the right things, but remember to take care of yourself.  You are grieving the loss of her health, and that is normal.  But way too early - maybe many many years - to grieve her loss.  Blessings to you all.
