    "Content": "Just wanted to chime in ... I've been on aromasin (plus ovarian suppression as I'm only 32) for 1.5 years, and my side effects aren't terrible.  Yes my feet hurt when I first get out of bed or I'm stiff after sitting a long time, but nothing lasts after I've been moving for a minute.  With any AI you have to closely watch bone density and cholesterol.  I would say my chemically induced menopause has some extreme symptoms but nothing I can't live with so far.  I do highly recommend exercise and glucosamine.  And I know I wouldn't feel comfortable without it or tamoxifen at a minimum!  Good Luck!",
