    "Content": "I was diagnosed with sarcoma (according to my oncologist it is a fast moving and fast growing kind of cancer) on my left breast in 1997 when I was pregnant with my first son. I WAS EVEN TOLD THAT I ONLY HAVE FIVE YEARS LEFT. My left breast was removed and I underwent chemotherapy (both IV and oral) for 3 months and then I stopped. I didn't finish the 6-month initial chemo. There was no effect on me - no hair loss, no dizziness, no throwing up and everything went smoothly. I stopped because I was so depressed seeing the other patients who were so sick looking. My mother and other relatives are very worried about me, so I went to see another oncologist. All she said was I am alright. Everyday I can feel a pain on the affected area. Recently, I can smell a foul odor. I don't want to see a doctor again because for me I am not sick. Truth to this, I am physically capable to do anything, I am strong, and I weigh enough. I don't think of being sick, I move on and I continue to live a normal life. I never questioned GOD for my illness because I was thinking that if not me, who else? I even forget that I have cancer. I only realize it when my mom starts to worry about me. My friends at the clinic continue to undergo chemotherapy but they look pale, and sick. Whenever they see me - they get the inspiration and hope to live. I am so proud about that because I helped people. For me, CANCER is just a state of mind. But I cannot deny that sometimes I am afraid to die because my kids are still very young to lose a mom they love so much...but I have to move on.",
