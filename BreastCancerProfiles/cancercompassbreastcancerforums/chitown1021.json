      "Content": "Hi, rlinda... first of all please know you are in my thoughts and prayers... I'm 57, diagnosed with DCIS (left breast) a few weeks ago - no prev. history and it was a shock - confirmed w/ stereotactic biopsy, had a lumpectomy last week and thank the Lord, the path. report came back clear. Had to wait 3 weeks between the biopsy and my first surgical consult because the doctor was out of town and it was one long anxiety attack! So sorry to hear you're having breast and back pain, I had something similar - developed a LARGE (2-3\" dia.) hematoma after the biopsy, felt like a big scary lump and was quite sensitive, had a hard time sleeping due to soreness, etc.. Luckily my surgeon (who was great) drained this during the lumpectomy. Ask your doctor or nurse about this, also try using warm compresses (and maybe Tylenol) to relieve discomfort. As for feeling alone, please know you are not. Hopefully you have a good medical team to help support you, as well as your husband. Have faith... you will get through this!",

Hi chitown..Thank you for your advice..How are you doing?..For me still in pain, breast and back..I am waiting till monday to call the nurse or doctor for some advice or medication..It really get to me when it doesnt stop even when i am sleeping..The lump still there, i don't know if it will get smaller or the same till my surgery..Maybe they do the same with yours that they drain it..I hope this is over for all of us, but, this is still the beginning of everything..I will keep posting with my development on my situation..By the way, did you have any lump before the stereotactic biopsy?...Or they found it during your regular yearly mamo...Please keep posted...My thoughts and prayers are with you!.. GOD BLESS! Hi again, rlinda - I had no lump before the biopsy. What happened was, a week after my annual mammogram, my gyn. asked me to return so they could get another image of my left breast. This confirmed the presence of microcalcifications. I had the stereotactic biopsy a few days later. Afterwards, I was black and blue, and the lump (hematoma) developed. I was scared this would interfere with the surgery, but my doctor reassured me it wouldn't. (P.S. My breast is swollen from the lumpectomy, but this is not unusual and the doctor said it would recede within a few weeks.) I'm truly sorry you're still in so much pain, and hope your doctor can help. Again, you are in my prayers. Please let me know how you are doing.",
