    "Content": "Hi and greetings to you all from Israel, where I live and receive treatment for breast cancer.  I too suffered terribly joint pains from aromasin and wanted to share with you different things I have found very helpful.   First and foremost, I soak my hands in warm water as soon as I wake up........this seems to help for a while.  I have also taken up aquatic exercise and swim many laps (back stroke) this allows for major movement for my arms and knees (which have been the most painful).  I have counted 25 pain pills that I have not taken as I feel such incredible relief in the swimming pool.........this relief often lasts for hours.  I am also a pianist (could not play for a long time due to the pain in my fingers)......I now play again and loosen my finger joints every morning playing up and down the scales.  I try to keep a positive attitude to the cancer and volunteer in a nursing home where people suffer so much more than I.  I wish you all only joy and health and we must be thankful that there is medication for us now (years ago, there was so little that could buy us more time).  I am grateful for each and every day and look forward to playing concerts once again.   Best wishes to all.   Lorry",
