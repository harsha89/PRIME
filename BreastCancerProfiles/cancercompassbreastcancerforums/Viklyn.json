      "Content": "Am in same position now with being disfigured and rock hard, red & inflammed with heat-started with fluid I could hear sloshing when walking & Surgeon kept waving off questions saying my body would absorb it, all of a sudden 2 visits ago he became concerned did 3 biopsies all came back negative, sent me for massage therapy & seeing no change on last visit wanted to do an MRI, Insurance wouldn't approve it so niw I go to his breast clinic for sonogram. Angry comes to mind 1st, not being warned, his cavalier attitude & still not knowing how to get rid of the rock. Appreciate reading the info & so glad my hubs took the time to find this site for me. I am Blessed!",
