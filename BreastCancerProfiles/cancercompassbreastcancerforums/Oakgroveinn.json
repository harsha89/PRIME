      "Content": "My friend had a lumpectomy last fall. I believe her diagnosis was DCIS, with clear margins and no node involvement. I believe she was Stage one. Oncotyping says her tumor (but it's gone, right?) would be moderately to highly affected by chemo. She's just gotten a FEC protocol prescription and now faces 18 weeks of that. She's an otherwise healthy 45-year-old widow with three children and a full-time teacher. I have not asked her about this because I don't want to introduce any doubt. BUT ... I feel she's doing what they tell her, and my research shows FEC in cases that are worse than hers. Is this ounce of prevention really worth a pound of cure?",

      "Content": "Thanks so much. I forwarded your response to my friend. I did some research into how doctors make their treatment decisions and there seems to be a gap between clinical trial results and the \"odds\" that doctors give for recurrence and survival rates with particular types of treatment. ALSO I read an article about watch-and-wait versus chemotherapy in early-stage bc.",
