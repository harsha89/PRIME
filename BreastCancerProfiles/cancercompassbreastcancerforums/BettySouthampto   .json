I had horrible, chronic pain for 6  months after a bilateral mastectomy 5 years ago. I know what your mother is going through. The pain was so terrible that I could do nothing but lay in bed and suffer. I went to about a dozen doctors and no one told me that it was nerve damage, but Vicodin seemed to be the most popular drug offered (but, of course, it doesn't work on nerve damage). I also had the pain injections in my back twice but they did not help and were terrible to go through. I'm sorry to tell you. Finally, after someone gave my nurse an article from the New York Times, magazine section published about 6 or 7 years ago, about chronic pain and a Boston doctor named Daniel Carr, I realized the cause of my unending pain could be nerve damage. I went to a pain specialist at Stony Brook University Hospital on Long Island, New York, Dr. Farrouk Maneksha, and he prescribed Neurontin, Fentanyl patches, and Effexor (chronic pain drains your brain's level of seratonin and an anti-depressant helps to replace it, that's one reason chronic pain causes depression). The combination was like magic for me. My pain level was lowered from 10, on the pain scale, to about 3-4 ...good enough for me to function. I got my life back. Since then the Neurontin was switched to Lyrica because I had swelling in my hands and feet. The Lyrica works better for me, but everyone is different. If you can, try to find that article for your mother to read. It focuses on the pain practice of a Boston doctor named Daniel Carr. I finally went to see him and he concurred with my doctor that I have nerve damage and that the meds I'm on are the best for now. I don't know where you live, or if you can get your mother to Dr. Carr, but he is known as one of the best pain specialists in the U.S. and now, mainly, spends his time lecturing about pain management. God Bless your mom. Tell her to try to hang in there. I know how silencing it can be to fight that kind of pain. I remember it well. BettySouthampton",

      "Content": "Hi, I had to reply when I read that you feel like you have a cement block on your chest. I have had the same chronic, crushing pain for almost 6 years now, since I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders placed for reconstruction. The pain was totally debilitating for 6 months...so extreme it was silencing, I could not talk. All I could do was try to stay on top of the pain. I had the expanders removed (although my plastic surgeon refused to do that until I had \"a note from a psychiatrist that I would not be depressed 5 years from then about not having breasts\". He really said that to me....when all that was on my mind was surviving cancer and getting out of level 10 pain! Anyway, I finally found a university pain center where a doctor there explained that I had nerve damage during the surgery. (the plastic surgeon had only offered vicodin, which did not work on nerve damage) A combination of Lyrica, Fentanyl patches, Lidocaine patches, and Effexor gave me my life back, and now I am using massage, accupuncture, and yoga. I am hoping to eventually get off the Fentanyl by using the accupuncture and yoga, as well as massage. It was interesting to hear from the massuese that my muscles were in a very tight spasm that she thought would never unwind. The pain feels like I have a tight band around my chest, or a cement block on it, but it's much better now! When I told most doctors that, they immediately thought I must have heart problems, but that was all checked out and I don't have anything wrong with my heart....so, I know how you feel and I hope my experience helps you. Good luck!!!--Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed. Consider private reply.
