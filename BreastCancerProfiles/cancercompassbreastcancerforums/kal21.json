      "Content": "I was diagnoised in 2010 with invasive BC .. stage and grade one. Now my OB says I should have the brca test and ovaries out I do not understand..tamoxifen  causes higher risk for uterus cancer.. ovaries for ovarine cancer..but you can not just start  taking out everything for prevention..That seems a bit much! Family history.. Mother and first cousin but my family is small and that is all I know of with cancer but I really don't know. Any one out there do this, I am having no problems. Thanks so much",
