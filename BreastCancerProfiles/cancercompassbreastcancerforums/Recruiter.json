    "Content": "I can't sleep on the side where the port was implanted because I become mildly short of breath and the port feels like it is digging into my chest wall.  I had it installed on June 22nd and had my first chemo treatment on June 26th.  The swelling and bruising is almost gone, but I still have the above issues.  Has anyone else had this experience? God bless you for responding.",
