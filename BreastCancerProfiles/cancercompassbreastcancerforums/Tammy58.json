      "Content": "Hi.  I took Arimadex and Aromasin - problems with both - more so Aromasin - fairly bad skeletal/joint pain.  Been taking Faslodex, have had no problems with that so far, but it is an injection, and I'm guessing it is very expensive and probably the ins. co. frowns upon its use, as the drs. don't seem to offer it until the others prove to either not work or cause too many side effects.  (I was due to get one yesterday and the nurse forgot, and I didn't remind her either.....).  I agree with trying the Brevail - flaxseed oil lignans (which is why I didn't remind the nurse about the forgotten injection).  I would look into that before Faslodex I think.  I am going to read up on it myself, only heard about it a week or so ago.  There are many natural miracles contained in flaxseed.  I have found out firsthand.  Tammy",

In a nutshell, my 46 y/o wife had stage 1, lymph node-negative breast cancer , with the tumor being under 2cm. The oncologist has informed us that she wants to administer this Cytoxan and Taxotere cocktail every three weeks for a total of 4 treatments...this along with the usual tamoxifen treatment and radiation. We're not sure what to do because my opinion is that this seems to be a bit extreme based on the circumstances...or maybe not. Any opinions? Thanks for the help. Seems like very aggressive treatment to me.  Maybe things have changed?  Do they really give chemo for Stage 1, node-negative?  When I was diagnosed in 1998, I had a masectomy.  Radiation was a given, but the deciding factor of whether or not chemo was warranted was whether or not it was in the lymph nodes. I would question it myself.  I am currently undergoing treatment for Stage IV metatstatic breast cancer - bones and liver.  I asked the dr. why I should assume chemo would work now, since it apparently didn't do anything 10 years ago, when they gave it to me as \"insurance\" - an adjuvant setting.  The answer was \"Chemo works on fast-growing cells.  When we give it in an adjuvant setting, the cells are in a dormant stage - non-fast growing, therefore the chemo doesn't affect them.\"  OK, so why did they put me through all that?  Also, a note to ALL cancer patients:  sugar feeds cancer.  Stop eating it.  The alternative practitioners have always told us that.  My regular onco dr., a professor, and researcher, at a world renowned cancer center, recently confirmed it is true.  Maybe they could have told me that 2 1/2 years ago when the cancer was found to have come back, so I could have cut out sugar then???????  What's up with that?  ",

Has anyone gotten all better after having pain while taking these meds? I trust the answers I get here more than I would my docs! Thanks for your time and help. I took Aromasin for two months.  Seems to be a gradual process for the pain and stiffness to go away.  The way my dr. explained it, since the AI's work by altering hormones, it takes a while for your body to adjust to the change in hormone balance again once you stop taking Aromasin.  Sort of like peri-menopause and menopause, it's a process.",

I took Arimadex for a year, the joint pain went away in about a month.  Then I took Aromasin, again it took about a month for all pain to go away.  (Aromasin was the Devil as far as I'm concerned.  LOTS of pain, nor did it do a drop of good. I am now taking Femara, which is a once a month shot.  I haven't had any side effects whatsoever from this one - it's been two months since I started.  My dr. says that she hasn't had any complaints from any of her patients about this drug.",
