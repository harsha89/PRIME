      "Content": "I am trying to find information that might help my mother. She had surgery to remove breast cancer a couple months ago. At that time she was suppose to start radiation also. She ended up having fluid from the lympth nodes being removed and then ended up with an infection. She has been on antibiotics since then. They were going to give her a week of radiation 2 times a day. But because of the infection they can no longer do that and now are telling her she will have 6 weeks of radiation. It has to do with the fact they had to wait to long for the infection to clear so the way they were going to use balloons isn't possible. She is now wondering if she will do the radiation. She is afaid they will hit her lungs or heart. She is a heavy smoker. Is there any research on the difference between survial rate for those who get radiation and those who don't. She had quite a few tumors removed but her nodes were ok and supposedly she was in very early stage. Thank you Linda",

      "Content": "My mother was diagnosised with Breast Cancer almost 2 years ago.  They took out some small tumors from her breast.  They checked her lympth nodes and said it wasn't in them.  Then she had a few weeks of radiation and was started on a pill that I think was like a hormone pill that blocked estrogen but I might be wrong.  This week my mother got lost and ran off the road when pulling into our driveway when she finally 4 hours later was able to get home.  We called an ambulance to have her taken to the hospital as she was disoreinted.  They have done brain scan and body scans and are saying she has a mass of tumors 10 to 12 and a mass in her lympth nodes from the breast cancer.  They are not going to give her any treatment as they don't feel it will help.  I don't understand how this could have happened.  She was supposedly given scans of her body off and on the past couple years and yet there is so much there I don't see how it could be this much this fast.  Also she was talking to me last week and I don't understand how she could be this bad with this in her brain and now she isn't even there and able to talk.  Is this a normal thing that happens or what I am so shocked and upset I don't know what to think.  We have no hope of any thing right now and I don't understand how we could have all missed the boat on this.  Linda",

      "Content": "Sorry its taken me so long to post back.  First thank you for your replies.  Now the doctors are saying my mom has lung cancer that has gone to her brain.  I am not sure what to think.  Mom is like a child. She has a boyfriend that lives with her and has power of attorney.  I want her to try going to a different cancer place with better doctors.  I can't get any one to help me with this.  They are scared to go somewhere else and miss the radiation treatment.  I am wondering if there is a way to get control through the court and get her to go.  Her being like a child now in the mind maybe it wouldn't even help her and then I would have put her through stress that would only make her unhappy.  I sure wish I knew what to do the doctor only give her about 3 months mayber more.  This really is bad if her brain is damaged permanantly it might not help her to get any treatment.  I would rather her be around even if her mind isn't good.  Sorry I am not sure this is even a breast cancer post any longer.  I don't think the doctor know.  I thought after  woman has breast cancer they are suppose to watch them and scan their brains and bodies because breast cancer can go to the brain if they had looked at her brain for breast cance they would have seen this.  Linda",
