    "Content": "I have been on Aromasin since April 2004. In March 2005 I began experiencing foot pain - generally in the heel area. It is now in both feet and so painful that I'm unable to exercise or stand for any length of time. Only very strong prescription medications make the pain bearable. The pain is intense most of the time, with a burning sensation like my feet are on fire. I didn't realize that the Aromasin might be the cause of the pain until I read the messages posted on this website. I've tried Acupuncture, wearing splints at night on both feet,and pain medication. The powerful pain medications make me dizzy and unable to drive or function at work. I'm contemplating going off the medication. I've been on Tamoxifen and Aromasin for a combined total of five years. Has anyone stopped taking their Aromatase Inhibitors - and if so - did the feet and joint pain eventually go away?",
