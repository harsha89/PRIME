    "Content": "if you haven't been seen in the two weeks since the drain was put in, you certainly should ask to see the nurse and/or doctor. It sounds like it is doing what it is supposed to do ( ie, draining the wound), It wouldn't make sense to remove it when it is still doing that ( even though you would like it gone). Call the office tomorrow and see when they can see you/talk with you.\\ Patience, it seems like you are both doing a good job !!",
