    "Content": "20 years ago I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, which had not spread to my lymph nodes. I had a modified radical masectomy. I have had 20 wonderful years of my life with a lot of happy things, but I have always had the fear of a return of bc. In July of 2007, it was diagnosed as stage 4 breast cancer. It is in my lymph nodes all over my body, and am on a hormonal therapy Femara, and Zomata, a bone hardner. I have also had 10 radiation treatments in my sternum, and my c-4 disc in my neck. Swallowing has not been easy, sometimes I can not swallow at all yet, I just finished radiation treatment last monday, and today is Sunday. I have been very tired, still trying to enjoy my 3 grand children, who are teenagers, and they are involved in a lot of school activities, which I have always been there with them. My Sons, and daughter-inlaw have been absolutely wonderful. I pray and thank God for everything he has given me. I had limited insurance, and I have had to get medicaid. That too, I am grateful. I am not sure what tommorrow holds for me, however I am not going to give up HOPE. God is good, and he helps us when we call upon him. Lynette",
