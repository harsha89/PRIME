I had eight treatments of taxotere, surgery to remove the lump in my breast and now I am on my ninth round of Xeloda. My tumor markers have dropped dramatically and I continue to work (teacher). I am told there is no cure but I am praying for remission. Would like to hear from anyone with a similar diagnosis to compare treatments and share the experience. Gail G. I just read your message and was wondering how you were doing?  I am going for a mammogram and ultrasound tomorrow because of a suspicious breast MRI.  The reason I am concerned is because my situation sounds a lot like yours.  About 5 months ago I was sent for a CT scan of my chest (for an un-related issue) and they \"incidently\" found multiple enhacing lesions on my liver.  The largest was 2.3 cm.  After several more tests including an MRI and SPECT scans I was told that \"careful consideration must be taken to make sure these nodules were not mets.\"  At the time my doctor said that we would just watch these nodules since \"You don't have cancer.\"  Now, 5 months later a breast MRI has come back suspicious.  I was wondering if you had any advice for me?",
