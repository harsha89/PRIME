This sounds just like me. How are you feeling now? I just stopped aromasin 19 days ago. I had two years of Tamoxafin and the last 3 years of Aromsin. I too am feeling VERY tired, not much of an appetite. I hope it gets better. I was thinking it was maybe the heat. It has been very humid the last couple of weeks.   ",
