    "Content": "Looking for info from others that have been on Arimidex and are experiencing any heart problems.   I had a mastectomy, chemo and radiation in 2005 and started taking Arimidex in September 2005.  About a month ago I passed out.  Happened again this week and I am scheduled for various heart tests next week.  I was told this week that my cholesterol is a bit high whiich is normal for my family.  Heart problems aren't.  I'm 58 and was wondering if anyone else has experienced this problem.  For those who are suffering with stiff joints, I've found that exercise is a big help.  In fact, I'm actually upset that I've had to stop using the treadmill and arc trainer until what is causing me to pass out can be determined.  Certainly don't want to fall off and break something ;-) I'd appreciate any info. for  ",
