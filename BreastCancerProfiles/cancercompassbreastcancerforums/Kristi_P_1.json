    "Content": "I routinely have this test done at my oncologist's office. Your oncologist has to believe in the test first. Some oncologists believe that it leads to too many false positives and therefore leads to too many unnecessary scans and tests. My oncologist believes that it is worth the false positives. Once they have a baseline number on you then they will know whether the number is rising or not. Kristi",
