In fact, because the bones are so rich in blood supply and so closely tied into the nerves, bone cancer pain can be quite severe, whether the cancer is primary or metastatic, or  very localized or more widely spread through out the bone.  Even if the metastasis is well confined to one point in your mom's back, the pain could radiate so that it seems like everything hurts. some people will have accompanying muscle spasms due to the changing calcium content in the blood stream, and that can be extremly painful, also. One of the risks of bone metastasis is osteoporosis, where the bones lose calcium, become brittle and break.  And yes, that is extremely painful also.  Hopefully the test results will be back soon, so the dr will know whether to treat with pain meds, if there is a fracture, if the Aredia is working, etc.  In the meantime, you might try to help your mom get relief from the pain through a mind technique - focusing on other things present in the here and now. (I've used this myself in a very simplified form.  I look at my cat, focusing solely on the cat, and I say either silently or aloud, \"I see the cat, I hear the cat, I feel the cat.\" and I keep repeating that same thing over and over until the pain is either subsided enough to be bearable or even better, totally gone.) You could get more information about mind techniques like this from the internet (search items: mind techniques to manage pain, or mindfulness technique - which is a somewhat different thing,) or ask your mom's dr about a referral to a pain clinician. I am not specifically familiar with Aredia, although I do know it is being  used mostly for treatment of myeloma, and is supposed to not only slow advancement of disease, but also decrease pain and reduce fractures. Some people on it will still have bone pain due to their underlying disease - I don't know if this lasts as treatment goes on or not. If you don't get any other answers on this message board specifically addressing the Aredia, you might try posting your question on the multiple myeloma board - responders there are sure to know a lot more about the drug than I do, and they may also have suggestions on how to help your mom deal with the pain. I wish you and your mom the best. Sincerely, Tre             Hi honey,                  The only way she will know, is through having scans & waiting for the results.  Just have faith & take one step at a time--day to day and make the MOST of each day! Worrying how long she is going to live (which is so easy for me to say, I know) is only going to make things more unbearable.                 If she feels up to it, go out and eat or just get her out of the house some, each day. It can take so long to get results back from a Dr. & it will drive you crazy, while waiting.  I , after like 3 days, would politely call the Dr's office & ASK if results are back--Mom is really concerned; otherwise, sometimes you'll wait forever, before you hear. The unknown can be so worrisome & painful, itself.                Have faith, be positive, and God will be there for each of you. Try to talk openly with you Mom & listen to her. Tell her how much you love her & that you will always be with her!! You sound like a wonderful daughter. Take care of the 'caretaker' / yourself & spend some time with friends, also! Prayers for you & Mom.                                                                Luv, Nursie ME",
