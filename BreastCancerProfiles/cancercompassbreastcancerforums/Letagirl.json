      "Content": "My sister had your symptoms for awhile. Then her breast became red and swollen. She then went to her doctor, who treated her for 3 weeks with antibiotics, which is standard treatment for her symptoms, but they did not help. She was then diagnosed with stage 3 inflammatory breast cancer. I pray you have seen a docter & a biopsy has been done to rule this out for you. My sister died last year, six years after her initial diagnosis. God bless and I pray you are okay.",

      "Content": "My sister and father died of cancer six months apart. My sister died sept 06 and dad died april 07. I took care of them up until their deaths. During this time, I kept reminding myself that God doesn't give us more than we can handle, but at times, I was sure He had me confused with someone a lot stronger. The other day, I read something that makes so much sense to me: God doesn't give us things to handle. He is there to help us handle what we are given. God bless you and keep you in His care, especially while you and the family raise your new little brother, a special gift from God Himself, I am sure of that!",
