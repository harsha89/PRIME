A second suggestion I always had long hair.

We are thrown into an emotional rollercoaster sometimes wondering why?  Be angry it's really OK cry if you want no worries!  You may have people give yu all kinds of advise but listen to your Dr.'s but be your own advocate too. If you have questions write them down. Talk to your Dr .  It isn't about all the right or wrong things we do, I did everything I was suppose to and yet ended up with Cancer. If you have to have Chemo get a Port a Cath.  It is much easier than the Picc . Start flexing your  hands to make sure you have mobility after a few days start stretching your arms upward It will hurt I promise but the sooner you do you won't have the frozen shoulder issues and the quicker you will have full use.. Try not to listen to all the stories of your friends sisters grandmother's best BFF who had the Exact same thing..Nope no two cancers are alike!   Give yourself a break It's not your fault!  Keep a journal or blog .. People well intentioned will say keep smiling it's all about your attitude. well guess what there are some days you don't feel like it you want to be left alone to be with your own thoughts. Your feelings are valid.. Feel free to contact me if you need some encouragement or just a place to vent..... Mostly we are here for you !!",

It has little to do with changing your attitude keep a continual smile on your face and be greatful, sorry Im not grateful. This is not normal or a new normal, that term is so over used. When I was on Tamoxifen it was suggested I have my ovaries removed. If I have to resort to surgery for every medication I take then maybe they need to re-look at these meds and find a better solution to preserve your ovaries. I told him (Gynocologist) If it ain't broke don't fix it. At the end of the day he agreed. So often procedures are used as a just in case.... there my oncologist agreed. My body hurts, my bones still ache, I try exercise riding my bike walking, but the damage was done. . So when i hear that phrase \"The new normal\" What comes to my mind, there is Nothing Normal about this!",

I told my Gyno why fix something that's not broke.  We should be made aware of these issues prior to taking drugs, then we can go into  treatment with a full understanding not be scared out of our witts later believing if we don't tow the line something bad will happen! It's unfair to us to be put in a stustion that in either case might not be in our best interest. I have since found another GYN and he agreed to go into surgery may not be the best thing Surgery is not always necessary. ",

We can't always expect to have a permanent Happy Face etched on. I was diagnosed in 2009 My son at the time was 16. I did not have family support or anyone to just sit and talk with me.  I had my son. During the months of Chemo he was there for me he cleaned me up brought water washed the floors when I didn't quite make it in time to be sick. He took over running the house doing everything including cooking!! I was and still am so proud of him for taking the inintiative and just doing. Your mom appreciates all you do. She may not be able to express herself well but she does. Don't stop school these outlets are a very important part of your life We have to become part of the \"New Normal\"!  Talk to your mom, tell her how you feel you may both cry but that's fine too.   Don't forget about your friends too. It is very important that you have your outside sources  to help you through things. Don't predict when your mom may not be here, we don't have the answer to those questions. Call the hospital in your areas Oncology Unit they always have social workers, they are there just for these kinds of situations. Keep a diary, start a blog write down your thoughts and feelings. It is hard for a child to see their parent go through this just as much as it is for your mom.  Please feel free to drop me a line if you like,  Never doubt that your mom doesn't appreciate you for all you do..  Have a movie night with your mom My son and I still do Most of all keep the lines of communication open...  I was diagnosed stage 3 grade 3 Multifocal Breast Cancer  with Lymph node involvement I remember my Oncologist telling me I could live 4 years that's great 5 years a bonus... Again he doesn't know sure they can guess but many women live a long time with STAGE 4 Breast Cancer.....Take good care Alli.......",

This is severe legitimate pain you are suffering. I'm, on Tylenol 3 and I take an ocycocet before bed. I have restless leg severe pains in my joints there are nights sleep has been difficult. I have stopped taking everything and will now look into alternatives . The pain 24/7 is unbearable. It's tiresome when the Dr.s' play dumb and try and convince you it's in your head. There are hundreds of us out there suffering. Maybe they should look into alleviating some of the side effects before blaming the patient...",

I had taken them all With Tamoxifen I was developing early signs of possible cervical cancer.  Arimidex, Femarra and the other  sucked the life out of my bones and joints.What is a baby aspirin suppose to do? Nearly 7 years later I have to use a cane and more these days a walker after a severe bout of neuropathy. I read baby aspirin and nearly gagged. I have to take a strong medication just to relieve some of the horrendous pain just so I can walk. I take Hydo-Morph and a Tylenol 3  inbetween if the pain worsens. These Dr.'s prescribe but we as the women who take this poison need to advocate for ourselves and realize One drug is not a \"One size fits all\"!! I don't regret one second stopping. Otherwise I believe I'd be pushing myself in a wheelchair..",

The side effects were were far to painful to  continue I was in so much pain having to take narcotic pain killers I was on all of them at some point going through forced menopause It was no day in the park. I made the decision that quality of my life was more important than taking these drugs My oncologist gave me the same lecture but it is lick of the draw anyway There is no assurances they will even work long term. as we reas we see tht after a point they no longer work. The damage is done to  my joints Here I am now going into my 5th year of remission.

Keep your arm mobile. Try not to baby it too much It is painful no doubt but having a frozen arm post mastectomy  with nerve damage with be worse.
