I too have rib pain under my breast, it hurts to touch it, I go back to Fox Chase next week for my second followup with the oncologist and will ask again, My gynocologist said she would never have radiation as she was in pain for years. It is just nice to know that I am not the only one with this problem! you hate to keep complaining, but it hurts when I lay a certain way or with the wrong bra on. I have found the new  Geniebras are the most comfortable. I hate not being able to wear an underwire! Well, enough of my complaining, all you want to know is that the pain is normal and then you deal with it instad of worrying.",

Also my surgeon is local and my oncologist is 2 hours away in the city. Atleast for a while I will continue with both, the radiologist has released me so I don't go there anymore.",

They are trying to keep you alive, wake up before it is to late . Hi, here it is Christmas Day and I am sitting here recuperating from a double mastectomy with reconstruction. Yes I had cancer 5 years ago I. My right breast with chemo and radiation, because it was triple negative. Now last month my mammo showed something In left breast, my fist visit this time was take them off, I am tired of worrying about this. This time wasn't triple negative, and was less than 1 cm, and all I wanted to hear when I woke was, sentional node clear. I was so worried about the reconstruction and mastectomy that sometimes I forgot about the cancer and I had to step back and say this not elective surgery, this is my life. Believe me the mastectomy is not really a big deal, there is not much pain involved. It is the reconstruction that I would like to stick a knife in! Not so much pain, I am just on Tylenol after surgery one week ago, but the drains, a pain in the butt, the tightness, maybe I should have given this more thought! I'm sure I will be fine with the end result! Just make.sure you have a wonderful oncologist , surgeon, and plastic surgeon (preferably female) , they even had a breast coordinator at the hospital that set up all my apps , follow ups , she was a life saver. Enough about me, just know if you choose a mastectomy it is not the end of the world, it will give you a sense of peace, you're doing this to save your life. Much easier than chemo and radiation !!",
