    "Content": "Hello Everyone, I hope this finds you well. This looks like a very supportive group and it is a pleasure to be here. I am in the process of completing a PhD on quality of life issues in breast cancer. I am doing this due to my own personal experience of having cancer in my family. If anyone would be willing to spare some time to complete two questionnaires for my studies, I would really appreciate it. The questionnaires are completely confidential and no names need to be provided. If you are interested or have any questions, please contact me at: --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
