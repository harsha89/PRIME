    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 2.5 yrs and also experienced weight retention...gained weight during chemo and radiation...cannot drop the weight now. But, I did find my aching joints were relieved by a high dose of B vitamins, daily. Have the hot flashes, but also was told to stay away from Black Cohosh. If you, or anyone, has ideas on how to reverse the 30lbs I gained, I'd appreciate it. I had awful leg/foot/knee pains and B Complex vitamins helped after taking them approximately 2 wks or so.",
