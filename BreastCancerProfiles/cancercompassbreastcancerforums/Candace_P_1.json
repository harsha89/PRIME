      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Invasive (inflammatory) Lobular Carcinoma of the right breast in Feb. 2002, started chemo (Adriomycin and Cytoxin) for 12 weeks, once every three weeks for four rounds, took a 3 week vacation from chemo and then started Taxol for 12 weeks, once weekly. I had a break for a month or so and then had a radical mastectomy on Nov. 1 with reconstructive surgery (free tran flap from stomach) that had to be removed the next day because of complications. I also had a reduction of the left breast at the same time so it would better match the reconstructed breast. Oh, well, I ended up with one pretty perky breast and a tummy tuck after 24 plus hours of surgery in 2 days. I had a lot of lymph nodes removed because they were affected by the cancer - stage 3b by pathology report. I started radiation treatments in January 2003 and finished up on March 3. I am also on Femara. Well, here I am, still standing and wondering what to do with the rest of my life. I don't have to go back to the cancer center anymore, except for 3 mo. check ups. I felt much safer when I was there every week because someone was always checking on something and I had blood work done weekly. Now that I'm free I feel like my high wire act just lost its safety net. Does anyone else out there feel this way?",

      "Content": "First of all, I want to thank each and every one of you for answering my message. Cancer is a slap in the face and the heart. I have had a lot of time to think in the past year and to decide what is important in life and what isn't. My small circle of family and friends have been here to encourage me and to just listen when I think out loud. I have also made visits to a wonderful psychologist who is very understanding because his wife has cancer. If you need something like antidepressants to help you through, try them. If one doesn't work there are many more. I found that Celexa helps me stop obsessing about the evil one (cancer). I am not very religious in the formal sense, but I talk to God almost every day and keep St. Peregrine close to me. I have one friend who lost her husband to melanoma 2 yrs. ago and she has been the best friend ever. She makes me laugh till fluids come out my nose. I try to keep a positive attitude and enjoy every moment I have. I think I'm going back to work next week, which will be another step at getting back to me, although wearing pantyhose again doesn't turn me on. We must use the time we have well. I will pray for all of you. I'm leaving a lot out of this note, because there is so much. I just wanted to let you know that I got your messages and really appreciate them. If any of you want to talk please e-mail me at Primrose@gisco.net. I will answer. I will also be back here. Thank you so much. I think of you all with hope, peace and love. Candy",
