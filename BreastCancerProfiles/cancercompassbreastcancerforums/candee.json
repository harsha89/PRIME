      "Content": "I tok Armidex for two weeks and said no way -- terrible pain could not even kneel on my pillow top bed  threw them away and have stayed off all medicine for 7 years.   According to my doctor says I am doing fine  just eating and drinking all the anti oxidents I can find, and he fired me -- no more office calls either.  Works for me - maybe give  it a try??   Also the anti oxidents will help even if you continue with the medicine .  Tablespoon of red cider vinegar every morning,  broccoli, and every other I can find, blueberries are loaded, pomgranates are loaded, but I hate them, so drink V 8 juice mixture pomgrante and blueberry every morning   Suzzane Somers  says none of that medicine, just the right foods  read her book -- Knock Out Great book.    --   ",

      "Content": "My cancer also did not show up on a mamogram and even on the ultrasound there was doubt, but a biopsby was ordered and there it was -- it was a mass not a lump -- but a pea size lump could be something other than cancer -- I  had two pea size lumps, one on my neck, and one on my upper thigh -- went to a doctor and found they were spider bites -- took the anti biotic and sure enough, they went away -- There is now quite a bit of doubt now as to whether mamograms are for real or even sufficient   Have you read Suzzane Somers book Knock Out -- wonderful book re: cancer, discovering it, and treating it, a must read.",

      "Content": "My breast cancer also did not show up on a mamogram nor on an ultra sound, but thankfully the diagnostician had a flash and insisted on a  biopsy -- there it was   But obviously something was wrong as the nipple had inverted Had both breasts removed so as to possibly prevent having to have the other one needing to be removed a year later -- who knows?  It has been seven years now and all is well.  Did not take any of the recommended medicine after surgery just ate and drank a lot of the right foods and liquids",
