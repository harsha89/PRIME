      "Content": "My recent annual mammogram resulted in a callback for another one on the right breast. I've never had a callback before --age 62--and am having occasional daily shooting pain in right breast on the right side of the breast that lasts for a few seconds (which they didn't know about at time of first mammogram). The repeat mammogram on right breast last week determined as \"dense/normal\". But I can't ignore the shooting pain -- something doesn't seem right. Batter reading some of the posts here, I wanted to ask for thoughts/guidance on any further steps I maybe should pursue? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your kind note. I hope you are doing well. Thinking of you and wishing good luck. I will give what you mentioned a try. :). I expected to get a sonogram at the callback but they said only if a second mammogram indicated it was needed -- and claimed the 2nd mammogram on one breast used different angles and more pressure -- and then saw no need for further testing. But ... a person seems to know and shooting pains in a breast are not usual and need some explanation.",
