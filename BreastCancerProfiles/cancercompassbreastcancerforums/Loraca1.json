      "Content": "Dear Roz57, These medications are an adventure. I am not telling you what to do but just to explain what I went through taking them. 6 weeks of Tamoxifen and the doctors told me that is why I have a sensorineural hearing loss in one ear. 3 years of Aromatase Inhibitors and all the pain issues with muscles, joints and advance of my osteoarthritis as well as a few other little goodies. Finally went for a 2nd opinion and was told to stop taking that stuff. After that amount of time I have received 90 % of the benefit it would have given me. But, I had a very small tumor, lumpectomy margins were clear, 9 sentinal nodes were clear. Had a full course of radiation. Life was tough but I hang in there. Darvocet N was my friend anywhere from 4 to 8 per day. Since stopping, I don't take the Darvocet. I am not treating with my original Oncologist, she is a fine physician but my gut said to go with the 2nd opinion. It has now been nearly 3 months and all of the aches and pains have left. Yes, I tried all of the AI's available with the same reaction. So hang in there and be tough but think about it and if you get a 2nd opinion please make it one with a prestigious and distinguished physician. The treatment for some of us is hard.",

      "Content": "Roz, Do some homework.....eliminating all milk products right now is not right thing unless you take calcium citrate with Vit. D. The AI's are very hard on your bones and can cause, osteopenia or advance to osteoporosis. The best concentration in milk products is Yogurt. Do not do anything unless you really research what this medication does.... You could be harming yourself. Do your homework....",

      "Content": "Do not just stop taking the medication. Give it a try, sometimes the side effects of a medication take a while to go away when your body becomes used to it. You have been on Tamoxifen for some time, right? Your poor body has adjusted to that medication. It might take a while for your body to readjust. Remember the oncologists are trying everything to stop this monster, breast cancer. Not all the answers are available yet. When all else fails, get a second opinion from a physician outside of the group and hospital you are treating with. There are many special centers that work on this disease process. Look for a major teaching center, one that has a med school, etc. They really have a foot up. Look for the doc that is the head of the department. I don't know how to say this without offending you but: Remember, if you just stop, you might be making the decision of a doctor but you will have a fool for a patient. I found that it didn't make a difference, whether it was Femara, Arimidex or Aromasin. Some studies show that Aromasin is easier to handle but for me they were all the same. Be strong, live happy, keep your chin up. Your personal courage will increase. No one in their right mind wants to go through the treatment process a second time but make up your mind that you 'Will Prevail'. Look into some supplements, but stay away from all things that mimic estrogen. Do some research on fish oil, IP-6, Vit E, Flax Seed oil. At least it will put you in charge of part of your health care. Look into this wonderful tool we have to get really smart about other healthful paths. Blessings, C",
