      "Content": "Hello Pradapee, Cannot give advise but we' re in the same boat...so to speak. I have Melanoma mets to spine and a rib , noticed in CT scan about seven weeks back. After RAPPID ARC radiotherapy ,...which really eased the pain and let me to walk and move better, I had spinal cement injected into damaged vertebra...which worked well. Oncologist is trying to place me in another advanced stage clinical trial. Has advised Zometa or Xgeva to help bone restructuring...infusions every three weeks. Reading the side effects of Zometa is ..as you say... Discouraging, and nether seem to actually fight the cancer. Being that I am\"self Pay\" and without insurance, cost is $2,900 for one and $1'500 for other per infusion....yes extreme sticker shock, but response rates are low so I,m hesitant... and if there is a natural supplement that might improve the bone damage, then I,ll be up for it. Have you had radiotherapy to contain spine and pelvis? So sorry cannot be of help, but I'll be following the thread with high interest... Best wishes to you. Bob",

      "Content": "Hi Pradapee...thanks for all that good info, been googling until I just had to quit!.. See that you like to well research your options so check out...... Http:// chemo care.com /chemotherapy/drug-info/Xgeva.aspx. There's six pages of detail info you can print out...got mine from the Miami hospital last week. Xgeva is also marketed as Prolia. Use same search but change name from Xgeva to Zometa and you,ll get another six pages. I just started a natural suppliment branded as AHCC recommended as an imune system enhancer, which may be the Mushroom product that was mentioned in posting yesterday . Good to hear that Jim has had less side effects using Xgeva instead of Zometa , that's all good info so thanks Jim for sharing that. I have had medical treatment during three trips to Guatamala ...top doctors and modern state of the art hospitals with reasonable costs.....medical tourism.... Check out guatemalamedicaltravel.com . If you want to see prices there vs USA ....American lady runs it, she's feels that USA medical costs are out of control... Best wishes to all. Bob",
