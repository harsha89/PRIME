      "Content": "I stopped the Femara 2 days after I wrote that post.  I started Aromasin 1 week after that.  It wasn't so bad in the beginning but now, 3 months later, it is starting to be as bad as Femara.  I made appt for next week to tell the doctor she must deal with this pain or I quit....PERIOD!  I will no longer accept the \"Take a tylenol or naproxen.\" because this pain is way, way, way beyond that.  I took 2 dilaudids from my back surgery and that didn't ease the Aromasin pain to a tolerable level.  Some of my current symptoms are.... Trigger finger/catches and locks Severe, debilitating joint pain from hips to balls of my feet and bilateral wrists and hands.  Feels like my hands are going to snap off at the wrists. weight gain headaches muscle spasms in my legs, feet and toes loss of energy neuropathy, verified nerve damage can't walk after sitting for a few minutes, feel like I'm 100 yrs old hot flashes feel like my fingers are swollen triple their size but when I look at them and they appear normal in size.  I can't do puzzles, sew, or groom my dogs because my hands don't work. legs, hands, feet throb 24/7 I'm sure there are more but I can't remember all of the problems.  Oh yes, memory problems too.",

      "Content": "I do not believe for one minute that the maker of Femara studied this drug long enough.  There is no way that any \"medication\" should case more pain that the condition being treated.  I have been on Femara since the end of September, 2010, and the pain from this Rx is like nothing I have ever experienced, and I have experienced a lot of pain in my life.  I've repeatedly been told by my doctors in the past that I have a high threshold for pain but Femara has beaten me.  I admit defeat. I think I'd rather go through chemotherapy again than to continue to suffer the side effects of Femara.  I'm in so much pain that I can't walk, thus I cannot exercise or do anything I used to enjoy.  I have no quality of life.  I feel like I'm nothing more than a waste of space.  This should not be.  Something is terribly wrong with these AI breast cancer drugs and we women are the guinea pigs for these companies.  I want to cry every day. ",
