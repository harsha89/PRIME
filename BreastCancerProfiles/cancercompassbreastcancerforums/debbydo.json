I really would love to take her out to get a chocolate ice cream soda (her favorite) but she just isnt into it... does anyone have any advice...i want to keep her happy, i  miss her smile.  It is so had to think of your parents being sad, maybe you could go get the chocolate soda and bring it to her. Can you surprise her with a  small maybe 2 or 3 friends or family members ice cream social, have the ice cream and all the toppings for all to make their own.  have each guest have their most humorus story involving  your mom ready to tell while eating the ice cream.  Seems I was most smiling when people came to visit it took my mind off of the cancer in me",

Jodie   HI Jodie I was on the Herceptin for almost a year stopped once for 6 weeks after a mugascan showed a reduction of my heart fuction, then they tested again and it had improved so I went back on it.  they said that they have experienced some reductions in the history of the drug but once the person was off it, it went back to normal.  Not permanent.  each case is different.  I am over weight and maybe that played into my condiditon.  The cardiologist says this can be handled with pills, I hate pills but the risk of the cancer coming back is worth it I guess.  The nurse said my pills will take about 2-3 weeks to really start giving me relief, and I am having more good days than bad now.  i am glad your doctor is staying on top of things.  Did you have a masectomy?  Is your cancer HER2? How did you know it came back?  blood tests? Isnt it awful to live with this doubt?  I wish you the best  Debby  ",
