      "Content": "Hi  My son had a PET scan ...it's not always that conclusive as it shows 'activity' in the body /body tissue  rather than definite cancer cells  i,e my son had 4 years previously had a bone graph taken from his hip ...the PET results came back that he had cancer in his hip/ pelvis area ...he knew himself that this diagnosis was wrong ..but it took 3 weeks and more tests to confirm this ...the PET scan had picked up his body repairing itself  in that area.  Hope this doesn't cause more confusion ...ask your consultant ..just ask ask ask ....thats what we did ...we never just took what they said and walked out ...we asked questions and we wrote down what they said ...as often when you get home you get confused ...as there is so much to take in  take care    ",
