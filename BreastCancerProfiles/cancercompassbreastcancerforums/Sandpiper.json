      "Content": "In November '02 I was diagnosed with DCIS. Lumpectomy, radiation, and five years of Tamoxifen. (I've been taking it for a little over two years.) I had hysterectomy, including ovaries, 15 years ago (not cancer related). I'm 58. I've never had an abnormal PAP. Haven't had one for four years. Not concerned. Saw oncologist probably for last time today. She said should have PAP annually while on Tamoxifen. I've never heard that before. Comments?",

      "Content": "Liz, I was diagnosed with non-infiltrating DCIS in November '02. Had lumpectomy, radiation, and am on Tamoxifen. I've had no problems. Did the surgeon put in a drain after removing the tumor? A narrow vinyl tube inserted just below incision with bulb on the end to collect fluid. Had it for a week and recorded amount of fluid that drained out. Surgeon removed it after a week. Mary D.",

      "Content": "Teresa and Liz, Everyone's experience is an individual thing. But I truly had no problems or pain due to lumpectomy or radiation. I don't know if it was due to a low dose or what, but I had very little skin reaction (or reaction of any kind) to radiation. No fatigue. Having virtually no side effects to Tamoxifen. The worst of it all was the \"cancerhead\" (as it's called on another message board I visit) -- how a cancer diagnosis messes with your mind. I'd say I'm 99% over that now. Mary D.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with DCIS in November '02 and had a lumpectomy. I'm guessing the size of the tumor may help determine whether radiation is necessary or not. My tumor was kind of on the large size. I had the usual 33 external treatments and had no problem with it. No fatigue and my skin became only pink and dry. Not bad at all. Used the recommended 100% aloe vera gel faithfully. After a hysterectomy at age 43, I had been on Premarin for 12+ years. I stopped taking that the day I got the DCIS diagnosis. As I'm estrogen receptor +, I'm taking Tamoxifen and having virtually no side effects from it. Mary D.",

      "Content": "Vicky, I read in another thread that a woman had an excisional biopsy / lumpectomy, but the surgeon did not insert a drain to drain the fluid which fills the cavity where the mass / tumor was removed. Because of that (?), she and others had problems after surgery -- moreso if they had radiation. I never would have thought of that. My surgeon did insert a drain after the lumpectomy. I had it in for a week. I had absolutely no problems with lumpectomy, radiation, or with Tamoxifen. Ask the surgeon about a drain prior to your surgery. Mary D.",

      "Content": "Vicky, I've had four biopsies (incisional in operating room, stereotactic core, Mammotome, core needle under ultrasound) and a lumpectomy. The incisional biopsy and lumpectomy included a needle localization. Only the incisional biopsy and lumpectomy were done with any kind of anesthesia. I'll admit, I had a little problem with the first localization prior to incisional. Not so much physical problem / discomfort, but as I was \"clamped\" in mammo machine nurse was telling me what was going on with localization. I just didn't need to hear that at that time. Had no problem with second localization prior to lumpectomy. (I told the nurse I'd already had the experience and she didn't need to explain it to me.) The core needle biopsy under ultrasound truly is nothing. So I would say do not stress out ahead of time about the localization and core needle. After that, you can just sleep through the excision. Best of luck with the results. Mary D.",

      "Content": "Vicky, I should have also said the localizations were done before anesthesia was administered for incisional and lumpectomy. Don't remember if I possibly had IV with sedative going already when localization was done. Again, the core needle under ultrasound is truly nothing. Don't worry about either procedure. Mary D.",

      "Content": "Everyone's experience is different. My most recent procedure was the core needle biopsy under US. If I remember correctly, I got a few shots of \"novocaine\" (small needle) in the area of the biopsy to deaden nerves on surfact of breast. The radiologist told me there are few nerves deeper within breast tissue. Of all the biopsy and localization procedures I've had, the one I felt the most was the stereotactic core biopsy. Felt like tissue deeper inside breast was being pinched and twisted. But it wasn't anything horrible. I could do it again if necessary -- even knowing in advance. Mary D.",
