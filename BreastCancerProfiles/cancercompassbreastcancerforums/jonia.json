      "Content": "I have a history of breast cancer so find myself sharing stories with other survivors. Recently, an acquaintance told me she has had very painful neuropathy in hands and feet since having chemotherapy for breast cancer. She has been in a study which involved laser treatments of affected extremities in people with neuropathy caused by chemotherapy. It was a blind studyand she was in the placebo group. She did not receive an actual laser treatment until after the study was completed. But now, after receiving one treatment of laser therapy, she has noticed a dramatic difference in the painful sensations she has been experiencing. The pain is not as intense and it occurs further down on her lower extremities. She was told that with the next treatments, the symptoms would not diminish as dramatically as with the first treatment. Once she completeded the series of treatments she will need to return for a maintenance treatment approximately every 6 months. Te study was done in Minnesota-possibly through the University of Mn. This woman is hoping that with the positive outcome of the study, that insurance will soon cover this treatment. I hope I have given accurate information about this!",

      "Content": "i had really bad bone pain for about 4-5 days after neulasta injection. It felt like someone was hitting me with a hammer on my long bones of arms and legs. The next appt, I spoke with the nurse practitioner. She was a life saver! She instructed me to take claritan one tab daily for seven days after neulasta, mix one packet of Nestle brand protein powder in juice or water and drink every 8 hours, and tylenol per pkg directions. i found that the protein powder taken on a regular basis was most beneficial. I would begin to feel the pain coming on about 7-8 hours after the protien but it would subside again after another dose. It made a huge difference!!! I had my chemo in summer 2012. The pharmacy for out- patients  at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis, Mn  sold the protien powder as an over the counter item (no prescription needed). I would recommend that you call there to determine exactly which product it was. It really helped with the bone pain! Take care and may the Lord bless anyone undergoing chemo.",
