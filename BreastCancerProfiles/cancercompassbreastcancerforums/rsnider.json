I am nearly 3 years out from a stage 3 breast cance diagnosis, located in Europe and taking Tamoxifen for the past 2 years. Based on what I read on European cancer-related web sites, Tamoxifen IS being widely prescribed in Europe. I know many ladies taking it. I guess doctors chose one or other treatment depending on age, risk factors, general health, cancer type and many other reasons we are not aware of. For some people Aridex might be the most appropriate treatments, for others Tamoxifen. I don't think we can make blanket statements about these treatments. DochasHi there, I would agree w/u IF Tomoxifen didnt cause liver & uterine cancers! Arimidex doesn't cause cancer. I have a co-worker who got liver cancer 10 yrs after taking Tomoxifen. That is a much bigger chance than Im ever willing to take. There is also Proton Therapy cancer patuents should research as a healthy alternative too. God Bless u and may u be healthy forever after u finish your Tomoxifen treatment.",

I had 2 biopsies because they found 2 other suspicious spots which ended up not being cancer.  They took all three out and 4 lymph nodes which 1 had a 3mm cancer. I was diagnosed at Stage llA.  They then did oncotype DX testing which came back in the intermediate range at 27. Recurrance rate with just tamoxifen is 16% and with chemo and tamoxifen it is 13% which is not really better. I will have radiation and the tamoxifen but I don't feel the chemo improves my chances of recurrance.  I wish the decision was more clear cut. Also my doctor said if I choose not to have chemo then aromatase inhibitors work better than tamoxifen. Would love others opinion. Thanks I hope to shed a comforting light on your cancer worries. I had Stage 1 aggressive & invasive ductal cancer in left breast. I had a lumpectomy, followed by radiation & at a year anniversary of taking Arimidex, I was still cancer FREE when I got my Bilateral Digital Mammogram last week ??. I am 52 yrs of age, I have some sort of hereditary disposition but not the BARC(?) genes. I have a 22% chance for reoccurrence and I did NOT do chemo b/c protection from these treatment was next to nothing. Ladies, please note: try to insist on getting Arimidex instead of Tomoxifen, even if you're premenopausal! Doctors in Europe favor this medication all the time & have done studies that prove Arimidex has a 27-30% better prevention rate than Tomoxifen! I was thought to be postmenopausal and was given Arimidex ... turns out I am premenopausal & I was still cancer free more than a year after surgery b/c I took Arimidex! And I had hereditary gene AND 22% chance for reoccurrence! As usual, the US is behind Europe in their medication standards/updates. God was looking out for me giving me Arimidex and I am so grateful. Plus, Arimidex does not cause liver or uterine cancer! I work w/a younger woman who took Tomoxifen 5 yr, another medication for 5 yrs and in the 15th yr after her surgery she had a cancer reoccurrence, and yes it was in her liver & quickly spread to her bones. Do your research online about Tomoxifen & stay away from it - no matter what u r told.",
