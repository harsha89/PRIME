      "Content": "Dear Ann: I finished chemo and radiation 12 months ago. I also took all the things that you described. I added accupunture also. I suggest finding a nutritionist that specializes in patients doing chemo. I researched my options carefully, got opinions from 4 oncologists, and decided to do both because the people I knew who did only alternative (or delayed traditional treatment too long) are no longer with us. Chemo will affect your body for sure, but being alive is great. There are no \"for sure\" answers, but fight it with everything you've got. Robyn",

      "Content": "Yes, I am avoiding soy because of the controversary around it. I had BC in 2002 (estrogen and progestrone sensitive). I had been an avid soy consumer. I ate tofu after 3 days a week, drank soy milk, etc. When I got diagnosed, I increased the soy even more. My doctor at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX said that my tumor was growing VERY fast. I always wondered if it had been the result of the soy. About the same time, I saw new research that soy might increase tumor growth. My nutritionist (PhD in nutrition) deals with cancer patients. He said that the fermented soy products should be OK, and that the Japanese population eats more fermented food (e.g. tempeh and miso) than soy milk, tofu, etc. It is confusing and scary. So, to be on the safer side, I am doing LOTS of vegetables instead of the soy to help my body. BTW, the Japanese diet includes LOTS of veges, also. I've got to increase the exercise, too!",

      "Content": "I am taking chemo for breast cancer (FEC protocol). I had a lumpectomy in April to remove a small cancer (Stage 1) with no node involvement. After my fourth (out of six treatments), my breast cancer tumor makers were elevated. My doctor said this happens at times during chemo but they are not sure why. They usually go down, however. Does anyone have experience with this happening? Thanks! Bobyn",

      "Content": "Dear Julie and Susan, I had a lumpectomy and sentinel-node biopsy done in April 2002, followed by chemo and rad. There was no node involvement. I began with a stiff shoulder about a year after surgery, along with tendinitis in both wrists. Now the soreness, weakness, and stiffness has involved the whole arm to the point that I can hardly pick-up a glass of water. I am taking Aromasin because of the blood clot risk with Tamoxifen. Joint pain is a side effect of this medicine, so perhaps that explains the problem. I do not have lymphadema, fortunately. My oncologist said that the chemo had aged me 10 years, and the stiffness was just part of aging. I'm not convinced. So many of us have been told that the doctors just simply DON'T KNOW a great deal about the side effects. They are learning through us. Julie, do you remember the web site where you found the exercises? Thanks! Robyn P.",

      "Content": "My doctor started me on Femara and then Arimidix. I walked like someone with terrible arthritis. The pain was awful. So, he switched me to Aromasin. No more pain! I did gain weight, but I don't exercise or drink water enough. I did get lots of cysts, but can't find any correlation between the cysts and the Aromasin. (I plan to do a message about cysts and possible cause from Aromasin.) My advice is just keep trying the meds until you find the one that works best for you! Peace, Robyn",
