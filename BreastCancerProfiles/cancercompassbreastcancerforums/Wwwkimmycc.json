    "Content": "In January I found a lump in my right breast. I went to my OB who sent me for a diagnostic mamo & ultrasound. The mamo was done before the ultrsound. During the ultrasound, they spent more time on an area in my left breast. A 4cm oval mass at six o'clock. The right lump was clearly fluid filled round cyst. The radiologist suggested a six month follow up. I spoke with my ob gyn and he agreed. I went to a second opinion and found out her radiologist was the same one who did the mammo & ultrasound. I went for my six month check up at the beginning of this month (July), no ultrsound was done this time although it was recommended. The radiologist never came in to speak with me after the films were done. Only the tech who said \"OK, everything looks great\". I then get a phone call from my second opinions nurse who wants me to go back again in another six months for a mammo on only the left breast. I am wondering why I should wait another six months which would put me at a year from first suspicion. Why not check it completely with biopsy now and use the existing mammos as my baseline? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
