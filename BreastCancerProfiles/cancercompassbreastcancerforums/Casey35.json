      "Content": "Hi, I was wondering for those of you with bone mets...what supplements are you taking to build your bone strength? I have heard different things about calcium and you don't want to take too much calcium? I know calcium is just one of the MANY minerals that actually build bone stength. I get so confused sometimes with all of this information of what to take and not to take! Any suggestions?",
