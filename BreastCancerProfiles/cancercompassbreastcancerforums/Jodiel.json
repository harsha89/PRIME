    "Content": "Hi all I started my second go around w chemo in Feb. Started on Taxol for mets to my liver and bones. Diagnosed stage IV in November 2013. Was started then on carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks for 6 rounds. Diffuse rumors in liver stabilized. (Did this chemo bc of neuroendocrine features). Went on tamoxifen and was stable until the new year. Progression to several bones. Radiation to sacrum and lower spine. Then chemo again bc liver functions were elevating and spots showed growth. Taxol knocked me down. I was bedridden for 2 weeks w pain and mouth sores and it was awful. We have a 20 month old toddler, so this was hard! My third treatment of taxol was delayed because of white counts. Finally had it and promptly had a dangerous allergic reaction. Had one again at my fourth treatment, so switched to abraxane. Much easier to tolerate, but had a fever after one treatment but believe that was from zomeda I had for bone mets. Had two treatments and now can't get my white count to bounce back. I've delayed treatment two weeks now and am beyond frustrated. They can't do the neulasta shot bc I'm on weekly. But I read more about neupogen and wrote my dr to see if this is a choice. Anyone have experience with those here? I haven't had a scan yet, but my. LFTs are going down and I feel better and don't feel the inflamed liver now. Any and all advice is welcome! Gotta beat this for my baby boy! Thanks! Jodie",
