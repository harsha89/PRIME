    "Content": "Margie, I am a breast cancer survivior and as you, I´m going through anti-hormone treatment. The joint pain is caused by the lack of hormones. Hormones help the body to built collagen, which is the basis of the joints. You can´t built collagen without strogens. So, that´s what old women suffer, arthritis. I am becoming 40, but in the mornings I feel like having 65. What I do to fight stiffness and joint pain is I take a warm bath every day, and that helps me until the house work and some exersice does the rest. That´s what we have to go through to stay alive, but now something else we can do for ourselves during these 5 years of antihormones. I took Femara, and it was so painful, moved then to Arimidex and now I am with tamoxifen. I feel just right but still, some stiffness and joint pain. But my ovaries were taken away too, so at the end of these five years, there´s no way I could absorb any calcium for my bones because again of the lack of hormones, so, what I have been doing is taking calcium because the mollecular form of the antihormone medicine, is so similar to strogen mellecula that you do absorb calcium in your bones. I have five years to deposit as much calcium in my bones as I can, after that, my bones strengh will start to decrease with the subsecuence of bone breaking. Let´s face it, we are different from what we were before cancer, but could still make a difference in the lives of thouse around us, because we are alive!
