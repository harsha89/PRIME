      "Content": "I'm so sorry to hear of your mother.  You are so young to be going through this.  Your mother and your family are lucky to have you there.  I will pray for your strength and your mother's recovery. My friend continues to do extremely well 3 months after his diagnosis of leptomeningial disease (also referred to as MC). He is taking Temodar and finished his whole brain radiation 2 months ago.  He is feeling great and is getting physical therapy for the damage the lepto did to his left leg.  He is able to walk and is back to driving.  I will continue to keep all of you who have posted your pain on this message board in my prayers.   ",

      "Content": "My dear friend was diagnosed with melanoma stage IV in December 2005 (found in the body in the lymph nodes).   He is my best friend's husband, and is like a brother to me.  He is 32 and she is 29.  They have been married for only 5 years.  They are a match made in heaven and love eachother so much.  It breaks my heart to think of her losing him. He began undergoing both Eastern and Western treatment.  He began receiving interleuken therapy (a bio-therapy similar to chemotherapy successful at treating melanoma).  He also began receiving holistic therapy percribed by a naturapath (herbal regimen, very strict diet, and accupuncture).  This combination kept his organs healthy and eliminated side effects from the interleuken while undergoing treatment.  The doctors were amazed at his liver enzyme levels and lack of any nausea or lethargy usually associated with interleuken.  The interleuken and holistic therapy has kept his body completely clear of tumors since his original diagnosis 2 years ago.  However, since interleuken does not cross the blood brain barrier, it cannot keep the brain safe.  So the cancer metzed to the brain last July but was treated successfully with gamma knife procedure.  The brain turmor continues to recur, and this month, two more tumors were found in his brain and he was diagnosed with leptomeningeal disease last week.  They began full brain radiation yesterday and will be doing this everyday for 3 weeks.  He will also undergo intrathecal chemotherapy but the treatment has not yet been discussed with him.  From what I've read, this type of chemo is extremely difficult for the body to handle and often results in systemic failure.  He is planning on beefing up his herbal regimen to strengthen his organs to handle the negative effects of the chemo.  This will hopefully help lessen the nausea and other ill effects that chemo causes. He is also going to try some other altermative methods such as hyperbaric oxygen chamber and hyperthermia.  I would highly recommend researching these two options as well as visiting a nuturapath.  Western medicine is aggressive and research based, but there are many untold benefits and miracles associated with alternative medicine.  Another amazing program is call the \"incurables\" program that involves an intense at home herbal treatment by Dr. Schulze.  My friend is going to try this after his 3 weeks of therapy are complete.  The testimonials inspire hope. Herbal treatments can be just as uncomfortable as western treatments such chemo and may include severe diarrhea.  Reading the entries on this site break my heart.  I am so sorry for what this terrible disease has done to your loved ones.  I will pray for each of you that you receive some sort of peace in all of this.   I'm so worried about my friend and am trying to keep hope alive and trust in God's plan for him.",
