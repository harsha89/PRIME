Like you, against my doctor's advise, I chose not to have chemo or radiation.  I had a lumpectomy for IDC no invasion of lymph nodes and felt it was not necessary to have chemo or radiation due to it being a low grade cancer and clear margins.  I followed a restricted diet with a good nutritionist and did every measure of prevention possible.  I went for my blood markers every 3 months followed by a MRI and every thing came out negative.  Now the shocker comes, I was experiencing Vertigo and having some very bad dizzy spells which the docs kept telling me was just Vertigo. They continued giving me Meclizine which helped but then it would come back.  I knew deep in my heart that something else had to be going down, so I asked my Oncologist to schedule a Pet Scan on my brain which gave me some very astonishing news.  I am now dealing with 2 brain tumors located at the left side of my cerebellum and 1 tumor located in my spinal cord at the T4 level.  Due to the tumor being located at my spinal cord, I have been in chronic pain with my left back and legs for the past month.  I am going blind doing research and have received more than 5 opinions.  My oncologist is highly suggesting TOMO Radiation therapy, from what I have read it delivers a very good measure of eliminating tumors on the spine, without receiving any awful side effects.  The surprising aspect about this whole issue was the case that if I didn't take the initiative to schedule the brain MRI I would have never known about these existing problems.  The oncologist do no tell women how high the rate is of breast cancer spreading to the brain.  My question to my Oncologist was:  If Breast Cancer has a high percentage of spreading to the brain, then why isn't a Brain Scan highly suggested after 1 year following breast surgery.  His answer was the cost which  is no excuse for neglect in this area.  My health is relatively excellent, I exercise and eat a very healthy diet, had all past and present negative reports in the last year,  and then to find out that my breast cancer metastises to my brain and spinal cord  is mind blowing. I am sending this message out so that women can demand brain scans once a year to protect their bodies after breast cancer.         Now what I really really want to know is if you had opted for radiation therapy, would the outcome have been different? What is triple negative cancer? I notice you were keen on brain scans, but didn't seem so insistent about radiation follow-up. Cheers.",
