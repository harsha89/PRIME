      "Content": "Isuppose that I am \"in denial\" (no one wants their thirty year old daughter to have breast cancer!)..but it seems like the medical community is experiencing a \"rush to cancer diagnosis\" that seems rather extreme, or obsessive, especially in Histology. I don't remember anyone checking my daughter for local infection, just rapid rush to biopsy. Of course she is..hysterical! This makes it hard on me to remain analytical, trying help her in the defense of her health and future. But I also don't want to hinder her therapy either. I understand that early detection and treatment of cancer is necessary. Can\u2019t non-oncologic pathologies left untreated can also do a lot of irreversible anatomical damage just as quickly, ..or quicker than cancer? Do infections also co-exist with malignancies? Are cancer patients routinely treated for infections during analysis with cancer treatment(s)?  I worked in histology and cell biology many years ago, and I still attend local histology conferences annually because of my experience 30-40 years ago, and I realize that I am a layman with very limited understanding. But I also know, histology is a \"finicky\" * technology, especially considering the current high level of automation and biopharm-technology in histology (tissue level morphology and pathology), high volume of analysis, and the \u2018antigen and target epitope-specific\u2019  and \"recovery\" technologies. (note: I left this field, I realized all biopsies technically create a post-mortem condition in tissue)  Even though my close colleagues tell me they have a high level of confidence in Specific Antigen Immuno-histology, I personally know the technical level in these histology labs seems generally high, but it seems possible, and I fear that investments, integration of tissue and automation of high volume processing and rapid analysis may be intermittently and seriously compromising, and benificial for patient diagnosis and therapy, simultaneously. I have seen automation intermittently and repeatedly corrupt quality and reliability in several other very high tech industries. Automation failures can be difficult and expensive (correction and analysis time) to detect. There is always pressure to avoid automated processing shutdowns for maintenance and analysis\u2026I can\u2019t image the costs and vulnerabilities this causes for automated histology labs..and the patients (comments?).  Another concerns, until this recent high regard by the medical community for immuno-specific Histology staining (of biopsy tissue), approximately 2008-2010, it seemed difficult (?) to differentiate between Mastitis*^ (Staph.) and carcinoma in the breast, even by histology. I think (?-please comment) this might be because of the highly ductile morphology of symptoms or cell structure.***  It also seems that in the breast, a highly ductile system, perhaps 3 dimensional analysis using frequently single thin or thick tissue sections may be a source of some misdiagnosis(?comment please). Serial sections and 3D image reconstruction and other techniques seem to offer solutions, though currently unavailable and/or very difficult technically. Finally,\u2026and \u2026my primary concernis that even though immune-specific antigen/target epitope histology (special microscopic tissue stain analysis) is used to identify specific cancer types, a very curious set of \u201cepitope site recovery\u201d systems seem to be in use that seem to worry me personally. They seem to be \u201crecovery- similar techniques with different \u201ctrademark\u201d names, but they are used, it seems when this \u201cspecific antigenic, or epitope staining\" fails, especially in \u2018Dense\u2019 tissue. After \u201crecovery\u201d of the \u201chidden\u201d or \u201cblocked\u201d sites (assuming they existed..?), amazingly these specifics sites may now be stained\u2026.or have the \u201crecovery processes\" actually \u201cchanged them\u201d??? The processes include microwave (not always well characterized or certified), Bio-chemical, \u2026etc. **  (??
