      "Content": "My mother had a Right Masectomy a year ago and have tried to find the best Bra and Prosthesis.  Recently we went to a bra fitting at Nordstroms and we bought the Spanks Bra-lleluja and Amoena's Natura Light 2S #390 Prosthesis. Spanks Bra-lleluja seems to be very comfortable and since we bought it at Nordstroms, we had the tailor add an insert for her prosthesis.  It seems to be working well but she would like to get another one that is not so expensive.  (Spanks was 62 dollars, Amoena Insert was 302!) She might get another Spanks bra but it still does move around.  Is there such bra that doesn't really move around? We are also looking at other cheaper alternatives for inserts that are weighted.  It looks like it needs to be weighted (silicon's tend to be heavier) so that she has a better balance between her left and right.   If you have a bra of prosthesis that you would like to share, please let me know! She does recommend the underwire Bralleluja - they also now have racer back!  Amoena 390 was also great but at $302- it's hard to recommend! Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with Stage 2 BC in October of 2008.  She has since then undergone single masectomy and chemo.  She is currently on hormone medication. Aside from the awkward feeling that she has a metal plate against her chest, she has been complaning of pain in her right ribs.   She has since stopped lifting too much with her right hand and since she is using more of her left now the pain has moved to her left ribs. Has anyone experience this problem?  We are wondering if this is a common thing.  She has gone back to the surgeon recently but somehow he wasn't all too interested in providing more help.  Thanks in advance.  ",

She is wondering if maybe because she doesnt' have much muscle in her pectoralis muscle, it is causing this. What do you think???   ",
