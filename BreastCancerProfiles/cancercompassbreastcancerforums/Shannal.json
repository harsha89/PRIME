      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer and we wanted to start her on the cesium chloride regiment before we begin chemo. I wanted to see if you had included it in your alternative practices and what convential therapies you have used to combat your cancer. Any and all information will be appreciated. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Sorry to bombard you with so many questions. I am extremely interested in the methods that you have used and am extremely greatful for your cooperation. I was wondering how far your cancer had spread when you were initially diagnosed. My mother had debulking surgery which removed cancer from her bladder, part of his stomach and a full hysterectomy. The problem is that nodules remain lodged in her stomach, as well as on her bladder and there is a spot on her liver. I was also wondering where you obtained the cesium, how long you took it, and if you got someone to administer it to you or took it yourself. Also I read not to take the potassium and cesium within an hour of each other so I was wondering which should be taken first. Me and my dad are having trouble finding a good nutrionalist who would know something about the cesium to help us. We have read a lot, but we don't want to cause my mom more harm than good. We are located in South Florida if that helps any. Also, how old are you (haha sorry to be so outward). The only reason I ask if that I have noticed that many of the ovarian cancer survivors I read about are very young. My mother is 49, and usually these survivors are diagnosed in their 20's, which gives me reason to believe that they have more energy to combat the effects of the chemo. they are administered. I would really like to avoid the chemotherapy for her, as I see the awful side effects it has on people. Thank you for your time!",
