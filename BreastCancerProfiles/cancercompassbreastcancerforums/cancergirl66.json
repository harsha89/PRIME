    "Content": "I am not sure it matters or not but I would insist on the brca gene test.  I had no immediate family history (i.e. mom, sister, aunt, or grandma).  I am 34 and tested positive for brca 1 test. only 7% of breast cancer patients carry the gene but if you do your chances of getting a second breast cancer and ovarian cancer increase. I have a sister and a neice who are going to get tested because of this.  if they carrry the gene they have a 50% chance of getting breast cancer by age 50.",
