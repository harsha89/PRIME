I am impressed with your attitude.  I am going to pray about this decision. Thank you so much for your reply.         I, too, am happy to have found this site. I always find comfort and support when I am able to converse and compare with what others are experiencing. I have had a terrible dilemma about continuing the use of Arimidex. I have been taking it for approximately 13 months never realizing nor associating it with the side effects that I had been experiencing...digestive/gastro issues...very poor memory (have always \"prided\"myself on having a very good memory)...highly elevated b/p (have always had good b/p readings (now, 180/90)...elevated blood glucose...and, perhaps most difficult, EXTREME FATIGUE and simply wanting to sleep all the time. I had stage 1 br. ca. diagnosis...\"caught\"early...lumpectomy followed by 37 radiation treatments. Not having related these to the medication, I assumed my terrible declining health was attributable to so many difficult life issues that preceded...2 deaths (my sister and my niece)...the diagnosis, itself, followed by surgery...AND the same diagnosis for my best friend who has Parkinson's Disease for whom I am her care partner...her concussion resulting in a subdural hematoma...her experience with generic manufacturers of her PD medications...2 car accidents...and, quite frankly, my age (85). By process of elimination, i.e., taking myself off the Arimidex for even a few days, the improvement was absolutely evident...started it again...same results. I have now been off the Arimidex for 5 weeks and feeling SO much better. I can only attribute this to my decision to stop the medication. I am an advocate of quality rather than quantity..especially at my age. I will see my surgeon next week when I will discuss all this with him. I was told that I didn't need an oncologist which leads me to believe that I would be a \"good candidate\"to stop this medication. I have also researched the chemical components of Arimidex which definitely factored into my decision. As always, our personal decisions have to be made just that way...personally...and, certainly, what might be good for one could be catastrophic for another. I wish all of you suffering with the side effects of this medication the best choice for you...and best of good health. Virginia",

Went back to see radiation therapist for follow up( it had been two years since treatment). I let her know of my decision t o stop Arimidex six monts ago. She was not that upset, but pointed out mine was a very early cancer. She seemed to accept my decision to not endure the horrible side effects for only a small gain from Arimidex. None of my doctors have ever guaranteed taking the Arimidex would guarantee no cancer returns, only improve odds. Since my last post, I have had a consultation with my surgeon related to Arimidex and its side effects, most concerning were the very high b/p and glucose readings...AND the memory loss and extreme FATIGUE. We discussed my concerns...I asked him if, in my case, i.e., given the level, type, size, location and all that is factored into the final analysis, would it be reasonable for me to discontinue taking Arimidex. I stated that I felt I wanted to opt for quality of life rather than quantity. He DID mention that he could prescribe other drugs, but that they, too, have similar side effects AND their own. I was thankful that he agreed that it was not worth the side effects that I happened to be experiencing given the small percentage of prevention provided by the Arimidex. I had already stopped taking this drug before I saw my surgeon...as a \"process of elimination\"test which revealed that the medication definitely was causing the side effects...felt almost \"normal\"within a few days. Even though I had opted on my own to discontinue the drug, still, I felt that it was important for me to discuss this with my surgeon because I thought that I would always question my \"own option\"as possibly being opposed to my surgeon's advice. He actually told me that he wanted me to stop the medication (at which point, I told him about my \"process of elimination\"test. As I am always very careful to state...each of us is different...our cancers are different...and only one's own doctor must be any individual's guide. I wish all who are experiencing this disease the very best on this journey that we travel...Virginia",

I have been taking Anastrozole (Arimidex) for approximately 13 months. I have NEVER had a high blood pressure reading...usually, 128/78-130/80. While at my gynecologist's office for an office visit, my b/p reading was 180/90...taken a second time to confirm. My gynecologist advised me to see my internist who was shocked to see the same reading of 180/90. Also...at my dental visit, the hygienist took my b/p and was shocked to see a very high reading. I had not associated this elevated b/p reading with taking Arimidex until a few weeks ago. It seems highly likely, though, that these very high b/p readings can be related to the medication. Also, high glucose readings which I have never encountered throughout my life. Hopefully, this will help in your own evaluation of what may be occuring with your b/p and glucose readings...Virginia",

It is very unusual for me NOT to have done that, but, I honestly felt that I had no choice about taking this drug...just something that was a \"must\"after lumpectomy and 37 radiation treatments. I never related my terrible \"unwellness\"to Arimidex. Until taking this drug, I really felt very well physically and mentally. In retrospect, I am able to trace the \"unwellness\"to this drug...elevated b/p and glucose readings...very poor memory which had always been very good...bone/muscle pain that seemed to increase \"overnight\"to the point where I thought that I had fibromyalgia (although I have never been sure exactly what this was...just knew of the awful pain which I was now experiencing. Perhaps most alarming was the EXTREME FATIGUE...literally dragging myself around on a daily basis...sleeping throughout the day. I have just about decided to opt for quality of life rather than quantity. Of course, at my age (85) that is probably a \"no-brainer\". It just seems to me that my doctor should have taken so many factors into consideration when he prescribed Arimidex...age...stage one...early detection...lumpectomy...radiation...no need for an oncologist. .even stating that I no longer had cancer. I just feel that this happens to be his protocol for all his patients. I will see him this coming week and will ask these same questions. Throughout my life, I have always put my doctors on a pedestal...have always followed their instructions, etc. but, I feel that it is time for me to assert myself...to advocate for myself...that perhaps, in my case, I just MAY know best. Of course, that remains to be seen...but, I have just about opted for that quality vs. quantity. It has been a difficult decision for me even though I have some positive factors in my favor. I stopped taking the drug about 5 weeks ago, and I have to say that I am feeling SO much better. Again...I always want to emphasize that we are all different with different aspects of this cancer, and we have to be guided by many factors. My question is: Is there any \"proof\"that this drug absolutely prevents recurrence; or, that by not taking it, we are assured of non-recurrence? Is there anyone who has taken it and still has had a recurrence? What is the percentage of recurrence in those who opt NOT to take it and those who DO opt to take it? From my research...reading so many women's reviews about this drug, it just seems that those who are cancer-free after the prescribed 5-years relate this to having taken the drug..but, isn't it possible that one could be cancer-free...not because of taking the drug but simply because the cancer, itself, was not going to recur? I know this is long...thank you for \"wading through\" it...I just hope for the best...for all of us...Virginia",

      "Content": "Hi, Lori...I will begin with what you said, i.e., \"we are in His hands\"...I pray every day that I have made the right decision about taking Arimidex and it is only because I seemed to have been able to put this in His hands that I was able to make the decision that I made. I know and understand your dilemma because I experienced the same. I don't know your circumstances related to your particular breast cancer...there may be factors that would dictate that you MUST take it. Only your doctor knows this...but, if I were you, I would certainly ask your doctor if it would be \"reasonable\"in your particular case for you NOT to have to take this drug. I did exactly that, Lori. I scheduled an appointment with him to discuss my feelings about opting for quality rather than quantity of life especially in that it seems that there is only a 2% \"POSSIBLE\" chance of recurrence prevention if we take this drug. He absolutely agreed with me and actually told me that he didn't want me to take it! As I already mentioned in a previous post, I only wish I had had this conversation with my doctor before I started taking Arimidex. It's difficult for me to imagine going through what you have gone through...chemo, and now starting radiation. I will only suggest to you that you discuss this with your doctor and ask her if it would be \"reasonable\"for you NOT to take Arimidex. Depending on your particular breast cancer, she should be able to help you with this decision, Lori. Just as you wished God's blessings on my health, so I wish you the same. If there is anything else that you might want to discuss with me, I would be so happy to hear from you again...Virginia",
