    "Content": "I am a 51 year old, 4 year survivor of BC, stage 1; treated with lumpectomy, radiation, 2.5 yrs tamoxifen, currently in second year of Arimidex. I recently had some spotting (not like a regular period) and the gyno did D&C and biopsy which came back okay. He recommended I do 4 months of Lupron, and I have had the second shot. The first month wasn't too bad, but now I'm starting to have some pretty uncomfortable side effects: hot flashes, night sweats, anxiety and depression being the worst. My blood work shows that I am menopausal and have been since beginning the Arimidex nearly 2 years ago. I am considering not going ahead with the next 2 Lupron shots. I feel I have been very fortunate so far...my cancer was caught early and the treatments to date have been very tolerable. I don't want to risk a reoccurrence, but I hate feeling this way.  Has anyone else taken this combination of drugs? How have your side effects been? Any info is greatly appreciated.",
