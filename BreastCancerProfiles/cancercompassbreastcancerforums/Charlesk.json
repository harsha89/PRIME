Although I try not to dwell on the possibility of recurrance I find that sometimes I worry a great deal about the cancer coming back.  I also think at times that I want to stop arimidex due to the side affects which I live with daily. Does anyone have input to , or share my concerns??  Please respond. I just stumbled upon this website this morning and am hoping it is a good place to be.  Friends who have not shared my experience cannot relate to my feelings on these matters. Believe it or not, the side effects get better after two years or so.  They don't go away, but they do get better.",
