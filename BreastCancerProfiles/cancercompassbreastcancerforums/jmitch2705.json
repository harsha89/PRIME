YES a huge difference between $60.00 and $10.00 I was totally phsyched! Saving an extra $50.00 every month is definitely a plus!",

      "Content": "There is always HOPE regardless of your stage, or situation. I am a breast cancer survibor with a bone metastis. I was stage 4 at diagnosis, and cancer was difused through out my right shoulder, and found 3 places in my spine. I am currently cancer free and have a zero circulating tumor count, which your oncologist can explain to you what markers and counts are, but needless to say, I was hopeless at diagnosis, then Cancer Treatment Centers patched me up. 12 months of chemo, and currently undergoing hormone maintenance and bone strengthening!! If you have Hope you have FIGHT! God Bless,   Jenny  ",
