It's unknown if chemo would have stopped it. The cancer cells are tiny and spread insidiously but that spread awful fast. I'm really sorry for everything you've gone through.Thank you for the reply I also think that they missed it as I sure it could not have speed that fast in both her liver and spine and ribs that fast. The doctor made me feel very bad on Thursday when we found out about the liver as he said well we did want to do chemo, which yes I agree they did say this but they said that it would be to much for my mum. And due to her tablets that she was on they was not going to do it. If they had said she had to have the chemo I sure her metal Heath doctor would have sorted a new tablet she could have taken for her mental Heath but the way the doctor made it sound hurt me really badly as it seemed he was putting it on me for not having the chemo. They said in Wednesday he should not have said that, but it still hurts me badly. In the spine they have said its in T12 to T7 I think and the ribs, but they are more worried about getting the liver working. I just cannot understand any of this and how it could have been missed it's breaking my heart I don't think I could cope losing my mum we are so close. And due to her age which is 76 she said last time if it came back she would not go for treatment. I am not even sure she could take it. But we have to wait for the rest of the tests to see if they can do anything and if the liver can start working with what tablets they are giving her. Regards Lorraine",

      "Content": "i have been doing a lot of reading the last weeks and looking at other things she can also take that can help her. i am looking at other doctors also, but i need to see what the cancer is and she going in hospital tomorrow so they can take a little of her liver to do test on it, also to give her higher does drugs to try and get her liver working. Its breaking my heart my mum is a person that likes to do everything herself. and seeing her just so tried and only wanting to sleep is just not my mum. i know a lot of that is due to how bad her liver is so if they can get that working i think that will be a big help. i trying to keep her going taking her out and doing everything with her. like she wanted for weeks to go get her hair done and just could not be asked and when i tryied to say to her come lets sort it she just said no i really dont feel like it. well Friday i would not take the no and took her and it really picked her up. she also loves walking so i been making her walk a little each day over the last week and thats making her feel a little better. i cant let her just lay there and give up.

      "Content": "Hello all My mum had breast cancer in 2011 in both breast the lump in her left breast was small and we did not know it was there due to it being really close to the bone, but she did find one in the right breast and that's why we went right to the doctors. They sent her for test really fast which was good. That's when they also found the lump is the left breast. They removed the lumps in both breast and also removed the nodes from her right arm. The doctors wanted her to have chemo but due to tablets my mum was on for metal Heath they said that it would be to much for her as she would have to come off her tablets as she could not have chemo being on them. The doubled her radio and give it to her for much longer. The cancer was also the fast growing and speeding on and when they removed the lumps they could not get a clear merge from the breast bone that they wanted as both lumps was very close to the Hearst bone. We have been seeing the doctors 2 times a year plus she had her breast X-ray each year which has shown all clear. We got the all clear just over 2 months ago. About 6 weeks ago my mum started to feel unwell it started with her bowls not being able to go to the toilet with pain in her tummy. We went to the doctors and they wanted her to have a scan on her gallbladder. Which got messed up as the date did not come in the post. I was getting more worried due to the pain as we had given her something to clear her bowel and the pain was still there. Her wee was also orange in colour which her GP had sent of for tests. We had to see the doctor again on the Monday but due to me being worried I took her to the walk in centre at the hospital they said all seemed ok but we need not to get the results for the wee test, which I told the doctor we was due to see her GP on the Monday she said that was fine. I also noticed my mum looked yellow which I said to the doctor, and that she had lost a lot of weight the past 6 weeks. Any way we went home and 2 days later went back to the gps, told them we still did not have the date for the scan and also her mental Heath worker wanted her to have an ECG which I was taking her to the hospital that afternoon to get that done. Told her again about the colour of my mums wee, about the weight loss again, about the pain in her tummy, and that she looked yellow, she asked my mum to get on the bed to look at her tummy and then sent her out to do a next wee test, when my mum was out the room she said my mums liver was larger then it should be. Mum come back in and again the doctor saw the colour of her wee. She asked us to get some blood tests while at the hospital having the ECG which I said that fine, we went and had the tests done, and the next day I got a call from the doctors that the liver test was not good and we had to see the doctor the next day. Went there the next day to be sent to the hospital, they don't more test but by the time all them tests come back it was to late to have the CT scan done what they wanted to do so was told to come back next morning when it would be done. Went the next day had the CT done and had to wait for the results, later that day was told that the liver had cancer badly. And the bones did not look right and they needed bone scan, that was booked for the Monday. Was also told there would be a meeting of all the doctors on the Monday afternoon. So would see the doctors for all the results on the Wednesday. Got the results which show it's very very bad in the liver, they can't even count the grows, it's in the spine, and the ribs. We asked how they have missed this they say it could have got this bad in weeks, which I find hard to believe. We are asking things they don't seem to tell us anything. Mum is due to go into hospital on Monday to try to get the liver working somewhat and also to take a simple from the liver to see what type of cancer it is. I was also shocked as we had never been told the high group my mum was in to get the cancer back, and that within the 1st 3 years there in more of a chance of it coming back this has only been said to us when we got the results. There is a high risk in out family both sides my mum my mums sister both had breast cancer, and my mums dad died of lung cancer. On my dad's side my dad's sister died of breast cancer, and my dad's dad died of liver cancer. The doctors know the full history of the family as cancer also goes back more then this on both sides. But can someone please tell me could the cancer have come back and gone this far so fest after getting an all clear around 2 months before she became ill? So sorry for the long post but the family are in bits and we just don't get the answers to what we are asking. Regards Lorraine",
