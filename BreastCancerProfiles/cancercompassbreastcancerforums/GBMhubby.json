    "Content": "The Avastin trial data (its online, I have seen it) submitted to the FDA did not show a survival benefit for Avastin, in fact, it shortened survival slightly, presumably due to the adverse effects of bevacizumab. If interested, I can post the links to the trial data. Avastin did extend the progression free time slightly, so the real debate is the question of whether the high chance of reduced survival time is offset by the chance of being progression free for a couple of extra months.  That is the real debate: should the FDA approve a treatment that shortens the life span of the majority of cancer patients that use it. What are your thoughs on that issue?  Of course, if there were a way to pre-identify who would benefit, than there would be no question about the merit of Avastin.  No matter which way the FDA decision goes, Avastin will still be available, off label, and that is an insurance issue.",
