I am working to learn more about how people live through cancer.  I am in search of volunteers for a study about communication while experiencing breast cancer. If you are receiving treatment for breast cancer, or if you have completed treatment recently (within the past year or so), please consider participating. The study is an online questionnaire. You will be asked about your experience with cancer, your health, and your communication patterns with your spouse or partner. Feel free to contact me by private reply to learn more.  Thank you!     Erin, I am interested however a survivor after a August 2004 diagnosis of Breast Cancer (ER/PR positive, HER 2 neg, Stage 1, 1.9cm). I often see that there area many studies with a recent diagnosis and not looking at the great number of survivors who are thriving. When I was diagnosed I would look for long term survivors and not so much the recent ones. I was searching for the obvious reasons and didn't want to feel or believe my life would be shortened by cancer. Goodluck, survivors (longterm) are everywhere. Elizabeth",
