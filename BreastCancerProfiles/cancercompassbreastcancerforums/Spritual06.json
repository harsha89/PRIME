      "Content": "Hi, I am currently taking chemotherapy for breast cancer and am very interested in alternative methods ( I plan on focusing on alternative methods only after this latest round of chemo is completed in three weeks) . I would appreciate it very much if you would e-mail me a copy of your regimine. I have began to a fruit and vegetable diet and while on chemo daily take ground flax seeds and fiber along w/ organic mushroom builders and teas. I also have liquid B-complex and calcium supplements. Thank you for your positive response.  Isaiah chapter 33 verse 24 Dee   ",
