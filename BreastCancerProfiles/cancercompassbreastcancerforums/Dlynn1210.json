Had the lumpectomy and setinal lobe disection last week and now have to wait until next week and meet with the oncologist to find out what the next step is going to be. My husband has been very supportive through all this but i feel guilty putting him through this. We have been married just over a year and now all this. I don't know that I want to go any farther with treament. I have been cut open 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I am feeling very sick when i look at my scares, I know they are new and they will fade but right now I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to scream.  Intamacy has become a thing if the oast since all this has started and I think that is the hardest part of all this, I need to feel close to my husband, i need hito touch me and love me the way he used to before I got sick. How so I relay this to him without pushing him. It is going to happen sooner then later that I will not physically be able to love him and feel close to him but now while I can he is scared. Does anyone have any advice for me or encouraging words of wisdom. I need something to hold on to right now.  Thanks for listening. Hi again - I just replied to you on another message, but I will add a couple of things here.  First, I'm sure you husband is not scared of you but scared for you.  If you've told him to let you go, that you don't want to go any farther with treatment, I'm sure he is scared to death he is going to lose you.  Have you told him how you feel?  If your doctor has given you an all clear for intimacy - then tell your husband what you need.  This is the love of your life - your best friend - talk to him (and I know at your age that can sometimes be easier said than done).  You have no reason to feel guilty - this is not anything that you did wrong.  Discovering you have cancer did not make your husband stop loving you or make him love you any less.  I would venture to say that it probably has more to do with being afraid he will hurt you.  You may go through a period that intimacy will be out of the question but it will only be for a short time - it is not permanent.  Open communication is very important right now - trust your husband - tell him exactly what you have told us.  My money is on him coming through for you.  Diana",

I have gone back to work for now as my surgeon called last Friday and was very exited about my insurance paying at least part of that Oncotype DX test I was telling you all about earlier.  Results should be back in about 2 weeks the tumor was sent off this week to the lab.  I have an apt with the cbc docs on 8/1 and with the radiation team on the 5th, so still not knowing what my tx regiman is going to be still alittle on edge. Finding myself falling slightly into a depressed state I am trying to stop it before it gets worse, upped the dosage on my antidepressant for the time being.  Hubby still holding strong and my mom and my sister where out for a visit this week. My mom was glad to see I looked so good not that she is bias or anything but I think actually seeing me has put her mind at ease alittle.  She left me with encouraging words and told me if I need her to come out again once tx starts she will be there in a flash. I have a good support team I think.  As I said I have gone back to work for now but only working 6-7 hours a day and very tired when I get home, my breast is swelling again, called the surgeon she said it is to be expected and not to worry but if it is not better next to call and she will see me just to be sure.  My incisions are healing (slowly) but they do look better.Bruising is still present but healing time is very slow she tells me.  My rigth breast is still lack and blue from the biopsy done like 4 weeks ago, bruising from iv's still very pronounced as well.  I guess I will close for now. Love to all and God Bless Kristine Hi Kristine You sound much better which is wonderful to hear.  Sweetie, you have been through a lot and you will have days of feeling depressed but you have so much to fight for.  You have a wonderful husband, your children, and a dynamite mom (many don't have any support).  As for your mom, if you need her, please don't hesitate to call her.  As a mom of five grown children, I know I want to be there for them when they are hurting.  Imagine you are now preparing for a 10K run - you can't look behind you because you will falter and you can't look to the side because you will lose your focus, you look straight ahead keeping your eyes on the finish line.  As any runner will atest to, the \"run\" itself is only a short period out of the rest of your life.  Once you cross that finish line, like all runners, you will need to rest but after a recuperation period, you will have the rest of a very long life to enjoy your new husband and your children - and one day your grandchildren (I know - I know that is a way in the future but trust me, grandchildren are something special to look forward to - all the fun with none of the work).  You will make it through this and I believe w/ an even deeper appreciation of your wonderful husband, your entire family, and even your friends.  Take care of yourself and keep us posted as to how you are doing.  I speak for all of your pen pals on here that we all care about you as well.    Diana          ",

      "Content": "Hi Dovie My journey with cancer has been short compared to yours and I had a different type of cancer (oralpharyngeal) so I'm not in a position to give you any advice on treatment; however, I did receive my treatment at Cancer Treatment Center in Zion and highly recommend them (I know they have a total of 5 hospitals).  If nothing else, I would suggest going there for a second opinion.    The gentleman who started CTCA did so after losing his own mother to cancer and felt that there was a lack of communication and care involving his mother.  He believes that the patient's care & comfort as well as the caregivers comfort are the most important things.  They have a motto that God didn't give us an expiration date so they will not either.  Everyone - the doctors, the nurses, the technicians - and others were amazing.  Many (doctors included) are cancer survivors so they've been there - done that.  I had a nurse laughingly tell me how she taunted her sister about having a prettier shaped head than her - after she (the nurse) had lost all of her hair from having chemo for breast cancer.  They really do know what you are going through and were a God send during one of the most difficult times of my life.     What was especially important to me was that CTCA believes in an integrative cancer treatment approach.  They combine conventional methods, such as surgery, radiation, chemo, and immunotherapy with complementary therapies such as nutrition, naturopathic med, mind-body med, physical therapy, pain management, and spiritual support - you can participate in one, two, all, or none of the complementary treatments (I even tried acupuncture for nausea).  They even had sessions on comedy as laughter does help.      I know they pay for flights in for the patient - I'm not sure about a caregiver but they may.  I knew several people that flew in for treatment (and still are flying in) but we drove and they paid us mileage.  They even have stretch limos that pick you  up at the airport.  They are not flaunting anything - but who better deserves to be pampered if not someone battling cancer?  They have contracts w/ all the local hotels and you are given a very reasonable rate (they pay a portion and you pay a portion).  Shuttles transport you back and forth to CTCA - no charge.  One really nice thing they do is handle everything for you - flight arrangements, limo pick up, hotel reservations, and filing all insurance.  At a time we have so much on our mind, it is wonderful to leave all the details to them and let us concentrate on getting through treatment.  I received excellent care from CTCA and know that they had my best interests at heart.  You know how they say little things mean a lot - well for me it was the receptionist in the radiation department remembering me by name and asking how I was each and every day.  I also feel as if they are on top of all research going on.  My medical oncologist at CTCA stopped giving me heparin a couple of months into treatment because research now shows it doesn't help.  About 4 months after they stopped my heparin intake I was hospitalized at a local hospital (where I was originally diagnosed).  They gave me daily heparin shots in the stomach even though I tried to object.  For me it was saying CTCA was ahead of our local hospital as to the latest research data.  If you have any questions about CTCA please ask, I will be happy to answer them.  I wish you the best in your days ahead and will add you into my prayers.

There is so much to think about and the pressure of making the right decision is really tough. But, I have faith that something will turn up. Thanks again for sharing your experience with CTCA! Hi Dovie I read where you are seeing another doctor next Tues also.  That is good because when making such an important decision I don't think it ever hurts to get 2nd and 3rd opinions.  It is so important that you are comfortable with your doctors and your treatment when dealing with cancer.  I go to CTCA in Zion on Thur and Fri for my check up and hoping for a clear scan and good results on my blood work.  My prayers are with you and just imagine a hug coming to you Thur from CTCA in Zion.  Even if you decide on one of the trials at the other cancer center, I think you will like CTCA.  For me, they were like family that were with me throughout.  Please let me know what you decide to do - I know how difficult it can be in trying to make the right decision for treatment.    Diana",

Cheers, Passionfish :)I agree that you have no reason to feel guilty. You believed you made the best decision years ago and it would only prove otherwise if a problem arises. Cancer Compass was created to answer questions from our own experiences AND to support those with questions so what better place to post! The American Cancer Society is an excellent place to call. You might also call local hospitals to see if any free screenings are being offered in your area OR at least affordable Mamograms. I wish you well and remember everyone on CC in my daily prayers.

I'd love to say it's nice being here, but...... 53 years old, married, two children, one still at home.  I'm a RN and found a lump in my left upper chest wall at work one day in late February.  Asked one of the docs to check it out and he sent me to a surgeon who specializes in breast cancer.  Biopsied the spot, and low and behold it was invasive ductal breast cancer.  Then began my journey to the land of oncologists, radiologists, plastic docs, etc.  We elected to do bilateral mastectomies and the first surgery date was March 18th.  All ready to go to surgery when a critical lab was reported:  blood glucose was 517 :( Surgery was rescheduled for March 28th..spent one night in Observation, discovered a hematoma and had to have surgery again the 31st.  So far I still have the tissue expanders (I call them my hockey pucks) in place.  Implant surgery is scheduled July 30th.  Had the Oncotype DX testing and scored a 43...sigh. I got my Bard PowerPort yesterday.  I see the oncologist next week to discuss type of chemo, schedules, etc.  I also see a gyno doc for the lovely and exciting transvaginal ultrasound as I'm having a complete hysterectomy (prophalactic) and my doc doesn't want to go in blindly.  Honestly, I think the thought of losing my hair is my biggest worry.  I've decided to shave it and get a spray on tan..hehe And I'm seriously considering foregoing the nipple tattooing and get a hummingbird on one breast and a flower on the other.  I've never had tattoos and love the thought of being a secret rebel ;) I've had great family/friend support, but it's great to have a place like this with people that KNOW what I'm going thru.  Thanks, y'all :-) Welcome to the club!  Talk about a vacation from you know where.  This is one vacation spot I don't ever want to return to.  You've got a wonderful outlook which really helps get you through it all.  Some have said on this site that they felt alone when tx ended - like being released to fend for themselves but NOT me.  I loved all the doctors, nurses, techs, etc. (and I received excellent care) but I sure was elated the day I began to see them every 3 mo rather than every day - 2x a day for many of them.  Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.

I've been trying to sleep for quite a while - just too much stuff spinning around in my head - keeping me awake.  Not cancer compass stuff - just other stuff.  All of a sudden, it pops into my head:  be a clown. I have a friend  - I'll call him Ed - who volunteers as a clown. He used to work the rodeos, as a professional clown to protect the bull riders, until he was injured and could no longer do it. Took the joy out of his life.  Then his mom passed away - that really took the joy out of his life.  Knowing that Ed was having a hard time, a friend of his that often volunteered with a group of clown for kids in the hospital asked Ed to fill in for him for just one day while the friend was out of town.  There actually were other people who could have done this, but the friend knew Ed needed the joy and laughter of children to replace the grief in his heart.   Ed wasn't real enthusiatic about filling in, but he owed the guy a favor and agreed to do it. Turns out Ed's friend was a pretty smart man.  Ed went to the hospital, worked with the kids, made them laugh, and lo and behold, they made HIM laugh. Showed him that there was still room in his heart for love and joy and victory, instead of grief and sadness and defeat. When Ed next saw his friend, he asked to join their volunteer clown group. He's been with them for a number of years now - he says he never gets tired of doing it.  And he doesn't just visit the kids - he goes to see church members that are in the hospital, shut ins in their homes - all kinds of people, and he does it for free. He sure gave me a big boost the day I was walking down the hall of the hospital just hours after I'd had my gallbladder removed,  trying to get myself mobile so I could go home.  This big clown came lumbering up the hall, grabbed me gently, shook my hand with his clown buzzer, and made me laugh!  Made my belly hurt a little bit, but sure took my mind off the discomfort of walking!  I didn't even know who he was until he took his mask off.  Said he was on his way to see the kids, so I was thankful to have also gotten the benefit of his visit. If you feel up to it, maybe you could check out if there is a volunteer clown group in your neighborhood. I'm sure they'd be glad to have some help, as you feel able and comfortable. You don't have to be able to do anything special tricks, or wear a really fancy clown get up.  A painted smile and a funny nose, a floppy hat, and some baggy drawers - that gets good laughs, and sick kids sure do love getting a balloon, or a box of crayons and a coloring book.  And they sure get happy when the clown sits down and colors a picture with them, or reads a story to them. ( A lot of the adults seem to like the clowns, too.)  And you know how kids are - they can be quick to give back the love and kindness they receive.  Just like Ed:  therapy for them, therapy for you. Wishing you the best, Tre Tre: thankyou so much for your responce and very good advice.  I totally love the clown idea!  I dont know if there is such a thing here in my area but I will look into it.  The idea of dressing up and looking goofy and having the kids chuckle and have fun is such a great idea.  I will talk to officials here around town and see if they have people who do this already.  I know I need to get out and find my own things that will help take my mind off of my problems..I know that is my problem..I use to work retail years ago and havent worked for several years...I should go back to work..but then I wouldnt be ready available to take care of the little guy when I was needed..I guess I make myself to available to be hurt in a way.  I never thought I could be a person who could love to take care of little kids either..my grandson has changed that state of mind for me.  Not all kids are like him though..he is so easy to take care of..it makes it a joy and not a burden or a hair raising experience.  He is busy as all 3 year olds are, but he minds well, and I just have so much fun taking care of him.  He will probably be my only grandchild..my son and his wife arent having anymore..so this makes this little guy even more special..and unfortunately it makes them very protective of him to the point they are affraid to let him venture to far away from them.  I can totally understand their feelings, but they need to realize that I may not be here to watch this little guy grow up and get to a point he will remember the little things that I do for him now..I cant recall very much when I was 3..  I am not at deaths door by no means, but I know that stage lV brings a very grim outcome usually.  I am realistic about that..I do have a good attitude and most of the time I dont think about my illness or let it control me or paralize me.. I get out and do what ever I can to keep myself busy..but I just need to do more.  My grandson will be starting preschool soon which will make my time with him become even more few and far between.  I have offered to help with baking and craft making and such for classroom parties but this offer has fell on death ears.. no input from me is wanted or seemingly needed so all I can do is just back off and allow her to decide when she wants or needs the help.  Like you said, I need to find another avenue for my help.  I decorate cakes, and have always loved crafting, painting, sewing etc.  I loved it when my kids were in school and at the age I could do these things..they grow up way to fast!!  Well enough...but thankyou again for the helpful ideas..I love the clown one and will see about how I can use this idea around here...heck, I could sew and make the costume...that would be fun!!!  Sorry for the pitty party whiney stuff..I will be fine...just pull myself up by the bootstraps and get on with it..  I am a strong person usually, I just get down about this one aspect of my life and how things turn out so often with it.. I wanted to take my grandson this weekend out for lunch..I was so excited about it and I even asked my daughter in law to join us so she wouldnt be left out..but it fell on death ears..so that is why I am feeling so down about it right now..I just dont want to even ask anymore..rejection is hurtful..but I will be fine...just had to vent here..and thank you all so much for responding..it helps alot!! God's blessings...and hope your days are filled with good things! Jodie Hi Jodie My sister-in-law and brother-in-law have the same problem.  Their daughter-in-law only allows the children to come over on rare occasions - usually when she needs someone to babysit.  Unfortunately, few states have laws allowing a grandparent visitation rights and even then, it is only a rare visit for a short period.    Tre, as usual, has given you some excellent advice.  If there are no clown groups in the area, you could be the one to start one.  God layed it on Tre's heart to come up with the idea even after she responded to your post so maybe a clown group would benefit a great many children and even adults in your area.  Jodie, remember that while your grandson means the world to you and not seeing him is difficult - you also mean the world to your grandson and he NEEDS to see you - even if for one day a week or even once a month.  If he never had the opportunity to see or know you it would be tragic for him.  Should the clown group not work out, please look into being a grandparent to a child who is not fortunate enough to have one.  It might ease your pain as well as fill a hole in the child's heart.  We helped a family rebuild their home after Hurricane Charlie destroyed it and I became very close to the children (even though I have 5 children and 12 grandchildren of my own expecting #13).  Their dad eventually asked if I minded if the children looked to me as Grandma as only one had ever seen his grandparents (when he was 1 yr old - now 10) and the other two had never met their grandparents as the grandparents live in a different country.  Who knows, once your son and daughter-in-law see that you are able to take care of others, they might be more open to your having your grandson more.  I wish you the very best - please let us know how the clown group or surrogate grandparenting goes.    Diana       ",

Jockey Hi Jodie Have you heard anything back yet on the volunteering at the hospital.  I think you have a wonderful plan of volunteering first and then working your way into the clown group (which for you I am so excited about).  You know how I told you yesterday that I could God's hand all over Tre's suggestion of the clown group?  If she suggested to me - I would have said \"No way\" but she feels compelled to tell you and you say \"Right on\"!  Well consider God's hand still in it.  My thinking was a little along what Jockey's is - that possibly your daughter-in-law and maybe your son are concerned about your son getting too close to you OR maybe just wearing you out (as 3 yr olds can do).  While I was cleaning today I picked up a couple of books that I had with me 2 weeks ago when I was up at the Cancer Treatment Center of America.  I read a paper while there but for some \"unknown\" reason I tore one page out of it and stuck it in my book.  I pulled it out today and thought 'this would be good for Jodie'.  It is a Dear Abby column addressing this exact issue.  I tried to think how I could get it to you - go to the library and scan it and then email it to you, mail what I have to you, ????  Then I thought why not go to the website www.dearabby.com and see what I find.  Imagine my surprise when it was easy to locate as I have the date and headline of the column - July 31 - 'Encourage contact with boy's ailing granddad'.  In fact, there were a two more very good letters in the same column that didn't show up in the paper I have (2 were published in my paper).  Here is the link http://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/index.html?uc_full_date=200 I'm sure your son is a nice young man as he is your son and I'm sure he loves you.  Just a suggestion because you know your son whereas all of us do not but have you tried talking to him and asking him why they don't bring your little guy over for you to see more often or let you take him for outings?  They may be concerned he is too much for you to handle with your illness (which your volunteering should alieve those fears).  They may be concerned about him getting too close to you and feel they are protecting him from a loss later in life which would be sad for both you and him.  Maybe the letters in Dear Abby would help your son and daughter-in-law to see a different viewpoint - one of the letters is actually from the grandchildren who later in life found out that their parents had \"shielded\" them from getting hurt and how they felt about it.  As I said, I thought they were very good letters/responses.  I know one respondent suggested a journal which is a tremendous idea - In fact, I think I will start one myself.  I would cherish a journal written by my grandmother.  She also suggested finding an article she named and giving it to your son and daughter-in-law.  Only you know them - would they consider this interfering in their parenting.  I have given artlcles/books to my daughters but I did something similar with my son years ago and it was not well received.  I was thinking about your question as to what do clowns do?  As I was mulling it over last night I remembered my dad's days of being a Shriner - they had clowns.  So I googled Shiners clowns and came up with a ton of articles.  Maybe if you have a local Shriners Association you could explain to them what you want to do and they might be help you.  Just a thought!!  Please let us know what you hear back on the volunteer work.  What an inspiration that would be to so many of us on this forum.  You already have me looking ahead to what I can get involved in.  I can just envision how much happiness you could bring into so many lives by being a clown.  Take care sweetie and remember God loves you and is watching over you - of that I have no doubt!

My mother went through similar of what you are and in Oct (2013) she went into the emergency room because she had a lump in her breast that she thought was a boil. When the first doctor looked at it they suspected it could have been breast cancer and wanted her to get more tests. My mother went back the next day for another doctors opinion and he ended up lancing it because he said it was a boil. About 8 months later it grew back and my mother once again got it checked and they got a biopsy and confirmed it was cancer. They started her on Chemo (my mother weighs 98 lbs.) and gave her over 15 different meds. The chemo weakened her immune system and her heart and she ended up having to get a blood transfusion to improve her T-Cells. They released my mom from the hospital about 4 days later. Because of the extensive chemo and all of the meds my mother was back in the hospital about 5 days after her blood transfusion suffering with 4 heart attacks within 2 days as well as a seizure which landed her in ICU for a week and in the hospital for 2 weeks after. She recently had surgery for a permanant pacemaker and by the grace of Lord she survived it all and is now taking chemo pills which are shrinking the cancer and is planning on getting the mastectomy in June. My mother almost passed away because of poor negligence caused by an incompetent doctor who never even took a biopsy to test the lump for cancer. I thought most doctors should know these kind of things. It upsets me that women like yourself and my mother have to go through these kinds of things when a doctor should be trained and know how to diagnose someone especially when it's an evident suspicion. I really am praying for you and keep hope alive like my mother. Lots of love, Reg :) Hi We always welcome newcomers to Cancer Compass because it is truly a cyber family that is here to support each other.  CC has been around for many years and we find blogs are often revived when someone reads a particular post.  This particular blog was written in early 2009.  Linda may not respond to your post because it has been six years since she posted - and so much can happen in six years.  I pray she is doing well wherever she is.  I truly understand your frustration.  I had a different type of cancer (tonsil) and my only symptom in the beginning was extreme fatique.  I went to 5 doctors in seven weeks and all found no reason for my fatique.  Finally, I began having very mild chest pains - only bothered me at night when I went to bed.  My father had an extensive heart disease problem so I asked for a referral to a cardiologist.  She took a look in my mouth and said \"We need to get you to an ENT immediately and they may want to biopsy that.\"  That was Monday - Wed evening I saw the ENT who looked in my mouth and said \"Holy Mackeral\".  I was in surgery the following Mon AM and biopsy showed cancer before I even left the operating room. A very dear friend of mine - sisters by choice since we were 3 years old, had a very similar experience as your mother.  She was diagnosed with cancer and had a double mastectomy.  A little over a year later she had a \"boil\" come up in one armpit.  The doctor lanced it and told her that it was no problem.  Several months went by and the area got continually worse.  Her husband finally told her she was going to a specialist - who diagnosed her with advanced cancer.  She was told early on that it was so far advanced it was incurable.  They sued the doctor and won a huge settlement but as she told me, she would have given it all back for good health.  After seven years of fighting this horrible disease the second time (nine including the first battle), she passed away this past Dec 20.  She had a deep faith in God and I know she celebrated Jesus birthday with Him but we all miss her.  She was a HUGE inspiration to so many!!  Prayers for everyone Cancer Compass.  I can tell you are going to be a valuable member of our family - caring, knowledgeable, and sharing.  We may not cross paths often because I am rarely on the breast cancer section except to share Brenda's story.  I have been contributing to the oral cancer section for 7 1/2 years - cancer free!!! Praise God!

There hasn't been an MRI or PET Scans done which is really frustrating.  When one was asked for, she was told that they couldn't order one until something showed up on the CAT Scan to warrant it.  Yet the third lump in her breast was not even mentioned in the results of the CAT scan.  As I said, very frustrating.   Thanks for inquiring Bibi!  As a Mom, I have to contain my concerns for her enough so I don't scare her more but show them just enough to push her into pressing forward.   It helps to have a place to vent my fears here.    Diana    ",

Diana    any development on your daughter? I appreciate your asking.  Keeping in mind that this is the daughter (I have 4) that has never even let us know when something was going on with her, I am extremely worried about her because she is sharing what is going on!  I can tell she is very frightened - and it takes a lot to scare her.  The doctors have finally admitted they don't have a clue.  Everything seems to center on the left side (left breast, left ovary, left pelvic area).  Here are some things going on: 1) A sizeable lump 2\" below her belly button.  They did an ultrasound of the pelvic area but said the area where the lump is located is not considered the pelvic area (what?).  It costs her $700 to be told sorry, \"we couldn't examine the area we should have because it was a inch away from what WE consider the pelvic area.\"  2) She is waking up during the night with her right ear stopped up and left ear hurting.  Once she sits up, it subsides. 3) Her left ovary is twice the size of her right ovary.  4) They did a biopsy and said it was inconclusive for lupus.  They did a second biopsy and said it was also inconslusive.  They will do another biopsy in mid October.  I appreciate my Cancer Compass family's input.  You were always there for me when I was undergoing treatment for tonsil cancer.  I had excellent care at CTCA but from reading so many posts on here from others received inadequate care, I don't want to hear one day that I am going to lose my daughter because of the incompetence of some doctors who didn't have a clue.

Diana There is a difference between instructing God's words with others and being judgmental and cruel . \u201cI hope you find my words helpful as you prepare for you own annihilation.\u201d \u201c It's rude to turn this into your problem and start policing the comments.\u201d \u201cIt's merely a satanic attack. \u201c \u201cThere is no need to respond back because it will just prompt other Christians to share the Gospel with you \u201c  \u201cIf you are looking for a argumentative discussion on theology, I suggest you find a site where life is not so fragile and where your hurtful words will not harm those in the weakest moments in their lives. \u201c This woman has cancer and has the right to feel however she feels. As Christians we need to love everyone regardless of their beliefs and the God I believe in is a kind and loving God. It is people like you and others on this thread that give true Christians a bad name. I will pray that the people here can see the error of their ways. Praise God. alicekay, Spoken as a true Christian!  The \"satanic attack\" comment made by others was upsetting to me also.  I am a Christian and being a Christian has been of great comfort to me and my family. Getting religious advice and comfort from someone I know is always welcome, especially when I ask for it.  I don't need nor want any anonymous witnessings or preaching.   To bring up religion and then refer to a non- believer's comment as a satanic attack is wrong.  These internet cancer Christians need to spend more time in church and less time on CC.  Charles Charles - before bowing out of this discussion, I would like to make one comment in response to your post. I was not the one who wrote satanic attack but it sounds as if I interpreted it differently than you and alice did. When we are not the author, we often don't understand the meaning behind certain words. We can take words differently than what someone meant. I did not understand satanic attack to mean breast's comment but rather that very often when God's words are offered, Satan tries to counter those words and undermine God's work! That happens frequently - I have very close friends who are missionaries and dedicating their life to The Lord outside the U.S. The more good they see from the fruits of their labor, the more Satan worked against them. This went on for a year but as we all know, we've read the book and know who wins in the end. Diana",

I have stage 4 and I am not deluding myself thinking GOD will provide a \"cure\", If that magical thinking is comforting to you, indulge yourself. I don't find any of that GOD crap useful, helpful or worth a second of my time. This is a real thread about dying, I doubt you have ill intent, but please take it somewhere else.I am always very sorry for those who are in your position. I am referring to anyone who is facing a serious dilemma - whether it be a life altering situation or a life threatening disease. I lost my husband to lung cancer and I was given a 50/50 chance for survival 7 years ago after being diagnosed with tonsil cancer stage 4. If I had been in your position either time, I would have fallen apart - probably yelled at the world - but I know that there is a god - my Heavenly Father and I relied on Him to get me through both times - and He did! ................................................................................................................................................. This thread is not about dying but living - however much time we have left - and no one is assured of an exact time. I could be involved in a fatal car accident today - as could anyone. The Cancer Treatment Centers of Ameica created and sponsor Cancer Compass. Their motto - \"God didn't give you an expiration date and we won't either\". God is important to CTCA and is important to many here. They hold Sunday services in chapels located in their facilities. They are all about what is best for ALL patients and there are many of us that take comfort in knowing that God is there for us. God can perform miracles and has but what is more important than living is knowing where I will be after death. So while you may think that god is a lot of nonsense - a great many more know better. ................................................................................................................................................... One question that you don't need to answer. What if you are right and I am wrong about God. What is the worst that can happen when I die? I will be buried in a grave! On the other side, what happens if you are wrong and I, and all others who believe in Him, are right? The Bible is very clear on the consequences of denying God. And that my friend is a position that I wouldn't want to be in - to be wrong about whether God exists or not. I don't expect to make an impact on you here but then God instructs us to share His words with others. We have free will and it is up to them as to what they do with those words. There is no need to respond back because it will just prompt other Christians to share the Gospel with you. Diana",

      "Content": "It's interesting that you should word it that way - afterlife insurance because our belief in God is insurance of an afterlife (eternal life) but more importantly, it is assurance of a way of life while here. You are absolutely right about Emily's question but I have a best friend since 4th grade and know that Emily has the same type of relationship that I have with my friend. I just drove five hours one way to spend a few days with her while she was recuperating from gall bladder surgery. She flew up to stay with me while undergoing treatment for cancer. We are there to hold each other's hands and listen to each other through whatever comes our way - good and bad. We are sisters by choice rather than birth. ...................................................... I was a stage 4 patient given a 50/50 chance of survival. My now husband (we were planning a wedding when diagnosed which I put on hold since I didn't want to die and leave him with a ton of bills) said I was unbelievably calm throughout treatment. I cried once when thinking about not being here to see my grandbaby who was born half way through tx grow up. I was sad for her - not me! You see, in the beginning I had handed everything over to God - my prayer was that if it be His Will that my time here was done, I totally accepted that and was at peace with it. Also, that if He saw me through treatment I would do even more in His name! God was with me every step of the way. ........................................................................ I have a close friend who has been living with terminal cancer for 7 years. She had a double mastectomy 7 years ago and was clear for one year before being diagnosed with two different types of breast cancer (one started as a lump under her armpit). They have told her point blank that she will never be free of cancer - that it will one day take her life. Her daughter drives her 300 miles round trip for treatment every Tuesday. When I left her last fall, I really didn't think I would see her again she looked so bad. When I came back a few months later I was shocked to see how upbeat she was. She is totally bald but has numerous wigs that she can put on at any time and be ready to go. We had a wig fashion show, we went out to dinner and laughed all night, and then we returned home for a sleep over. She now has injections in her hip once a week that leave her SORE but yet, she thanks God each and every day for giving her another day to enjoy her family, her many friends, and counsel other cancer patients. She is an amazing amazing amazing woman! .............................................. The requirement to believe in God and the way to have eternal life is not just my way but God's way and the many who out their total faith in Him. I beg to differ with you about no other post is there god talk because it is found continually through all posts over all types of cancer on Cancer Compass. I am in the right spot - and maybe so are you. I am not being cruel here but everyone is going to die - we just don't know when our time here will be up - it could be today for any of us! When I ask unbelievers or those who are not followers of Christ what happens if you are right and I am wrong about God - I truly hope one thinks about that. If I was wrong, the worst that would happen is nothing - I would die and someone would bury me. But of I am right and you are wrong, I will gain eternal life and be united with family that left years ago AND you will spend eternity in place described so horribly in the Bible that one don't even want to think about it! ...........I look around at our world today and I'm beginning to see what that place will look like - and it is ugly and with no hope of it getting better.. Your eternal soul depends on researching our claims. Lee Strobel did not believe in God but after his wife became a believer, this professional writer set out to prove there was no God. Instead he found information that proved otherwise. He spoke to atheist and to clergymen of different faiths. Remember he set out to prove his wife wrong to get her out of this crazy Christianity. His research proved to him that there is a god - our God! ................................................................................................................... Satan was referenced because where God is at work, we always find Satan trying to undermine God's work. Diana",

I thought I had clarified that Amdy's input about vitamins and treatment involving vitamin therapy may be welcomed on the alternative section but maybe I wasn't as clear as I thought. I find Andy has been posting since April, 2010 which allows a young man 1 1/2 years to research cancer in general (admits he is a researcher and never a cancer patient) and become an expert! I am a cancer survivor of tonsil cancer and have researched in terms of years, as has Sheila (Shemay) and many others when it is our lives on the line - or a spouse or child- but I would NEVER attempt to tell someone with different type of cancer how to treat. I had a type of cancer that if left untreated would have taken my life. I am NOT adverse to alternative treatment but personally I am not going to become the guinea pig for an alternative treatment when there is a tried and true conventional treatment that has been proven time and again. I do visit the alternative site and Sheila helped to convince me that Vit C injectable has some value; however, I did not - and do not want - to join a political fight against any non-profit organization OR any doctors. We cannot become so defensive of our OWN opinions that we begin to hurt those that we want to help. THIS forum was not created as a stage to fight a political battle. The only statement that I have heard that was more stupid than \"men can't get breast cancer\" is the statement by Pelosi that we should pass the healthcare bill and THEN read it! No matter what stand you take, you should read anything before voting to support or not to support an issue. I so totally agree about pink ribbons not having anything to do with treatment - alternative or conventional! It is an emblem used to promote breast cancer awareness. Diana",

Found a lump, no show on the mammogram but did show on ultrasound, gave me 3 weeks to have it removed. June 13th  had a surgical biopsy in 2 weeks, it was invasive ductal carcinoma and had my lumpectomy with sentinal lobe disection done on July 2nd. Surgeon says she got it all and it had not spread so now I am in limbo waiting to go to the oncologist and find out chemo or radiation or both.  I am 38, married a year for the 2nd time have 3 gorgeous children and am scared to death. i told my husband today who is the main reason i am fighting this that i don't want to do anything else. Just let me go. I am becoming more depressed as time goes on and I know it is awesome that it hasn't spread and it isn't in both breasts but the thought of chemo and what you have to go through and I found out today that chemo will throw me in to menapause and truley my new husband and i were hoping to have a child of our own he does not have any children and I was hoping to be the mther of his first child. I waited all my life to find a love like this and I feel i am being short changed and that i am short changing him, he didn't sign up for this and now he is suffering to.   I hope your test comes out with good news and sorry to ramble on I just read your message and started to cry because I literally know what you are going through right now and it is not easy.  Keep us posted. Hi Tomslady - I have a different type of cancer so I can't address your treatment but I would like to say I can feel your pain.  As a 60 yr old, I called my step mother shortly after being told by my ENT that she was sure I had tonsil cancer and cried because I was so scared - so being scared is a natural reaction.  I encourage you to do whatever it takes to ensure you beat this - for yourself, for your husband, and for your three gorgeous children that need their mother.  You said your husband didn't sign up for this - but when we get married no one says it is always going to be perfect.  As my father once said, young people today don't understand that every marriage has good times and bad times - and it is the good times that get you through the bad AND it's those bad times that make the good times even better.  As for having children, talk to you doctor and tell him how you feel.  There may be something that can be done but if it comes to your never having children with the love of your life, then you both will enjoy the three you have.  I have a daughter that was told at 22 that there was a good possibility that she would never be able to get pregnant.  When she met a young man several years later who asked her to marry him, she told him no because they might never have children (which he wanted badly).  He told her it was her he wanted and if there were no children - well so be it.  They were married and 3 years later went through invitro and have twin boys - now 5 yrs.  Please don't sell your new husband short regarding your children.  They are a part of the woman he loves.  My first husband decided he preferred the single life when I was pregnant w/ my 5th child and walked out on us.  I met a man when my youngest was 7 mo. and my oldest was 7 yrs.  We were married when the youngest was 3.  Sadly, we lost him to lung cancer shortly after the baby turned 18 yrs but 3 yrs later when her sister talked her into going to a family reunion (biological father's) she told her biological father that he wasn't her father - that her real father had passed away (so a close bond can exist between a child and stepfather).  You fell in love with this man so I'm sure he is very special - give him a chance to show you how wonderful and supportive he can be through this trying time.  Marriage is being there for each other and there will be good times again!  I had only known my present husband 4 years when I was diagnosed w/ my cancer and we grew even closer through our battle w/ cancer (and it was definitely \"our\" battle).  Take care of yourself sweetie and I will remember your entire family in my prayers (which help more than anything).  Diana   ",

We do not come here to have a young man who has acquired just enough knowledge (both accurate and inaccurate) to make him dangerous give us his opinions on the best treatments or tell us how we get cancer (or prevent it) or how non-profits work. We have been in the trenches having fought cancer or are still fighting it! Your spouting off accusations may be acceptable on some sites but this really isn't the right place for them.

Wouldn't waste time on this computer and site if didn't truly care about people and possibly helping someone gain useful and factual information. That's what we all want, factual and truthful information  Have done the homework, lots of hours. The organizations you mention, specifically and especially SGK, while probably formed with good intentions, are not being truthful and transparent with the public and people who give them millions of their hard earned dollars  Recommend watching 'Healing Cancer from the Inside Out' by Mike Anderson, for a good start on understanding these organizations.  And listening to Mike Adams, who talked just tonight actually, 10/28, and touched on these organizations -  http://www.renegadehealth.com/cancer/blog/ \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.renegadehealth.com/cancer/blog/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.renegadehealth.com/cancer/blog/ Also, any legitimate breast cancer foundation truly devoted to eradicating this disease will have studied the research on Vit D and be recommending supplementation or getting enough sun  to ALL women. What does SGK say about Vit D?  mums the word. Shame on them  Andy I am going to try one last time to get through to you. Your type of post may be welcomed on some sites but this is the wrong place for you!!!! Why? You are correct in that we want factual information but not from someone who is not even wet behind the ears and has NO idea what he is talking about! We, the cancer patients and the caregivers come here to gain information from other cancer patients and survivors - people who have been there and done that! When your own life, or the life of someone you love dearly, is on the line, we have done tons and tons of research. The first thing my husband did after my diagnosis was get onto the Internet. The fact that people found our site is proof that they know how to navigate the net. As for nonprofit organizations, I repeat, this is not the forum to address that issue. The majority are wonderful, caring, supportive groups. Believe me - when you have cancer, the first place you turn is generally one of these groups. As for pink ribbons, do you have any idea of how many people you just offended? The pink ribbon is to bring awareness - which it does, When you are battling cancer, you welcome any and all awareness that calls for a cure. You mention, you mentioned what MAY aide in preventing cancer - people on here already have cancer and can't concern themselves with preventing it - especially a pie in the sky unproven way. FYI - everyone has cancer cells in their body!!!! It is when they begin to clump together that the problem arises. The fact that you could make a really dumb statement about men not being able to get breast cancer (even if you did correct yourself) shows just how little you know! I don't doubt you care but people coming to Cancer Compass are looking for info from the real experts - those who have fought it and won OR are still fighting it. The Cancer Treatment Centers of America have created this site for that purpose and to be there for patients and for caregivers to share info and offer support/comfort! It is NOT, I repeat, it is NOT a site to offer your opinion or my opinion! We don't have time to fight political battles. I watched as my first husband wasted down to 79 pounds before God took him home! I could care less what the outside world was doing! I needed a place to cry, to scream, to rant, when it was evident he was losing a hard fought battle against lung cancer. I didn't have Cancer Compass but I didn't have my Cancer Compass back then so I held it inside. I couldn't let Jack stress more - he already felt guilty because he was leaving me! When I fought my own cancer battle 4 years ago, I could care diddly about what the pharmaceutical companies or any other supposed injustice. My focus was on winning the battle! This is Cancer Compass - compass as in showing the way on a journey - a journey through cancer. As with traveling from New York or Florida to California. The only people who can guide you are those who have traveled the route before you. They know the curves and dips in the road. Someone who has just looked at a map cannot know these dangers. The people who are fighting cancer don't need any additional stress - they have their plates full! If you truly truly truly care about them, you would keep your thoughts about political issues to yourself. Can't you tell by the responses that people are trying nicely to educate you rather than the other way around - much like you would a small child who thinks he knows more than his parents. Please, for their sakes, keep your opinions to yourself OR find a site that was established for this purpose because it is not Cancer Compass. Diana",

When I go to CTCA for my checkups, it's as if I am going home. I know if there is ever a reoccurrence, they are up for the fight again! I am four years out of treatment and counting!!! I am happy for you that your scans continue to show no change. Diana",

When they took the cells out of my neck, there was a very distinct smell. It was not a pleasant one. My next biopsy was of a benign lymph node, and, sure enough, no smell. Now, I have more lumps in my neck andmy urine has begun to take on the same smell as those cancer cells. My next biopsies are on August 1st and it will be interesting if it is in fact thyoid cancer back. Also, pets do act different when you have cancer! My dog wouln't stop licking me obsessively.. I didn't notice a smell but I can easily believe that there would be one.  Also, we all have cancer cells in our body - it is ony when they begin to \"clump together\" when they become a problem.  Hopefully the first person to post pick up on a lone cancer cell.  I totally believe that dogs can pick up on the smell - they are much more sensitive to smells than humans. ",

ThanksCancer keys is absolutely correct about the Benadryl for any kind of allergic reaction. I am allergic to the dye used prior to scans and break out all over. I also have difficulty breathing. My oncologist ordered prednisone 50 mg - one tablet 13 hours before, 7 hours before, and 1 hour before a CT scan. Also, I am to take 1 - 50 mg capsule 1 hour before. I had a serious rash around my port area during treatment which turned out to be an infection. My oncologist put me on an antibiotic which cleared it up. .............I don't see it mentioned often but I also have an allergy to latex that I did not have prior to treatment. Any bandaid, tape, or glove that is made of latex will break me out. A small piece of tape on my arm will result in my entire arm breaking out. Diana",
