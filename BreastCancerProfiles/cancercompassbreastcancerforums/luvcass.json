I started on Arimidex in March and I am already having major pain in one arm and elbow joint and in the oposite knee joint.  My arm and shoulder on the side where I had the mysectomy does not have a full range of motion without pain.  Isn't there any other medicine we can take that won;t cause us so much pain?
