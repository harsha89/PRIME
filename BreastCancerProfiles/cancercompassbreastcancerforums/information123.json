    "Content": "Hi, I'm her2nu breast cancer with one spot visible on my liver.  Has anyone ever had a mastectomy when the cancer has already spread to the liver?  My dr said the spot has to be gone before I'm a candidate for the mastectomy, so I'm just wondering if it's been done before.  I know I can seek a 2d opinion.  Also, how long do they usually wait between last chemo and surgery to give time for immunity to build up, yet not enough time for cancer to go wild?  Thanks for help, this is my first post.",
