    "Content": "Sher, I am starting my first of eight chemo's this Monday, the 24th.  I have been traumatized many times over thinking of it, losing my long long hair that took years to grow.  But we have to walk the walk and talk with the Lord all the way.  I feel the same, think of it as God's creative power running through you, killing all the invisible cancer cells that may possibly be there.  Rest in Him and take Him with you each step of the way.  The rest of our journey we know where we are truly going.  It is true, it will make us all better people and children of God.  Just think, the rest of our lives will be JUST the way we have always wanted it to be, in the Fathers' hands!  We are conquerors and we will endure it, He endured much more than we ever have had to.  Keep a good attitude of better things to come!  I just hope my hair and nails grow back more beautifully and my hair thicker!  I'll be thinking of you and everyone else that is sharing it with me.  ",
