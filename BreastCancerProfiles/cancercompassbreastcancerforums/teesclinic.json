I have been having lymphatic drainage almost non-stop on the left side since the surgery in Dec. My doc hasn't really answered my questions about whether or not there is a problem with my lymph nodes that is causing so much drainage. He keeps testing for infection and so far there hasn't been any this time but I did end up with an infection just prior to the surgery in Feb. I'm not sure I understand what is supposed to happen with normal lymphatic fluid, where does it go? Why the constant build-up on the left side now? I had 2 nodes removed from the left side and 1 from the right with the mastectomy but had no lymph node involvement. Any information on this would be helpful or even questions to ask the doc when I see him again next week. Thank you! TQOTU   Hi, First of all are you having lymph drainage from a fully qualified practitioner as he/she should be able to advise you as to whether a compression garment/bra would be of help to encourage lymph drainage from the affected site. He/she should also have been able to explain how lymph drains. Basically from the armpit or Axilla the lymph drains mainly up towards the collar bone/base of neck where the lymph then passes into 2 large veins, from here the waste product is filtered through the kidneys and is passed as urine and the remainder is recirculated around the body.  In your case the fluid should be re-routed to the groin for uptake into the lymphatic system. It is important to have a fully qualified therapist who knows what they are doing so ask about their qualification as it should be from one of the following : Vodder, Casley-Smith, Foeldi or Leduc. Hope this helps   ",
