    "Content": "i have been fighting Pancreatoblastoma since 2006. i have had a liver resection, whipple and rib resections. I have had intrmittent fevers every 4-6 weeks. It usually starts out with extreme chills and shaking which usually goes into a fever of between 103 to 104 degrees. i usually take 20 mgs of prendisone and head for the hospital. As soon as they hook me up to an I.V. and rehydrate me i recover within a few hours. Most of my doctors think it is most likely tumor fevers. However i have had full lung radiation so it could be pneumonitis. They also arent ruling out an intermittent stricturing bile duct. They have not been able to give a definate answer on what is causing the fevers.",
