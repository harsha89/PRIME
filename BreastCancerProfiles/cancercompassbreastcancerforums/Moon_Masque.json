      "Content": "<<1) How do you/did you go on with you daily life while undergoing treatment for breast cancer?>> I didn't. I dropped out of life for a while. I had the luxury of cutting back on my work schedule and working from home, performing only the most necessary duties pertaining to my job. I worked only a few hours a week during the most difficult treatments. I'm still not working a 40 hour work week, for fatigue and poor concentration are still making it impossible for me to manage an eight hour work day. I can't expect my employer to baby me forever, so I imagine I will have to make a decision sooner or later regarding my job. In the meantime, I've already been 'demoted'; it's obvious I'm no longer suited for my original high pressure position. As for daily life at home, during treatment I concentrated on only the necessities. My husband took on the majority of the housework, and I helped here and there, as energy allowed. Of course it took me three times longer to perform even the simplest of tasks, such as making the bed, but I felt better knowing I was at least doing 'something' now and again to help. I've taken on more household duties now, but I'm still not able to do everything I once did, and some days I can't seem to do anything at all. I'm trying regain my strength now through gentle daily exercise (walking and stretching), and meditation. The exercise/meditation seems to help, for if I miss just one session, I tend to feel physically worse and even more useless the following day. Nutrition is another tool I'm using in an attempt to improve my health and fight the fatigue, etc. Good nutrition is very important. It's one of the few things in my life I can control. <<2) How has breast cancer changed you or your life?>> It changed EVERYTHING in my life down to the tiniest detail. My job, my relationship with my husband, friends, and even strangers. It changed the way I think, the decisions I make, and the way I prioritize my life. Some of these changes were negative: I live with fear now and the realization my future will always remain uncertain. I have nightmares; I worry; I feel 'defective.' I struggle with the medical bills which will eventually cause me to file bankruptcy. No matter how hard I try to push these negative thoughts from my 'conscious' mind they remain lurking in the background, always there to remind me there is no escape. In a way, my treatment is ongoing -- I have to take Armidex for five years, thus endure its side effects. There is also an unidentified spot on my spleen which needs to be watched. It could be a harmless abnormality or it could be cancer. If the spot changes, then more treatments will have to ensue. I haven't reached an impass yet where I feel like I can safely leave this part of my life behind me. Some of the changes were positive: I am more aware of other people's suffering now. I am no longer shy about approaching people who appear to need help or an ear to listen. While waiting for my doctor appointments I've been known to approach complete strangers in the lobby who appear sad. I encourage them to talk about their burdens. I ask them if they want a hug. I want them to know they are not alone. I am also more aware of my own needs. When energy allows, I seek new experiences I never took the time to pursue when I was healthy. I've become more assertive about my own wants and needs. Staring death in the face has forced me to evaluate what is truly important to me for my happiness in life. Good luck with your college report! I hope this information is helpful.",

      "Content": "The doctors state I had my breast cancer for 2 - 3 years, before I discovered it in June of this year.  I didn't do self-exams; I hadn't seen a OB/GYN for 10+ years.  I just happened to do a self-exam one day and sure enough.... I found a lump in my left breast.  Had I taken the time to do monthly self-exams I surely would have found the lump years ago. All testing to date shows the cancer not to have spread to my lymph nodes, bones, or other organs.  A recent tumor marker test revealed a score of 11 (I was told anything below 40 is considered 'normal'). I take Armidex now (the cancer was labeled stage 1:  1.4 cenimeters, node negative, ER+/PR+, no signs of spread). I was sick before the diagnosis (I began to feel terrible two years ago, oddly enough), but after the diagnosis I became so ill I could barely get out of bed.  I lost my appetite.  As a result I wasn't eating properly and near fainting everytime I stood up.  It took me weeks to come to grips with my diagnosis.  During the waiting period for surgery and further testing I felt certain my entire body was filled with cancer. Cancer really messes with a person's head.  It is probably the most feared of all diseases.  Your sister is going to feel scared, stressed, and depressed, until she has had sufficient time to adjust; I don't think it would be normal if she wasn't feeling physically and mentally strained right now. Hang in there and be strong.  Try to help your sister find ways to gain a sense of personal power.  I chose nutrition, exercise, hypnosis, and prayer for my weapons of choice.  I did extensive research about nutrition and completely rearranged my diet. My diet is mainly comprised of fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and complex carbs now.  I visited a hypnotherapist to help me boost my immune system. I used meditation tapes to help me relax. I reached out to my spiritual guides and Deity for compassion and help. I also began an exercise program.  I still have bad days, but for the most part I feel better now knowing I'm doing something to aid my health. This has been very important to me in overcoming some of the fear of the disease. You and your sister are in my thoughts and prayers. Blessings and Healing to You Both, Moon Masque     ",

      "Content": "I'm not certain what is considered 'standard' testing. I just know the tests I have had done and will continue to have done to stay on top of things: 1) Tumor marker test (Used in conjunction with CT scans, it can help identify signs of reoccurrence /metastasize. I just had my first tumor marker test done in December. A comparison test will be done in March.) 2) Cat-scans (with and without contrast dye). This is to check for signs of metastasize. I understand breast cancer sometimes spreads to the lung, liver, brain, and bones. Because I have right side pain, I had abdomen CT's in July and October. Another one is scheduled for March, because a small \u2018unidentifiable spot\u2019 was found on my spleen. I probably won't have a brain CT unless I begin exhibiting brain symptoms.) 3) Bone scan (for the above reason) - I haven't had that one yet, but it is on my 'list of things to do' in the upcoming future. 4) Lung x-ray (For the same reason listed in #2.  I'm not certain how often they should be done.  I've heard there is a suggested limit for the number of CT/X-rays a person should receive in his/her lifetime.) 4) Complete blood work (to check liver function, etc.). For now, I have one done every three months. 5) Bone Density Test (If you are ER/PR positive and taking anti-estrogen medication. The bone density test checks for signs of osteoporosis caused by the Estrogen deficiency. The first test is considered your \u2018baseline.\u2019 I'm not certain how often they are to be done.) 6) Mammogram (I believe the first one is done after six months, then every year thereafter if the six month one checks out okay. I recently read some doctors prefer MRI's. MRI's have more false positive results which can require unnecessary biopsies, but they are also more accurate. 7) Sonogram (They sometimes find things the mammogram may have missed. They can also help determine if a lump is a fluid filled cyst.) 8) Monthly self-exams.  This is important even if you have had a masactomy. If I'm missing something I'm certain one of the other ladies here can fill in the blanks. :-) Blessings, Moon Masque",

      "Content": "Oh, yeah, the colonoscopy. I forgot about that one.  I had one done and they found six polyps, one of which was precancerous and another which was burnt up in the removal process hence it will remain a mystery.  I was told had the precancerous polyp not been removed, I would have had colon cancer within ten years.  At any rate, it is recommended everyone have a colonoscopy at age 50, for screening purposes. I find the testing important, because the earlier they might find signs of cancer having spread, the earlier they can begin treatment to attempt to keep it under control.  On the flip side, all the testing is expensive, time consuming, and stressful. In my experience, doctors don't always seem to offer additional testing, unless you ask for it or you are experiencing problems.  I suspect this may have something to do with keeping costs down for the insurance company, especially if you are stuck in an HMO.... but that's an entirely different subject which serves to raise my blood pressure! lol.

      "Content": "Wow! I thought I was crazy, until I read your post. Prior to my diagnosis, I detected a noticeable change in the scent of my body perspiration. My husband noticed it, too. I tried different deodorants to counteract the problem, none of which seemed to work. I was taking two+ showers a day in an attempt to escape this very odd odor. After my diagnosis and sequential treatment the odor began to slowly fade. Every now and again it tries to return, and when it does I revaluate my diet, stress levels, etc. and make changes accordingly. Eating large quantities of vegetables, fruits, and herbal teas (preferably organic), reducing meat and dairy intake, and maintaining an exercise program seems to be the key to keeping myself healthy.... and odor free. lol. In addition to seeking medical attention, please try to convince your wife to alter her diet and to begin exercising if she is not exercising already.  It is especially important to give our bodies the nutrition it requires (preferably through organic whole foods) to maintain a healthy immune system. I am also curious to know if any other women here (or their spouses) detected a change in their body scent in conjunction with their diagnosis. Blessings, Moon Masque   ",

      "Content": "I'm currently taking Arimidex (I've been taking it for 7 months now).  Some days I do okay with it, other days I ache all over, suffer joint and bone pain, depression, and extreme fatigue.  I also have Fibromyalgia, hence it is difficult to determine if the pain/fatigue/depression is related to the Armidex, Fibromyalgia, or simply stress.  I've also started losing my hair, which hasn't helped my outlook on life.  In the past, exercise and diet seemed to help me a great deal, but I'm now finding it increasingly difficult to exercise and eat.  My blood pressure and weight has been slowly dropping with every doctor visit (Last visit: BP 90/50; weight 146lbs). The doctor hasn't mentioned these changes as being a problem, but if my blood pressure continues dropping it is obviously going to become an issue.  I do feel dizzy and faint sometimes when I am walking or standing, however, it doesn't happen everyday. Sometimes I wonder if the Arimidex has stopped working.  I no longer suffer hot flashes, and the terrible vaginal dryness I once suffered has now mysteriously vanished.  Has my body become accustomed to the medication or somehow discovered a way to create Estrogen in spite of it?  I discussed my concerns with my doctor, and he simply stated hot flashes are usually temporary.  Nonetheless, my doctor suggested I switch from Armidex to Aromasin, under the assumption it may help some of my issues.  I asked if there was a difference in the effectiveness of either medication, and he claims they are both the same. My question is if they are both the same, then why should I switch?  I'm wondering if anyone can tell me the chemical differences between Armidex and Aromasin and the methods in which they work.  Is Aromasin known to cause less pain/fatigue/depression/hair loss, and if so, why???  Is it possible Aromasin could cause more problems than the Armidex?  What side effects can I expect from the Aromasin in comparison to the side effects of Armidex? I'm feeling apprehensive about making the switch.  I'd like to hear from other women regarding their personal experiences with both medications and any health care professionals who can explain the chemical differences. Thank you for your time. Blessings, Moon Masque    ",

      "Content": " Disclaimer:  The information provided below is based upon my opinions, personal experience, and research.  I do not advocate anyone make changes in their treatment/medications without doing their own research and discussing the subject with their doctor first.  ******* I took Arimidex for one year, before deciding it was doing *my* body more harm than good. My side effects with Arimidex were manageable for the first six to eight months through diet, exercise, etc., but then I hit a wall and I began experiencing rapidly increasing side-effects I could not control.  Because my BC was deemed Stage 1, it was my understanding that the Arimidex was mainly being used as a preventative measure against reoccurrence. Of course my doctor tried to convince me to switch to Tamoxifen, which I also refused (Do an Internet search on LE MAGAZINE, OCTOBER 1999 - The TAMOXIFEN SUBSTITUTE This article is rather old, but still enlightening). At any rate, after doing a great deal of research to attempt to uncover as much information as I could about these types of medications (beyond the 'benefits' shouted from news releases and drug manufacturers), I decided the possible health risks associated with Arimidex far outweighed the benefits for my Stage1 breast cancer. When I pressed my doctor for further information, he admitted the medication was only increasing my survival rate by 7% (I assume this number would be different for other women, based upon their cancer type and stage).  I'm no math genius, but when I compared this rather small percentage to the alluded risk of stroke, heart disease, osteoporosis, etc., etc., (information which I understand is only now beginning to more fully surface), it just didn't make sense for me to continue taking this medication. It seems to me the entire system is screwed up in regard to the treatment of breast cancer. If I were to die tomorrow from an Arimidex induced pulmonary embolism, instead of cancer, I imagine my doctor would pat himself on the back for keeping me 'cancer free,' then chalk up another positive percentage point toward the benefits of Arimidex  (Sorry if I sound bitter.. but I am. lol). Because Arimidex is technically still being studied, they do not know much about the long term health risks associated with Arimidex and if these risks are reversable (But I understand information has been increasing lately, as more and more studies are being completed).  Based upon the results of my last two chest CT's, it apears a year of Arimidex usage may be responsible for the Thymus uptake noted on my CT reports (apparently the result of an overactive Thymus gland working to reestablish my immune system).  The reports clearly state this problem is presumably the result of 'BC therapy.'  Of course the alternative is far less desireable, but who can say for certain (in my case) the Arimidex didn't do more harm than good? Regardless, in hindsight I still would have taken the Arimidex, just not for an entire year.  I think six months would have been ideal for me.  I feel my body needed a temporary break from Estrogen, until my dietary and lifestyle improvements were firmly established.  However, I do believe if I had continued to take the Arimidex for the recommended five years, I would not be here in five years to discuss it. If you do an Internet search on 'WHAT YOUR DR MAY NOT TELL YOU ABOUT BREAST CANCER' you should find a website which shares the first two chapters of a book (of the same name) written by John R. Lee, M.D,  Dr. David Zava and Virginia Hopkins.  Although I have yet to order the book (money has been an issue due to medical bills -- yet another rant for another time), the two chapters which can be read through the website reveal some rather interesting information.  Although the book appears to be somewhat dated (it talks about Tamoxifen, rather than the new Estrogen blocking drugs), I still found this information to be revelant and enlightening.  Besides, I really don't think there have been many new recent developments in BC breakthroughs in the last decade (besides the Aromatase Inhibitors). Now as far as Arimidex and other Estrogen blocking drugs being used for the treatment of Stage II - IV hormone receptor positive BC... I have a different opinion about it.  In such cases it may be the best choice available until remission is achieved and diet/suppliments can be used to try to address the root of the problem.  I hope this rather long post (sorry... I got carried away. lol) is helpful to you in considering your options.  I suggest you ask your doctor about the % benefits of the drug vs. its risks/side effects.   Also be aware your doctor may suggest a medication change.  Sometimes that is the answer for some people. As for me, I'm taking the more 'dangerous' route (or so they say).  In all honesty, I no longer trust the doctors and pharmaceutical companies when it comes to my OVERALL health (not just the cancer).  I'm tired of them trying to control me through fear. If you do decide to end the Arimidex early, as I have done, I strongly suggest you at least research and pursue healthy dietary changes.  (Do an Internet search on 'CRAZY SEXY LIFE.'  They have a wonderful, positive forum there with health tips, recipes, and tons of information to help 'C' patients develop a healthier lifestyle.)    I with you the best of luck!  Talk to your doctor.  Let us know what you ulimately decide and how you are doing!

      "Content": "I had multi-catheter brachy therapy in October 2007. Twenty-one catheters were inserted into my breast (42 incisions total) and radiation was passed through the catheters two times per day for five days. The scar tissue and discomfort from this procedure was severe for me, so I understand what you going through. Some of the areas riddled with scar tissue have softened over time, so I\u2019m hoping as the years go by I\u2018ll experience additional improvement. Unfortunately, the pain hasn\u2019t improved yet; I have to take pain medication on a daily basis. Some of the things which seems to help me include the following: 1) Applying vitamin E 2) Long, hot baths 3) Applying ice when there is a lot of swelling and inflammation 4) Forgoing a bra whenever possible and wearing a comfortable fitting sports bra when traveling or exercising 5) Avoiding injury and jarring (I can\u2019t count the number of times I\u2019ve bumped the bloody thing). 6) Gentle stretching over time 7) Sleeping on my \u2018good\u2019 side with a small pillow wedged between my arm and the effected breast to lessen pressure from my arm I also switched to a hospital that uses digital mammography -- it does not require the breast to be compressed as much as conventional x-ray type mammography. I recently read on the Internet that ultrasound therapy can help break up scar tissue in the breast -- but I\u2019ve also read conflicting reports as to whether or not this procedure is considered safe for BC patients. Hopefully others here can provide a long-term perspective regarding how much improvement we can expect over the years and/or additional tips for handling this problem.
