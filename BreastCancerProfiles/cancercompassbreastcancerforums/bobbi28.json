    "Content": "On the 27th day of radiation treatment when I got up I was extremely dizzy.  I was assisted in getting dressed and with walking to the waiting room.  I did manage to drive home...slowly but the dizziness persisted throughout the weekend.  On Monday I consulted with my radiation oncologist who said the dizziness was not a reaction to the radiation.  Since the dizziness stopped by the end of the 4th day, I returned for another treatment yeasterday.  I walked in with no difficulty, but following treatment had the same reaction but not as severe, and I had a driver with me.  Up to this time I've had very little side effects to the radiation, but just wanted to know if anyone else has had the same effect because my doctor was so insistent that this was not an effect of radiation.",
