    "Content": "So I am a 30 year old male, and I have stage 3 Breast Cancer, I am starting to become very scared and sad.  I am feeling very confused about many for the different treatments that I am in, and I have no support really.  I am not sure what I can do or where I can even go to talk to anyone because men don't usually get breast cancer! I would love to be able to talk to someone so I don't feel so alone and so sad.  Dealing with the pain of treatment is a hassel, I am recieving Chemo, and also am in a research study to try and help as the cancer has spread to my lymphnods. thanks for taking the time to read this!",
