    "Content": "Dear solcalicopper, I'm sorry to hear the news about your wife! If the diagnosis is cancer,you might want to at least check out alternative medicine.I know of a woman who had a tumor the size of a quarter on her breast.She was taking Graviola liquid extract,internally and topically,and the tumor disappeared.If interested,you can find it at www.allvita.net.There is hope!   Best Wishes,Susie Q",
