    "Content": "Wow, your  email has given me hope in my new diagnosis of a second go around of breast cancer, I have it in my spine, pelvic area with a few other small area. I get my pet scan Monday and bone scan and brain mri next Friday. I am 38 and had stage 1 breast cancer back in 2005. Lumpectomy and radiation. Clean mammograms so this came as a shock when they removed a tumor that had eaten my vertebrae away. So, now receiving  radiation on the spine and Zometa once a month and Tamoxifin once a day. Does anyone have any strange side effects from any of theses meds. Joint aches are huge? I dont like taking the Oxycodone but it seems to be the only thing to relieve the pain. Anyways have rambled on enough. It is so comforting to know someone else out there is going through the same stuff.....please reply   Jen ",
