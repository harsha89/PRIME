    "Content": "i just read your concern.if i am understanding the info correct,it sounds like your lymph nodes.ck out your lymph system and how n why it works n what it does on your pc. then ck out dry skin brushing and also a mini trampoline to help move the lymph fluid.they say we have more lymph fluid than blood and when the fluid becomes slow or stagnated to a degree is when lumps etc show up...the lymph sys has no pump like the heart for moving blood thru us,certain activities cause the lymph to move n remove toxins in us. i,m not a dr of any kind,just trying to be informed n hopefully to pass on info to others,it,s just info,so others can also make their own opinions,as i have. take care.",
