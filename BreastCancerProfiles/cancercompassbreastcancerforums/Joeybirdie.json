      "Content": "Hi everyone!  I just received wonderful news from oncologist!  My breast cancer is gone and they can't find any cancer cells in my body!!  I couldn't find an alternative treatment feed on here and didn't know if it is okay to post it here.  I did not do the mastecomy, chemotherapy, and radiation like she wanted me to.  I used Raw Cannabis, Broccoli Sprouts, and Turmeric Spice.  That is all.  I never had a bad day and never missed a day of work.  I had stage IIb...HER+++ breast cancer.  I will take a maintenace dose the rest of my life.  Did you every hear of breast cancer stem cells?  If you google 'stem cells in breast cancer university of michigan' you can read about the research they did on it.    God Bless, Joey",
