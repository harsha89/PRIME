    "Content": "Hi I just had a lumpectomy just over month ago 3 cm, plus a smaller cancer next to it. I'm only a c cup.but think now I should have reduced both like you to match up after lumpectomy surgeon did a great job but it's still pretty ugly and now I have one c and one b probably dosent sound bad, considering it could have been worse.lymph nodes took longer to feel better still feels odd because of scaring where drain was, I'm now waiting for chemotherapy to start. I live alone but stayed with my mother for a while only because if I could get clothes on getting them off was harder so may need some help but not much or get clothes that do button up so you don't have to lift your arms, there will be swelling so still need your bigger bra at first ,your man sound a great help anyway.good luck",
