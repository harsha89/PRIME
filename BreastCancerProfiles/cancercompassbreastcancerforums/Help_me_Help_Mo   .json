    "Content": "My mom just started chemo treatments for breast cancer. When the docters told her she would lose her hair...she cried. And now...two weeks after first treatment, she has started to lose her hair and is tearyeyed off and on. I want to make her feel better. I offered to shave my head, but she said not to. I don't know what I can do or say to make her feel better. When she crys I cry. Does any one have any ideas for me.                                        Kim",
