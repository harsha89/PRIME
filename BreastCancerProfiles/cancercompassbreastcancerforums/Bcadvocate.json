    "Content": "I have had numerous problems with AI's tried both arimidex and exemestane. A watch-dog group, dubbed the bad girls of Breast cancer, have an on-line study looking at all the side effects of the AI's. You may want to visit their website, Breast Cancer Action,bca.org. They will have a presentation at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this December displaying the results. I am not a medical doctor, I am a 2x BC survivor with a mother who died of the disease. I serve as a national patient advocate and I do not think enough testing has been done with these drugs to be labeled safe or better than tamoxifen. In the SABCS meetings for the last two years I sat in the poster sessions discussions and spoke up when the presenting doc said that the bone density loss and associated pain was NOT SIGNIFICANT to take into consideration when prescribing this medication. I stood up and related my experience and my training in statistics where the numbers in question are statistically significant, it was -2.96. There was a deafening silence in the room after I finished, this was an international audience. Use caution when new drugs are suggested.Especially the AI's which docs are ready to prescribe like chocolate and which patients are battling at this moment.Ask what the reason is for this switch and what the doc is basing her/his decision upon. Info from the Pharma rep is not a good answer. ask them to cite studies and make it your effort to read and understand them. They usually have someone at the medical center, an advocate or SW who will work with you to understand the terms and significance if your doc does not make time.",
