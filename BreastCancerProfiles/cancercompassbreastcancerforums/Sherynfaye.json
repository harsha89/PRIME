    "Content": "I wish I would have found this site awhile ago for support.  My mom has breast cancer (original diagnosis was in 2000 - LOBULAR).  She underwent chemo, radiation and lumpectomy, even though there were no infected nodes.  She discovered a lump in her clavical area and was told for 4 months that it was not a spread of the disease.  Scans (PET and MRIs showed it was not).  Finally, she convinced the doctors to remove and biopsy.  It was a spread of the disease.   Over the last year, she was on hormonal therapy, numerous chemos (2 of which nearly killed her).  Last week, she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.  They did an MRI and confirmed a spread to the bone in the pelvic area.  Her oncologist LIED to her...told her it was in the soft tissue but after obtaining the reports, it says right on there that it is in fact in the bone.  Oncologist is a different story altogether....  We met as a family this weekend as she is considering stopping treatment.  Her ONC told her he had nothing else left to give her as chemo is killing her and Abraxane (the only one that she could feel good on), did nothing.  The tumor in her clavical area has grown rapidly.  We will visit City of Hope to check in and see if there are experimental trials she would be interested in.  However, she is tired, weak, doesn't want to do this anymore.  How do you know when to stop fighting?  We told her we would support the decision she makes.  I've read on the boards and bone mets don't mean that death is emminent (as in within a couple of months).  I also read about Zometa and have no idea if she has been given that but will find out later. I am angry....I know it doesn't do any good but I am.  Anyway just trying to release some negative emotion.  Anyone with Bone Mets out there who found a successful treatment?  What about the tumor up near her neck?  If it hasn't responded to any chemos, now what?",
