      "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with triple negative IDC and is having a simple mastectomy next week. She is 83. This is her second breast cancer diagnosis. She had IDC (but it was hormone responsive, not triple negative) 18 years ago. She had a lumpectomy and several lymph nodes removed then as well as radiation and chemo. She doesn\u2019t want radiation again but hasn\u2019t ruled out chemo. I guess we\u2019re waiting to see what is determined from the actual surgery. She is Stage 1.",

      "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with IDC 18 years ago. She had a lumpectomy but I don\u2019t remember the number of lymph nodes that she had removed. I believe that it was over 10 because she did experience some minor lymphedema in her arm. Since it\u2019s been so long, I can\u2019t remember how many rounds of chemo and radiation she had. She was was on tamoxifen for a number of years. She still follows up with her oncologist and they recently found something suspicious on her mammogram. We learned following her biopsy that she now has IDC in the same breast but it is triple negative. Luckily, it is Stage 1 but we\u2019re scared because we know it is aggressive and we don\u2019t know what to expect. She\u2019s scheduled for a simple mastectomy next week (no lymph node removal). She\u2019s refusing radiation as she felt it damaged her heart and we aren\u2019t sure she can handle chemo. Her oncologist said that the standard of care is not to do mammograms on women over 80 yet he\u2019s had made 4 recent diagnoses on women over 80 so he will continue to recommend screenings. Hoping that you\u2019re well.",
