Did you ask for the scans or it is an automatic?? I will be seeing my oncologist in a couple of weeks. I finished radiation yesterday. yeh!!!!!!!!!. Connie   Hey Connie,  I think it is standard for your Doctor too order these scans.  Not sure how often.  I have been scanned twice for everything since my last radiation treatment.  So once a year unless you find another lump. Kimarie   Hi Kimarie, Sorry this has taken me so long to answer. I really appreciate the info you gave. I did talk to my oc about having a scan. He said If I wanted but its not necessary as he keeps track of me through my blood draws. I still havent had a scan but want to. I guess I need to be more pro-active. I do see my radiologist one more time for a skin check. I will discuss this with her as well. Thanks again, I will be on here more often. I really feel after we get to this part of our survivor- ship we are put on the back burner (if you will). support systems are so important. Do you attend support groups? It feels good to talk to others in the same boat. conneann  ",

Thanks Connie On 7/12/2007 Leemg wrote: Hi!  I've been on Femara for just over 3 years and have suffered no ill side effects, and the woman I work with is also taking Femara for about 4 years after being on Tamofoxin for 5 years and also has tolerated it very well.  I do read a lot on the sites however about the side effects you mention.  I understand Arimidex is very much like Femara in that way but everyone is different and different medications affect people in different ways.  I would at least try it as the worse that could happen is that you would have to stop. Good luck to you!  ",
