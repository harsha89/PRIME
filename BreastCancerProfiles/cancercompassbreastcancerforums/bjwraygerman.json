      "Content": "Hello: I had a lump removed in my left breast in 2008 it was negative for cancer.  Then in 2011 I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast.  I went through surger and then chemotherapy and then radiation.  I got burned so bad that my skin fell off under my right arm and on my breast and under my breast.  I used radia guard but I went through weeks of healing.  The doctor removed lymph nodes that were positive also.  I have had pain in my breast, chest, arm underarm and back for over a year.  Just three weeks ago the surgeon said the only resolve to my burned tissue was a masectomy. He also suggested a bilateral masectomy.  The pain in the breast area has decreased about 60% but my chest wall is so tight I feel like I have a brace around me.  I still have the pain and was told I would most likely have some pain the rest of my life but I have the pain medication that helps and I am a pretty strong person so I know I can make it through.  Although I have my moments.  On the brighter side.. . . I can go outside without a shirt because I am not being indecent.  I am writing a book about my experience called \"Is there something you forgot to tell me?\"  I also know that God has given me this experience, bless his heart, for something special and maybe I can be there for others.  God Bless you and I will be praying for you.",

This will be her third time having it, but this time is so different.... It's stage 4, incurable, and has spread from a lymph node between her lungs to her right ribs. I wasn't alive for the first bout with it; that would be what caused early menopause, and the reason that I am adopted. The second time, I was 12 and 13, in eighth grade, and my Dad died of Hemochromotosis two months after my Mom finished her Chemo treatments.... I've essentially been taking care of my Mom since I was 13. I don't know what to do right now, though. I feel so alone; we moved to a different state, and we don't have any family --that counts as close family-- here, and all of our family friends and our support system are back in our home state.... My Mom is talking about how she won't see me graduate, or get married, or see any of her grandchildren; tomorrow we're going to meet with an oncologist who is going to tell us what we can expect, including life expectancy.... My Mom is a tough cookie. She was given 5 months last time, and is still going, and that was about a decade ago. But she's in such a depression, and I don't know how to help her. I don't know what I'll do if I lose her.... She's trying to teach me how to run her business so that I can have some sort of income while I'm still in school. Everything has such a final sort of feeling to it, that I don't know how to cope. My head is reeling, and I'm trying to keep up with my classes and manage my Mom's clients and inform our family and friends about the situation and make her doctor's appointments.... I know that there are people who do this every day, and I can't even express the respect I have for them.... I am in awe of their strength. I've been trying to find mine.... I've been trying to keep a happy face on for my Mom, and not cry around her, and not freak out or have a mental breakdown.... I keep bottling up everything that I am feeling, for lack of any coping mechanisms. I need advice. I need help. I need to know what I should be doing, and what I can do to help her.... Please.... Help me? Hello Nicole H.  My name is Bj and I am a country gospel singer and lecturer.  I am also a cancer survivor who just three weeks ago had to have a bilateral masectomy due to severe radiation burn of tissue.  I have had to be a care giver for my first husband, mother and father all within two years then caring for myself. We never know what is going to be handed to us.  As one of the other repliers said, \"stay in the moment\".  Try to get in touch with you local cancer society and ask if there is a support group.   Or call your local hospital, there are usually care giving support groups.  God won't give you any more than you can handle, and what you are going through is and will make you stronger.  I will put you on our prayer list and God Bless you.",
