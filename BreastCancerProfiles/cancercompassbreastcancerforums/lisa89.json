I am not quite sure if it is the side effects of Letrozole or Zometa. Both these drugs have similar effects.  Is anyone going through the same treatment and having similar effects? Or is there any alternative medication I can take to alleviate these effects? I am 47 years old,but it feels as though I am 90. With love Ryalma Have you talked with your doctor? Was your treatment changed, did he/she give you pain meds? Would be interested in knowing where you are at with this.",

      "Content": "I originally was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 at the age of 36. Had surgery, chemo, and radiation. February of 2008 rediagnosed with the breast cancer in my lungs and bones, and since then suspicious spots in my liver. I started on hormone drugs, but the cancer was advancing slowly. In addition, I developed plural effusions and fluid around the heart this past winter, spent three weeks in ICU; therefore, treatment of the cancer had to change. Since January, I have had three different kinds of chemos, which were not working. Just received the second treatment of another drug this past week. When I was rediagnosed, I was told by several doctors that it is now a chronic illness, but it is treatable. There are many breast cancer treatment options. I am assuming your daughter with the spots on the liver may receive a different treatment than your other daughter. Please know that there are several options. My doctor started at the bottom of the list. It made several people upset and they questioned me as to why I wasn't getting the big guns right away. I tried to explain it like the doctors, want to try the easiest so that if it works they didn't waste the others, but still have them to turn to down the road. Please ask your doctors all your questions, no question should go unasked or  unanswered. If you aren't happy with the doctor, find the right one for you. Your daughters relationship with the doctor is the most important as it is her trust in him/her and what he/she is doing!! Be your own advocates!!! May you find this difficult time made easier by accepting the help of others. Blessings to you and your family! Lisa",

Rediagnosed in 2008 with it in the lungs, bones, and now suspicious spots on the liver. Have had a couple of hormone drugs that didn't keep the cancer in check. Had Taxotere and Taxol, that my body must have built up an ammunity to from having received one of them in 2003. Had an oral drug, but have now switched to Ixempra (?I think this is the spelling). Just interested in knowing what others are receiving, how you are responding to it.  Blessings to you and your family and friends on this journey. Lisa",

The issues you outlined and uniqueness of your situation really could benefit from professional counseling. They should be able to deal with the specifics of you situation. Going together as a couple would be helpful, but I'd encourage you to go on your own even if your spouse doesn't want to go. I know breast cancer is difficult for all of us who have been though it and our loved ones. We each have ways we have coped, but I doubt any of our experiences can adequately cover all of your issues. Please seek out a professional counselor. Good luck to you both.  I agree with this response. As a Christian, I believe that God is bigger than everything we are going through; however, He never said that life would be easy. He is there to help us through these difficult times, to make us stronger in our faith. Please pray for a counselor that you can open up to and God can use to help you and your wife!! Blessings in His Name!",

Not curable, but treatable. I know that made me feel better when I was rediagnosed in February of 2008 (originally in April 2003). I have been on several different hormone drugs that were not working, now several chemo drugs since January of this year. There are so many out there that I am feeling confident that God is helping the doctors find the right one for me! Frustrating at times, but I need to trust that God is giving all of those working with me wisdom in their decisions! What chemo are you receiving? Where is the cancer now?Hopefully you were told",
