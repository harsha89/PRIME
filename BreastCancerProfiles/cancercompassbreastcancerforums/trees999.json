    "Content": "I have lymphedema in my left leg.  It has never been a problem until last year.  Since June I have had 8 admissions for cellulitis.  My case is complicated by the fact that I have multiple skin allergies and since they have been treating the cellulitis I have developed multiple drug allergies.  I knew I was allergic to penicillin but I have also had allergic responses to doxycycline, clindymicine, tremethoprim and one other which I cant remember. Linezolid makes me nauseous and causes vomiting although they are continuing to use that.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  Has it been resolved? trees999            ",
