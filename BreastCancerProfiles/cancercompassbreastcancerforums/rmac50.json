Doctor wants to do a lumpectomy and then 5-6 weeks of radiation.  No lymph nodes will be removed and no chemo. will be given.   Since a digital mammogram done in December 2007 showed nothing an MRI was done on both breasts this past Thursday.  I am awaiting the results that may show something in both breasts.  The doctor has said that I can delay treatment because this is a slow growing cancer. I beleive that cancer is a fungus.  I am familiar with Doug Kaufman.  I plan to follw the Phase One for a least 30 days to help kill off as much fungus as possible but I am not sure that it is a good idea to not have the lumpectomy and radiation. Does anyone know if I consult or get a second opinion with the Cancer Treatment Center will I be obligated to receive treatment from them?  The closest location is Oklahoma but that is 1300 miles round trip. Is there a directory available for doctors that beleive that cancer is a fungus and will prescribe anti-fungal drugs? Does anyone know if Dr. David Holland still sees patients? Thanks for your help.       I am wondering how you are responding to your treatment. I have just been diagnosed with the same. Please let me know, I am also interested in what Doug Kaufman has to say on the subject of cancer being fungus and have just sent off for his book containing the Phase One diet. I look forward to seeing how things are progressing for you and how the diet worked for you, as well, as far as affecting the DCIS.",
