      "Content": "I finished last treatment 8 days ago and the pain, swelling, itching, numbness is worse than I could ever experience. My  fingers feel like raw nerve endings exposed.  I am in constant pain.  The only relief I get is from ice packs. Pain meds don't work.  I feel almost insane from this pain, as well as tongue. I can barely speak, or even eat.  They didn't tell me about these side effects after chemo.  I had chemo 6 months and went through it easily, but this, I have to meditate a lot and  take the focus off the pain.",
