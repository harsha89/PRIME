      "Content": "I had a R simple mastectomy 3/08, zero positive nodes, no chemo or radiation needed, now on tamoxifen. I noticed a small lesion (macular )approximately .7 by .5 cm. on the surface of my other breast which has been there about 5 days. A friend of mine was just diagnosed with IBC,so I am worried about such a diagnosis. Of course I am going to make an appointment with my oncologist who I missed my last appointment because I was doing so well. Lesson learned, go see oncologist even though I feel like I am doing just fine so I will maintain that connection. Anyone have any feedback on size of IBC lesions? Are they ever that small?",

      "Content": "I had a simple mastectomy in march of this year. I am uninsured so I am still paying hospital bills. I went into the mastectomy/bra shop with trepidation and the sinking feeling of having to spend lots of money. I couldn't afford the really delux prosthesis, so I was going to try ready made. I had even gone on E-bay but I had sense enough to know this is something that has to be personally fit.      I am only moderately concerned about my missing breast. My boyfriend is very accepting of the new me, in fact he was the one who noticed the lump and insisted that I have it checked out.      I would like to consider reconstruction in the next several years, but I may have to wait until I am 65 and Medicare will cover it.       After showing me the available products, she mentioned that some people might be turned off by this but some people after having a change in their needs donate perfectly good used prosthesises(?) . I got a $450  Amoena prosthesis for free! It is the soft gel kind, don't even look at the foam rubber ones. My next hope is to find a cooler product. Even though this one has a special detachable gel cooling pad, it is still very hot. Anyone know of something that really works? This little pad is so thin it doesn't help much. About bras, I hated what was available both for the price($40-60) and the industrial strength construction of them. I got bras with a lining, cut a hole in the lining, and stuck the prosthesis in it. It's not perfect, but it sure is more comfortable than those mastectomy bras. Kay in Atlanta              ",

I had a simple mammogram with sentinal node biopsy 3/13/08. I had one positive node so was expecting to get chemotherapy. When I went to see the oncologist the first time, she implied since I had a positive node I would need chemo. She tried to get online with a program called Adjuvant! but the computer was down. The next visit she priced the two treatment types, A/C for 4 treatments at $2000 a treatment for a total of $8000 or another ,carboplatin/cyclo.. at $3800 per treatment or a total of $17,000. She then gave me the Adjuvant! chances i.e.the chances of me being alive in 10 years with all the parameters of my tumor, size, positive nodes, etc. The odds just weren't that better with chemo and hormone therapy versus hormone therapy versus doing nothing.. She did it for no positive nodes. I pointed out I did have a positive node , she said that a node less than 2mm was counted as a negative node. She ran the program again for me with 1-3 positive nodes and the mortality was essentially the same. My tumor was E+ so I am on tomoxifen which is thank goodness a generic drug. I am still paying medical bills, so I am delighted if I don't need chemo. I just hope I am doing the right thing. And if I should have a recurrance....I'll worry about that when it happens.

Sincerely, Tre  Model Refines Beauty By Christina Faro The world of fashion isn\u2019t all superficial. In 2002, former fashion-model and now photographer Lynn Kohlman was diagnosed with breast and brain cancer. Now a survivor, she has published a visual account of her life, titled \u201cLynn: Front to Back.\u201d In the late 1960s, a young Kohlman was considered to be the most prominent fashion model. Frequently featured on the covers of major fashion magazines and in numerous advertisements for such companies as Yves Saint Laurent and Missoni, Kohlman dominated the model world. In the 1970s, she became a photographer and was recognized by publications including Vogue and Glamour. In 1989, Kohlman was named Fashion Director of the designer Donna Karan\u2019s company. In 2002 when the Kohlman suffered a seizure during a yoga class, the woman who had so extensively impacted the fashion industry was given just six months to live. She eventually underwent a double mastectomy, and as of 2005 continues to defy her diagnosed fate. Jennifer E. Heinsman, design assistant, Capital Mercury Apparel, said that Kohlman has had a significant contribution to the fashion industry. \u201cKohlman greatly influenced Karan\u2019s DKNY line, which is a highly recognized fashion line,\u201d said Heinsman. Kohlman\u2019s book is now gaining national prestige. Featured on Oprah, the book is considered to be a raw and profound look at human beauty. Highlighting photos of the author, Lynn: Front to Back, it offers a new illustration of what is considered beautiful. Karin M. Chrisville, 19, Hopewell Junction, N.Y., said that the book suggests a brand-new perspective of what it means to be beautiful. \u201cThe book offers so many images that contradict what society tells us what beauty is,\u201d said Chrisville. Ann Marie Sperrazza, 20, Buffalo, N.Y. said that the book is also a change from what the fashion industry is typically portrayed as. \u201cUsually, one thinks of the fashion industry as a superficial entity, with an obvious focus on appearance,\u201d said Sperrazza. \u201cBut Kohlman\u2019s book suggests otherwise, that even though she was once a famous and beautiful model, life can touch her just like it can touch anyone else.\u201d Kohlman\u2019s publication indicated bravery of the human spirit. One particular image is of Kohlman, naked and make-up free, baring only her mastectomy scars. Heinsman said that this particular image depicted the author\u2019s bravery, on more than one level. \u201cClearly, Kohlman is an extremely brave woman for battling cancer,\u201d said Heinsman. \u201cShe is brave in another way, for being known for such a long time as a traditional beauty and having the courage to break the mold and show real life.\u201d Kelly A. Schenker, 20, Smithtown, N.Y., said that Kohlman\u2019s decision to show her scars is profoundly unselfish. \u201cWhen you see the pictures of Kohlman as a young and beautiful model, and then the pictures of her following her mastectomy, you really understand just how giving this woman must be,\u201d said Schenker. \u201cTo allow the public to see that difference, she really was doing us a favor by humanizing herself.\u201d With such a current focus on supermodels as having negative effects on our society, especially on young girls, Kohlman\u2019s struggle is a deviation from this stereotype. When good friend and former-colleague Karan was asked about Kohlman\u2019s story on Oprah, she said that she has great admiration and has learned much from her friend\u2019s battle with cancer. \u201c[She teaches] the spirit of living and really how to give back,\u201d said Karan. \u201c[I learned] how much Lynn has given to all of us. . .

I am uninsured, so I have had to pay every penny of my treatment . I did not need radiation or chemo (which would have cost 20K) and am on the cheapest hormone therapy tamoxifen which  increases my risk of having uterine cancer. I shopped for breast prostheses everywhere and bought one of those \"industrial strength\" mast6ectomy bras on the web cause it was cheap, $6.99. It was also too small so I cut up one of my old strappless bras to extend it from a 34 to a 38. I wasn't going to pay $30-60 a bra for such horrible mastectomy bras.      As I walked into the prosthesis and Bra store, I looked for the sales rack. After talking to me for a few minutes to the sales woman, I was confused by the wide variety of prostheses available. Then she  said she had some used prostheses people had donated if I would consider such a thing.      Would I? I walked out with a $450 Amoeba  prosthesis for free. It is a size B cup and my other breast is a C but no one can tell the difference except my sister.  Some women naturally have one breast smaller than the other. My size difference is just not natural. Kay  ",

I had simple mastectomy with no radiation or chemo. I have had very mild effects with the tomoxifen, some hot flashes but no other side effects I have noticed. Tamoxifen is kind of old fashioned  but it has been thoroughly tested and is even available in generic form.I remember sone studies showed it was better than some of the new aromatase inhibitors. A scan will not show anything yet, you have to wait til the tumor is big enough to show up on the scan.  Or you take an estrogen receptor in hopes that it will keep any cancer cells left in your body from growing into a tumor big enough to either cause symptoms or show up in a scan. /I am a hospice RN as well as being a breast cancer survivor, and I deal with so many women dying of metastatic breast cancer. It is a horrible way to die especially because they can do so much for breast cancer nowadays. I will take my tamoxifen  for the next five years, thanking the Lord that I did not need radiation or chemo. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it, but I would take anything my MD advised me to take to keep my cancer from coning back.  Kay RN ",

I am uninsured  so the fact that tamoxifen is a generic might have been a reason my oncologist prescribed it.

I'd love to say it's nice being here, but...... 53 years old, married, two children, one still at home.  I'm a RN and found a lump in my left upper chest wall at work one day in late February.  Asked one of the docs to check it out and he sent me to a surgeon who specializes in breast cancer.  Biopsied the spot, and low and behold it was invasive ductal breast cancer.  Then began my journey to the land of oncologists, radiologists, plastic docs, etc.  We elected to do bilateral mastectomies and the first surgery date was March 18th.  All ready to go to surgery when a critical lab was reported:  blood glucose was 517 :( Surgery was rescheduled for March 28th..spent one night in Observation, discovered a hematoma and had to have surgery again the 31st.  So far I still have the tissue expanders (I call them my hockey pucks) in place.  Implant surgery is scheduled July 30th.  Had the Oncotype DX testing and scored a 43...sigh. I got my Bard PowerPort yesterday.  I see the oncologist next week to discuss type of chemo, schedules, etc.  I also see a gyno doc for the lovely and exciting transvaginal ultrasound as I'm having a complete hysterectomy (prophalactic) and my doc doesn't want to go in blindly.  Honestly, I think the thought of losing my hair is my biggest worry.  I've decided to shave it and get a spray on tan..hehe And I'm seriously considering foregoing the nipple tattooing and get a hummingbird on one breast and a flower on the other.  I've never had tattoos and love the thought of being a secret rebel ;) I've had great family/friend support, but it's great to have a place like this with people that KNOW what I'm going thru.  Thanks, y'all :-)   I'm an RN too, and had a simple mastectomy on 3/13/08.I am uninsured(and now I don't think I will be insured again until Medicare) so I have had to pay medical bills on top of everything else. I was fortunate and didn't need chemo or radiation, but I have the worry that maybe chemo could have helped my chances of survival(it would have but by such a small extent it wasn't worth it.) I am on tamoxifen so now I will have to worry about uterine cancer as well as possibility of recurrence of breast cancer. I sometimes wonder if my breast could have been saved by chemo before surgery, but that was not an option because of the expense of chemo. I love your spirit, good luck    ",

I went back several weeks later and found they had another prosthesis my right size(for free) and bras on sale for $9.99 which they had never had before. I bought 8 bras, so should not need any more any time soon. Now I am waiting til I am on Medicare so can even consider reconstruction.      Does your mom have insurance?

It is much cheaper than the arimidex and since I am self-pay I have no idea if that is why I was prescribed tamoxifen. The survival rates for both drugs is similar, though slightly better with the arimidex. If you are on private insurance the profit margin for the arimidex is higher than for tamoxifen. I have had hot flashes with tamoxifen which I can live with doubly, because the tamoxifen is not so bad and it is reducing my chance of breast cancer recurrence. You can't know which side effects will happen to you til you try the drug.The main point of all of this is helping us be survivors so good luck on your quest. Remember the people who write to these type of forums are the ones with really bad side effects and there are probably many women out there who have mild side effects. My advise, try tamoxifen.",

At church yesterday, 4 breast cancer survivors, one lung cancer survivor, and only one multiple myloma survivor congregated. Alas, one multiple myeloma congregant is burried in Texas.      The thought of not getting treatment is denial.Get treatment and go to the web to get stories, information and more information. As a start, I suggest looking up Tre's blog. She is wonderful.       So, I had a  R simple mastectomy with no radiation or chemo. I am taking Tamoxifin which gives me hot flashes like I never had during my menopause.

Chemotherapy, by contrast, has been done on thousands of women over the past twenty years so there is lots of information about it's effectiveness Oncologists are so busy just keeping up with the enormous amount of information about chemotherapy, radiation and other treatments for cancer that studying nutrition is beyond their capability.to study nutrition as well. Your observation that they \"are ready to give my wife chemo without question\" actually includes a lot of information including what type of tumor your wife had, etc. Read some of the other message board discussions to get a better idea as to what is going on with your wife's treatment.

(Lol skipping the mammogram nearly!)  The only thing that confuses me is that this patch of thicker skin hasn't changed, infact, it kind of hasn't done anything. It's not any redder than the skin around it, (it infact is the same color as my aerola?) It has some cysty like things in/near it. I don't have the inverted or flatter nipple, no lymph swelling or anything.. Just a patch of thicker skin on my left breast, slightly near the nipple. The only time it changes/gets redder is if I poke at it for too long. But then again, what doesn't?  I just can't get IBC out of my mind though - Looking it up on google is terrifying. - Especially since i'm only 19. e_e! I just learned that a friend has IBC.

You need to go to someone familiar with IBC and/or get it biopsied. I am going to my oncology office tomorrow. I am not as panicked as I was but I want an expert to tell me that I don't have to worry or have it biopsied. IBC is rare so many oncologists don't see many cases. Are you near a big medical center? A dermatologist could probably biopsy it or a very experienced oncologist(cancer specialist) could lead you in the right direction. Good luck, and get the followup and reasurrance you need. Kayatl",

      "Content": "Good news, I finally heard and I am ES+,PR-, herp- . I was afraid because I went to Sheffield Clinic, the reduced cost clinic of Atlanta Medical Center  where my simple mastectomy was done.For bills of 25K I will end up paying under 3K, they gave me ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL CARE. I am uninsured, so the next hurdle is trying to get reasonable chemo which is somewhat of an oxymoron. I am going to Grady, Atlanta's charity hospital. I have heard great things about them and I am already starting to get all the grants, reduced cost drugs, etc. I am optimistic most of the time, though sometimes get down with the tremendous cost chemo etc. is going to cost. I have never been in debt before.I make too much for medicaid. Oh well, my beat up 97 Corolla, thrift store clothes, etc will just have to continue. I am an RN so I am a bit obsessive/compulsive about the whole cancer thing. Thank you so much for responding. I am going to start answering some of those questions on the board with my knowledge.

I will just have to live with my incision lymphodema since I am uninsured.I am learning how to do all this breast cancer stuff \"on the cheap\" since I get bills every day practically . I went to the prosthesis store with my tlc catalogue. The saleslady said she could match the prices on some of the older models then she mentioned she had some donated prosthesis'es if I didn't feel revolted by the idea of using a used prosthesis. Hey, I loved the idea. I walked out with a free $400  prosthesis. I am sewing in inserts into regular bras and buying special bras on Ebay.!     ",

      "Content": "     First of all, my heart goes out to you especially because after losing a spouse which is one of the biggest loses one can go through you are hit with the double whammy of having to go through having cancer yourself.    I was diagnosed with breast cancer in Frebuary of 2008.  I had to have a mastectomy because the lump in my breast was so big that a lumpectomy was out of the question.I had to wait until the results of the biopsy to determine if I needed chemo.      Have you had a second opinion?  I don't see how they could give you the choice of a mastectomy or chemo. My simple mastectomy was not a bad surgery. I got all psyched up for chemo and they told me I didn't need it, that it wouldn't make much difference in my survival rate.      Now is not the time to be secretive or stoical about your cancer. Get support and as much knowledge you need to get through the next few weeks. The people on Cancer Compass are wonderful. Several women at my church went through some of the same things I was going through, so I can't stress enough the importance of reaching out to other cancer survivors.      I am also an RN, so I can say that chemo for breast cancer is not as bad as that for stomach cancer. Don't let your husband's experience keep you from getting the treatment that you need for your own situation.  Kay, not only a survivor but a thriver  ",
