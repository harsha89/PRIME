This also prevents fatigue during radiation. Am doing banting 0 High fat, medium protein and low carb ( basically no carbs), and find that thie really works. But am battling with chronic arthritis. ON Methatrexate for that, butfinding I feel like an old woman ( am 55). Do Gym, spinning, swimming and running, although running is tough now as my feet get sore.

      "Content": "My bones have not been affected at all, but lung does show signs of damage. The worst side effect of RADs is fatigue which TAURINE prevents. I worked full time, and did all my exercise and was only tired on one day. My supplement regime inclded: Zinc ( improve the immune system) Vit E, Oil of evening primrose ( to prevent depression) Magnesium Citrate for my bones/muscles and to prevent chronic cramps. Really worked. A host of others inclduing L-Lycine which im continuing even now. My worst side effect was chronic burning ( 2nd degree). Used R1 (for immediately after each session, and R2 to help the skin recover. )",
