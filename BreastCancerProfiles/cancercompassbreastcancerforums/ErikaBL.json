    "Content": "My wife completed 33 radiation treatments and 5 \"shrinking\" treatments and three weeks later developed terrible nerve pain in her shoulder radiating down her arm into her fingers. The Oncology Doctor said it was from holding her arm over her head during the treatments but after a visit to the ER, the Doctor told us it appears that the nerve running thru her shoulder was burned by the radiation and is causing her pain. He prescribed Neurontin and Percocet but they don't seem to be helping. She's sleeping less than 4 hours a night and in constant pain. I feel terrible for her but I hope there's someone else here that has gone thru this and can help. The cancer was removed along with eleven Nymph Nodes. Thank you for your time. Robert",
