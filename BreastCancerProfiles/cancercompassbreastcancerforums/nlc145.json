    "Content": "My mother called me last tuesday and said she had a mammogram and the doctor said he found something. she supposedly went in wed. for a biopsy. monday she sent a message that it was cancer. then this wednesday it had spread to the lymphnodes and today she said it was terminal. she said the doctor offered no treatment and no other options. she has a history of mental illness and often acts out for attention. i am just wondering if this timeline is possible. also if it is true would a doctor call on the phone and give the news and then offer no treatment at all. please help!!! i am concerned and feel very lost.",
