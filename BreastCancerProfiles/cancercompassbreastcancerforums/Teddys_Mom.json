      "Content": "I agree that you should push for more testing. I had a clear mammogram, clear screening mammogram and clear ultrasound. But, I could feel the lump and swollen lymph nodes. My maternal Grandmother and her sister both died of breast cancer. My mother died young so we don't know if she would have have gotten it too. I've had bartholin gland cancer 7 years ago so I've learned to be proactive. I went to the breast surgeon that I've seen before and he could feel the lump. I have very dense breast tissue so things can hide in all the scans. The doc recommended a lumpectomy and biopsy. I am scheduled for Nov. 17th, my youngest sons birthday. I think that's good karma. I wish all the best for your daughter and everyone on this board that is fighting for their lives.",

      "Content": "I have been on the gyn cancer board (4 year survivor of bartholin gland cancer) and on the multiple myeloma board (I have mgus, it can be a pre-cursor to myeloma) but never on this board. My question is this. I have been having what I can only describe as gurgling sensations in my right breast. It feels kind of like something is flowing but bubbles up and stops and then starts again and then bubbles up. I don't have any lumps or anything and I get my mammogram each year. Has anybody had this happen to them? Should I be concerned? Thanks! Good Luck to all of you fighting and to all of you survivors. Â ",
