    "Content": "I had taxotere and within 2 weeks i lost my hair, was very sick and dehydrated. After every chemo treatment i was admitted for 2 days for hydration therapy which helped alot.  I was devestated at the hair loss, but i did get used to it. You will get through this. Just keep the faith. Your PINK sister, Lori ",
