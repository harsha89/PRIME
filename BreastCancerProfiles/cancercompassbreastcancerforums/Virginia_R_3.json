    "Content": "Hi: I have been taking Arimidex daily for over a year now following lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation. I have experienced no side effects whatsoever from this drug. I was concerned about the lack of side effects after reading all these messages and asked my oncologist if this was normal. She informed me that everyone reacts differently to the drug but many women experience little or no side effects. Attitude has a great deal to do with this so please keep a positive outlook. I hope you have the same experience I have. Here's to good results!!! Va.R",
