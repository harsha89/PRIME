    "Content": "Absolutely not!  I have found out from personal experience that doctors are governed by the insurance companies and the insurance companies are modivated only by $$$$.  You are only a number to them.  I am caretaker for a 44 year old woman that is now fighting for her life because not only did the insurance company not care but the doctor was to busy to listen to her.... really hear her pain.  Please look out for yourself and ask LOTS of questions.   Take someone with you if at all possible. ",
