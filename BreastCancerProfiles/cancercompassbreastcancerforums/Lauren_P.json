      "Content": "Hi Andrew! I'm sorry to hear about your mother in law, but I also have breast cancer and while undergoing chemotherapy I met quite a few women with mets to the lungs and bones. These women were on Taxol chemotherapy for the bone cancer and took a drug called faslomax for the pain. There is a new drug they're using to treat lung cancer called Iressa, which is supposed to be excellent. It helped a friend of mine who was also given a few months to live, and she's proved them wrong. I know another woman who went to be treated for lung cancer at a hospital at a hospital in Chicago. She was also given a death sentence by her oncologists in New Jersey, and since she went to Chicago, her tumor totally disappeared. You can check out all the drugs I've mentioned above, by doing a search. Good luck and I hope your mother in law makes it! Lauren",

      "Content": "I was also diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, and have since had a mastectomy, plus extensive chemo and radiation. Before I found out I had breast cancer the doctors thought I had ovarian cancer, but the cysts were benign and then disappeared with the chemotherapy. A few months ago the cysts came back and now the doctor wants me to go for genetic testing, and if I have the brca 1 or 2 gene she wants me to have a hysterectomy because she thinks I might end up with ovarian cancer. I decided not to undergo genetic testing for many reasons, and after the mastectomy I don't want to lose any other body parts, so I'll take my chances. I'm 45 now and just hoping for the best. Good luck. Lauren",
