Her lymph node on one side was hard and sore but but on Friday they said it had not spread to the rest of the body.  Good news. Monday I was with her to get her port inserted, education at the oncologists office, and they did another scan on upper body late Monday afternoon. Tuesday was her first chemo treatment; I wasn't with her but she did fine. Now today they tell her they see something and want to do a CT Bone Biopsy.  It was scheduled for Dec 22;  her Dr called and said they are going to try and get her sooner. She tells us it's scary.  When I picked her up Monday we hugged she she I'M SCARED.  I tell her \"I know\". Hell we are ALL scared.  We aren't dwelling on it though. I posted Nelson Mandela quote about courage on her face book.  I texted her back \"of course its scary! you are in a war for your life.  We will win this war. Do not let fear triumph.\" I was wondering what is the best was to keep her  positive through all this? What is the best thing to NOT say?  Absolutely, what the other ladies have said. Be there for her, she needs your support. Have her tell you all the things she would like to do and do them. Get her out of the house as long as she is strong, when they are in that room all day for days they get depressed and can't see the positive. DO NOT push her to continue on with any treatments she may no longer want. We as family members want them here with us, but the truth is they are the ones that are getting poked and proded. Feeling ill with chemo, not being able to get up and do things because she is so weak. Please respect her decisions, after all it is her body. You are already giving her support by logging on with us, you've come to a very blessed site. These people have been my distant family every since I became a member in September. God bless you, your sister, and other family members:) Mary",

I always say don't worry till you have to worry. Right now , it's just an diagnosis. My mother was diagnosed in 2009 with Breast CA, it was the very beginning stages and she freaked herself out with worry. She thought she was going to die, she had surgery and radiation and she made it. Unfortunately Pancreatic CA took her life this year. So you see, the cancer she was worried about did not take her life. Hearing the word cancer scares everybody and people tend to think it's the end. There are so many survivors out there. Good luck to you and your mom, God bless.",

I kept my mom home until the end and I was so glad I could do that for her. You can always take comfort in the fact that you were there for Merie. My friend passed this morning. Two and a half months after being diagnosed with stomach cancer and having malignant ascites. Her husband wrote me that he feels her primary dorctors let her down because they diagnosed her problem as acid reflux and treated that for a couple of months. Also I don't understand why her urologist did not test her for cancer. She was under his care for five years taking that awful tamoxafin. I surely wonder if that drug gave her the stomach cancer in the first place. Take care dear. My heart goes out to you. You are a wonderful daughter. My condolences to you and her family:( I hate to hear stories about the doctors misdiagnosing patients, makes you always wonder if people could have stood a chance. My uncle, which is my mothers brother also had stomach cancer, he had surgery and passed away. The stomach cancer wasn't what killed him, it was his heart. They had removed the cancer. I was just thinking maybe it was his time. I also wonder why my mother didn't get checked thouroughly as well. It was her new primary care doctor that found her cancer. The tamoxifen is a very scary drug and I don't think I will ever take it, if I ever had to. I have decided to keep my mama at home till the end. I can't even imagine the people in the nursing homes trying to take care of her. I just pray that god releases her from suffering. God bless you. Thank you, I really am trying my best.",

I agree with what you say about our foods. All the toxins in our products certainly add to our chances of getting cancer. Our deoderant and household cleaners are loaded with things that are cancer causing agents. I was born in 1944 and believe me I know what food used to taste like. I often say it is sad this generation will never know how good peaches and tomatoes used to be unless they grow them and even then they have to grow on good soil which has been spoiled already by overuse of pesticides.  You are good to your mom, bless you for that.I will be praying for you both. My mothers name is Merie. I remember when everybody was getting upset when they took twinkies off the market. I kept telling everybody they wouldn't miss anything, those things taste horrible. My son ate one for the first time about 3 years ago, and he said ''Mom, you have got to taste one of these, they are awesome!'' I told him he had no clue how they use to taste and I thought they were nasty. He looked at me like I was crazy lol. So I definitely agree these younger generations will never know what it's like to eat REAL food. God bless you and your best friend, just know being there for her is gonna make her feel at ease about her situation. You are an awesome friend to care so much:)",

They found lymph nodes with cancer and removed them under her arm. she had chemo and started tamoxifen. She celebrated when her 5 years was up. Now 6 mos later she was diagnosed with stomach cancer and has malignant ascites with prognosis of 4 mos to live. I searched for info and have read studies in the UK and Sweeden mention tamoxifen can possibly cause stomach cancer. She also has a blood clot in each lung which this drug is known to cause . I keep wondering if the drug did this to her. I am hearsick over this and just cannot believe her prognosis. She will try chemo if she can handle it (so far side effects are bad for her). Does anyone have any thoughts on this story. Thank you. Hello, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, she had the lump removed, had radiation, and she also was on her 5th year of Tamoxifen when we got struck with Pancreatic Cancer. I am also wondering if this drug had anything to do with this cancer arriving. My mother was diagnosed in March of this year, I think we are nearing the end of our battle. She is bedridden and in diapers. I remember her breast cancer oncologist was not a fan of the tamoxifen, but we were sold on the whole keeping the cancer from coming back. She decided to take the drug. I'm wondering the same thing.",

We hear so much about drugs that are approved by the FDA and later found to be detrimental to our health. I don't know who to believe any more. I feel money is number one and they just don't care about the people at all. I was especially curious as to how that small lump my friend had actually disappeared. I know this can happen, have read of some cases, but then I did not read those people had nodes with cancer at the same time and had them removed. I am to the point that I even question mamography. Too many false positives and retesting going on including biopsy. I feel if a lump is not found and disappears, maybe that is a good thing without doing anything about it at all. I don't really know, but I know I am sick wondering if my friend could have lived many more years had she never had that mammogram. You're welcome for the reply:)I know, we get to thinking maybe we shouldn't take these meds. My co worker also had breast cancer and she waited months before taking the tamoxifen, because she saw all the side effects. I also believe these cancers are coming from the foods we eat. I was born in 76 and I remember the foods not having all the hormones in it. Kids actually looked like kids. These children are developing so fast these days. Everywhere you turn somebody has cancer, even these babies. Food actually tasted like food back in the day. Now with all these pesticides, things have an awkward taste. It's sad because all the healthy organic foods are so expensive, and it makes it hard for families to eat healthy. Thanks for adding my mama on your prayer list. I pray that your best friend will come by a miracle. I thought my mother was passing away last wednesday, today it's like she never had an episode. I guess god said not right now. She is back to her normal self, except for the fact she can't get out of bed. Hmmmm that is really suspicious about your friends lump. I honesty do believe that patients get misdiagnosed all the time. These med they prescribe for us always has some effect on our bodies. But to feel better and to heal we have to take them, such as antibiotics. I think a lot of people will skip out on that tamoxifen now and in the future.",
