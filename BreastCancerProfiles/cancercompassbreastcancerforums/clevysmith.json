      "Content": "My mother has Stage 4 Breast Cancer that has essentially spread to her skin.  She had a masctemy, lymph node involvement and now lymphadema.  I am looking for any information, examples from others who may have or have seen this type of cancer.  She has a reddening of the skin and then nodules break through the skin, they grow into large tumor masses, eating through the skin, starting as the size of a dime and grow very large, some the size of apples.  I am trying to learn what treatment, dressing options, or any information to better understand what is happening with her.  Thank you so much for any replies!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply and my thoughts are with you as you hold your memories of your mother.  My mom was diagnosed in Feb 2007 and has never really gotten much relief since then.  She was triple negative, had a lumpectomy, masectomy, radiation and a eight different types of chemotherapy.  She started with the reddening and small nodules at the operation scar in 2008 and it began spreading across her chest, now down her arm, back.  They slowly have grown in large clusters together and have a lot of discharge and drainage.  When did your mom's lymphoedema begin?  My mom is wearing a compression sleeve and glove but with the lesions she is finding it very painful so we may need to go with a wrap. I am trying to reach out and hear if there are others with these extensive skin lesions and wondering if there are chemotherapy treatments that would have some success at slowing down the growth of these tumors on the skin.  Other than the breasts, the cancer has not gone to other parts of her body or organs yet, only attacking at the skin and it is so difficult to watch her in so much pain and suffering and still have healthy organs. When and if you are comfortable, I would like to know what to expect with the process as your mom approached the end of this fight.  Over the last two months I have really noticed a difference in her energy level and loss of appetite, more sleep, nausea and I am not sure if this is the next course of the journey or as a result of medications, so much treatment.  Based on her time since diagnosis, I am starting to prepare for the worst. Again, thank you so much for your reply and prayers and I send you strength to help with your loss.",

The past year it has slowly moved to her skin, but her PET scans continue to be negative for organs or bones.  Her chest is now almost completely covered in lesions and looks like a big scab and then it peels and will ooze and does smell a little bit.  She is the sweetest woman and says it doesn't hurt, but she does say that her legs cramp and she has excruciating bone pain because of the neulasta she gets after chemo.  She is constantly tired and I can tell it is taking a toll on her, she finally went on to disability this year because her doctor kept bugging her that she needs to rest and that she shouldnt be working... which I and my family agreed.  She has horrible chemo brain and she is very forgetful, how was this with your moms? I am just having a hard time because I feel she is deteriorating right before my eyes.  I find myself preparing myself for the worst and I just want to know if any of this sounds familiar to you guys and if there are any cues that I should look for or things to expect.  I just feel helpless and would love to have some support with this situation and it would be nice to talk about similarities just so I know what to expect or should expect.  Thanks in advance, Brittany Brittany: Thank you so very much for reaching out and replying.  I would certainly be willing to share and chat with you as you go through this with your mom.  It is such a journey that I found my comfort and strength from others and trying to understand what to expect.  Does your mom have regular dressings over the lesions?  My mom tried various types of dressings, when the lesions were small, she wore dressings with silver in them and it seemed to provide some comfort.  She got a prescription cream that had morphine mixed with it that we would apply like a paste as she experienced a great deal of pain in the nerve endings and everything was so tender to the touch.  This part was one of the hardest as with lesions on her chest, spreading across her back and down one of her arms, I was no longer able to hug her, to wrap my arms around her and cuddle up to her for comfort that only your mom can bring you.  The chemo brain is definitely a real thing and with my mom, she was very forgetful in terms of what she was doing from day to day to be able to recall things.  We regularly chatted on Facebook as I lived 4 hours away from her before I went home to look after her in the final month and she would be forgetting how to navigate to things on the computer, etc.  It is so very hard to see them change for the worst each day when the battle starts to come to an end.  The whole time from when you hear the diagnosis it is always about beating the disease, having hope after every check up/follow up and then it was a difficult transition to think that she wasn't getting better and I was looking after trying to make her comfortable instead of stronger.  The fatigue was a big thing I noticed in the last 6 months of her life, this was when she wasn't on any chemo, just medications for pain, she would be taking more naps throughout the day and moving more slowly.  She was diagnosed at age 54 and passed away at 58.  Far too young.  As difficult as it all is, the time I spent with my mom trying to bring her comfort and look after her at the end of her journey was truly so meaningful to me and while you feel helpless, you are doing so much by being there as her strength.  Let me know if you have any other questions, don't hesitate.  My thoughts are with you and I am sending you prayers for strength as it is truly so difficult not knowing what to expect.  I am sure you will hear the comment that you need to treasure every moment, it is true beyond belief.
