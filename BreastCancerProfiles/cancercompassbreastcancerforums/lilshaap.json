    "Content": "Hi, Rybar5:  I was just diagnosed with lobular breast cancer 2 weeks ago (Nov 18).  I had an all clear on my yearly mammogram in March, but in June I saw an indentation in my breast and the nipple was starting to invert.  I went directly to my GP, and she sent me to an ultrasound (clear) and then an MRI (clear).  So, she said to wait and see.  In October I suddenly felt a thickening in my right breast.  Back to the doctor and another ultrasound.  This time, she could see it and feel it.  Off to the surgeon for a biopsy.  The surgeon did a lumpectomy that proved to be lobular cancer.  What she took out was 7cm, and the borders were not even clear.  So, I'm going back to surgery.  What I'm trying to say is: follow-up.  Don't wait.  My mass was big and now I'm really nervous about the surgery where they will see if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.  Ten percent of cancers don't show up on ultrasounds, mammograms, and MRIs.  Pursue this, please.",
