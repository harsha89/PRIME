    "Content": "I have tried tamoxifen and arimidex for post chemo & radiation treatment for stage 1 ibc. The arimidex made me so tired, depressed and horrible joint pain. I'm supposed to try aromisin next but I can't get myself to start taking it. I've read they don't know the long term effects of these drugs. Anyone else dealing with this? The chemo was horrible but I'd say these drugs are worse.",
