    "Content": "Hello survivors and fighters!  I need some help.  My local hospital is having a bra decorating contest as a fundraiser. My friend and I are decorating a bra with the \"You're my Healer\" theme (song by Kari Jobe if you've never heard of it it's awesome!!!). Our bra will have crosses all over it and on each cross we would like to write the favorite bible verse of those who have survived breast cancer or are currently fighting it!  Please email me or comment here with your favorite verse, first name, where you are from and if you are a survivor or fighter!  I think this would be such a special entry to dedicate to any and all of you!  I will post a picture of the bra once we finish.  We received an honerable mention last year, we made a coconut bra look like a monkey and called it Boo-B Bananza!  It was super cute.  Thank you!
