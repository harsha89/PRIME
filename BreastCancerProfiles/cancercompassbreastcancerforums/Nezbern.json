      "Content": "Hi Pattit, My tumor was 2.0 they did a lumpectomy . However, 2 days later I had severe swelling. The surgeon went back in to relieve the pressure and since she was in she wanted to take more even though she had clear margins. Well, when we got the results back I had more. They called it DCIS , which is pre cancerous. They recommended a mastectomy . I did only 5 rounds of chemo. I had a very hard time on the 5th round. My whole body felt sore to the touch for a week. In December I had a double mastectomy. I chose to do a double for many reasons. I have herceptin until August as well. it's been a few months since I have been on femara. At first, I had severe cold and hot flashes back to back. But now things have calmed down. I don't have them hardly at all... My biggest problem now is my fingernails. They are breaking past the nail bed and very thin.i take many supplements to help my body recover. My last chemotherapy was November 22. It's amazing how long this chemo stays in your system.. on q positive note, my hair is growing back yeah! I would appreciate it if you could keep me updates as well... Any natural alternatives etc? Thanks, Inez",
