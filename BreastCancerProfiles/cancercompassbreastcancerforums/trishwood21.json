    "Content": "Hello. I have Stage 3 breast cancer, due for a Mastectomy in a few weeks.  Three or 4 lymph nodes were involved.  I have responded well to chemo, the tumor has shrunk quite a bit.  If cancer is found in my nodes during surgery, I need to decide whether I want a full dissection or a partial- only taking the nodes that have cancer and leaving a margin of them behind.  The possibility of lymphodema really scares me, as does the possibility of recurrence if I don't have them all removed.  Anyone have any insight on this? ",
