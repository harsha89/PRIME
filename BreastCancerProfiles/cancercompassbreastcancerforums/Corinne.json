    "Content": "Hi, My mother is diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. The tumor went from her breast to her under arm lymph node. I have two questions: 1)She is set to have a full body PET scan and an MRI. Are the injections painful for these? Is there anything she can take to dull the possible pain from the injection? 2) Is the prognosis of invasive ductal carcinoma generally good or poor? Thanks for your advice... Corinne",
