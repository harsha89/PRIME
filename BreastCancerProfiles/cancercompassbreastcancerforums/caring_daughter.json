    "Content": "Hello, I know that you and your sister are scared about getting or having breast cancer. Does your mom or an aunt or a grandma have breast cancer? It is super important that as young ladies you take good care of yourselves. Learn how to check your breasts for lumps. Talk with a grown-up or a doctor or a nurse about how to do this the right way. You might feel embarrassed, but this is important for your health. Ask about getting mammograms at an earlier age because this is a type of x-ray that can find cancer cells before they can be felt. It is important to ask questions because this is the only way to get the information that you need. All questions are good ones. Breast cancer can be found early (especially if your are feeling for lumps every month and having the exams that the doctors recommend) and can be treated. I know this is scary and it took a lot of courage to write to this message board. If someone you love has been told that they have cancer, it is scary. A lot of us know what you and your sister are going through. Take care, Rondi",
