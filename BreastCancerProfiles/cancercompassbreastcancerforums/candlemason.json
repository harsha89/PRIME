I have been cancer free for 2 years. I was on Tamoxifen for the two years, and tolerated it ok. More recently I was put on Arimidex, but after reading these blogs, I am concerned, should I stay on this or go back to Tamoxifen? well I'm no expert but I do a lot of research and what I have read about Tamoxifen, I think it has the worse side effects of the two, one being that it is a carcinogen.  I would stay on the arimidex if you can tolerate it.  I wish I could as I have so much bone loss and joint pain already, I just don't want to make it worse.  I've decided to forego all hormone blockers and go the natural route.  It's a risk either way, in my opinion.  So frustrating!  Congratulations on being cancer free for 2 yrs.  I'm only a little over 4 months with stage 1 bc, double mastectomy and no lymph node involvement. But I have totally changed my way of life with organic food, nutrition supplements and juicing so I'm hoping for the best :O) ",

An going to see my Onc for a check up on Monday 21st and intend to tell him I no longer want to take these tablets. From what I read, it prevents co-lateral cancer, but on the other hand causes cervical and even liver cancer - seemingly a no win situation. 6 months ago I had to visit a gynae, on the Onc's instruction, and had to have a d & c, whih apparently was due to the tablets?! I am of the idea now that I shall just let matters take theri course and what will be will be. I am in the same boat at you Jaqueline except I have only taken 3 mos of Arimadex and my joints started aching bad so I stopped it because I am osteopedic and my mother is pretty much bed ridden at 85 because of bone issues.  I investigated tamoxifen and I'm afraid to take it because I too read that 6 page report and very concerned about my liver due to other medical issues I have.  I have an appt with my onc on Monday and I have to discuss my options/decision, etc..  I want to totally STOP taking any drug and use natural means to reduce estrogen via my nutritionist.  But I'm afraid.  I just don't know what to do. I had bi mastectomy in January 2012 with Stage 1, grade 2 papillary with micropapillary pattern (which is very confusing to me as papillary is slow growing and micropapillary is invastive and aggressive). Maybe time for a second opinion...but seems like doctors don't want to know about natural means and they don't consider the side effects of these drugs to be a deall-breaker in making the decision of taking the drug!",
