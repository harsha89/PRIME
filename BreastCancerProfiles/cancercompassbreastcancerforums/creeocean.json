      "Content": "Hello,  I'm new to this site. May 9th was my one year anniversary.   On May 9th I was informed that I had stage 1 BC.  Three short weeks later, on May 28th I was informed that the BC had metastatised to both my lungs after a routine CAT scan was conducted.    I was treated with 4 FEC-100, then 3 taxotere.  both treatments reduced the nodules on breast and lungs.  I then went on herceptin [once a week] for 8 weeks.  Unfortunately the herceptin didn't work.   I am now on my 4th FEC-100  with 2 more rounds to go.   Again the some of the nodules on lungs are reduced.   After the FEC, my doctor recommends a break from chemo.  But I am scared.  If herceptin doesn't work, what other protein options are there.    Any body out there in a similar circumstance.  ",

      "Content": "Hi Jodie. Thank you for replying to my message.  I hope your pet scan shows improvement on the lungs.   The chemo treatment I have been on is F=flourouracil, E= Epirubicin, C= Cycloophosphamide. I have been told that I have multiple tumors on both lungs, In my mind I imagine it would look like measles.  I never asked to look at the scans, coward that I am.  I don't think I could handle that. I really hope that the herceptin works for you.  I will keep you in my prayers.  Once again thanks for the info.  Donna ",

      "Content": "Hi Marcia.  Thanks for the info about tykerb.  I will be looking this up.  I am glad to know that there is something more then herceptin out there.  Its too bad that this drug doesn't work for everyone.  On a more positive note it looks like the FEC is reducing the tumors on the lungs again,  I wish I could have an operation, unfortunately that is not an option for me given that there are multiple tumors on both lungs.  Right now, the course of action is to stop the tumors from growing and hopefully to push it into remission.   I pray that you keep well.  Donna  ",

      "Content": "Hello.  I am looking for ladies to have a discussion with that have mets to the lungs.  I have been on chemo since being diagnosed in May 07 except for a brief period when I tried Herceptin, which unfortunately didn't work for me. According to the pathology report the cancer is HER2+ estrogen/progestron negative.  Six weeks ago, I caught a cold, which I haven't been able to shake.  It starts to go away then comes back on at least three occasions.  what is worrying me, is that a few months ago, the oncologist asked if I had a cough. At that time I didn't but now I do.  I am worried that it may be more than just a persistent cold.  I am going through staging now,  I had a CT scan, and will meet with the oncologist this upcoming Monday to discuss the results, and the next steps.  My question is has anyone dealt with a persistent cough/cold?  Any words of advice.  Hoping to hear from someone out there.  Thanks.    ",
