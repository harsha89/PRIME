    "Content": "It has been six months since my Bi-Lateral Mastectomy.  I began with symptoms of frozen shoulder, burning in the armpit and tightness in my chest, shoulder, arm.  I had a feeling of numbness, and with each movement of even my fingers or arm  would cause pain.  I have shooting pains that come out of no where and my body jerks. Sleep was difficult because of the constant pain. My surgeon never heard of PMP and is in denial.  I had a rotator cuff surgery that was unneccesarry, as they found that it was frozen shoulder. I see a pain specialist and get steroid injections about every five weeks.  I also take Neurontin. I haven't been able to return to work.  I am just trying to find out if there is relief down the road.  Mostly I want awareness that this syndrome does exist.  I have been pretty much alone in this process.  Most of the articles are outdated and no one is speaking up.  I am one voice.  Are there others out there that have had similar experiences? Thanks for listening. csb",
