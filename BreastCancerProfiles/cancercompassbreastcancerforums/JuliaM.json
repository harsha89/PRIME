      "Content": "Hi I was recently identified as a high risk for BC (LCIS and Atypical Hyperplasia). I had 2 surgeries in past 6 month and I am kind of fed up with it. I am considering having a prophylactic subcutaneous mastectomy done in a near future. If anybody had this procedure done I appreciate if you answer my message. I have just basic questions like how long is the recovery and such but my doctor is not being very supportive.  Thank you  ",

      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Lobular Carcinoma and had a surgery. I was told that even if this is a benign condition I am more likely to have Breast cancer in a future. Two months before my diagnosis I had my first baby and so now came time to get life insurance.  I figured it would be a slam dunk because I'm very athletic, never smoked, don't drink, don't work, no history of any cancers in the family, etc.  The Lobular Carcinoma was my only health issue ever, and  its now fixed.  So I thought I'd get the best rating which is \"Preferred Best\".  However I got 3 ratings lower \"Preferred\" based only on my condition.  The premium is more than twice the price. So now to my questions: Has anyone had a similar experience ? Has anyone found a life insurance company that does not consider this a major issue (20 year term policy) ?",
