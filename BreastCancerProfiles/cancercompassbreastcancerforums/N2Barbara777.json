      "Content": "Hello, I also took this drug, and it made me eat a lot. It made my heart beat very face and made my blood pressure go up a lot. My doctor told me not to take them too long because it affects other part of your body. So I stop taking them. The drug has a lot of side affects, my stomach is so big with swelling, you would think I was 8 months pregnant. I can not eat too much, it will begin to hurt. I have lost so much weight. And cannot eat like I want to. I hope this has helped some one.",
