    "Content": "I happened to catch your 1/07 message regarding vaginal atrophy, and I do commiserate.  I have vaginal atrophy as a result of ovarian cancer surgery I had 6 years ago at age 37.  I thought I would pass on this link which mentions a new drug for breast cancer patients with VA that you might want to check out.  Perhaps you have heard of the drug, which I believe is called ospemifine.  Just looking on the web the other day, it looks like there are other new drugs for the condition, so perhaps things are looking up for us.  Keep a look out, and check with your oncologist about this one.  Course, I realize I'm sending this a year after your post, so maybe you are more in the loop about this than I am.
