      "Content": "It's kind of a double-edged sword when someone you love has been suffering with cancer for a while. I know for my step-father I was releived on one hand he was out of pain, that my mother could once again start taking care of herself, but then there's the devastating void their absence makes. It's very hard and my heart goes out to you. Perhaps you could journal some of your pain? Or take a picture out of your sister and talk to it and try to have more closure. Channel your grief perhaps into something good, raising money for others going through cancer, keeping yourself healthy so no one else in your family has to go through this again, a healing fund in her name to help others in your community with the financial devastation a cancer diagnosis can bring, volunteer to take someone to treatments or bring them lunch during chemo.....I send you healing thoughts. Love, Casey",

Something else is going on that they are giving her this I suppose. I would suggest taking a good probiotic along with all of this.I had Stage IV non-hodgkins lymphoma so I don't know a great deal about BC, other than from the ladies in my support group. Â ",
