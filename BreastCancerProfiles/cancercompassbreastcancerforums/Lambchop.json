      "Content": "I had an early stage breast cancer almost 10 years ago. I had no problems! Them my doctor took me off Aromasin in June 2011 and by June 2012 I had a recurrence. It's been terrifying! Faslodex is killing the cancer but now that it has metastasized to a small part of my lung it's not curable. I just need encouragement. I am 100% ER positive and was told by my new oncologist I should not have been taken off the anti-estrogen drugs because I was BRCA2. The doctor that took me off was in Birmingham, AL. The new doctor is at Duke. He seems so much more knowledgeable. Is there anyone out there who has had a recurrence and doing well?",
