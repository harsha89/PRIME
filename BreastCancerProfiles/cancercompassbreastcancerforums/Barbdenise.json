      "Content": "Hi everyone. I had breast cancer in 2008 and have been feeling fine until recently when I found a lump in my neck. I have had a biopsy and blood tests and waiting for the scans. I am terrified especially as 2 of my children are still young and one has autism. I feel despairing. I really need encouragement to fight. HELP",
