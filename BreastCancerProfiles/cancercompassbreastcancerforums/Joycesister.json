I have had a rough year but I consider myself well, maybe for just a little while, but who knows, so little is known about this type breast cancer that you must do a lot of research for yourself, go online to the American Journal of pathology. Prognosis not that good without treatment so think many times before you decide not to take treatment. I was like the typical cases listed, my lymph nodes were clear, but that is the way this cancer acts. If you are interested I will give you more research information. I am also estrogen negative so no pills are needed. can you tell me where you went to research. my sister was diagnosed in 6/2007, went through chemo, and now it has spread to her brain.  thanks",
