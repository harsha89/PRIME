Hello there! This is the best place to come for \"advice, support, anything....\"  Everybody who comes in here has experienced what you are feeling now, or knows someone who has.  It is a good place to have a good look around to see how people are feeling and coping. Are you working?  If not, try to watch crap daytime tv or dvd's, anything to stop you thinking about Friday.  I found reading didn't really work as my mind would start wandering off! Do NOT google!  I really mean it.  There are some frightful stories/sites out 'there' that could scare the pants off of anybody! As yet, you have to find out the whole situation, and then assess it.  There is absolutely nothing you or anybody can do about it now, this very second, minute, hour or day until you/they know more - so please try your best not to be nervous or worry.  Bliddy difficult innit?!  I find humour a good way of coping - so maybe phone a friend or email someone you know will make you laugh - it really helps. Deep breaths, have a warm bath and try to chill.  You only have one whole day to get through.  I find knowing exactly when and what is happening incredibly helpful, and you do, and it is not long. All the very best to you and all, and please let us know how you get on.  Any questions, just ask! Andrea",
