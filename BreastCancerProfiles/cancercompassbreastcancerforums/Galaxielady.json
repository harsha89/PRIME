I had been on Femerra (l'etrazole) but the side effects, nausea, diarhea, and joint and muscle pain were debilitating. I certainly don't have the nausea and diareah with A but I am tired and seem to feel quite down. I am experiencing some pain in arms and hands. It seems by reading through the messages my symptoms aren't that uncommon but I am so reticent to complain again to the doctors. I suppose I think I should feel lucky to be alive.  As anyone tried acupuncture or other non-drug interventions to handle the side effects?  elle0   ",

      "Content": "In April of 2005 I had a lumpectomy. Fortunately I did get clear margins so I only had to go through radiation.   Because my cancer was HER2 hormone receptive my doctor prescribed Arimidex.  I am 78 and have been on Arimidex for 2 1/2 years. I consider myself fortunate not to have many of extreme side effects I know other women to have.  I do attribute much of this to a supplement I drink called Xango. I first tried this fruit juice because of the  aches, pains & fatigue I attributed to Arimidex. Combined with the antioxident properties of the mangosteen fruit from which it's made I felt that it was well worth a try.  Overall I have been feeling much better than most of the women on Arimidex who have postings on various forums and really feel it is due to the Xango juice.  Just a though I wanted to share.",
