Are there any other hodgkins surviors who have had the same experiemce. I am not sure if I will have chemo or not. I had SO much 20 years ago and have heart isuues. I also had mantel radiation so that is not an option.. Just wondering if anyone else is in my situatiuon.   Hi - i'M SO SORRY you've got this to deal with. My wife has just had a full mastectomy after what turns out to be metaplastic carcinoma returned following a lump excision in Oct 2006, which obviously didn't see it off. her oncologist is currently considering whether further chemo might be helpful. She had FEC and (I think) taxotere first time. She's very positive and optimistic, but it's so hard. Will let you know what is decided/recommended as soon as we know.   ",
