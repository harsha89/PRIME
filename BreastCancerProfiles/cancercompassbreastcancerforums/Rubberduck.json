    "Content": "Hello, my sister 45 has been fighting breast cancer since nov. 2004.She caught it very late a stage IV. Now she has it in the brain and lungs after having the highest dosage of Chemo and radiation. A very fast spreading type of cancer. 16 tumors on her brain right now and having a very difficult time breathing (even with oxygen).She is starting to hallusinate and talking about things that don't make any sense. Her husband has to be away from home for 6 hours during the evening and I will be there to help her. The Doctor gave her 2 months to live ,that was 2 weeks ago.I'm hoping that she makes it at least that long (if she's not suffering). I'm not ready to let her go!!! I guess my question is to anyone who has went through this is do you think that she will make it 2 months with her breathing as bad as it is and the hallusinations that she's having.I can't find anything on the internet that will give me any indication that this might be indications that this could be signs of her last days. I just want to prepare my self because I don't think it has fully hit me that my sister is really gonna go. Any advise about anything would be helpful right now. How can I help her? What can I say? what to exspect? I'm lost!",
