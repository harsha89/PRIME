Hello there...ive just joined and looked on this site..because I too am wondering whether to carry on with the Arimidex as the aches and pains and stiffness seem to be getting worse the more months that I take it...I`ve been on them 8 months now and I`m just trying to weigh up my odds with the lack of quality of life with the risk of cancer coming back...i`ve noticed you wrote your message in 2006 did you carry on with the Arimidex ??...and how are you now???",
