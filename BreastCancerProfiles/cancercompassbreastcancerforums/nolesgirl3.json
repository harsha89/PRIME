      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am 29 years old and last week my gynecologist found a lump. I had my first one at 18, which turned out to be a cyst. This one feels completely different, so I had no idea that I had it even though I do regular self breast examinations. Since the lump was found, I have had an ultrasound and a mammogram, which both detected microcalcifications within the lump.  This has all been such a whirlwind for me because I never expected to be faced with the possibilty of having breast cancer since I have no family history of breast cancer, and I am very active and healthy. I do not smoke and only drink occasionally. I am also confused about some of the information that I have been given. The general surgeon I am assigned to said that I have a moderate to low risk for cancer, but since I have an \"increased\" risk, I have to have a biopsy done. These two statements seem to contradict one another, so I do not know how to feel about all of this. Has anyone had this told to them before?  For now, I am just waiting until I hear back from the radiologist's office for the date they have scheduled for my biopsy and am trying to remain positive. ",
