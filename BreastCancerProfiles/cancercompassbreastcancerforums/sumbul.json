      "Content": "Hi My mother also had a severe case of lymphoedema and skin lesions. I first saw the appearance of reddening after she started Novalis Tx Radiotherapy in December.  In January I noticed small lesions on the operation scar and which grew into crusty lesions whoch later on had yellowish discharge. We used Hydrocortisone for dressing but it only made it worse. Try cleaning it with spirit and warm water, nothing else. I wish your mom recovers soon! Ameen. I lost my mother on the 3rd of March, she had been fighting against breast cancer since 2007. All the Best to u and your family, my prayers are with u all.",

      "Content": "My mother underwent 24 cycles of this latest, painless and supposedly side effect free radiotherapy beginning from 23rd november 2010 at Apollo Hospital New Delhi, India. She was a breast cancer patient who had undergone several cycles of chemotherapy as well as had a mastectomy, radiotherapy and more chemotherapy including Avastin. She also underwent Ixempra Chemotherapy and suffered severe side effects, spent one whole month in barrier nursing at the hospital. Starting from 31st july 2010, she was given chemo every week, and she bravely faced it. On 23rd novemeber 2010, the latest radiotherapy was started, we were very hopeful that since it was painless and side effect free or so the brochures and the doctors claim..... But after the 3rd dose of radiation, she started developing swelling on the left arm as well as the neck, her left breast was where the mastectomy had been done. The doctors assured us it was just my over imagination. I as a caregiver tried to convince them but in vain.    ",
