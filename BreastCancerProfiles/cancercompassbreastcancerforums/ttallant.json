    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy last April.  Both breasts were removed down to the chest wall and my breast bone sticks out  in the middle!  My main problem is my right arm where 16 lymphnodes were taken out.  I have tightness and pain under my arm and top of the arm.  I have found that coconut oil helps so much with the tightness on my chest scars.  I will start radiation in January 11' when I am done with taxol.    I chose not to have reconstruction and have not regretted it at all.  If it wasn't for the arm pain I would be home free!   I excercise my arm almost everyday, but in the evening it starts to hurt.  I believe it will get better!!!!    ",
