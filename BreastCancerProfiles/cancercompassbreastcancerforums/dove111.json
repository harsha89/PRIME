The onc. said it was more to prevent it from developing in my contralateral breast. I had partial mastectomy and radiation and as far as I am concerned, the osteoporosis and total depletion of estrogen (I had a full hysterectomy 5 years ago) will simply dry me out faster from the inside out- perhaps affect my late term mobility- also cause insomnia and depression in addition to weight gain isn't worth the risk of breast cancer for me. It has to depend on what your chances are for recurrence or new disease. I intend to choose a healthy active lifestyle with pure foods and good exercise. Has anyone heard of Drs. getting kickbacks for prescribing drugs. I would like to believe Drs. have more integrity than that but I have heard some push the drugs for rebates they get. My recent mammogram was clear.  I have one every six months.  The thing is I tolerated the Arimidex for 2 years and accepted how I felt.  But the third year, the side effects became intolerable.  I've decided for now to stay off of it and try and get my body back to some kind of healthy.  I have no idea if this is the right decision or not.  I'm not willing to risk my other organs to who knows what! Thank you all for your feedback as I am glad there are other women struggling for answers.   dove",

I struggle with my decision, but after weighing all the pros and cons I decided for me that I need to have a healthy quality life right now.  Of course anyone of us can have a reoccurrence.  Another issue for me is that they really don't have any long term test results for the long term affects of Arimidex.  We can only make decisions based on us as individuals.  That\u2019s one of the hard parts for me.  Meanwhile I\u2019m living life and enjoying every bud that grows and bird that sings, every moment of every hour.

And some, like me, tried only a few doses and said \"Uh unh - I ain't doin' this.\"  If you look back through the messages on the breast cancer forum, you will find dozens of concerns similar to yours. Be patient as concerns the weight loss - it will happen, but it will take time. The weight gain was quite possibly due to severe estrogen suppression.  Taking Arimidex chemically produces just about the same effect as if you had had a hysterectomy and your ovaries removed, or had gone thru menopause.  More women than not report that they gain quite a bit of weight after hysterectomy - 50 pounds is about the average.  (I speak from personal experience!!)  And just so many women report weight gain when on the anti-estrogen drugs. This seems to be the body's attempt to increase estrogen in the body. Fat cells produce estrogen - the more fat, the more estrogen - so the body starts gaining weight by increasing fat storage.  It will take perhaps 6 - 9 months for you to metabolize and totally eliminate the arimidex from your body.  As this process occurs and your body goes back to the estrogen production that would be normal for you at your age and reproductive status, your system will less and less perceive the need to maintain the extra fat cells for estrogen production, and you should be able to start losing the weight.   If you make sure to incorporate lots of cancer-fighting foods - like cruciferous veggies and fresh raw fruit - in your diet, that will also help balance out the effects of the arimidex.  Many foods like broccoli, asparagus and brussel sprouts are also very gentle natural estrogen regulators.  Also increase your exercise as tolerated, as the side effects of the arimidex begin to lessen.  make sure to focus on gentle, low impact exercise, such as walking or swimming  - this will help to strengthen your muscles and bones without overstressing your joints.  It also increases metabolism.  Make sure to drink lots and lots of fresh pure water.  The body absolutely has to have it to promote weight loss, and for healing from the detrimental effects of drugs. You might consider getting a rebounder (a 36\" mini trampoline.)  It's wonderful exercise for weight loss, and you can start with very gentle bouncing and work your way up to a more vigorous routine as your body heals.  This is an especially way for women who have had lumpectomies or mastectomies to exercise, as it promotes lymph drainage in the arms and breasts. http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Sincerely, Tre Thank you Tre,  You message is very encouraging as I went to the oncologist this week and when I told him I was going off and why, he just sat with squinted eyes and stared at me for the length of my conversation.  When I was finished I said so what do you think?  He responded with, what can I say?  Would you consider trying tamoxifin and I said no.   When I left the office, I was second guessing my decision for awhile but have since made peace with it.  I east losts of fruits and vegetables and drink lots of water.  In that respect I'm ahead of the game.  I will continue to work on losing some of my body fat slowly and love myself in spite of it. Thank you all for this site.  cindy (dove)  ",
