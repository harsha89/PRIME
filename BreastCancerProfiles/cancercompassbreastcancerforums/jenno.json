      "Content": "In response to the last posting, the type of cancer I was diagnosed with was INvasive Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma and surrounding comedo intraductal carcinoma, grade 3. That sounds horrible and it has been but I am strong and even stronger willed. I just went for all my three month check ups and all is well. I pray that lasts. Good luck. Thanks for writing back.",

      "Content": "Hi, my name is Jennifer and I am a thirty eight year old stage three breast cancer survivor. I have survived one of the most aggressive cancers. I pray that a cure will be found to stop this cancer from coming back. There is hope and my prayers have helped me survive chemo and 33 rads last year. My body does not look the same but I am still me. I have learned to enjoy simple things, especially time. Remember to take time for yourself and be with your family all you can. Also, thank God every day for giving you strength and determination. Good Luck everyone. My prayers are with you.Â ",
