I am sad to read all these stories but i'm having a real difficult time coping with my own. i'm 23 yrs old and was diagnosed with breast cancer (IV stage) it has spread to my lungs with constant coughs and pain in the chest and lower back areas. i'm due to start chemo in 2 days. A little scared, worried, upset (all the words to describe pain and anger). what's weird is i'm so young and it's hard to wrap myself around the idea that this is happening to me. ...",

Please and thanks guys Sorry, but it's not that simple. The chemo drugs are very strong/toxic and designed to destroy bad cells and it just takes it's tool on nice little hair follicles. I have seen hundreds of cases where I volunteer and what I always advise, is not to shave your head but only cut your hair short enough so a wig will fit better. You need to wait to see how you do. Not everyone looses their hair or maybe it will just be thinning out. I would start to investigate wigs that look like your real hair. The wigs now a days are very, very good. The hair is just beautiful and fine. Here are all my personal notes: http://liveforeverwithcancer.com/ \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://liveforeverwithcancer.com/ \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://liveforeverwithcancer.com/ Please write, this community will take care of you and give you great love and support. My Best to You John thank for the heads up. I've lost my hair before (during chemo) its grown now and i'm loving it. i really don't want to loose it again. and i don't like wigs Â ",
