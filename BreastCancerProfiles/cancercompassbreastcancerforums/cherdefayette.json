      "Content": "I am writing this in hope to lift someone in spirit that may feel as if they got a grim diagnosis. I was 48 years old when I felt something on my sternum. It was Oct. 2012 and the mass was the perfect shape of my sternum and felt like bone over bone. I am from Georgia and was in Florida with my brother as I had separated from my husband due to his  severe alcohol abuse. The doctor did an ultrasound and a mammogram. I had two tumors in my right breast. I returned home to Georgia to be near my family and on 12/12/12 I had a right masectomy. I had 26 lymph nodes removed and 9 were malignant. I did chemo , radiation, lost my hair. I was due to have the left breast removed and to start reconstructive surgery in June 2013 but in fear my husband was going to cancel my insurance I begged my surgeon to take the left breast off now. While they were taking the breast off my lymph nodes lit up. Once again they removed over twenty lymph nodes and I had 13 malignant. I had a nickel size tumor that was not there 8 month prior. I had to start more chemotherapy, radiation and lost my hair AGAIN :(. The divorce saved my life as this was an entire separate tumor of its on, I had two primary tumors. both breast removed . 22 chemo treatments 75 radiation treatments 22 lymph nodes malignant, hair loss twice tissue expanders placed and then removed from a bad infection. I had all this complete in 18 months. I was stage 3C with both tumors. I was sick and broken hearted. There were times when I wanted to give up. There were times when I was sick of being sick.  I felt I would never come out of this. I have letter in my bible for my three daughters Today I had my 9 month CT scan. I was told at my 6 month scan that they were watching nodules on my lungs. I had yet to have a complete blood profile that was normal...until today.... I am cancer free and my bloodwork was perfect and there are no nodules on my lungs. I looked at the paper and it said I was disease free. I have read so much on this sight but have yet to respond or write myself but something urged me tonight to share. I feel there is someone who has got the news and you are as scared as I was. I hope that my good news will bring you all hope in your situation. Never give up hope. Fight knowing you are going to win and share with others your happiness.  I start my reconstructive surgery on May 21. May God Bless You All. Cher~ Atlanta GA.",

I will go in the highend shops and try them on for style and then I purchase the same exact style on ebay. I would be more than glad to send you some links. The best wig I have ever owned I paid 10.00. It is a long blond with light curl. I handwash it in woolite and it spings back like new.",
