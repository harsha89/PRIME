    "Content": "Zelda, I'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. My mom has metastatic breast cancer and she's been taking Xeloda for about a month now. I have read great things about this drug but it's expensive. My mom has some weakness with it and very little appetite. She doesn't really like it but she has no other choice. She gets a weeks break from it and gets a little energy back. Karen",
