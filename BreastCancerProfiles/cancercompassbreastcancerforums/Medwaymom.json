    "Content": "Good Afternoon,  I am a 45 year old women that was diagnosed with Stage 3 Breast cancer 4.5 years ago and 2 months ago learned it is in my bones, plureal fluid, pelvis and lymph nodes on the right side -- I am taking femera (no chemo right now).  The best way to approach it is with a positive attitude -- write down your questions and question everything.  You are your own best advocate.  If you are nervous about talking to a doctors, bring someone with you and even bring a tape recorder so that you can \"hear\" it all again when you can focus better. ",
