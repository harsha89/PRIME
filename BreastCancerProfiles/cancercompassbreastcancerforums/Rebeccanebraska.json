    "Content": "Hello.  I am new here. I had my 1st mammo. 2 weeks ago.  I have silicone implants, no history of BC in myself or my family. The mammo. showed \"vascular calcifications\", the radiologist marked \"probably benign\" on my copy of the form and I was told to come back in 6 months for a repeat mammo.  6 months seems like a long time to wait to me.  What do you think?  Does anyone have any experience with vascular calcifications?  I cannot find much information on this on the net.  Thanks so much for your help.
