      "Content": "I am doing great. I try to maintain a positive attitude through all this. I am coming up to a close on my second week of radiation therapy. I needed a nap only today and one day last week. You know one thing that has been frustrating that I keep forgetting to mention is I cannot find anything to wear that is cute. All the summer tops and dresses are spaghetti straps. I cannot wear those because of this big bra that has to fit the breast prosthesis in. I have a few bras but none are strapless and the straps are fairly wide. I also cannot wear anything with a vneck or scoop neck because all the markings they put on me for radiation. I also like to swim and do water aerobics but the prosthesis is always floating from underneath my swimsuit! I am not complaining but those things have been challenging. Don't get me wrong, I am not a fashion guru or one that has to have all the latest styles I just like to look like I am 26. Do you have these same concerns?",

      "Content": "Hi Christy, I was diagnosed in Jan 2005 with bc on the right. I am 26 years old. In February I had a mastectomy and started chemo in March. I had 6 out of 10 positive lymph nodes. 4 tx of Adromyacin and Cytoxan and then 4 tx of Taxol. I had a pet scan two weeks ago which was negative and have just completed 1 week of radiation with 6 more weeks to go. I am blessed and doing very well now, however it was not always this way. I know that I am healed, (through prayer and faith) and I will have reconstruction probably in September or October. Please reply so we can talk further and I can find out how you are doing. Cherrell",

      "Content": "You did not do anything to deserve cancer. You did not do anything right or wrong we just have to go through things like this to be a blessing to someone else who has a similar situation. Change your thinking. Say something positive to yourself everyday. Read encouraging books. If you think you are sick, you are. If you feel like giving up, you will. If you believe you are a survivor, you are. Since my diagnosis in January 2005, I would not allow myself to think negatively, even when I was very sick. I am only 26 and instead of worrying why me, I decided to learn what can I do to get through and help someone else. Hope this helps. Feel free to contact me directly.",
