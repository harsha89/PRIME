    "Content": "Go to a place like bath and body works and get samples if possible of different lotions. place a blot of the lotion above her upper lip and see if she can tolerate the smell.  If she can, do this every time before she eats a meal.  This smell will allow her to eat the food and not have the bad taste of the food.  The problem with this is that you may have to go through several lotions before she can tolerate one.  You may also have to switch up after a period of time when her brain is no longer fooled by the smell of the lotion and her stomach becomes upset again.  My brother-in-law tried this when he go through his treatments for colon cancer.  He has stage 4.",
