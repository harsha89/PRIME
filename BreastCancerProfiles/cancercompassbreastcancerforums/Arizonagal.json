I have a very sensitive stomach and also have mitrial valve prolaspe(mild). Also strokes run in the family..does anyone know which one might be better for me.. Would like to know what the side effects are on both drugs.Tryed fermera before  and gave me really bad body pains and aches.made dr's think i have fibro myalgia so it makes it worse they say. So now my dr.prescribed tomoxifen i am scared to take it  due to my stomach pain recently waiting for my stomach to feel better then i am going to try it.. Please let me know what side effects are from fermera ,tomoifen and arimadex.. Thanks !  I had a very low oncotype DX score stage I breast cancer. There was no lymph node involvement and yet it appears to be standard protocol to recommend Femare as an ancillary follow up to radiation. The Femara website lists the side effects as mild to moderate. I strongly disagree and I am working toward changing the FDA approval for Femara as the standard for all breast cancer cases. The side effects were beyond moderate, they were insidious, I went from slowly regaining my strength following radiation fatigue to taking Femara and finding myself with symptoms ranging from a 40 pound weight gain, elevated cholesterol count, hot flashes that could generate a small country and the worst of all; the symptoms that mimick rheumatoid arthritis. I have made it my mission to go online and contact as many women as possible regarding this drug and trust in knowing I am not alone in this experience. I took the medication from the end of Oct. - mid March and I have still not fully recovered. Some web pages indicate there is some discussion among oncologists that some of the side effects are irreversible. I know these drugs save lives, if you have no other options then you have nothing to lose. It simply stymies me that this particular medication actually stays on the market. It has already faced on class action suit when used for infertility. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!  ",
