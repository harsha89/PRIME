      "Content": "So, if I am understanding you correctly, I can request a lower dose radiation than would typically be administered.  Same drugs at lower dosage.  Since my cancer is hormone negative so can't be treated quite the same way as hormone positive, the drugs that are used can cause some side effects that are quite severe.  My surgeon said that she believes that the cancer had not spread, but as a safeguard and to lower the reoccurance possibility, chemo would be the proper protocol.  If I could request lower dosage, that sounds like a perfect solution to my dilemma.  Did I understand you properly?",

      "Content": "I have been diagnosed with Stage 2 - Triple negative.  Tumor has been removed along with 18 lymph nodes.  Tumor size was 2.8 cm, 3 lymph nodes affected.  Not sure about chemo - worried about the risks and the fact that it seems that reoccurence is likely to happen with this type of cancer even with the chemo.  Question would be - are there alternatives?  Something natural that has been successful in treatment.  i have heard of a new type of chemo that is completed in a week or something like that.  Does anyone know anything about this?",
