    "Content": "Diagnosed in July with Stage 1 invasive lobular carcinoma; lymph nodes negative, Estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive.  I begin (intensified) radiation therapy next week, for a 4 week course.  Also recommended following the radiotherapy, Arimidex plus Zometa, which should counteract some of the bone-loss problems.  Has anyone else been recommended this combination?  Any hints about what I can expect in terms of side effects from this intensified radiation regimen?",
