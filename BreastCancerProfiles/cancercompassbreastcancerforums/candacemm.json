      "Content": "I'm living the same nightmare.  I finally decided to \"stop\" at 550 ccs of saline per breast, so that I could rush the process.  Scheduled for implants Dec. 29.  I'm absolutely miserable and have found that driving is the worst thing, who knew all the chest muscles involved in turning a steering wheel.  I'm taking a LOT of ibuprofen and have been drinking lots of wine... I hate to have it come to this but the wine relaxes the muscles and aside from vicoden (which isn't an option forever) is working better than anything else.  I hope someone comes on here and gives us some advice.  For now, bottoms up.  Good Luck!",
