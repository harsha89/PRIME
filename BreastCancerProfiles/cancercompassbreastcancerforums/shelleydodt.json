    "Content": "Yes, there is a cooling cap called the Penguin. You can lease them and they freeze up your scalp so the chemo doesn't get into the hair shafts. I have heard from women who barely lost any hair through chemo. I heard about this at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium from Dr. Hope Rugo, an Oncologist at the University of California in San Francisco. Good luck and I hope you get to keep your hair, going through chemo is hard enough.",
