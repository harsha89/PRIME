Things are going well, we did get funding from the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (that's why we limit to breast cancer patients) and we have been getting great results! Increasing quality of life and decreasing pain and helping women understand what they can do for their self! We also offer acupuncture, yoga, meditation, and nutrition classes!
