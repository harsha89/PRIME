      "Content": "I have had breast cancer and have been down the track of chemo.  Whatever symptoms you have at all, even if they seem trivial, mention them to your team - the ones who are working with you to resolve the cancer.  It is a good idea to be virus free before you start the chemo as chemo knocks down your immune system and it can be hard going if you get a cold or flu during that time. I had two episodes of colds and it was a tough time, and even in the bleakest period when I didnt think I could go on, I did.  The tiredness I also had and it was related to the cancer.  You have to be kind to yourself and if you feel tired rest, even if it is just sitting down with your feet up. I know this sounds odd, but when brushing your teeth use a childs toothpaste or a sensitive toothpaste as this minimises the risk of getting mouth ulcers.  Also brush the back of your tongue - right up the back.  Yes you will gag, but you will also be surprised at what rubbish can be stored there and this too can give you a phlegmy cough. Also keep your fluid levels up as you will find that you can have trouble swallowing due to a dryness in your throat and mouth.  I hope this helps.  Take care and remember that you can do this and always stay positive no matter how hard it may seem.  You never know, you may be one of the lucky ones who just breeze through the treatment - my cousin did.  We were both on the same treatment and I had a rough time (I am sure that psychologically I wanted to get the full experience), yet she found it easy - I must admit that I did curse her a few times yet her cancer was far more advanced than mine! Take care and remember to take each day as it comes.  Love Amanda",

      "Content": "I too am on Arimidex.  I started off on Femara but changed after 6 months as I found it too hard going.  The Arimidex is not as bad for me, but the side effects can be horrendous.  I just try and rationalise it with the thought of what will happen if I stop the meds. I take glucosamine with chondroitin for the joint pain - 2 a day as this builds up the tissue between the joints - you must take it for 3 months before it gives any significant relief. I also get the headaches, swelling, burry vision etc etc.  I had a brief change on Tamoxifen and loved it as I felt back to normal, but the oncologist was not happy about it and I had to change back.  My risk factors were too high on Tamoxifen.  Just be kind to youself and take it easy. The alternatives to stopping the meds are not great.  Love Amanda",

      "Content": "I too have regular tumour markers done - mine are the CA 15.3, but in my form of cancer these markers are unreliable as my cancer is a nonsecreter. The specialists get into action when your levels are at 30 or higher, but up until that point, they can fluctuate depending on how you are feeling at the time.  My oncologist relates it to being a butterfly in a bottle, it can drift up and then down without staying in one place.  If you are stressed (and who wouldnt be at a time like you are going through) they can read higher ( I had this happen when my son was critically ill), but the best barometer is how you are actually feeling.  Always relate how you are even if you think something is silly, it may not be. Let them know if you are having night sweats, any aches or pains or changes in how something feels.  It all gives them a comprehensive picture to work with.  Take care and my thoughts are with you - remember only you know how you really feel.  Love Amanda",

      "Content": "have you been checked for lymphoedema of the arm? I had a similar thing recently in my right breast and had this removed as it was painful and fixed but very ropey feeling to touch.  It turned out just to be scar tissue that had formed and attached to my chest wall.  It was quite frightening at the time, but after having it removed and tested as a safeguard, was all ok.  I too had lymph nodes removed from under arm and in the information given to me at the time, was told to keep an eye out for any ropey feeling lumps as it can also be normal and part of the healing process. Try gentle massage and some heat, but if concerned about it and you dont seem to get the \"right\" answer from your GP, get a second opinion.  Good luck and my thoughts are with you, Amanda",
