    "Content": "I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer on 10/24 and had surgery on 11/4. Chemo is scheduled on 12/2.  I understand your feelings and pray for both you and your wife.  The Lord gave me a word at Church about 3 weeks ago and all my fear was taken away.  I know the Lord will comfort, strengthen, prepare both of you for this journey. May He fill both of your hearts with His peace, His love and His wisdom.   RA755 ",
