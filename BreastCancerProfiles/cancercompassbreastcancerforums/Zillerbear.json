I had an ultrasound that showed a cyst and also an area of shadowing that was of great concern to my dr. I had a mammogram that showed \"something\" but I don't have the official report yet. I saw my surgeon again yesterday who did another u/s. The cyst is gone but the area of shadowing persists. He said if the shadowing is related to the cyst then it should resolve itself. He wants me to come back on Mar 1 for another u/s. If the shadowing is still present, he will do a biopsy.  I asked him if he thought this was a malignacy and he said he didn't know. He also said he is not comfortable waiting any longer than a month to see if it is resolved. Just curious if anyone else has had \"shadowing\" on an u/s and what it meant for you. Thanks for your help. Linda Hi Linda, I just received a letter from the place where I had my mamagram done and apparently they have found something and they want me to come in for a ultrasound.  I suppose I'll be doing this within the next few days, so I'll let you know what happens. Boy...  This stuff is not any fun at all.  Especially since I received the letter on Friday and Monday is a holiday, so I have to worry about this for a few days before I can even begin.
