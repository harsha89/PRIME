    "Content": "I have only been on this med for a little over 2 weeks and already it seems my arthritis, which became worse with chemo, is in every bone in my body. At first I thought the fatigue was just the chemo still in my body and I need to give it more time, but this fatigue is crippling. I hate to think things will become worse. I was told by my oncologist I will need to take this for 10 years. I'm really trying to stay positive, but it's difficult. My friend said my body just needed to get used to it, but after reading your post and many like it I don't think tha's true. The nausea is also something I had hoped had left w/chemo. I'm not to upset about that, it's mild and who wouldn't love to lose a few lbs.",
