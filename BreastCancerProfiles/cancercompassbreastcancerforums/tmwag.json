    "Content": "my sister had hodgkins lymphoma in her left lung for which she received cobalt radiation.  she was 21 at the time (1974).  sorry to say, but she died 10 years ago due to the radiation. it continued to radiate and scarred her heart and lungs to the point they could no longer work to keep her alive as they became stiffened.  she had a bypass and valve replacements due to the scarring.  she died in 2004 at 51 from a heart attack.   it was a great loss, but the treatment gave her 30 more years of life.  today they have learned to use much safer radiation therapy therapies (but it can still have long term effects).  your mom sounds like the therapy has given her many good years.  if she's having problems, don't wait - find out why while they can maybe fix them.  i wish you well!",
