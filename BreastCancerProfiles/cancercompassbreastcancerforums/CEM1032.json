    "Content": "I have been on arimidex for almost a year and am having the itching problems--my scalp and arms for a while but now my back, too.  The only other side effect that is giving me trouble is the joint & muscle pain...arthritis problems intensified.  But, the itching is really giving me fits.  Do you know if there is a lotion that helps more than the run of mill ones?",
