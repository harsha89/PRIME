    "Content": "I have cancer in both breasts; stage 2 in the right one, stage 3 in the left one and lympthnodes.  I started chemo in Oct. 2008 for 18 weeks -- one 3 1/2 hr. treatment every 3 weeks.  It did not get rid of all the cancer. I finished that on Feb. 6 2009 and after 2 weeks I had a double mastectomy, all the lympthnodes on the left side were all removed. The surgeon left a few cancer cells because the tumor was semi-attached to the chest wall, and it would endanger my life to take them all out. After 4 wks of healing I started radiation which will last for 6 weeks, 5 days a week.  I'm half way thru that. What I want to know now is what happens after radiation. What's the chances of radiation getting rid of the cancer or not. And what if it doesn't???? Would like to take to someone who has been in this sitation or similar to it.",
