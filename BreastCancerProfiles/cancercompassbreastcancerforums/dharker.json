      "Content": "Hello.  My BC was also ILC too.  I did have one node involvement so I did chemo, radiation, tomaxifin and letrozole.  My cancer treatments put me into post menopause.  I am 54 and was on letrozole for 5 years.  I was able to control the joint pains by exercising, specifically running.  My issues were/are hair thinning and hot flashes.  Good luck with your decisions - they are tough to make.  I had to make many along the way.  I still am not sure if all of my decisions were right or wrong - I suppose time will tell.",

      "Content": "Hello - I stopped cold turkey.  I was on it approximately 5 years.  Stopped in May of 2018.  Can't say I feel any different.  I was hoping that my hot flashes would have subsided and, like I mentioned, my hair would stop thinning out.  But, nothing yet.  Still have terrible hot flashes.  Maybe it's just me.  I'm 54 so it may now be due to my age... who knows...",

      "Content": "I'm wondering if anyone has experienced hair loss with letrozole.  I am now off of the drug (been off for 1 month) but still am experiencing hair loss.  My Onc told me hair loss is expected with letrozole  but I thought it would slow down and it has not.  Also, still experiencing hot flashes still.  I was just hoping these side effects would stop.  Anyone else have the same issues?  ",

      "Content": "I was on Letrozole for 5 years.  I also did appx 3 years of tomoxifin.  As far as the aches and pains - I did start out with them, but took up running and they completely went away.  My onc really recommended that I exercise as she believed excercising really helps many people with the joint pains.  Just to let you know, you should watch your bone density with Letrozole.  It decreased mine and therefore I went on Prolia to up my bone density.  It did seem to work, but who know what else it has or will do to my body. Yes, I was post menopausal when I start Letrozole, but the chemo and meds put me in post menopausal state.  I was 46 when I was diagnosed.  I'm 54 now, so maybe some of my symptoms are due to my age... Good luck with your treatments and recovery.  It's quite a journey.",

      "Content": "I was on Letrozole for 5 years (same medicine as your Arimidex) and did not really experience joint pain, but terrible hot flashes and hair loss.  I have now been off for 30 days and still haven't seen any changes for the better.  Matter of fact, I feel like my hair is falling out even more.  I also have dry skin issues and didn't think that it was related to the letrozole, but the fact that you mentioned dried skin got me thinking that it probably was/is the medicine effects.  I am 54.  It's just depressing to think even after all of the medicines and treatments we endured, we still have complications even when we stop the drugs.  I'm not sure what to do about the hair loss.  It's very frustrating. ",
