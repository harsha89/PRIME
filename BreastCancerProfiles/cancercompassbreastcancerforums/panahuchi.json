    "Content": "I was just prescribed Xeloda for my metastatic breast cancer, but I am concerned with the dosage.  I am supposed to take 4 500mg tablets, plus 1 150mg tablet, twice a day (after breakfast and dinner) for a total of 4,300 mg of Xeloda a day.  Is this right?  Will somebody please answer me asap, as I am about to start taking it.",
