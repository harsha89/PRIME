    "Content": "I had one nipple invert 3 mos ago.  My Mammo was normal, Ultrasound normal.  I was told to get professionally fitted for a bra, which i don't think has anything to do with this sudden onset.  I really felt like this appt with the surgeon was a total waste of time, I don't feel this is normal and I need some opinions on where to go or what to do next.  The CNP also told me that i should be concerned when most of nipple is inverted. thankx",
