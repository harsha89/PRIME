    "Content": "Hello Chelle, I was diagnosed in May 2009 with Triple Negative BC.  I had 4 rounds of A/C and 4 of Taxotere, followed by a bilateral mastectomy.  I opted out of doing post chemo radiation, just because I felt like I had been through enough and had already gone above and beyond what was necessary to fight it.  So far I am cancer free < knock on wood> and looking forward to every new day I have without it in my life, besides as a memory.  I did have horrible hip pain for the first 5 months after chemo but sometime in the last couple of weeks, it completely went away.  Why?  I don't know.  I do know however that I am ectatic that it is gone.  It makes you feel so OLD when it hurts just to stand up from a sitting position.  So, I guess what I am saying is there is hope of that going away.  Today, it's been just over 6 months since my last chemotherapy treatment and I am finally pain free.  :)",
