    "Content": "Hi Marcia.  I was very encouraged by your post.  I have had cancer return 4 times and it is still regional (Thank God!!!!) in my chest nodes.  I am not sure what grade that is; however, I am taking taxotere and I am hoping for a miracle like you.  Two years in remission is awesome.  Are you taking any meds for breast cancer now?",
