    "Content": "I'll have to agree that mammagrams are not particularly pleasant, but \"torture\"?  It is an unpleasant occurance that lasts a mere few minutes - worse for some than for others, I'll grant you, but I find it incredibly sad that woman who should be getting regular mammagrams are \"freaked out\" and terrified because they listen to stories about how horrible it is.  If you can find an easier way to get your breasts screened, do it, and good luck to you.  If you can't, for goodness' sake schedule a mammagram, and don't listen to the doom and gloom naysayers who like to frighten people.
