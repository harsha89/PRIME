    "Content": "I am a 17.5 year breast cancer survivor. I also went through genetic counseling testing for BRACA upon recommendations of my MD. I don't remember the cost. However, I will tell you that my gynechologist told me that because I am estrogen receptor positive, if I had the breast cancer gene, it would be recommended for me to have my ovaries removed. Interestingly, I did not have the gene, even though I had breast cancer so I did not undergo the surgery.",
