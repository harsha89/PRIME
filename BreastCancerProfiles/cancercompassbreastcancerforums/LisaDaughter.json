    "Content": "Hi Linda, My mom (71) has been fighting cancer in various forms for over 5 years! started from Lung Cancer then into bones (shoulder, hip, pelvic)...what an ordeal.  WE were so scared (THAT is REAL FEAR when you start accepting that someone you love has a terminal disease.) She has been thru so much, the care in Charlotte, NC at the main CMC Oncology Center is absolutely the finest I've ever seen.  The chemotherapy (taxol) has kept her alive with a decent quality of life (she was outside gardening last summer) for 4 years--that is amazing considering they gave her 6 months to live.  In hindsight she now knows that she would NOT have let them do radiation to her in areas near her neck or throat (it really destroyed her esophogus and it's been hard to eat ever since (years).  Radiation in the shoulder - no problem and no 'metal taste' that prevents them from eating ANYTHING other than 'ensure' for weeks.  So be careful and really think about radiation near vital organs and eating /elimination areas--they will be effected--kind of like 'welding them shut or raw'.  Seems like outer areas /bones don't create that horrid metal taste that kills their appetite. ALSO VERY IMPORTANT IN HINDSIGHT.  The lungs are going to fill with gelatinous 'stuff'...draining that off with a needle and getting a liter is is great.  I wouldn't recommending doing this dangerous procedure even 3 times (2 is IT).  My mom's lung was punctured (very common I now know) and that has given her such a hard time, the lungs will fill up over and over, so that's one discomfort they will have to learn to get used too...don't get punctured 6 times to pull of fluids...the procedure is toooooo risky. over time, so it's a wake up call to get ready to get used to feel the FULLNESS...it's coming anyway.  A punctured lung is a NIGHTMARE  She did great with chemo...4 years of it now...1x weekly .she always tried to have food on her stomach AND get that nausea medicine IN HER hours before the chemo would start.  I think she mastered it! The cancer is in her shoulder bones now very painful, the radiation halted that pain ni the first 5 sessions....but this summer in CHarlotte has been very dry and mom hasn't moved around much in the house, so she was DEHYDRATED....the dr/s brought her in for 2 liters of fluid for the dehyd. WOW that turns out to be TOO MUCH and she swelled and got pneumonia in her lungs overnite, fever, panting for breath, awful...exhausted from low saturated oxygen over nite.  I got there at 8am the next morning adn immediately called the wonderful people at 911 (which I have never used before)  they carried her out to the ambulance and to the ER and within 3 hours flat , they had her stable.  That was Saturday  8.25 and she's been in the hospital since BETTER but still 'gasping' for breath. Now it's Wed nite 9pm and she's had low level morphine drip since noon  so she can eat, is coherent totally, just worn out from the battle.    You'll know when you Mom is just worn out and please don't hesitate to start the low level morphine is your family member has extreme extended significant breathing problems (PANTING for hours) JUST DO IT. and in 3 hours you'll see a peace and a feeling of 'control' come back over the patient---that they haven't had if they've been fighting to breathe. So she could pass away tonite in her sleep (Dearest God keep her in your arms and best care please) or she could linger a few days.  I'm so lucky we had her this long and with this quality of life...friends, good dr's AND NURSES  and HER ATTITUDE made the difference. Her Sat oxygen saturation levels are now 80 to 85.  The morphine has relaxed her so that she can breather much easier ( a blessing for all of us) but the sat oxy levels will continue to drop and I saw the scale of what happens as the o2 sat rate falls from 95 to 90 to 85 to 80(mental impairment, still no slurred speech)  to 75 etc and to fatal at 65-50. That helped me to understand what is happening to her body and mind and what to expect.  There is no slurred speech etc from the morphine like you might think, but  there is relaxation and an in ability to react to a decrease in mental capacity (kind of like being drunk/groggy and just not worried about little things going wrong).  Well, time is short now, she is in the hospital on level 10 oxygen and morphine so I'm praying her into heaven all nite and hoping i'm back there to hold her as she passes.   My heartfelt wishes for peace and endurance to any of you that are going thru this or are family members going thru this. I'm glad I got to spend quality time with my Mom over the past 4 years--talk on the phone , take small trips etc.  It's been a dream . Thanks Dr. Frennette, Patty of Chemo at Carolinas Medical Ctr, Dr. Yute, all of th nurses",
