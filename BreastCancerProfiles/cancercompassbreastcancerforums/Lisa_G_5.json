    "Content": "Yes -- I did have message thearpy when I was going through Chemotherpy. It was wonderful -- my insurance denied my doctors request for this treatment, so I was only able to afford four messages. It was worth every penny. The chemo-body feeling, tension and stress associated with treatment is difficult for someone who has not experienced it to understand. The relief that I experienced is something I feel every one going through cancer treatment could and would benefit from. Good luck on your grant proposal -- if I can answer any more questions -- let me know.",
