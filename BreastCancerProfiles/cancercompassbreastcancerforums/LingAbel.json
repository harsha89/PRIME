    "Content": "I do feel for you,  I also have a seroma under my armpit. My Surgeon drained it with a needle last week and it felt great to get rid of the balloon shaped lump I'd been carrying around with me for 5 weeks.  Unfortunately in 24 hrs the seroma came back.  I was told to call my surgeon's office if this happened which I will do.  The procedure apparentley may have to be done several times,  or a drain can be inserted for a period of time.  Either way its one of the most uncomfortable and worrying aspects of the surgery.  By the way I've also been on antibiotics for 10 days as occasionally an infection can result. Good luck and keep us posted on your progress.  ",
