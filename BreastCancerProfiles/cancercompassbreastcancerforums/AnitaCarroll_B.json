    "Content": "Please don't put off having a mammogram and/or ultrasound. At your age, nipple discharge is more than likely something other than cancer (ie: infection, etc.) but, better safe than sorry. We don't do mammograms, generally, in young women because breast tissue is too dense, and some doctors will even recommend an MRI instead of a mammogram. Best wishes to you for your diagnosis.
