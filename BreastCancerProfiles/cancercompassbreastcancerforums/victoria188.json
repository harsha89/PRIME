      "Content": "October is Breast Cancer Awareness month... like we don't know that\u2026right? I think we should take this month to give back a little, to what helped us so much. When the breast cancer come to us, we could do nothing. But we could do something before it comes to prevent it. Just read a ton of articles in http://breastcancer.dormitory.com. I appreciate this website and am grateful for the opportunity to learn and share at their web site... gentle huggggsssss to all!!!",
