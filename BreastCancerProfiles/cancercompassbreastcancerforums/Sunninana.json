    "Content": "I had my radical Mastectomy 4 weeks ago and still have a LOT of swelling under my arm where my drainage tube was. The tube has been out almost a week now--The surgeon said to call him if I thought I had a problem--Is this swelling normal for a while or should I have it checked--I start my chemo this week my tumor was 4.5 also had some lymph nodes removed--just wanted to know if someone else had swelling for a while Thanks Caroline",
