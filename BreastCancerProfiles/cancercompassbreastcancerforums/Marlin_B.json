    "Content": "Teresa, The most important thing that you can know and understand about cancer, or any disease is that you are in control. I will not say you made the best decision to stop your treatment but I understand your decision. Each person must decide for himself or herself what is the best option. I have watched many people go through great trial and tribulations in the treatment of many diseases. I have witnessed the recovery of some, some even miraculous. I have also watched people fight for their life with all their might and loose the battle. When I was diagnosed with cancer I went into research frenzy. I looked up everything I could learn about my cancer. I went to the doctor armed with questions and decisions. I have thyroid cancer. There are four types of this cancer and I had learned before they even operated that there was a possibility that I had the worst cancer, which has a prognosis of only six months following diagnosis. I explained to the surgeon that if this is what he discovered, he was to close me back up and send me home and I would contact hospice when I got ready. I was blessed in that I had the least destructive kind of thyroid cancer. I have had to go through two operations and two radiation treatments. I have made the choice each time based on what I believed was the best option. The point is that you have to make your decisions based upon what is best for you. No one else can do that -- not your doctor -- not your mother -- not your spouse -- not your children. Talk to them. Read and study then decide. Know most of all that there is life beyond cancer. Your eternal life will not be altered because of your decisions about how to treat your cancer or the results. God loves you and is reaching out to you and nothing can separate you from that love. God Bless, Marlin B.",
