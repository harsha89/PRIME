Although I try not to dwell on the possibility of recurrance I find that sometimes I worry a great deal about the cancer coming back.  I also think at times that I want to stop arimidex due to the side affects which I live with daily. Does anyone have input to , or share my concerns??  Please respond. I just stumbled upon this website this morning and am hoping it is a good place to be.  Friends who have not shared my experience cannot relate to my feelings on these matters.  A brand new product specifically developed for metastatic breast cancer was just approved this week   It is called Ixempra.  You might look into it!  Best wishes in your renewed battle.",
