So blessed to turn  .  In prayer 5 times a day.  I pray that God continues to give you and your DH the strength to get through each day.  May I ask what illness your DH is living with? 2 more days till results...Hi , my husband has a blood cancer , it's cancer of the \"B\" cell which is the immune system. It is called waldenstroms Macroglobulinemia . I often say if I did not have faith I would have nothing. He became symptomatic in 2009 and was diagnoised with this cancer. Thank you my friend for your prayers and I am praying for you as well. God Bless, carolyn",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, when my husband was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer in 2009 I could not go to enough support groups . One nite I walked in one group and I introduced myself and said \" my husband is dying with a blood cancer \" well I made a huge mistake because I was corrected right away by the leader saying no \" your husband is living with a blood cancer\" .....and that is how all the group felt because they all had one thing in common \"HOPE\" !!!!!!

Perhaps you could tell me alittle more about agape love . I know it is a love like no other and I remember thinking how wonderful it was to revisit a word I had forgotten so long ago. To know someone who has such love is a true blessing I think . thank you as always, Carolyn",
