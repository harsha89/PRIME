Because of her unfortune conditions, they would assume that is what you are supposed to do.  The most unbearable part is the disrespect and blame of \"how come you did not do for me while I am cancer striken?\" or \"now you really wish I could die sooner!\" Those words can be heart breaking and humilating!! And few people in the supporting commnunity would imagine that. They assume that is the normal emotional reactions from a breast cancer patient.  I observed from my own experience, from when I grew up to now, that many women who ended up with what they and their family labelled as \"the Hunch of Notre Dame\" often disrespect their husbands.  These women feel that life is unfair to them and their husbands naturally becomes a daily reminder of their not being able to marrying a more successful man in life. These husbands, then, become wifes' psychological disharge toilets.  And loving and sacrifing would not reverse that.  To make things worse, a woman's family could either instill or support this psychology.  Most parents love their children.  After their children's marriage,  these love could easily turn into bias.  It is just human nature.  Some parents, family always feel what their children have done and sacrificed but only knows or sees( instead of feel) what their spouses have gone thru.  It is just too easy to make conventional conclusion on thier spouses like \"uncaring jerk!\".  Nobody would put that on their own children.  Have you seen any? I just found myselfing overwriting before even touching the my relevance to this site.  My wife, too, was diagnosed with breast cancer.  It was in Jan 2009.  I had the unappreciation, blame and dispectst, too, like you underwent.  I am too the only bread maker in the family but my wife supported my tuition during my master's degreee.  Our relationship is not a sunshing one for the 15 years of our marriage. I was thinking about divorce before the diagnosis. But now sudden came the diagnosis.  I decide to stay married rather than being an \"uncaring jerk\" since she is dependent on me for medical insuarnce.   I, too, got the blame that I picked the wrong insurance and I was criticized as not caring that much.  At work I am going thru the pressure to finish a project and I have to use work time to make appoints, change physicians, call for test results and accompany her to tests.  And when I talked back when she labelled me too stupid to find a good parking spot in front of Target, she threatened not to let me go with her for the next appointment.  She sighed constantly in front of me that she had been so unlucky all thru her life and never had been happy putting blame of unsuccessful marriage, of course, all on me.  When we in quarells, her mother questioned me why I shed tears on the night of diagnosis. She must have though I was being pretending.  Pretending for what? Blame from community/society, I admit, can be the last straw on the back. I feel that you and me are esssentially  different from those who walked from their wives shortly upon diagnois.  But hey, in the society, who cares about the difference between \"uncaring jerks\"? My husband, has kidney since Nov.of 09.We have been married for 15 years.He use to spoil me rotten.The frist time he hurt my feelings,was after his first surgerie,I cry like a baby,call my son,call my best friend.Now he is getting better.I love my husband with all my heart and  soul.But,I wish he would hold me more and tell me everything is going to be alrigth.I have to cry in between work and the house,cause he doesn't like it if I cry.Cause he just say{its what it is and except it} but I miss my husband to spoil me.Am I being selfesh? I just want him to know, its hard on me too.Now I have 2 jobs,just for him not to worry about the bills.I have put myself in his shoes, how would I feel if it was me with cancer. So no you'll are not uncaring jerks.One day my husband said he was worry that I would leave him,I told him my feeling were hurt cause by now he should know what kind of person I am.For better or worsed!! Take care I wish you luck.",

My darling friend of 33 years passed away April 26, 2008.   Frankly I am still numb no one ever expected her to pass Laura fought this disease for 10 years she always believed that she could beat it. Two weeks before she passed she was still reading labels and wanting to know about every medication and side affect before she put that med in her mouth.   Her courage and strength are unremarkable we all learned so much from her. My sister, Laura\u2019s best friend put together an incredible slide show honoring her sister friend of 33 years now she has taken in Laura\u2019s 17 year old son to ensure that he gets a good education and stays on track with his life he is a remarkable young man. At her service he said \u201cI am everything I am because my mother loved me. She educated me, she taught me about music and life, she loved me unconditionally and she led me to God\u201d.  Her husband\u2026well lets just say he has moved on already\u2026   At times I am at peace with her passing because I know that she is not in pain then there are times that I am so overwhelmed with grief that I fight back the tears. I have gotten physically sick to my stomach at times when I think about the fact that she is not here. My heart aches to hear her voice and hear her laughter.   I know that she has her dancing shoes on and I know that she is dancing, smiling, singing and laughing with joy because she is finally healed mind, body and soul\u2026and I know that she is in Heaven.   You would have loved her\u2026   To those of you fighting this battle and for those who have lost a loved one my thoughts and prayers are with you.   Maria   Laura Sunset April 26, 2008 Beloved mother, daughter, wife, sister, and friend...in our hearts forever... My prayers are with you and her son and everybody that knew her.Stay strong.                                     Rally 53",
