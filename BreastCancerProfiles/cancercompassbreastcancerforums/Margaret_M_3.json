    "Content": "I have metastatic breast cancer. I'm not sure what stage I am but I had a routine CEA test in April which was elevated. After scans, a small tumor was discovered in my right lung. I am now beginning my second cycle of Xeloda and may be starting Taxotere in the next few weeks. I just had a CEA today and hopefully the results are lower. Hang in there, every week new drugs are being developed.",
