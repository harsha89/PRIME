But, it will be a fight. But, for now, just get through the bx. Everyone else will have to wait in line for their turn. As the old lady said to the bill collector, I put all my bills in a hat and the one I pull out I pay, if he didn't leave her alone, she wouldn't put him in the hat next month. Cheers and best wishes. I am a 12 year survivor and as everyone has said, my husband was my rock.",

      "Content": "My experience has been the same. I remember that I told my surgeon that it shouldn't get out that radiation firms the breast. He said that gravity would win. Maybe when I am in my 90's. My  cancer breast is still higher and firmer after 12 yrs. and I am 68. I do a lot of stretching exercises, but there is definitely a lot of scar tissue. The numbness all seems to be gone though. Best wishes.",
