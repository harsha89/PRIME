    "Content": "Just found this site while looking up Aromasin to see if joint pain was one of the side affects. I sat here in shock at all the women suffering from what I thought was old age pain. I say old age, but I'm only 39. I had stage 1 breast cancer at 36. I had lumpectomy, AC chemo and 30 radiation treatments and 2 years of tamoxifen. I suffered from bad leg and feet cramps on that. My period returned and my dr. told me to have my overies removed. I did and I'm now post menopausal at 39. So, now I'm on Aromasin and feel like I'm 90 when I get up in the mornings. And the pain is now on and off all day. I have not had to take anything for pain YET. I've only been on Aromasin for 6 months and wonder just how bad the pain will get. Also wonder if this pain will continue after I'm on it for  3 years and stop taking it. I'm thinking of not taking it any more. Is there anyone out there taking it after having their overies removed? I think I would like to know what percent this is making for me in keeping the cancer away. I have two young children and want to stay cancer free, but at what cost?? I welcome your thoughts. Thank, Beachgirl",
