      "Content": "I had breast cancer in 2004 and had a lumpectomy followed by treatment. By 2014, my breast was so scarred from radiation, biopsies, markers, etc. that they could no longer get a clear picture with mammogram or ultrasound. Since I am genetically positive, I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with expanders put in place at the time of the surgery. When I came out from under the anaesthetic, every muscle in my back was spasming and flames were coming from my chest. I asked them to schedule the removal of the expanders at my post op appointment. They told me to wait a few days. That was September 3. When I called them the next day I was given a surgical appointment for October 23. The muscle pain and the burning have never stopped for even a moment. I researched and found the expanders I had have a nickel plated magnet in them. I am very allergic to nickel so I had convinced myself that was the problem. When the nickel comes out on October 23 the pain goes away. After finding this site and reading the many similar stories, I know now it is probably not going to be solved that simply. Any help, advice, encouragement you can give me will be appreciated. I don't suppose I can hope we are all allergic to nickel?????",
