      "Content": "I have suffered breast cancer at my youth, 20-year-old. At first I had severe pains in one of my breasts, and there was also a some-what large and hard lump in the same one. However my other breast seemed perfectly normal. I don't know if this had anything to even do with it.I went to the doctor, I would like to know what this meaned, and if it meaned that i might have breast cancer. Was it even possible to have breast cancer at age 20? Fortunately, I went to the doctor and get an accurate diagnosis and correct treatment. I am fine now.I have paid 200% attention to breast health and how to prevent breast cancer.  breastcancer. dormitory is one of the websites I stick to and it help to update me with the latest breast health advice and relevant videos.",

      "Content": "  Prevention is better than cure. Just read an article in breastcancer.  dormitory. It mentions that Smokers And Overweight Women Are At Greater Risk Of Breast Cancer. Gosh .I will give the damn smoking and keep fit right now. I don't want to put myself under high risk of breast cancer. Share the article as following, hope the smoker and the fat like me will learn:   A recent study published in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology has reinforced the correlation between being overweight, smoking and breast cancer. What makes this study unique is how test subjects were not diagnosed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, which predispose women to breast cancer. Instead, women with such gene mutations were excluded to allow researchers to concentrate on lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise, nutrition and weight.",
