    "Content": "I am 28 years old. I was diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer in March. My tumor was about 1 cm.  So far i've gotten through 4 rounds of TCHP, but these past two have been a nightmare. Nothing is controlling the nausea and vomiting. I'm currently prescribed Zofran and Adavan, when that stopped working they called in Promethazine. It somewhat alleviated the nausea but it makes me feel too loopy to function.  As much as I want to finish the 6 rounds, i dont think my body will tolerate it. I'm currently searching for comparisons of 4 versus 6 rounds.  Does anyone have any links to comparisons of the two? I want to approach my Dr about stopping at 4 but i want to have some statistics of my side. I think it will also make me feel better about my decision. Thanks!",
