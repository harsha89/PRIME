    "Content": "\"CANCER PATIENTS DESPERATE AND UNMET NEEDS ARE EVERY BIT AS RELEVANT AS CANCER RESEARCH AND DESERVING OF EQUAL FUNDING AND EQUAL ATTENTION.\" Cancer patient's advocate, Carol Anne Clark, 2007. After a valiant seven year battle with breast cancer, outspoken cancer patients advocate and humanitarian, the late and beloved Carol Anne Clark succumbed to her illness on October 22, 2011 at just 53 years of age. Anyone who has experienced a run in with any form of cancer or knows someone who has suffered extreme hardship due to the debilitating and accumulative effects of mankind's most feared of all diseases will want to read this moving story, see Antelope Valley Press article, October 22, 2012 and Santa Clarita Signal magazine's December 2012 issue).   From her days as a Girl Scout, Carol Anne Clark was a voice for those most vulnerable in society, especially those void of any influential representation. As an engaged member of her community, Carol gave generously of her time and money to numerous charitable causes, (see Malibu Times article, March 21, 2013). This was what defined Carol as a human being, always paying it forward, there for everyone and never seeking the limelight or anything in return. Despite her poor health, Carol took her role as a cancer patients advocate seriously and felt it incumbent upon her moral compass and tenacity to draw attention to the not so pleasant demographics of cancer and those that reflect the tragedy and human cost of suffering and hardship in America and the serious ramifications that extend far beyond the patient. The consequences of cancer oftentimes bring catastrophic financial ruin upon a cancer patient and their family, including American families being displaced from their homes as the direct result of a loved one's cancer. Carol discovered that these are the American statistics which no one wants to talk about much ... a segment of the American populace who for ideological and other rationale have been isolated, marginalized and all but abandoned by society, left to fend for themselves, their genuine concerns once again void of any influential representation.  Carol had identified a serious lack of REAL and MEANINGFUL resources and quality of life Patient Care Support Systems that were proving a primary contributing factor with respect to the fiscal ruin of cancer patients and their families. Despite many in the mainstream cancer establishment and health care industry advocating that the appropriate resources exist to meet the needs of cancer patients and thie families who have fallen on hard times, Carol and many of her fellow cancer patients established that nothing could be further from the truth. As Carol discovered for herself, navigating the labyrinth of resources and referrals in order to qualify for assistance and stave off financial ruin can prove a nighmare in and of itself, especially if one is a homeowner. Moreover, when an experienced social case worker exhausts every resource and referral known to them, you know there is a problem with the system. Carol's research had also identified a serious funding inequality with respect to cancer patients desperate and unmet needs as opposed to the billions of dollars raised in the name of cancer research annually, over a trillion dollars and counting since President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971.   In Carol's efforts to shed some much needed light on the desperate plight of the cancer patients and their families who she was identifying, the lack of REAL and MEANINGFUL resources and quality of life Patient Care Support Systems and the vast and disproportionate funding with respect to cancer patients desperate and unmet needs, she wrote literally hundreds of letters to just about every cancer related society/foundation, philanthropic institution and government health agency in the United States.   Alas, Carol's compassion and advocacy for others, including her findings and observations did not go over too well with the mainstream cancer establishment and healthcare industry. Despite Carol's diplomatic overtures, many did not take kindly to Carol advocating that \"Cancer was not merely about research but also about the tragic human cost of hardship and misery and that there needed to be a healthy balance with respect to funding cancer research and also funding Americans with cancer who were being made destitute and oftentimes homeless as the direct result of their disease. Moreover, while all this was transpiring in the richest nation on earth, many in the mainstream cancer industry were getting rich and living lavish lifestyles, much of their wealth derived from the wallets of hard working and generous Americans.\" Unknowingly, Carol had touched a nerve in the Achilles heel of the cancer industry and in the process found herself at the center of much controversy as she took on the cancer industry and all its powerful players single handed.  Carol was deeply saddened by the enormous disconnect being demonstrated by the mainstream cancer industry and healthcare industry combined and their unwillingness to even acknowledge that a problem even existed. Carol was even more dismayed to discover that unlike the United Kingdom's Macmillan Cancer Support annual Report, not a single major U.S cancer organization had initiated one in-depth social study that would identify the human cost of cancer in America and the untold hardship. Not a single in-depth social study that would provide data and information relating to the scant and inadequate resources and quality of life Patient Care Support Systems. Not a single in-depth social study that would provide data and information germane to the numbers of Americans being displaced from their homes on an annual basis as a consequence of a loved one's cancer. This set of morally and perplexing circumstances presented Carol with a difficult conundrum as to whose priorities were most pressing, those of the living and made destitute, or those of a cure that has somehow managed to elude the world's finset scientists and researchers for decades? Out of all the multi faceted unmet needs that Carol identified, she pinpointed housing as the most basic and critical need. Carol thought it crucial that a cancer patient and their family be provided a beacon of hope, a safe harbor, a real place a family could call home. A place where children would have a back yard to play in, where a loved one be provided a sanitary environment and the opportunity to heal without all the added stress and anxiety of worrying how they were going to pay the rent or mortgage. Most importantly, in the event of Hospice Care coming into the picture, a place for a loved one to expire on their own terms, in peace and comfort and with a sense of dignity every human being deserves. Carol's heartfelt advocacy and compassion for others continued right up until she took her final breath, assuring that her beautiful home and that of her devoted husband's be utilized as a template for the first Carol House ... the rest is history.
