      "Content": "Hello just started this morning.  Was looking for help with the skin burn due to radiation.  I am being treated for left breast cancer in radiation as of now.  skin burn under arm pit, under breast and on back shoulder blade.  Have been using the silver but as I see that may not be the best alternative.  I have 13 more treatments left so I may try some of the suggestion on this site.",
