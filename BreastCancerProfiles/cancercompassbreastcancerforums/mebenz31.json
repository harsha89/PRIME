      "Content": "HI again, I am sorry I over reacted, its just so soon after my dad's death,and I dont want anyone else to suffer the way my family did. I agree with kay, you cant compare pc and bc,but,I would still seek  a second opinion asap.  My dads pc was caught so early they told him he would be the poster child for pc and he did not even need to finish his chemo. Few people live to tell the tale about surviving pc. I wish you well and again I hope I didnt worry you.  ",

      "Content": "Hello nic72806, Are they kidding? 5 weeks? Thats horrible! would they make their mother,sister,or daughter wait that long? PLEASE find someone who takes their job seriously.  My dad died of pancreatic cancer in november and 5 weeks would have offered him a cure.  That was the difference between operable and inoperable! Time is valuable when you are talking about cancer dont be foolish and put it off not even 1 day! GOD bless.",
