      "Content": "Hello, I am a Swedish woman, who due to very dense breasts, nipple discharge, and great imaging/biopsy difficulties with newly found mass, have been offered to do PBM. I will start with one breast, asap. My mom died in brain tumor, and my hubby doesnt really understand, so I find it difficult asking a buddy to travel from Europe to USA, as a support person is required by the surgeons., day after surgery. Having removed an ovarian tumor/hysterectomy , I feel fine on my own. Are there any volunteer groups I can contact in USA. Best wishes.",
