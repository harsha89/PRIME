      "Content": "After perusing this blog covering several years, I see no mention of the BEST relief for pain caused by aromatase inhibitors... VITAMIN D!!! Within 3 weeks after I started Arimidex 3+ years ago (concession to the Cancer Life Police), I experienced excruciating joint pains - not my norm - and found good information about using vitamin D to relieve joint pain caused by this class of drugs. I got some and combined with the D in my multivitamin and calcium, I began taking 2800+ units of vitamin D per day. WITHIN 5 DAYS I noticed a marked difference in the pain and now I have hardly any pain at all!! I did back up on the dose once and the pain returned. Now after 3+ years my dosage is around 2500. Please consider vitamin D as one of your options for control and elimination of AI caused bone pain. Also, 1(one) regular aspirin 4x per week will keep general body inflammation down, and it's good for your heart! :)",

      "Content": "I am now about 5 months away from my 5-year mark!! I have consistently taken extra vitamin D throughout this trek. Every time I tried to back off, the pain started again. Beware, the doctors may try to wrangle you into accepting a course of biophosphonates to \"protect your bones\". DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!! Your doctor is available to help you, BUT this is YOUR life and YOUR choice!! All choices have consequences. Staying on Arimidex has consequences. Stopping or lowering the dosage has consequences. Use the statistical analysis available to your surgeon for your particular case and make an informed decision. It IS your decision, not the doctor's decision. As I stated, choices have consequences. If you have had a particularly heavy schedule of treatments and surgery, you might research different meal plans and avoid those things that make you feel worse or can compromise your walk to wellness. I also learned that one regular aspirin every other day can keep general inflammation, a cause of many body dysfunctions, away. Of course, if you are allergic to aspirin or sensitive to things that might make the potential of stomach bleeding worse, do not take the aspirin or talk to your doc about taking baby aspirin. I want to encourage everyone to give yourself TIME TO HEAL! It took almost a whole calendar year to feel like my true self... Maybe longer. It WILL get better!! God bless you!!",

      "Content": "I do get \"warm waves\". They have never bothered me because I have always viewed them as joyous proof of no more monthly periods!!!! It may just be me, but fighting or stressing through the wave makes it worse. Keep a lightly scented hand sanitizer handy; the type with alcohol. Wiping your arms, neck and upper chest with this is very cooling. If you are at home, rub on your feet, too. :D) I am a shameless fan-waver! HA!! Fans are available from party stores for really cheap! One thing more, for you who are new on this life trek; I KNOW you can go down the negative path, (The docs DO NOT help!) I know I did... for a little while. We ARE NOT the cancer that attacks our bodies! It is not YOUR cancer! It does not belong to you! You do not belong to it! You did not invite it in! In your mind and heart, kick it out and back to the hell it came from! Do all that you know is right for YOUR BODY and YOUR LIFE!! Let your close family know your decisions and why you have made them, then GO LIVE YOUR LIFE!! Any one of us could have a meteor fall on us tonight and we would be out of here! So as the song says \"Don't worry! Be happy!\" Love and Father God's blessings of Peace, Hope, and GOOD HEALTH to you all!! :D)",

      "Content": "Vitamin D deficiency is just becoming a recognized problem all over the world. Many of us who are attacked by the medicines that currently are the norm for cancer patients, have vitamin D deficiencies due to various conditions as well as those medicines. To get the DAILY 2500-2800+ units of vitamin D that gave me (and others) relief from this pain, I would have to get a sunBURN!! I live in the extreme heat of South Georgia. Yes, the sun is free, but some of us need more than it can give in daily doses without extra trouble... say melanoma...",
