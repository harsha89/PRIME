      "Content": "Im 49 year old , I just bought a new sports bra \" silk \" after taking a shower I noticed my RIGHT breast nipple looked different than the other one ... Never noticed that before..  I have never had a mammo, my aunt had breast cancer but didnt die of it :)  im really a freak about know things, i always pray that when its my time God will just take me and I dont want to go through knowing what im dying from :( ...  I know God knows all about me and knows how many hairs I have on my head... So anyways I showed my Breast to my husband and he said I needed it looked at.... So I went to get my first Mammo ...  BIG MISTAKE ....   AFTER it was over I got a call back right away,, Come back ... So I did, they did more pictures and ultrasound........  then the Doctor came in and said, you have alot of Cysts on your Right Breast the one that has looked different, and that is normal ,, but its your LEFT breast im wanting Biopsy on ??? What the heck ??   she said you have a group of 2.2cm of calicifications and It needs a biopsy,, I said really what kind size ect of calicifications is it.. she said I cant tell Indertmine, Spelling may not be right :(  but anyways, I dont like this...     4b ........  26 years ago my baby elbowed me in this breast and it caused a blood clot, lots of pain awful crap....  so how much more for a biopsy????? gosh,,she said a 80% chance its nothing ,,, so what do I do???  My kids 3 sons and husband of 32 years are saying im stupid to leave it alone... BUT Im a gambler and know God knows all about me and my life.. so was this to show me to go in ? or what?  WHAT TO DO???????????",

      "Content": "Thanks for you reply Kathy48 :)  Can you give me more details on your case?  Im so torn about this whole thing.... I dont understand how you could have stage 2 with just the calcifications?  I asked the Doctor if they do the biopsy is there a chance of it being like stage 3 or 4 cancer and she said NO WAY,  Do i belive her NO !!!  I just dont understand this stuff very well... I want to throw up :(",
