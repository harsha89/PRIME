It continues, in an abated, come and go way, ever since. I have done acupuncture and massage, but it still hangs on. Stretching and advil help. Drs say it is muscle pain, not a sign of cancer. Has anyone else had this lingering pain? I finished chemo in April. I have the same pain.  My started after treatment.  AIso, I had the same combination taxol and Neulasta.  I finished chemo the end of May.  I have the same lingering pain.   The last a couple of days it has been bad.  My Drs says the weather can cause more pain. Like on damp and raining days.  I stretch and keep myself active but it stills lingers. ",

      "Content": "HI, My back pain is gone.  The only time I experience any back pain is when I'm tired.  It took about a year to feel like myself.  I stretch alot  and keep myself busy.  I work, take care of my family,walk and take care of two puppies(that is crazy)but I love every minute.  So, I did not have any leg pain.  I did experience differ pain but that is better.  Like stiffness in my fingers and toes.  Sometimes, I get spasmings in my feet and lower legs(calf areas).  I do feel great and enjoy every minute of my life. I hope the pain gets better.  Try to exercise more that seem to help me.    take care of my family,walk and I have two puppies that keep me busy.      ",

I also had double mastectomy. I would like to hear from someone who has been diagnosed as being her2 positive, and has had the herceptin treatments. I guess i would just like to know that there is hope at the end of this journey. My dr says that my cure rate is at about 70 to 80 percent, but I read that sometimes the herceptin does not always work. Even though my cure rate is pretty high, I still get nervous, after reading some of the info on breast cancer. Maybe I should just quit reading so much, huh? ha ha Thank you for any info k I have been diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 in December 2007.  I am also her2 positive.  I had about a third of my left breast removed and had a second surgery to remove the rest of the lymph nodes  in that area and under my arm as they found a small tumor on one of the lymph nodes under my arm after the first surgery.  I have been treated very agressively since January 2008 with 7 chemo treatments ( sceduled for 8, but could not tolerate the last one) and 34 radiation treatments.  I was given herceptin in smaller amounts during my regular chemo treatments.  Now, I go every three weeks for a two hour drip of herceptin along with a Femora chemo tablet daily.  However, I was told this herceptin can only be used by individuals that have a certain type of cancer and they have to be her2 positive.  I understand the herceptin actually targets and kills any of these tumor cancer cells in your body.   I have regular blood tests that will tell if I have this type of cancer cells in my body.  You might ask your doctor about that.  If you need it, I will find out the name of the test.  So far, so good!  I hear unbelievable survival stories at the cancer center I go to, even with stage four cancer.  I do know trying to keep a positve attitude is healing, but sometimes it is a struggle to keep positive.  Ten years ago, you and I might not have survived with this diagnosis.  Great strides have been made concerning breast cancer, and I am greatful and thankful to God.  I know I am going through this for a reason.  Hopefully, a really good reason.  Good luck to you and I hope this helps. A     I was dx with stage 2, lym nobe neg and her2 pos.  Also, treated aggressive with 8 chemo treatments.  I have herceptin every three weeks for one year.   What is the name of the blood test to detect the cancer cells?   ",
