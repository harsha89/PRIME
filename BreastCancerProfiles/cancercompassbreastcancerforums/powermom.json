      "Content": "I was told that 80% of calcifications are benign.  But please encourage your friend to go ahead and have a biopsy.  I did so and it turned out that there was a malignancy in my right breast.  Not to scare you, but I feel that in my case the cancer would not have been identified had it not been for closer examination of the calcifications.  My strongest hopes are that your friend gets an all clear result. This adventure I am on started a month ago.  Second surgery is scheduled for October 18.  I will be starting chemotherapy, hormone therapy and radiation.  Not thrilled about this, but very thankful that I will begin treatment!",
