Karen,     Milk not drying up by itself is not a concern. I know mothers who nursed their children right upto age 3. If you are nursing your child the milk won't dry up - doesn't have to. WHO recommends nursing for 24 months, while AMA recommends 12 months. Take care, and I will pray that the mammogram comes out clear. Priya.  ",
