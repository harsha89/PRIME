    "Content": "I also had the pains in my extremities i.e. toes, fingers etc and also in my back but I am sure this was down to the chemotherapy. Sometimes the pain would be very sharp I am sure that the itching down my right arm was due to the Herceptin but I finished this treatment in March and althoughI still on occasion get sharp pains the itching has at last stopped. However, I did take antishistamine for the itching and this did help and took painkillers when the pain was bad i.e. paracetamal plus. I also have co-codemale which is much stronger",
