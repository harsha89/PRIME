    "Content": "Hello, Just for another opinion here, I am over a year in remission, and my understanding is that ALL sugars feed cancer, including honey, fruit juices, fructose, etc. What has helped me and many others I knowÂ is lots of protein and veges and lots of green tea and pau darco tea. No soy, definitely not. I and many others do not take any chances with any of the above and it has served us well. However, everyone must find their own path. This has been my experience and those of others I know. Just to add another voice. Best of Luck to All",
