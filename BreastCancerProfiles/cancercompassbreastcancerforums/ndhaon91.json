    "Content": "Tanya: I do not personally have experience with the Hoxsey clinic, but both my parents do.  My mother beat breast cancer twice with help from the clinic (along with traditional chemo/radiation).  My father visited the clinic years ago after being diagnosed with skin cancer.  They are heading back this week because my father was just diagnosed with prostate cancer.   They are big believers in the treatment.",
