      "Content": "My daughter had breast cancer in November, 2005 with surgery in December 2005. They removed the cancer lump and it had not spread. She had radiation treatments for 6 weeks after surgery. It has now been 2 months since her last treatment. She has 2 - 5 spells each day where she looses all strength in her body. She is dizzy and almost faints. The spell last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. She can talk but cannot move any arms or legs. It is almost like a coma. She has had EKG, EEG, MRI, blood workup and 24 hour heart moniter with no indication of anything wrong. Has anyone had anything like this happen to them? We need information to assist the doctors to treat the problem.",

      "Content": "She is 48 years old. She has had a hystrtecyomy but is not on HMT. She is very careful about her diet. She is not diabetic. She is fine between her weak spells and is able to do anything she wants but never knows when another spell will happen. We have waited over 3 weeks for the results of a heart moniter test before they send her to a nuerologist. She is married and has two grown children.",

      "Content": "Her cancer was stage 3 DCIS. They removed one lymph for observation to see if the cancer had spread. It had not spread. She is waiting to find out what is causing the weak spells before she starts any oral preventetive mediacation. She did not have any of these spells until the last week of her radiation treatments which they called booster treatments. She has not used hormonal replacement therapy for several years. We appreciate your responses and your prayers. We know God is able to heal and restore but it is sometimes harder to believe for your own family than it is for others.",
