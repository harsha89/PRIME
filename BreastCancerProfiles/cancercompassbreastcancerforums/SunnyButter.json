    "Content": "Hello, My name is Sunny and 19 years ago my best friend, Dorethy Allen, died of breast cancer.  They've came a long way toward a cure since then.  Dot suffered so.  I want to do something to honor her.  I would like to give 10% of my net profits per month for a year, from my bakery www.sunnybutterpoundcakes.webs.com , toward breast cancer research.  Let's fight like a girl. I challange other bakeries to do the same If you have LOVE you don't need anything else and if you don't have Love nothing else matters. ",
