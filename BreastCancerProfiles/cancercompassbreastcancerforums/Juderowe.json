    "Content": "Hello I am Judy and have had breast cancer three times since 1995, The first time I was 54 years old the doc's said it was a small insitsu tumor left breast reqiring only lumpectomy , however after surgery I was told that I had 1 positive lymph node and would need Chemotherapy four rounds then six weeks of radiation. OK, that done I was put on tamoxifin for two years with horrible side effects seeing Oncologist follow up's regularly.. Eight years later 2003  after going to  oncologist for regular check up's my cancer returned in the same breast , after a mastectomy I recieved six rounds of Chemotherapy and was put on Arimidex for four years, I had terrible side effects and my bones are so very fragile now. I was  seeing my doctor regularly.  It was four years later 2007 we had moved to SC a lump developed rather quickly in my right breast, they said it was a new cancer and on the left mastectomy scar I developed some lesions that I had been showing my Oncologist for about seven months he felt the lump on my right breast and said it was not anything to be concerned about and the lesions were cosmetic. He sent me to have a needle biopsy of the lesions and it was negative, He said I could have the lump removed if I wanted to. My husband was going through treatment for Prostate cancer with bone metasis, since my doc wasn't concerned I put off surgery for a few more months. After surgery , A mastectomy right breast and lymph nodes two positive nodes  and removal of the lesions. All were cancer. Right breast was a new cancer and the lesions were inflamatory breast cancer which is rare and very aggressive with a survival rate of two to four years , since it is stage IV. It is so rare only about 2% to 4% of all breast cancer patients get this kind of cancer. I had six rounds of Taxotere and cytoxin and now am on Aromasin, I feel like a 90 year old woman the pain all over is aful. Even through all this I have been able to remain active but this is getting to be too much. I am taking care of my husband for he is having his second round of the same chemotherapy taxotere for the prostate cancer and bone cancer. I am 66 years old but since starting this Aromasin the pain is bad and my bones are getting worse. They want to put me on Zometa for my bones but there are possible side effects like the jaw bone rotting but my Doctor said they can put me in a pressure chamber to fix that problem in hospital. I am considering getting off the Aromasin but some say you have to come off slowly or withdrawls will occur. I am a small woman weighing 115 and 5' 4\". When this all started I weighed 140. I am a christan and have asked God to heal me and send angels to surround me. Are there any other stories that are close to mine. Bless all you brave women that are dealing with this most terrible disease.                                                            Sincerely Judy",
