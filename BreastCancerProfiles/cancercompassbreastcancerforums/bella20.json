    "Content": "I tried 8 g curcumin before, and cancer marker going up too I don't know why. I decided to see Dr. Munoz in SDC in Mexico , first he took my blood test to find out what is good for me to get rid of cancer, the result tell me that curcumin Is not help me. Curcumin is good, but doesn't mean is good for everyone . Like some good for vit c, some don't , some good wit paw.. Paw.. But depend on your body. So I think good to see alternative dr . So they know what you need for your. I tried many thing at home but didn't help me, after treated at SDC in Mexico with Dr. Munoz the cancer gone. Good luck",
