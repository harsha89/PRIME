    "Content": "  On 10/8/2008 Jodie wrote: hello out there:  has anyone been told withing a month apart by two pretty reliable doctors and diagnostic scans two differant written report readings? I thought today that I was going to new doc to start another round of chemo, due to a petct scan that said that I had a new 2.4 cent. nodule in my left lung and that it was to be considered malignant until proven otherwise..this is a direct quote.  It also mentioned persistant and residual activity in the other areas that had been previously treated with chemo last fall.  The new doctor that I am seeing now, ordered a new ct scan to be sure about the other scan report, and it came back clear of any metastatic activity in my lungs.  I am very pleased about this new finding but am very confused about it as well.  I know there can be false positives and false negatives to any of these diagnostic tests but they seem to be very differant in their reporting of these findings.  The two scans were done in differant hospitals and differant radiologists reading them.  I am elated at the new news of no need for chemo at this point when I thought today I would be starting more of the stuff.. but like I said, I am so confused and not sure how to feel about which one of these reports were wrong?  I looked at the cd rom of the petct, the new nodule was very apparent and very easy to see.. it looked like a quarter laying in there.  I have not been sick bronchial for there to have been any infection going on in there, and could it have been disolved within just a month by my system?  Should I get yet another radiologist to look at both scans and make another determination?  Sorry, I am just needing to know if others have experienced this miracle or confusion?  At this point I am seeing it as both!  I want to believe that this new report is correct, but if so, then why did the petct which is suppose to be pretty acurate show up this new nodule, and now its not there?  I am thinking out loud here.  None the less, I am glad that I am not having to go forward with more treatments.  I dont want to use this chemo medicine unecessarily causing the cancer to become resistant to the only drugs that may keep it under control.  I was taking herceptin treatments, and the new dr. now feels this is not necessary to continue either since I have already been on it 6 months.  I am her2 pos. Had recurrence in lungs which was biopsied in Aug. of 07 and proven to be breast cancer spread to lungs.  The new dr feels that yes there may very well be new cancer growing in lungs but until it reaches a higher SUV value more than 4 then it isnt considered to be abnormal enough to warrant more chemo at this point.  The object I thought was to keep it from growing in there at all or being able to spread elsewhere in my body..any loose cells can do that, I guess its just a ticking time bomb that waits for its moment to go off and start growing again.  Anyway, thank you for anyone who has some medical knowledge of any of this to send me some answers if you can.  I dont want to seek yet another dr..I am satisfied with the new one, but I just want to feel confident that these scans are being read and reported accurately. Thankyou so much. Jodie So what do others think?  I am a 4 year bc survivor with the same problem. 2 years into recovery a cat scan showed several small lung nodules. Oncologist sent me to a lung specialist for possible asthma where they were discovered.  A cat scan showed several small nodules with the largest being 5 milimeters. I have since had cat scans every 6 months. Now going forward yearly. My nodules are stabel though none have gone away. It can happen though. My lung Dr. did say if they did become unstable he would do a biopsy. (god forbid).If I were you I would go the nearest high end University Hospital that specializes in Cancer research for another cat scan. Bring the cd's from previous scans with you for a means of comparison. I don't have to tell you how serious this can be and Doctors do often make misakes and take shortcuts. As a survivor I'm sure you know all too well that you alone must always manage your own care. Try to remain positive but do what you have to do. If you need any help or information cancercare.com is the best web site for assistance of any kind. (in several languages if needed)  ",
