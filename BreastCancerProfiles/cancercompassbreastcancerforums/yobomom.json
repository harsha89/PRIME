    "Content": "I understand your pain and frustration.  My mom took arimidex for five years at the request of her oncologist and with the desire to be with her family and watch her grandchildren grow up.  She too had many of the side effects of the aches and pains.  When she finally got off of it the aches and pains got worse to the point she couldn't walk.  She saw her oncologist regularly, had mammograms and took care of herself.  We found out today that she has stage four breast cancer.  I am furious with her doctor as well as every medical person she has gone to see who brushed off what she was feeling as a side effect of the arimidex or a pinched nerve, etc.  I also cannot understand why it happens when she did everything she was told to do and more and yet, it has come back with a vengence.  She is now doing radiation and chemo, has a very positive attitude that she is going to beat this, but I am still mad!  I will support her with all my heart and soul but still, the questions are many and the answers are few.  I give everyone who is facing cancer so much credit and kuddos.  You people are my hero.  My mom is the biggest hero of all.",
