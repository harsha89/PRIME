      "Content": "You don't have to let go of life. Start reading and trying alternative treatments. My husband, Jim, was diagnosed with Stage 4 Esophageal Cancer on July 5 and the oncologist didn't give him any hope of recovery. I started reading and am convinced that the Macrobiotic diet is the answer. We have started on it and Jim is feeling much better. Although tests show the tumor has not shrunk, it also has not spread. The dr. was very surprised that it hadn't spread in the last 2 months. It is a very aggressive form of cancer. I feel quite sure that it is the change in diet from the Macrobiotic diet. Just take some time and read about it. It makes sense. I have been staying up late every night reading all I can on nutrition and lifestyle changes for curing cancer and I really feel that this diet can help. I suggest reading the book \"When Hope Never Dies\" by Marlene McKenna who was almost dead when she started the diet and was totally cured of her \"incurable\" cancer in 5 months. I personally know 2 people who were cured of their stage 4 cancer with this diet. Just do some reading and make up your own mind. Your life is worth a change in diet. Judy T. Holland, MI p.s. Stay away from sugar as it feeds tumors.",

      "Content": "My husband has Stage 4 esophageal cancer that when diagnosed last July 5, had already spread to the lymph nodes. We immediately started a program of high doses of Vitamin C, Beta-carotene, Vitamin E, Selenium and Grapeseed. Of course, the oncologist didn't believe in any of this but we had several friends that were cured just from diet change and supplements. So, we continued the antioxidants during 6 sessions of chemo. The result - the tumor did not shrink at all but it also did not grow in 10 months. The oncologist is amazed - we never admitted to him that we were doing things on the side. He told my husband he only had 6 months to live last July. Read the books \"Beating Cancer with Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin and \"A Cancer Battle Plan\" by Anne Frahm. Both tell which antioxidants can be used with chemo and have been life-savers for us. We are now seeing a biochemist who has Jim taking IP6 (like chemo but all natural) and Lysozyme Forte. I have researched IP6 and it says it can be taken to enhance chemo. I know if Jim ends up back on chemo, we will continue the supplements. Another suggestion - try to turn vegetarian (or get hormone-free meat) and get as many organic veggies as possible or wash your veggies in vinegar water to get rid of some of the pesticides. Good luck and God Bless! Judy T.",

      "Content": "Teresa: It's ok to stop your chemo but you still have cancer. I don't feel toxic chemo is the answer - they are treating the sickness not the cause. Go to a bookstore and get \"A Cancer Battle Plan\" by Anne Frahm or \"Beating Cancer With Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin. You can beat this cancer by changing your diet and taking supplements of antioxidants that build up your immunity. You have a very positive attitude, which is half of the battle, but you also have to do something to reverse the disease and nutrition can do it. Stop all sugar immediately (sugar feeds cancer). Cancer hates oxygen so I suggest taking Coral Calcium. My husband has stage 4 esophageal cancer and we found the coral calcium at Walgreens for $20 a bottle of 90 gel caps. Make sure it has magnesium and Vitamin D in it so your body can absorb it. Write to me if you need more information on antioxidants that my husband is taking. You do not need to die but you do need to change whatever caused the cancer and since experts estimate that 60 - 90% of cancers are related to our lifestyles (and diet), you will have a much better chance if you change that. And PRAY! Good luck sweetie! Judy T.",
