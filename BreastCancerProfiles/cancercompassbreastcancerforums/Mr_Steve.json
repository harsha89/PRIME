      "Content": "Please Tammy don't give up. You have gone through so much to date, giving up now is just the wrong way to go. FIGHT,FIGHT,FIGHT. Everyday is a fight, but it must be fought. 2 and 1/2 year ago when I was told that I had small cell lung cancer and that I really did not have much of a chance. 3 months, maybe 4 or 5 months. For the last 2 years everytime I have a CT or PET. or feel a strange pain or whatever is the problem of the day, yes I think maybe it's back. It has never come back, and it won't. Yet tomorrow morning if I wake with a headache, I will start thinking. Tammy we have a teribble illness, but some of us do get better. I joined a Cancervive group locally in Naples, FL. They are wonderfull. Ask a question and someone has been through it before. Ask at your Doctors, at local hospitals, call the American Cancer socity and find out what supports are available. Please don't give up, PLEASE!",
