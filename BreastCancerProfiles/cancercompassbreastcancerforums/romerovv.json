Dang, serious props to all you ladies who have gone through something similar or to anyone who is a survivor. So far, i have caught issues on time, but it's still pretty emotional. It is soooo mentally draining! Sending love & prayers to you all!",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I found a tiny lump in my left breast right next to the nipple this morning. I don't know why I decided to check, maybe because I had a big scare in September with abnormal cells in my cervix. Everything turned out fine, by the way. I just have to go to a follow up in December and go get checked every 3 months to make sure it doesn't come back. Anyway, back to the lump. My aunt was just diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery earlier this month. So I am freaking out about this lump. I talked to a couple people that I am really close with and they said to go get it checked. At this point, I know I need to be proactive with my health because of what happened, but I can't help but not want to go back to the Dr. I don't like going to begin with and I don't want anymore bad news. If anyone has gone through a similar experience or has any words of advice/support, please share :-)",

      "Content": "Hello all,  Thank you for the positive words of encouragement and the advice. It has been quite awhile since I've been on here so I wanted to give an update. I decided to take a break from Cancer compass because a lot of posts I read were very frightening ( not this particular discussion, but others). I have been going to follow ups for the abnormal cervical cells. I had a LEEP done and they said the abnormal cells were removed. In regards to the lump in my breast, it went away sometime in December I believe.  I asked the nurse If i should have it checked because I had a follow up pap scheduled soon anyway. She said if it goes away, it should be fine, but if not the Doc will check it.  Being that it went away, that was that. But I have talked to people who say to still get it checked because that lump could still be there, but sort of hiding. This scares me a little. I have another 3 mo follow up pap tomorrow so i am going to ask the actual Doc ( not the nurse) what she thinks about the lump that seems to be gone. Again, thank you all for the support!",
