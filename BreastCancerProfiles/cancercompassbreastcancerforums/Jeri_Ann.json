There have been insufficient studies done on aromasin and the other aromatase inhibitors for drs to across-the-board truthfully state that these symptoms are not due to the aromasin,  Indeed, many well-meaning oncologist are just repeating the assertions of the drug companies when they say that the bone and joint side effects are the only ones that have relevance to the meds. There are ways to naturally decrease the body's production of estrogen and therefore deprive cancer cells of the hormone they need to grow, but those natural means do not require a dr's supervision nor are they things that will bring the drug companies any money.  And that's what promotion of prescription drugs like the estrogen receptor blockers(Tamoxifen) and the aromatase inhibitors (Arimidex, Aromasin, Femara, etc) is all about :  the acquisition of wealth and maintaining job security in the cancer industry. Reputable and definitive studies have shown that Tamoxifen loses its effectiveness after 3 1/2 to 4 years, and there is some evidence that after that time period the drug may actually become contributory to other health problems.   Yet dr's are still prescribing it for a minimum of 5 years, and some are wanting their patients to stay on it even longer than that.  Aromasin and other similar drugs haven't been on the market long enough for studies on their long-term effectiveness to have been completed, but already some researchers are releasing preliminary results indicating that the body acclimates to and becomes resistant to these drugs over several years, just as has been proven to happen with the Tamoxifen.  There is a whole wealth of foods, herbs, supplements, botanicals that can help women prevent and defeat breast cancer. They are tremendously cheaper to acquire than the prescription drugs, and they offer wonderful health benefits other than just fighting cancer, with very few side effects in comparison to the anti-estrogen drugs. I researched this subject and designed my own natural anti-estrogen regimen, and in less than 6 months was able to put my metastatic breast cancer into remission.  Every person's body chemistry is different, and what was a good combination for me may not be the exact combination that another woman needs, therefore I recommend that people seek consultation with a naturopath to determine their own needs, but the natural means that I used very well could be at least a good start for other women seeking a weapon against hormone-positive breast cancer. (even something as simple as an aspirin a day can reduce the amount of estrogen produced by the body.) I've published my regimen on my blog.  Readers are welcome to look at anything else on my blog that interests them. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers It is my sincere hope that many more women will stop the insanity of suffering the debilitating side effects of prescription drugs, and will seek a safe, natural way to live longer, healthier and more pain free lives. Sincerely, Tre  I am also trying different vitamins and herbs--but I feel I need to be so aggressive with my sarcoma--that I am thinking of Arimidex--I am praying for the right answer to this--I am 39 and have a 12 yr old so I am quite desperate--I am No evidence of disease per three weeks ago--but just had a recurrence in lungs, and pelvis--all removed but no chemo recommended as I had just had gem-tax--anyway I am very interested in doing vitamins and trying to do whatever I can.  Jeri",
