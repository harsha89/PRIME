    "Content": "Hi My co-sister (30 yrs old) had MRM and oophorectomy 2 weeks ago, following a lumpectomy 6 weeks ago. The lumpectomy revealed a 5 cm IDC Grade III,  ER-, PR+, HER2 -. The doctor wasn't too happy with the clearance margin and advised MRM. Now, the pathology report post the mastectomy and removal of nodes indicates: 1. 2 greywhite lesions in the breast tissue, each ~ 2-3 cm, arranged in nests, sheets, cords. They are around 1.5 cm apart.   2. 2 lymph nodes in the breast with cancer, (greywhite), without perinodal spread. 3. 1 lymph node in level 1 with cancer with focal perinodal spread. The whole breast tissue is fibrous. The doc says this means she is T3N1, stage 3a. He also suspects that the 2 lesions that we have found in the post-MRM excision are actually a single big tumour, part of the original lump taken out in the lumpectomy. He also says that while the chemo wd kill any microscopic cells, there is a 60% possibility of recurrence....We are going in for chemo in 2 weeks, when the wounds heal. I have the following questions: 1. If they all are one single tumour - it would have been ~ 10 cm!!  But the mammo revealed only a 5 cm lump... Is there a chance the mammo could not have detected the other 2? And since the lumpectomy removed only half the tumour, wouldn't this have made the tumour spread faster? Is there a higher risk now of spread? OR - Is there a chance that the other 2 lesions only grew AFTER the lumpectomy?  In which case, does it mean the cancer is very aggressive? growing 2 lesions in a month? We just want to understand this report better. Any help appreciated. thanks.    ",
