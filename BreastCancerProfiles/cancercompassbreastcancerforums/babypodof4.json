    "Content": "Hello. I am 42 and just had my third screening mammogram and I am terrified. Never had anything show up before, but I got a call that I need a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound now. The findings were: No microcalcifications, no asymmetrical distortion or thickening of skin. Focal density in right breast seen on cc view only, may be artifactual. Further evaluation is advised I am scared. I have very large, dense breasts. I don't feel anything abnormal in there. I read that dense things are like 85% likely to be cancer.Â  Any thoughts or advice is welcome",
