    "Content": "I to am on Xeloda, I am currently taking 2000 mg twice a day, I was fatigued to begin with, but as my cancer markers are dropping I am getting more energy daily.Â  I pushed myself to do more every day, and if I over did one day, and felt like spending the next day in bed, it was ok. I am on my 5th roiund and doing better daily. Good luck to your mother and yourself, I will pray for you both, cancer is hard on all involved, but with a positive attitude, god, ctca, the wonderful doctors and caregivers, I feel we can overcome this also!",
