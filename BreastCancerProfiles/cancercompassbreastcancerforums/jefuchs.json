    "Content": "My wife has a malignant lump that's a little over 1cm., and it's triple negative.  We've been told that chemo is recommended under these circumstances, but she cannot have chemo, because she is in treatment for brain cancer, which takes priority. Brain chemo will not affect the breast cancer, so her only breast cancer treatment will be surgery, and maybe radiation. That will cause her to be at higher risk for recurrence than if she'd had chemo for the breast cancer.  So what are those risks?  And how do they monitor for new growth in other organs where a mammogram can't see?",
