    "Content": "This winter my left nipple was really itchy at times, especially when I was about to go to sleep. I've read that this could be a symtom of Paget's. The itchiness went away and I haven't felt it for about 3 months. I've read that Paget´s symtoms sometimes go away for a period of time.  I' went to the doctor today, and she just said that Paget's is rare and that I shouldn't worry.  As I have a lump in my nipple I will have a mamography in a month or so. 1. Does anyone know if you can have Paget's without eczema or redness? I've only been having itchiness. 2. Does anyone know if Paget's symtoms can go away for as long as 3 months? Would LOVE to get answers! I'm so worried. I'm 24 years old and otherwise healthy. ",
