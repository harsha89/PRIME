    "Content": "My sister in law was diagnosed with breast cancer in August last year.she has had chemo,radiotherapy,plus a clinical trial chemo only to be told that a scan has shown spots on her liver and brain last week.She has had a chest infection and had fluid on her lung and was unable to do anything at all for herself.the consultant said if he didn't see an improvement in her he was going to give her as little as four weeks to live! They took her to hospital few days ago and he agreed to drain her lung so she is in hospital for 72hrs,from 6pm to 2.30pm they have drained 2 1/2 litres from one lung.the drain is still in.She is very sleepy but seems to have perched up since she can breathe better and said she had walked to the loo on her own,which was good cos she was only having one pee a day,followed by diaoreah.she hasn't had a mastectomy as consultants aid she was too young,so now it's in both breasts spots on her liver and brain as I said above.is her body slowly shutting down,and do you think she still only has the period of time left as previously given(4)weeks now that she has had her lung drained.the consultant said he would keep on trying for her but needs to see if she's improved next week as to whether or not to give her her next round of tablet form chemo at hospital.i am so confused and worried as I live three hours away from her.she has three small children.",
