    "Content": "Hi, does anyone know why a 17 yr old would have nipple discharge? I am so scared that it is breast cancer, because my mom died from it. I know i have a amazingly high chance of getting it since she found out she had it when i was a baby, but i dont have anybody to talk to about it at home, i definitetly dont want to tell my dad about it. that would be so akward. But, ive had this pimple like thing on the dark part around my nippple, sorry im not too sure what its called. I thought it was just a pimple type thing, but it wont go away! its been there for like 4 months, but not its all dried, im so scared if its too late. Can someone please help me? Cathy",
