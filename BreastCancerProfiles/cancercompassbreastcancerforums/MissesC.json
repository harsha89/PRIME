I haven't been able to get a biopsy done yet.  I am hoping that my insurance will reinstate me.  They said that they are still reviewing it and it won't be untill the 10th of this month to have an answer.  I am having a little bit of pain in the area that they found the calcification but, I don't know if it is just all in my head. Thanks for all your help Missesc",

My mother had breast cancer 10 years ago so I'm at higher risk. Hope it will be benign.  Good luck with your tests. Please post results.   I haven't went for my biopsy and I don't know when I will be able to.  My insurance was terminated (long story) and the biopsy cost $3,000.00 (more then I can afford right now).  When will you get your results? Thanks for posting MissesC.",
