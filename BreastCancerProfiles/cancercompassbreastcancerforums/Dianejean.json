Thanks Hi, Betteanne I have been out of chemo for just over a year for colon cancer.  One of the drugs I took can cause neuropathy.  The numbness seems to get worse right after the chemo, but then gradually starts easing up. Unfortunately I still have neuropathy in my fingers and feet.  I take B vitamins.  It is discouraging, but I am alive and no signs of cancer for now. I pray that you will get better each day.  Do not give up hope...the neurologist told me last week that mine could continue to get better yet.  My prayers go out to you. Diane       ",
