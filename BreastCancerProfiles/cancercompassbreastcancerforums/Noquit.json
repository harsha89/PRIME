    "Content": "Hi all, I am new to CancerCompass. I had a double mastectomy 13 days ago. They removed my drains today, thank you Lord!!! I have this never ending burning sensation (like a really bad sunburn) under my arms and on the back of them. Any suggestions on how to soothe it? The Dr. Said its nerve endings. I'm trying to stay off all pain meds so I can drive, so I would like to use something topical. Any suggestions are very much appreciated!!! Cindy #noquit #fightlikeagirl #igotthis",
