    "Content": "I understand your concern.  I too had cancer that spread to my liver.  I went to sloan kettering hospital in nyc. I met with dr. Demateo and after reviewing tests he agreed to remove the part of my liver that had cancer. You can reach his office at 212 639-5726 and see if your sister is a candidate for the surgery.  I wish you all the best  ",
