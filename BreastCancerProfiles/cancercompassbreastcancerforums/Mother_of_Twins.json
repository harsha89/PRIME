      "Content": "i was reading your message and wanted to ask you how long you had to deal with the swollen legs and feet. i finished 6 cycles for breast cancer in april/06 and my right leg is swollen, reddish purple and is peeling on the shin. my oncologist did tell me it was a side effect, but it has been 8 weeks and i am not seeing much change as far as symptoms disappearing. i am hoping that this it not going to be permanent. should i ask about steroids? thanks for any input that you have.",

      "Content": "when i started chemo for breast cancer i had a very helpful lady who ran a wig store and also had been through breast cancer.  you have 10 to 12 days before you hair starts to fall out.  mine started on day 12 after your first round of chemo.  the drug that causes it is what they call the \"red devil\"  i had fun with my hair loss, my hair was dark and very curly so i decided to go straigh and auburn.  actually a lot of people liked the wig more than my hair.  you have to do this and your emotional health has a lot to do with your recovery so be positive and try different things.  i also had a purple/pink tied dyed bandana i enjoyed wearing also.  then after a couple of treatments i just decided to answer my door with nothing on my head.  now days when they see a woman bald they will automatically think chemo for breast cancer.  if all else fails, draw a pink ribbon on top of your head.  i do hope you do well and stay positive.",

      "Content": "i was diagnosed with stage 1 beast cancer.  i looked at my family history first, my mother had breast cancer.  i went for a mastectomy because i wanted to be as aggressive as i could be to make sure it did not come back.  i am not 49, 1 1/2 year survivor.  i also wanted to be around to see my sons marry, and be blessed with grandchildren.  also, my husband wanted me around, the reconstruction and implants are a good option also.   deedee",
