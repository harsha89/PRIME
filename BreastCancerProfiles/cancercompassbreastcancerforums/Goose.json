      "Content": "Is anyone out there treating stage 4 cancer with alternative medicine only? Without using any conventional hormones, radiation or chemo? My family is attempting to help my mom make a treatment decision, and she seems to want to only use nutritional/alternative methods. Is there anyone doing this? Is this wise?",

To be able to know that at least one person out there has experience with what we are trying to create is amazing. Do you know anything about cesium chloride? or hydrozine sulfate? or oxygination therapies? Also, what is a molecular enhancer? and also, what is a QXCI. I would appreciate any response. I realize all of this information is very involved and complex. A website or name of a doctor? Thanks for anything.",

      "Content": "Does anyone know about alternative therapies that are effective at stage 4. My mom was diagnosed 5 years ago, had a lumpectomy and has not had more than two mamograms in five years. Last week, she found out she has liver and bone mets. She wants to treat this entirely naturally. Does anyone do this? I am really scared for her. I feel like she is not taking stage four as seriously as she should.",
