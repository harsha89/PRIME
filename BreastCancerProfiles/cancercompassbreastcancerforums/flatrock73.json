    "Content": "oHi, I'm new here and hoping someone can give me ome advice. 6 months ago I had my first mammogram and ultrasound there were some palpable abnormalities found, given birads 3 rating and told to come back in 6 months. New mammogram and ultrasound found new suspicious linear growth of microcalcifications, birad 4 rating,Â biopsy was recommended and was done a week later. Test results thank goodness were benign. Dr. then suggested that I come back in a year for next mammogram. This has myself and my mother both a little concerned, she is a cancer survivor, 3 years in remission. She was diagnosed at the age of 63, I'm 38. Does this sound like a normal procedure or should I consider getting a second opinion?",
