    "Content": "BJ,  I was diagnosed two years ago, stage 3 with six positive nodes. Originally, I was told no positive nodes after surgery, then the doc came back a week later and said, \"sorry - six out of 14 were positive.\" I freaked out. I went through chemo, bi-lateral mast and radiation. My oncologist says that I have an 85% chance that I'm going to survive the next ten years. I'm ER/PR + and HRT -. I consider that a very good prognosis. I want to caution you and your sister. Every diagnosis is as unique as the person who is experiencing it. Have your sister talk to her oncologist. Be wary of the info on the Internet. Most of all, enjoy the lessons that you have learned through this experience. Make the  most of every single second, every day. You are lucky to have each other. Sisters are special people. Take care, Caroline",
