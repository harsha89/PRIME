    "Content": "I had what looked like a bruise appeared on my right breast about two months ago. It is still there. Is lighter at times and darker at others. I also have little bright red spots (right like blood but tiny like a large pin prick) on my sternum and tummy. These are also new. My breast is sore from time to time but not enough to stop what ever I ma doing...it is a dull pain. I read about IBC today and now I am scared. I am going to my doctor this afternoon. She is a new doctor and I do not trust her and have and HMO for the first time in my life....If she dismisses me do I ask her to refer me for a second opinion? Or am I over reacting?",
