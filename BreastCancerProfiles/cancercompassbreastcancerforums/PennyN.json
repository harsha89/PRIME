    "Content": "I had a port put in in 2004 and it bothered me the whole time it was in.  Especially at night.  I know that pinching feeling.  I have heard of people with no problems and always complained to my doctors about it but they always said it was fine.  They seemed to think it bothered me more than most because of my size.  I'm only 95 lbs and have almost no body fat.  The port stuck out and was visible under even semi tight shirts.  I have to have another one put in pretty soon, since my cancer is back and not looking forward to it.  I do have one helpful tip though.  There is a topical drug called lidocane that will numb the port area before you have to have an injection and I have used that at night to help relieve pain till I could go to sleep.  It was especially hard to lay on my side and found that propping up on pillows and sleeping on my back was the best way to get some sleep.  I know I don't sound very encouraging but hopefully you won't need the port for much longer.  I had mine removed about two weeks after my last chemo treatment. ",
