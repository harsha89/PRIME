    "Content": "Hi Alina, I'm relatively new to this site and only view it every few days. There is also a bulletin board specifically for \"Arimidex.\" I did react badly to the Arimidex after just 3 weeks -- severe arthritic hands. I also had very SEVERE hot flashes. Even after two months of being off of it, my hands were still in much pain with stiffness and disability. (The hot flashes are somewhat better now though.) I did receive cortisone shots in the base of both thumbs and got a lot of relief -- although temporary, the doctor said. Also been taking Celebrex for my hands. I already had radiation (28 times) and will now have chemo due to finding out that my genetic risk factor is high and because I am unable to take the hormone therapy. I do have a friend who has been taking the Arimidex for over a year with NO apparent side effects. So, as others have said, it clearly varies from person to person. I have heard also that many are receiving great results from the Arimidex. I wish you the best! Karen",
