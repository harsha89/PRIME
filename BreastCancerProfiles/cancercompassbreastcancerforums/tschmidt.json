    "Content": "The only way you will stop being scared is to go see you doctor.  I don't think you want to rely on what is on the internet to make sure everything is normal.  Just speaking from expericence.  When in doubt check it out with our doctor.  Wish you well and just stay positive.  The only thing you have to lose is your payment for the doctor visit and with that you can have a piece of mind.",
