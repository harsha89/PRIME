    "Content": "I recently ha a lump removed and was told it was cystic and they got it all and no need to come back. Maybe i was still under the influence but I thought i heard him say it was malignant,,, Is it possible for that to happen and then nothing else to be done or check out . I say again I was still out of it so he might of said non_malignant but I would of thought the word benign would of been used to be more clear.Â  Any suggestions or opinions?",
