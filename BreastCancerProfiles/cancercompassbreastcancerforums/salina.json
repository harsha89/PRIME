There was not enough hydrocodone to make me take this for more then five weeks horrible headaches neck, joint, bone pain. I finally talked to oncologist he said if you can't take it you can't take it. history left partial mastecomy 18 lymphnodes, radiation, chemotherapy, then came lovely hormone therapy then came lymphedema most painful uncurable chronic condition from removing lymphnodes and radiating them. I didn't take arimidex i made it five six seven years now however my cancer is different i only tested positive for the first node of sentinel nodes second one was negative at the time i was told sometimes cancer skips a node so i let them take out 16 more 18 wrong move. Now they know a women who had same cancer and only two taken out is still alive and most likely doesn't have lymphedema which causes bactercia infections chronic daily challenges u lose more then half strength in arm and have so many affliciations forever",

If you do not have insurance most states have programs that will let's say get you treatment however be careful that is all they do. So reach out find women ask ask ask, alot of expensives will arise. Support group in person or at hospital is good. Online information is good however you can over load your self with trying to understand exactly what is happening to you. I say experience find women who have been threw it recently not 15 yrs ago your oncologist may help you find this person it really helps.  ",
