      "Content": "Thank you for the response.  So you are doing well?  That is the thing it all feels so unreal and you can help but to think all the time about it coming back seems I'm scared all the time...Are you doing well with the Tamoxifin?  I have read about it and of course like I said everything scares me...Did they give you final percentages?  I know it is hard for people to do but soemtimes you just want to hear \"hey you got a good a chance as anybody to living to ripe a old age so get busy living!\"  Did you have trouble getting back into your normal life?  You sound upbeat and that is wonderful!",

      "Content": "I was just wondering if anyone out there had a score of 22 or close I have already had 4 dose density cycles of A/C suppose to do Taxol now but I wonder what the percentage benefit would be?  I am 38, 3 cm tumor estrogen positive at first they say her2 positive but w/ onocono test they say her2 is negatvie. I had double masecotomy for invasive duct carcinoma, but it was only in right breast, lymph nodes negative.  I fear reoccurence but dont want more chemo than I have to take. Anybody close to this situation please respond this is my first post.",

      "Content": "That is the question if it only helps 1 or 2% by taking Taxol is it worth it, I had a hard time with the A/C.  I wonder too about size of tumor the surgically removed tumor was 2cm but they say the biopsy was 1.7cm so they added to say it probably at least a 3cm but I have heard that the biopsy should NOT add on to tumor size.  It has all been so confusing also with the oncono test it said 14% chance distant reoccurance is that with just the hormone therapy?  Thank you for responding.  ",
