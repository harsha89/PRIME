      "Content": "Hi Marie, I was recently diagnosed with Stage 4. I'm 47 and have two kids (7 & 11).  I am not ready either and I want to find a solution. I want to see my kids grow up and dance at their weddings. I've been immersing myself in books about people who have beat stage 4 cancer. The people who have commented on the Macrobiotic diet caught my interest. Across the board, everyone that I've read about who has survived stage 4 cancer (long term remission) has switched to a plant-based diet and they do not deviate ever (at least according to what they say). I just read a book about a woman with stage 4 uterine cancer that had spread to the bones and lungs. Chemo had stopped working and she was in a wheel chair. She switched to a macrobiotic diet and healed herself. I found out about the book because a woman with stage 4 breast cancer had done the same thing and had the same result. The book is called Recovery from Cancer by Elaine Nussbaum. I've also been to see the medical director of integrative oncology at UCLA. She gave me certain supplements. Her name is Mary Hardy if you are in the LA area. Healing Cancer from the Inside Out is another book that relates to diet by Mike Anderson. There is another book by a man named Greg Anderson called Cancer: The 50 Essential Things To Do. He is a 24 year survivor of stage 4 lung cancer (he also has a web site). There is another book called A Cancer Battle Plan by Anne E. Frahm and David J. Frahm. She survived horrific stage 4 breast cancer. Unfortunately she died about 10 years after becoming cancer free, but she didn't die from the cancer itself. You've probably heard of Anti-Cancer by David Servan-Schreiber, and another great book, The China Study by T. Colin Campbell. These two are also must haves for all of us who are going to do EVERYTHING possible to live our full life. For me, in addition to diet and supplements, there is a huge emphasis on spiritual. Medicine can kill cancer cells, but we need to get to the root cures whether it's building and training our immune system, or developing a spiritual life to guide us. They say cancer is linked to stress, and I find relief in spiritual practices like prayer and meditation. I recently subscribed to an online chat group for stage 4 breast cancer and I'm getting off. It's all about the horrible chemo side effects and other depressing posts. Of course those things may be true and we need to vent on them from time to time (always important to deal with real emotions), but I want to be surrounded by people like those who have responded to your post. People who are utilizing the best traditional medicine has to offer, but are looking for alternatives and are focused on life and not the disease. Traditional medicine can get us some time, but we have to look for the \"cure\" wherever we can find it. Hopefully we can all share the information we find. If anyone knows of other resources or online chats where this is the focus, please post. I wish you the very best of a long, long life, Marie!",
