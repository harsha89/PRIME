    "Content": "Has anyone else had their Circulating Tumor Cells(CTC) counted? My onc tested this and says greater than 5 per unit is bad, while less than 5 per unit is good\u2026 I have one per unit and he said considering I am now stage 4 breast cancer with mets to my liver this makes my survivability higher. Just curious if this is a newer test and it is still guess work or if it has been around for a while and thus more reliable? Any input would be helpful! Thanks, Susan (5 years ago, age 33 diagnosed 3a, chemo, lumpectomy, 7 of 32 nodes positive, radiation ER+ PR+ Her-2/Neu- Grade 2 of 3. Immediately on Tomoxifin, checkups every 6mos when liver counts jump up...now mets to liver=stage 4 and taking Exemestane. Cancer is still ER+ and Her-2/Neu- but mutated to PR-)",
