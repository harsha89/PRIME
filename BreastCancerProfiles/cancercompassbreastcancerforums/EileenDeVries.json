Also nipple just looks different to me, almost like its open. A few months later I had some discharge and I could feel a pea sized lump under my nipple. Went for ultrasound which came back normal. Still thought something wasn't right. Had diagnostic mammogram Monday and ultrasound. showed a small mass under my nipple. Core biopsy is next Wednesday. Quite nervous as to what they will find. hi, there, It would be a good idea to have the pathology also include tests for mammary Paget disease.  The symptoms you mention are classic for this disease.  It often is a warning of an underlying cancer, but not always.  Whatever it does turn out to be,  go for aggressive treatment and stay strong.   May God bless you.  Eileen",
