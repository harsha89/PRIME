    "Content": "Lou, Tell your doctor you will not be happy with the same oncologist and if he won't get you another one the best thing to do is get another doctor, too. It sounds like you have had very bad luck with doctors. If a doctor doesn't help you or listen to you or doesn't send you to someone who will then he shouldn't be in that profession. When you are told you have cancer somewhere they should find it, not dismiss you. Pray for God to guide you. I have excellent doctors and onocologist. they all take very good care of me and if I am not satisified with any doctor they do find me one that will help me. God Bless You.",
