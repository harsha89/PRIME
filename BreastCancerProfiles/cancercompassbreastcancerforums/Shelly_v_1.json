    "Content": "Hello Angel, Please know that a lump in your breast is serious. Get a mamogram scheduled immediatley.Remember digital mamography is the latest technology. You have to explain your  family hx. so  all the scheduling can be treated with  urgency. The great thing about your situaton is you found the lump early. Make an appointment with a surgeon,if recommended by the radiologist. Please follow the advice of all medical practicioners along the way.A bx. may be needed to f/u on the nature of the tumor. I found  a lump in my breast around Christmas 2006. It was the size of a grape then it grew to the size of a gollf ball.It was cancer and I am now cancer free.after chemoand radiation. UCLA has  a great evaluation program.for breast cancer if needed. Get busy scheduling your appointments and don't ignore.. Find inner strength  and do not ignore your symtoms. Take Care.
