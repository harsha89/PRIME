      "Content": "My aunt had a mastectomy and after nine years went for her check up only to learn she had stage 4 mets . They told her to expect maybe at most 3 months. It has been going on five years. She has made a bucket list, completed it, made another, completed it. She is out there doing what she wants. My grandfather was diagnosised with prostate cancer. They gave him a couple of years. He lived beyond 25 yrs and died from cardiovascular problems due to his smoking. Please live everyday with a positive attitude and take care.",

And the VP for the International MM Foundation is Mike Katz and it has been over 22 yrs since he was dx with MM. That's GREAT news!",

Not everyone who has MGUS will develop MM. I have gone to conferences given through the International Myeloma Foundation.( You can go to www.myeloma.org for information).I was able to speak with Dr Kyle who is an expert in the field. He answered individual questions for many people, even spoke with them one on one during breaks. I currently am in a trail at NIH (under the direction of Dr Carl Landgren) where they follow patients for 5 years and monitor them , trying to figure out what makes some people progress and other not. There are many different trials at NIH and other hospitals (Mayo etc) and you can benefit contacting them because these are experts in their field...they live and breathe MM. Talk with them and find out the lastest tratments. The great news is that people are doing so much better now then in the past. The conference I went to had people in the audience with MM who were dx 10 years or more and they were doing GREAT. I can't recall the guy who is very involved in the International MM Foundation (VP or something...I'll try to find out for you) and he is currently over 19 yrs since he found out he has MM. Please stay positive and ....take care.",
