      "Content": "Hello ya'll  Thanks for all the responds. I went to my doctor today and I think the light bulb finally went on in his head!!  Actually he is the only person I think that trying to help. Yes i did a skull xray and he gave me a copy of the report today. Basicaly this is what it says several lucent areeas with one to the left paritetal bone near the vertex and possibly on the right side. No evidence of increasd intracranial pressure or abnormal intracrancial calcifications. Impression: 2 small lucent areas seen within the calvarium . these could possivbly be represnet incidental partial foramina, although if patient has history of breast cancer, metastic change cannot be excluded. I am really not sure what all this means but.... after my husband told him that my mom and my sister were both told to wait and  see its probably nothing  ended up being cancer ( my sister had bc and then lyomyscarcoma  she passed away at the age of 36), and my told told him out of 6 daughter me and another one of my sister are the only one that haven't had to have mestomy.  In a matter of a 1/2 hour  he schedule me for a MRI at 1:45 today, Bone Scan tomoorw morning 8:00 and he will do a breast biopsy and remove all the milk duct on my left breast  Monday morning. i will keep ya'll posted on what the finding are.  ",

At your age, nipple discharge is more than likely something other than cancer (ie: infection, etc.) but, better safe than sorry. We don't do mammograms, generally, in young women because breast tissue is too dense, and some doctors will even recommend an MRI instead of a mammogram. Best wishes to you for your diagnosis. Anita, RN, Breast Health Educator I hope youreceieve this message and reply soon. I am 43 yr old i have had a left breast discharge fro 2 years with not pain. I went to eight different doc. all told me don't worry.  I still have this greenish brown discharge pain that goes from my left breast under my arm to my shoulder.

I dought it but I dont know.  My mother's breast cancer started in her duct, and has now that we found it invaded her breast and lymph system; we just don't/wont know how much until after her lymphectomy/mastectomy.  I hope you find out everything is absolutely nothing.   Thanks for your support. I do have pain and brownish green discharge in my left breast pain has gradually gotten worse, this has been going on for 2 years and 8 docotrs later. The pain goes over half my left breast up under my are and up to my shoulder collar bone. I will do a biospy when they remove the milk ducts no they fianlly saw it yesterday on a ultrasound MAMO'S  DO NOT SHOW UP ANYTHING. But I will call the docotr today to what he will do about my right breast. Thanks for your support and I will keep you and your mother in my prayers.",
