    "Content": "Take a breath ... I was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago .. Stage 1, Estrogen receptor positive.  I ended up with a lumpectomy, radiation, and I'm on anastrazole - I had my two year check yesterday - all clear.  Be careful who you listen to, if they are opting right off the bat for mastectomy, get another opinion.  Most research today, is pointing toward breast conservation surgery.  I went through hell, coming to a decision - as I was caught between two opposing opinions.  Glad I chose, what I chose - I was at Sloan Kettering yesterday, and they told me the recurrence rate for the treatment I chose, and that of mastectomy is equal. Take care!",
