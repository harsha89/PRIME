    "Content": "I'm a licensed naturopathic doctor who specializes in complementary cancer care (National Institute of Health Fellow, MS in Biochemistry). I see about 70 cancer patients a month. In my experience conventional treatments are really essential, AND if you choose this direction using complementary medicine to decrease the side effects, increase the rebound time of the immune system, and increase quality of life during treatment is essential too. The issues I have seen with cancer patients using only alternative means is that initially the cancer appears to disappear and the patient goes into a remission period, but the cancer is likely to return and be more aggressive. This of course depends on the stage of cancer at ddiagnosis and treatment. You can check out our blog. We've got a lot of great articles and recipes that might be able to guide you a little more. www.cookingthroucancertreatmenttorecovery.com Good luck with your decision!",
