    "Content": "A  close relative of mine was diagnosed with I B C and she met with her Dr which thought it could be drained which in turn referred her to a specialist which she saw and they looked thru ultra sound to see if there was any fluid to drain and it was not..My Goodness what a disappointment shamble she was left in Now she is waiting to see them this Thursday to determine just what avenue they will be going to treat her my question if they say this is progressive and spreads fast why did they have her wait another week to determine what they were gonna do?  She is presently taking  5 ml percocets to help some of the pain. She is in her 70's do you think she has hope in surviving? She is on a daily regiment of prayer and belief..My heart, help and support is with her every step of the way..What can she look forward to on her treatment?",
