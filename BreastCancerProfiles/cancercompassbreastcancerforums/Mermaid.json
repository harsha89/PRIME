      "Content": "Dee, It sounds to me as if you are a prime candidate for Herceptin infusion. I know you have been through alot, but the usual standard of treatment is infusion once a week for 52 weeks. Since you have had the best testing---being the FISH test, I would definately look into Herceptin. You can get more information about Herceptin at http://www.herceptin.com I hope this will help. Best to you, Pam",

      "Content": "Dear Fatima, A re-occurence of BC is always scary, as I know from personal experience. It sounds as if your Mom has a great attitude for dealing with this latest finding. My best suggestion would be to, first, deal with your initial shock,which you have already done, and then start to think in terms of being her support because if you give your loved one the impression that you are worried, then they too, start thinking in the negative. As I told my husband, I need you to be strong for me. He too, initially grieved but since that time he has been my rock, and I try and show him just how much help he has been during all of my ordeal. Best to you, Pam",

      "Content": "Hi Susan, First of all, congratulations on making it through all of your treatments, that is a great accomplishment in it's self. Your body has been through an enormous amount of stress and I think you should give your body quite a bit more time to heal. It will get better, but everyone's body is different as to how long it takes to heal. Absolutely, it is very frustrating and, at times, depressing as well. In my experience, I just do what feels comfortable to do, as far as exercise goes because I am sure you have been advised that exercise is a vital part to recovery. I assume that you were treated at one of CTCA's hospitals and if you still have questions they are there to help you. Did you get involved with support groups of any kind? I think there is nothing like talking to someone that has been through what you have. Have you spoken to anyone in the PNI department? This can be a wonderful source, not only for you, but your family as well. Now, as for having some sort of semblence of normalacy, that too will come, however, your life has changed and it is something that we have to be mindful of for the rest of our lives. This doesn't mean that we can't feel \"normal\" again and enjoy life and hey that epiphany just might strike you yet! Personally, I have found it to be rather bittersweet. Best to you, Mermaid P.S. BTW, some of those aches and pains just come along as we get older (not meaning your are old!, LOL)",

      "Content": "Hi PeggyD, In 1995, I had DCIS, with a wide excision, followed by 8 wks of radiation. I had no reconstruction as I felt it was barely noticibly. As DCIS is considered a non-invasive cancer, and in my case,at Stage 0, or precancerous, the doctors made very light of the situation, but did the radiation as a precautionary measure. My surgeon said, \"Gee you could have that breast for 20 years with no problem\". I was so afraid of the side effects of Tamoxifen that I chose not to take it. Maybe, my mistake, who knows. Anyway,I held on to that breast and low and behold , in 2004, I was diagnosed, in that same breast with a rare, and the most agresssive form of breast cancer--Inflammatory Breast Cancer! I now have had a bilateral mastectomy, chemo, and on my way to radiation. So to answer your question, keeping in mind that every person is different, I indeed think that breast conservation is oversold. However, it is still the standard treatment for DCIS. Pam",

      "Content": "Hi, This may sound weird,but I have always considered treatment my goal. If I am delayed, I feel that the cancer has time to gain on my body. As the other replier said, get treatment as much on schedule as you can. We are fighting a battle that we want to win. Consult with your doctors, regarding medication, that you can take to build up your platelet count. My thoughts are with you, Pam in OK",
