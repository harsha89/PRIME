      "Content": "LADIES! There is no excuse for you to be suffering from this problem.  Tell your oncologist/Surgeon you want to see a licensed Lymphedema Therapist.  They are out there, and you can solve your problem with some simple procedures.   Mine started right after my lumpectomy a year ago, with swelling, redness,heat and tenderness in the lower half of my breast.  My surgeon gave me antibiotics as I was concerned about cellulitis, but then when I went to an oncologist she said she didn't think it was cellulitis, but \"a little lymphedema\".  I had only heard about the arm lymphedema and I only had 2 nodes out so I wasn't even thinking about lymphedema in the breast itself. I went on the 'net and found the lymphedema therapist and my Onc was more than willing to give my an Rx for a few treatments.   It only took 4 visits following my surgery a year ago to help me get this under control for the rest of my life. I use an elastic tubing binder at night, almost every day. (obtained from the therapist.) It clears out 90 percent of any accumulations. If I feel any pockets of accumulation I put a little stuffing there (A sock!) or maybe wear it a little more.  I have done the massage too, but it is a little uncomfortable.  The compression works fine. I got a compression bra but found it much too tight.  BTW...Hopefully someone has told you not to wear an underwire bra and to minimize anything tight under the breast.  I wear camisoles most of the time now.  Also don't soak in a hot tub for too long (or at least get the compression on, or even a cold pack afterwards.)   A swim in cool water is the best! I also use a little Arnica gel on it.  Seems to help. Doctors like to pretend this doesn't exist.  It would mean that their treatments (surgery, radiation, etc) have yet another side effect.  We are on our own to discover these kinds of treatments,  but they are out there! Good luck, and please pass it on!   BTW my horse farm is named Never 2 Late Farm.  It's my motto. Paula   ",
