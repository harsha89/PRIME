    "Content": "Hi,     Sorry for everything yr going through. Dont know if I am the right person to answer  you but an going to try anyway. I am in the same boat as ur mother with the only differance being that I am suffering from a rare cancer called neuroendocrine carcinoid ,and we only found out a month and half back. The Drs think that my liver is giving way and they r going to try chemo on me but they did say that I would only have a few weeks.... Chemo will really not extend life long and the suffering one goes thorough is for each individual to decide if they want to. Some may just want peace and no pain in the their ends. I know I sound very cold but belive me when I say its for the ones suffering to decide. If yr mom wants to fight it then look for other opions . My Dr on the other hand will not give up. If you want I can give you his name and no. Prayers do help cause I do belive in God and his miracles. Thats what I asking for. I will say a prayer for ur family every day of my life. God bless your mother and family Simmi",
