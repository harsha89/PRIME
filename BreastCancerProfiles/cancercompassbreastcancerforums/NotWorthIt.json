      "Content": "Hi jmurphy914,  Thanks for sharing your mom's story. I am having serious joint issues as well. I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I have suffered with Fibromyalgia for over 20 yrs. I also have significant to severe arthritis, spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease along with bulging discs and occasional sciatica and nerve impingment for over 30 yrs.  After being diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, I had lumpectomy and radiation. Because of strong family history, it was strongly recommended I go on an estrogen blocking medication. I tried 3 of them. Arimidex, Femara, and Aromasin. The joint pain side effects are beyond tolerable, on top of what I previously dealt with, as were the new severe headaches, eye pain and upset stomach. After 9 months, I decided it wasn't worth it, much to my doctors Very Clear Disgust with me. It has now been 4 months since I stopped the medications, and my joint pain has not lessend AT ALL, even though I am no longer working at a physical job. I truly believe its lasting effects of the medication. My previous medical oncologist blamed it all on my pre-existing conditions, even though I explained to him the levels of pain, since starting the meds, and the fact that I was not currently working and doing very little physically to beat myself up.  It's frustrating to say the least. The more I research and read, the more I feel I made the right decision to get off the meds. By the way, I'm only 54 but feel like 74 since this started in August 2016.  I would love to hear from others that have made similar decisions to my decision.  I wish your Mom the best of luck, unfortunately you can't always take the doctors words as gospel, much to their belief otherwise. ",

      "Content": "Hi All, I'd like to reach out to all those people that have taken estrogen blocking medications, and have long term lasting/permanent changes/damage/PAIN , from the side effects with pain and bone loss, etc.  I have to be honest, I'm terrified that my new pain levels and joint issues may be permanent. And from what I've read, a lot of women have had permanent damage done with these medications. Some were on for long term, 5 - 10 years. Some only on the meds for under 1 year.  I admit, I have a lot of pre-existing joint issues and pain/stiffness/inflammation, but all of that wasexacerbated significantly with the estrogen blocking medications. In ashortamount of time, and doesn't seem to be lessening with time. And again, to be honest, I'm scared this is \"my new normal\" for pain and inflammation. Please, I would appreciate, any thoughts, comments, examples of similar issues.  Thanks J",
