    "Content": "I have  undergone surgery to remove a 2.0 cm tumor that has been classified as high grade ductal carinoma in situ. They said that several ducts have central luminal necrosis and dystrophic calcium deposition therein,no ducts were removed and I have undergone radiation only. My question is ...... does this treatment give me the insurance that the cancer won't return. I was told that this was the best stage to find this cancer. What does \"high grade\"  with  high proliferative rate mean to me and the chance of it returning?  This was flagged by the mammography five years prior but was told since I had no \"family\" history  no biopsy was required then.  ",
