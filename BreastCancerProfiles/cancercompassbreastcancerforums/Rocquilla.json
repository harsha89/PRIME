    "Content": "I am 29 years olad and was diagnosed with Stage IIIA breast cancer with metasases in Sept 06, I had a Radical Modified Mastectomy in Oct 06, I have had 6 cycles of chemo, which was hell, now I am on Herception whick I will continue until Oct 07.  I am just finishing up my 28 teatments of radiation which has also been and unpleasent journey.  I am considering having my remaining breast removed, then having reconstruction.  One, for fear of the cancer coming back in the other breast and having to go thru this all over again, and two because I was a 36DDD prior to the surgery and having one LARGE breast looks really odd, even if I had it taken down they would still be very different.  Any ideas or comments from anyone who has had reconstruction or knows someone that has, would be helpful, Thank You.",
