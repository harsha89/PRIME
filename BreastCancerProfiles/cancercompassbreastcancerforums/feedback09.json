I dont know a lot about cancer but she was getting chemo and i dont know if that did not help.  Because she got married and i did not ever do the ex bf thing i let her go, i dont know the cause of death and never met or spoke to her husband as its not what the ex does. All i know is she spoke to me on the 6th of octob 2014 and she was fine she said. She never spoke about the cancer to me after she got the all clear so i assumed she had beat it. Now Sunday 12th october 2014 i got a message on fb saying she died. im 36 and i have never been so close to someone and i dont think i ever will again. I am not an emotional guy as i was in care as a child all my life but this one is i just dont know. Ive still got her message from watts app about eating a pizza and thats my last memory but its mine. i wish i had seen her more but i didnt want to cause any problems with her husband. So i backed off and we was never going to be like that. i think it would of maybe been better if i hadnt spoke last week i just dont know. I work in the music world and manage acts etc etc and i cant let them down, but its hard.  Can someone tell me how she died peacefully in her sleep. I dont understand breast cancer. Was it the chemo was it the drugs. I need to know why this may of happened.",

      "Content": "My good friend died on Sunday 12th October from Breast Cancer. She was told she was cleared 1 year ago, i only spoke to her last week and she told me she was fine but died a week later. I know if she thought she was going to die she would of told me. I cant see her facebook page either and any remeberance messages because she unfriended me when i was a bit slow on replying to a message. It's far from her not liking me but more down to the releationship we had. We was soul m8s i think. Death has never hit me like this and i am lost and dont know what to do this is the most devestating thing i have ever had to do. We had a relationship a few years back and we lived together did a lot together but in the end we was not right for each other, but we still had very strong feelings and a relationship as friends. She was and is a shining star in the darkest night skies, she dedicated her life into helping the disabled and people. Even throughout the cancer she kept smiling like she always did and never let it get her down. She was only 41 and i feel like i have lost a big part of my life. I just dont understand how she died so suddenly its beyond me. I never thought when i went out with her, i would lose her 7 years later. I wish we found the cancer then. Any advice woule be good as i am broken,destoyed and sadness is not even close to how im feeling right now. I lost my soul m8 to Cancer and it sucks.",
