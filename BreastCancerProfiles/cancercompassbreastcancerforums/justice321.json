Hi Just wondering how old you are?  ",

No one should ever tell you what you should or should not do because a PHARMA Company tells you this is your sure bet of a cure. There are no guarantees. Like yoyur sister after 14 months taking it and nearly being crippled, now nearly a year off. I still have residule pain chances are I always will the damage was done. But I will never let anyone try and convince me that these drugs are a cure. Good Luck..... Amen.",
