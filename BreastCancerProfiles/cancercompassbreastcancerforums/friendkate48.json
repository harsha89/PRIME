    "Content": "My mother, 95 yo, has been on Arimidex for about a year.  She was treated for breast cancer in 1977, June; she had a total mastectomy -- and no recurrence until last year (or some time before, undiagnosed).  Starting on 8/01/07 I proposed to the oncologist's nurse (MD on vacation) that mother lay off the Arimidex until we saw him on 8/07.  Got the OK.  Saw him today and he has switched mother to Aromasin.  The reason I asked about d/c'ing the Arimidex was the excrutiating leg pain she was having. She had just gotten some relief from severe back pain (tumor growth in her spine in a couple of places) from 10 radiation treatments that were hard on her overall (nausea, weight loss).  I will hope for the best and will try to remember update with our experience after some time passes on the new drug.  Thanks to all prevoius posters on this topic -- to think of going through this without the internet and these wonderful topics -- wow.   Thanks again for sharing.  Catherine W, St. Louis MO",
