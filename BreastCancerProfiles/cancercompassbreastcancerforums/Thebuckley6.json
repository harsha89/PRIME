    "Content": "Hello, I found a lump a few weeks ago. Went to my doctor. She felt the lump as well, and felt around on the other breast and found a similar lump on the other side, just 1/4 its size. She thought it might be scar tissue or a structural abnormality. My normal screening mammogram was fine. She sent me in for an u/s and diagnostic mammogram. Got results back today via my E chart. Both stated they could not see anything that would cause a lump. No structural abnormalities. It ended with \"suggest clinical treatment\". My dr wrote \"everything is normal, call if you have any questions.\" I am confused. There is a lump there. Dr and I both felt it. It is uncomfortable. I could see it being scar tissue because the discomfort started right after I had a large lipoma removed from my torso directly below this breast. When she was removing it I could feel what felt like things being pulled from this area. I just want to be 100% sure it is that, but both yeasts could find nothing. Do I go in for a second opinion somewhere? I am in my early 40's with no family history of breast cancer. Thanks in advance",
