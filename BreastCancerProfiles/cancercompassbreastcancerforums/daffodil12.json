    "Content": "I recently noticed that I have a yucky odor inside the right cup of my bra.  I am 43 yrs. old, barely a full B cup, quiet thin and fit, and have always had an incredible sense of smell. I have taken special measures to ensure that I am always using a clean bra, cleaning myself equally on both sides, and using equal amounts of deodorant under each arm.  At first I thought it must be coming from the arm pit but it does not seem to be the armpit at all since I detect no odor there.  I can take a bra off after wearing it several hours and notice the smell all around the inside of the cup of a clean bra!  Zero smell on the left side and no signs of any nipple discharge.  I know that the smell is coming from the right breast and it is driving me crazy!  I have a mamogram scheduled for next Monday and while an answer to this smell would be nice, I can't imagine that this ugly smell is coming from anything good.  Two years ago I had a large cyst drained from the same breast that is giving off this odor now.  I wonder if this stink (smells a bit like regular body odor that would come from an underarm) could be coming from another fluid filled cyst?  I don't recall noticing any odor when I had the  cyst a few years ago. I am very curious to learn if anyone else has experienced this problem.  I have read posts on several sites that mention breast odor but what I have found seems to either be a smell coming from underneath the breast of a large chested woman or an odor coming from the scar site of someone who has had breast surgery. I would appreciate any information on this subject that anyone wants to share. Thanks!",
