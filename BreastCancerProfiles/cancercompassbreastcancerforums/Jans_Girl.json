    "Content": "Hi - I'm new to the site and have a question.  My mom has been diagnosed w/breast cancer, stage IV, with mets to the liver, bones and lungs.  However, even though her primary dx is breast ca, there is no tumor present in either breast.  Her oncologist states that she has a \"hormone-driven\" type of ca that eminates primarily from either the breast or uterus.  We're having a hard time understanding how she could have breast ca with no tumor.  Anyone experienced anything similar?",
