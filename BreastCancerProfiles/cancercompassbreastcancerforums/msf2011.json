      "Content": "Maybe I can offer some useful advice after all. Your situation should be encouraging to people who are faced with CM. See, in my wife's case, the time from her lumbar puncture until her death was a week and a half. We struggled for months with her pain and loss of use in her right arm before the tumor was diagnosed in her brachial plexis six months before she died. Perhaps a spinal tap then would have given us a chance to deal more effectively with the CM. We'll never know. I'm told that the occurance of CM in breast cancer patients is somewhere around 5 to 8%. That statistic doesn't mean a thing if you are one of the 5 out of 100 who gets it. As with all cancers, early detection can make a huge difference. Here's the biggest problem: the people who are reading this post very likely have already been touched by CM. I never even heard of it before I was told that my wife had it. A 5% occurance rate is not likely to prompt the test necessary to detect CM. As you have stated, be vigilant and advocate for yourself and your loved ones. It's your body and your health that is at stake!",

      "Content": "To hopeful82: Though your post is now several months old, your story is too familiar for me not to reply. My wife's initial breast cancer diagnosis came in the spring of 2005. It was followed by chemo & radiation. Fast forward to 2010... It took several months for doctors to correctly diagnose the inoperable metastasis in her shoulder. By then, she had lesions in both lungs. Day after tomorrow will mark one year since she went back into the hospital for the last time, delusional and in unbearable pain. Two weeks later we held her funeral. She was 54. As you can probably guess, is was CM that finally took her. It was undoubtedly present for quite some time before it was detected, things being much more clear in hindsight. By the time we knew what it was, the only viable treatment was palliative. I wish I could offer advice to anyone out there who has been touched by this hideous disease, but all I have is my wife's story to share. I hope your journey through this has gone better than ours.",
