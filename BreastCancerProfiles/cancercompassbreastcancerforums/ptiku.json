    "Content": "Hi, I came across CancerCompass just when I was surfing randomly and saw your post.  I registered so I could reply to you.  I was diagnosed in Jan of this year @31 yrs of age.  I considered myself reasonably health, no bad habits as such.  I just want to tell you that you will get through this.  This is a tough time due to a lot of information gathering and decision making, but you will get through it.  A lot of factors will go into your prognosis, but keep your chin up and fight this with all you have got.  I'll be glad to answer specifics.  My mother passed away of ovarian cancer at 46yrs, so we discovered that I carry the BRCA1 mutation and mine was genetic.  Just gotta fight it, there's no other choice.",
