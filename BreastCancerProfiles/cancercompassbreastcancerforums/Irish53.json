      "Content": "The swelling I had in knees, elbows, and ankles. At first I thought I was just being annoying but my doc gave me steroids for the swelling. See if your  doc will suggest this to  you, the Taxotere is wicked to the body and I had to take the steroids until the last two treatments. Keep the faith and tell your doc how you are feeling.",

      "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for 1.5 yrs. until they told me that I had a cataract in my right eye. Now I have been on Femara for 2.5 yrs. and the bone pain in which everyone describes is right on. I spoke to my oncologist and he told me that the drug never causes bone pain. Now come on, if we are all experiencing the same thing then the pain is real! Now I have to deal with Hip bone loss and osteopenia.

      "Content": "Hello! I so understand the ache and with me the numbness on my right arm and chest wall which varies in pain. I was desperate enough to buy a spa for my back porch. (which is tax exempt if your Dr. gives you a script) It is so much better to soak my weary bones and the stiffness just seems to melt. If you have a YMCA around some of them have hydro therapy programs for women with Breast Cancer or any Cancer really to get your joints moving again. I hope this helps you.",
