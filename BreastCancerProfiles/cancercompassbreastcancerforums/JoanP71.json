      "Content": "1 1/2 years ago I had a lumpectomy. There was no lump, only a nipple bleed and positive needle biopsy for 2 cancers, one very aggressive. The oncologist recommended a mastectomy. I felt the mastectomy should have been done with the positive needle biopsy so I changed Drs. My new Dr. did a thorough work up on the other breast also. He removed both breasts as the other one had a cancer also and I have a very strong family history of breast, ovarian, bone and prostate CA. 15 lymph nodes were good. No radiation or chemo was needed. There have been no problems. I see my family physician frequently for follow-up. Nobody calls me a 'Big Boob' any more but I would do the same thing again.",

      "Content": "My breast cancer had only one symptom, an intermittant nipple bleed in both breasts. There was no lump or other symptoms. I had a bilateral mastectomy with a 90% chance of a cure. That was 6 months ago. I was told that 20% of breast cancers will not show up on a sonogram or mammogram. I started letting my hair grow long to make my own wig if I was put on chemo. So far no radiation/chemo has been needed, but they check me every 6 weeks just to be safe. Good luck!. Trust your pathologist. He has the truth under his microscope.Â ",
