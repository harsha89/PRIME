I am diagnosed as stage 4 neurondoctrine neoplasm carcinoid. My cancer is a slow growing type that chemo or radiation will not help. As the tumors appear, they will have to be removed. The cancer is determined by levels of some hormone in my blood. When levels get too high, I will require a monthly shot that will help suppress the hormone my body is producing. I have been a work in progress for about 41 years now. My first sign was a tumor in my right lung the size of an orange. Like I stated before, immediate reconstruction worked well for me. Unfortunately, everyone heals at a different pace as well as everyone handles pain differently. Best of luck to you. Thanks, I will look at the posts you suggested.",
