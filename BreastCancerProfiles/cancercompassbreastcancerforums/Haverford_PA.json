    "Content": "From reading the Internet, my understanding is that the best treatment for recurrent breast cancer in the liver is surgery (a 2004 article in The Journal of Radiology) plus chemo.  The surgery recommended is laser ablation thermography; the problem is, I can't find out where it is done, other than in Frankfort, Germany.  Does anyone know of a surgeon who will do this?  I tried to get an appointment at Sloan-Kettering, and the \"referral person\" told me that the surgeons do not operate on patients with a recurrence in more than one spot (I have one bone spot and liver).  I think she may be wrong, but I can't get through (the journal article said that having both liver and bone were not a problem).  Does anyone know of a surgeon who will operate on recurrent in two places breast cancer in the liver.  They do it in Franfort, Germany, but what about the U.S?  The Internet says that the Sloan-Kettering doctors operate on breast cancer in the liver, but I can't get through.  Haverford PA   ",
