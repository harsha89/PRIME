      "Content": "My wife had this done 2 years ago. Thee xpandes are terrible, aweful. Once you have them rmoved the weight if off of your chest, you'll feel better. I believe you can drive thee next week.  Range of motion=she had to go to thereapy and after about 6 sessions or so she could raise her arms OK. Its been two years and the only thing is the implants to her feel not real at times and she adjsuts them (move them over or so) every now and then. But she went from an A cup to a C cup and she's happy. Good luck, after teh spaces are removed you'll be so much better. Its NOTHING like putting in teh spaces. by the way, she didn't have any checmo or radiation, takes a morning pll. David in Atlanta ",

      "Content": "My wife had breast cancer, double mastectomy, reconstruction. No radiation, no chemo but is taking an oral checmo pill (don't know the name). She now has aching joints. Most have said nothing you can do about it. She doesn't take glucosimine, doctor said it was a waste of $$. Has anyone found anything to help/ Many Thanks David",
