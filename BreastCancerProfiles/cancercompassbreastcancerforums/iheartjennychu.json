    "Content": "Hi everyone! My name is Jenny. I'm a 30 year old asian with no family history of breast cancer or any sort of cancers. I was diagnosed with DCIS Stage 1 and did a bi-lateral mastectomy on July 5th, 2016 and currently doing reconstruction. DCIS Stage 1. Medium grade Largest tumor was 3cm Negative Margins ER + PR + HER2 - Negative for the BRCA gene No family history. Based on this, the doctor said the chance of re-occurrence is very low. If I were to take Tamoxifen, it would reduce reoccurence by 50%. But if my chance of it coming back is 5%.....then why take Tamoxifen? The risks outweigh the benefits right? I woud like to have kids within 2 years. I would love some feedback. Or if any of you have the same diagnoses like me - I would like to know if you chose to take Tamoxifen.",
