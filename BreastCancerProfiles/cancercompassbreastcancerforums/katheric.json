    "Content": "My wife is scheduled for a Lumpectomy tomorrow morning.  She is diagnosed with IDC ER+ HER2-.  I want to thank everyone on this site for the world of knowledge I learned here.  I've been the self appointed researcher and have found some confort in my readings on this board.  When we found out, I didn't know where to begin or how to help her.  When I found these boards it was a blessing.  My main concern now is getting through tomorrow but I know I will have questions.  God bless all of you.",
