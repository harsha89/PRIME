      "Content": "I had a second lumpectomy performed and the wound is still trying to heal but very slowly.I had a mammogram done and the technician found a lump,I was referred to a surgeon and felt and examined and determined it was scar tissue from last surgery.He felt I could wait 3 months and get checked again or have a biopsy done to be sure it was only scar tissue,The results was it was scar tissue the problem is I'm ot healing because of radiation to the breast before.So now a nurse comes out 3 times a week to pack wound and I pack it the other days.I know it will heal but when and how long.The nurse measures once a week and there are changes.The wound seems to be healing approx 1/2 inch every week.Is that slow or normal for something like this?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply.I know I am being impatient but I was a little worried.It just seems like it is taking for ever.You would think after finding out I have breast cancer and going through chemo & radiation I would have developed patience.I guess I really have but I've always been a quick healer and this is not being quick.",
