    "Content": "Dear Erich: My heart and prayers go out to you and your mom... At first, my reaction was an all too familiar feeling of helplessness...Good thing I type slow... Only your mom can make the choice... A perspective (maybe even a positive) is the mere fact the doctor is giving her a choice...(versus patients in more advanced stages with both breasts recommended for removal).... Does that make sense?... The information out there is mind-numbing.... If there is anything I can do, please let me know. Even if it's just e-support.. Good night: Cindy",
