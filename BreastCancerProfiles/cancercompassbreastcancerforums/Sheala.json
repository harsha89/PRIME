      "Content": "The ultrasound was the first thing that didn't show cancer. I kept returning the doctor saying 'something is wrong' (inside my breast). A biopsy was ordered and the biopsy showed cancer. The subsequent MRI, x-ray, and catscan showed cancer. But the mammogram among that series of tests that week was repeated several times during my visit and each time showed no cancer. I was sent a letter in the mail that said I was all clear and good for another year!",

Â A year after my surgery, that radiology company sent a letter to me reminding me to schedule my yearly mammagram. (inconsiderate, poor paper work)",
