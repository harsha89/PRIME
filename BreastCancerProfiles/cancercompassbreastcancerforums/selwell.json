    "Content": "Hi Liz, I had radiation after a diagnosis of DCIS.  My doc did not remove any lymph nodes.  I had this surgery in February of this year (2013).  Back in August I started hurting with pain in my breast and in my underarm (left side).  My chiropractor was able to help me with the lymph nodes in my arm, but they were unable to do anything with the pain I was experiencing in my breast.  Well, I went to the breast doctor today and found out that I have an abscess near where the lumpectomy was done (left breast).  I was placed on antibiotics, so we will see how this goes.  I was in so much pain before I went to the doc.  I knew something had to be wrong.  Guess I was right. ",
