    "Content": "Hi,   I too have been taking arimidex for 3 years.  I have trouble with my joints and some kind of disc problem too.  Right now I am using a walker.  I am a Kindergarten teacher and was very active.  I must take showers instead of baths because of the stiffness and joint pain.  My oncologist doesn't think it is connected to the arimidex, but my orthopedic dr. and others have said it could possibly be connected.  My orthopedist wants me to have a knee replacement, but I couldn't possibly even think about it.  I do not sleep well, my fingers are always swollen, and sometimes I just hurt.  I have been given anti-depressants and cortisone shots.  Sometimes I think  I am going crazy. Why isn't there more info on the long term effects of this drug?  ",
