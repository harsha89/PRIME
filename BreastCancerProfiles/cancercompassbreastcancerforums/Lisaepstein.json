By the way I had stage 1 uterus cancer needed no treatment by a hysterectomy and my breast cancer was a 2.1 mm very small had lumpectomy and radiation and my doctors tell me I am going to be fine. Yes I am depressed and hope it never comes back and i am on armidex and if it comes back it will be treated again. If you have not good things to say and scare people dont write on here and dont tell women if it comes back they will die everyones situation is different!!! You are stupid!!!",

I had two have two biopsies and one turned out to be cancer. It was er+  pr- her2- stage 1. I went to a top breast surgeon here in NJ and she did a lumpectomy on me. It turned out the tumor was so small 2.1MM barely a stage 1. I had clear margins and my nodes was negative. The strange thing was now I am a Triple Negative which I am very confused by. I went to also a top oncologist and he told me with such a tiny tumor all I will need is radiation. He also gave a Arimidex not for this tumor which he says is gone but for any others if I were to get. I also had a BRCA test waiting for results and if positive it may change how we treat it. I cant understand how these two cancers happened at the same time!!!!!",
