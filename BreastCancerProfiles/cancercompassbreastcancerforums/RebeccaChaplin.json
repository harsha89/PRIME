      "Content": "Yeah. I had a breast reduction surgery ( http://www.lakeviewsurgery.com/cosmetic-surgical-procedures/ ) from Barrie. After two months I had a lumpectomy.  Pain after lumpectomy is common and takes some time to resolve.  The doctor will recommend you what type of bra to wear immediately after the surgery. I wore surgical compression bra which applies even pressure to the breasts and that promotes the healing process. Recovery from lumpectomy is a quick process and a woman can return to her normal life within two days after the surgery. You can restrain from work according to your wish. Anyways, it is recommended to take at least two weeks of rest. You are lucky to have a supporting husband. You must take proper rest for at least two weeks. You can ask your husband to help you with the chores and manage your children for that period. If your husband is not able to handle all that, you can seek help from other people. ",
