    "Content": "I am a five time cancer survivor.  I am 55 years old and all of my cancers happened between 50 and 55 years of age.  I am cancer free at this moment.  One of my cancers was breast cancer.  They put me on tamoxifen, which I was on for two years.  The side effects were horrible.  Memory loss, forgetfulness, extreme hot flashes and extreme anxiety to name a few.  I got my doctor to change me to arimidex which I was on for 16 months.  My side effects were extreme bone pain, tiredness, more memory loss, inability to put words together and extreme hot flashes.  I took myself off of it because this wasn't living.   I have been off the two drugs now for just over a year.  I still have bone aches and burning in my hips.  My shoulders are painful to the point that wearing a bra is very uncomfortable.  My ability to put words together is a constant battle.  My memory loss is frustrating.  My teeth are cracking and coming apart. The only thing that calmed down were my hot flashes.  All the aches and pains and even the teeth are doable.  What I am really scared about is that I have aquired dementia due to these pills.   I would love for someone to tell me their story and/or give me hope that I will live with this but it won't get worse.  I can do that.  Please share your story with me as right now it is not just me that notices these signs.  It is my husband, my friends and my employees.",
