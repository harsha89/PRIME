      "Content": "Hi Tracey, Glad to hear from you! I'm very new to the message board as of this month. I know it had been a while since you had written on the message board, and I wanted to write you to see how you and your mom were doing. I was really excited that you responded, and to hear that your mom is doing good. Especially knowing that you wrote back in June and we're now in October, which gives me some hope on knowing about my mom's condition. I'm also young, well... 27 yrs. old and a newly wed, no children (yet) and I know that you're you're 24 yrs. and soon to be married next year. I'm so sorry that you're having to go through this, during this time. Please, please feel free anytime to email me or even call me, seriously. I know that sounds strange and it sounds strange coming from me, the fact that I don't know you. However, I do feel as though that I'm walking your same shoes and it helps talking to someone who knows and who is presently going throughout the same thing. Even if it's talking about your mother, or wedding stuff. Don't give up hope, and have FAITH in GOD...He will take care of you and your mother. Short Back ground on my mom: My mother actually was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, age 52 in her right breast, (stage 1, lumpectomy, radiation) then in 2001, age 53 she was diagnosed on her left side with breast cancer (stage 1, lumpectomy, radiation). Since then she really never had follow up care, from her Breast Cancer Surgeon or Oncologist, such as CT Scans, or any blood work. This year she did undergo several surgeries, and still no detection of cancer spreading. In March 03' she went to her first Mammo (normal breast check up) since the 2001 BC she had, which was clear, she went again in August 03, in which the Mammo (breast examination) again was clear, no signs of cancer. However, an actual CT Scan, PET Scan, blood work, anything still hadn't been done to see if the cancer had spread through a lymph node or blood stream? The beginning of September 03, (age 55) she had several problems going on with her that none of the doctors could pin point what was wrong with her. She was completely misdiagnosed with Heart problems or Acid Reflux, etc... She then mentioned that she has a lump by her neck...immediately a Biopsy was done, 2 days later, they finally SUGGESTED her to have a PET SCAN, to find out that day the cancer had spread through the lymph nodes, to the liver & bones and that her Cancer Surgeon couldn't do anything for her. He suggested her to see an Oncologist...The oncologist, was really easy going and said that the cancer has spread to the liver, and bones and immediately started her first treatment of Chemo 2 days later (andriamycin & Cytoxin),it's been 2 weeks now and she seems to be doing OK. some days are better that others, but she still has a good attitude.. TShe has high hopes and a strong spirit that she's going to beat this cancer. The treatment that we got from the Oncologist left us with high hopes, but a little confused on how calm he was approaching the extent of my mom's cancer. He made is see as if it were a Walk in the Park, and that everything is going to be ok. That we do have a lot to go thru, but that my mom was going to be ok? Of course all of us are sadden, ANGRY, confused, and feeling much more, so we got a second opinion from my older sister's, sister in law who is a Doctor, and her husband is a surgeon in Texas. THIS TOPS IT ALL...After reading her prognosis, they were the ones who sat us down and and explained to us everything my mom had. which was 4 times worse that what the oncologist said. They had said the cancer has spread everywhere, and that she's only guaranteed to live 3-6 months. Now we're going to Cancer Treatment Centers of America, to see what they have to say. We're not giving up at all, we're going to do what it takes to get her through this. FAITH &A LOT OF PRAYER from our entire family and friends. It's really, really, really hard for my family, this is something that we never could imagine going through. This is something that you read about and wouldn't think could happen to us. I feel as if this is the biggest Nightmare in the world, everything has landed on our laps in just 3 weeks... We leave to CTCA in 2 days, and my mom is anxious. which makes us anxious to see what they have to offer. I'll definitely keep in touch with you on the experience that we are going to recieve. If you want to know a little more about them, you can visit their site, www.cancercenter.com. Thank you for your time, and I'll be praying for you! Take care of yourself too, because your mother needs you....",

      "Content": "Hi Tracey, My name is Dalila and I'm also new to this board. I know that you wrote this back in June, however it sounds similar to what I'm going through with my mom. She was diagnosed Sept 22, 2003 a 3rd time with Breast Cancer IV mets to the liver and bones. She's currently on chemo and that's it. How is your mom doing? What has been the outcome of any other meds or information for her condition? I will keep both of our Mother's and you in my prayers. Dalila in Texas",
