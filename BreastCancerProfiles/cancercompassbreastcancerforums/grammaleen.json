      "Content": "I have been on Xeloda for several months at a dose or 500 mg, 4 pills twice per day, one week on and one week off.  I have experienced minimal hand and foot problems, but the fatigue has been debilitating.  I wasn't sure if it was the med or the underying cancer.  I was just off off it or 4 weeks because I got married and I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle,  and I feel terrific.    I restarted the Zeloda at 3 pills twice per day, and I'm waiting for the horrible fatigue and listlessness to start again.. I have frequently asked myself what is the use of being alive if I spend the entire day in bed?  I also don't want to eat, food tastes funny, and my mouth is severely dry.  I am trying Ritalin (an ADHD drug) to see if that energises me .  I will let you know.    I have considered forced activity to help with the fatigue. (I don't know how you force yourself to be active)  Maybe a movie date with some frinds even if I don't feel like going.  Let me know if you find any answers I am a 67 year old woman with widely metastatic triple negative cancer; the primary was 7 years ago.  I am highly functional when not on Zeloda.  But then, so is my cancer.",
