      "Content": "Hi Amy and Ryan,  My Mom has had Breast Cancer since 1982.  She had a mastectomy in '82 and back then they didn't do chemo.  The cancer metastisized in her lungs and bone in 1996.  She has been doing hormonal treatments and also gets a month injection to increase bone density.  She leads a very active life and has been doing very well.  I went with her to her anually check up and asked the doctor if he would do a CAT Scan.  They did the scan and found a few tumors on her liver, so she is going to be doing chemo for the first time.  I think I have been in denial that she has stage 4 Cancer because it hasn't progressed in the last 10 years.  I am praying that the chemo gets rid of the new tumors.   My Mom has been a role model for me that someone can live with cancer for a very long time.  My Mom says that I am now her role model for getting through chemo.  I had a stage 1 tumor taken out almost 2 years ago and did 5 months of chemo, 2 months of radiation, 1 year of Herceptin and will do 5 years of Tamoxifen.  It really wasn't that bad.  I worked through most of my chemo.  I think it is harder thinking about my Mom going through it than it was for me to do it.  Luckily, her doctor said that she won't loose her hair and that the drugs don't have too many side effects.  Have your Moms tried acupuncture and chinese herbs?  I did these and think they helped.  It's hard to really know because I haven't experienced chemo without them:)  I know how scary it is to have a Mom with cancer.  I feel very blessed that my Mom has done so well for so long and pray that this continues.  I will keep you Moms in my prayers as well.  Take care,  Betsy  ",
