    "Content": "My sister underwent DIEP Flap last October at the same time she had her bilateral mastectomies.  I am also getting DIEP next month.  She told me that the main thing is to have strong lower body strength, because you will be utilizing your bottom/legs to get yourself up.  Her recovery was pretty uneventful - and good.  She was walking the night of surgery and continued to do a little each day.  She is going in for stage 2 in July (she had chemo for the last 5 months). ",
