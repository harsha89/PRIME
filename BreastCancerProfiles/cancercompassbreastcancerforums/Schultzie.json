      "Content": "I was just given the crappie news and before I have even had surgery/treatments I owe 4,000. Does anyone know the name of a back up insurance plan.  I have Assurant and they pay very little. I was unemployed supporting daughter and 2 grandchildren. Just returned to work 6 months ago and now make too much money for aide.  Is there a plan that I can buy to help financially then I'll be able to not worry about losing my home as well as parts of my body. Thanks for reading and any info will be followed up.",
