      "Content": "I was able to work during my treatments & I timed it so I was sick on the weekends. I had treatments every 2 weeks and felt good 11 or 12 days out of 14...not too bad. I had a Grandchild to enjoy and my kids & husband. I stayed strong for them. I exercised during all this minus a few days here and there. It definitely changes your life for the better. My experience was not bad and it made me a stronger person and I'm happier now than before.",

      "Content": "I went through pretty much the same thing 3 years ago. My surgeon was a Female and after she explained everything (lobular invasive cancer) to me it was quite clear a masectomy was the answer. Right after chemo I had a second masectomy and I feel great!They actually found a second cancer during my first masectomy and they found radial scaring on my 2nd masectomy. The Dr. said that I probably would have developed cancer in my other breast within the next 5 years. My gyno is a male and couldn't understand why I chose a masectomy. I read an article that the majority of male Dr's lean towards lumpectomies and female Dr's with a masectomy. It's an individual decision & you decided what is best for you. Good luck!!! It will get better for you!!!!!!",

I have no family history, and was too young to have had a single mamm prior to finding the lump in my right breast. I had right breast mastectomy  (cancer was over 5 cm), aggressive chemo and radiation. Now I wish I would have been more aggressive in my wish to have both breasts removed. However, at the time I was very distraught and confused. I listed to my Oncologist's recommendations and had only the cancerous breast removed. I cannot take hormone suppression therapy, because I developed severe blood clots in my juggular vein and down my right are 3-weeks into treatment with Arimidex. Needless to say, I feel like my left breast is a ticking time-bomb. I did (against my oncologists wishes), have my ovaries removed to cut down on the estrogen in my body since I can not take the Arimidex, which was supposed to be a big part of my treatment plan. I have approached my oncologist about having my remaining breast removed and he shuts me down and will not really discuss it with me at all. My oncologist is an older male, and has been doing this a long, long time, so I wonder if he is right, or if I am. The mental stress this causes alone should be reason to have this done. I never want to go through this again, and have no reason to keep my left breast. I do not even care to have reconstructive surgery, even though I have discussed it at length with two top plastic surgeons in the state; it is just not that important to me. My husband is just glad I am here and does not care about my missing breast (he is a leg man anyway). I was not even given the opportunity to have gene testing done, which bothers me too. I have a mother, sister and niece, so the gene testing is important for them too. I think when I see the oncologist in January, I am going to request gene testing and go from there. We have a new, wonderful female surgical oncologist in the area, and I will get a second opinion from her if needed. However, I am afraid of offending my current oncologist. If my cancer would come back, I would most likely receive treatment from him, and I hate to burn bridges. Can anyone offer guidance here? I discussed having a second mastectomy with my plastic surgeon & he said to discuss with my surgeon.  She completely understood and as soon as I finished my chemo I had the 2nd surgery done.  I feel great and I don't feel like a ticking time bomb.  Neither one of my doctors had any issues with having a 2nd mastectomy.  Both actually agreed.  I then had breast reconstruction and it was the best thing for me.  I feel great and I look pretty darn good!  Don't be afraid of offending anyone...You need to do what's best for you!!!",

You should be happy so many people are concerned about you.  These people are not ignorant and nosey,  they are people who are concerned about you.  The heathcare field is not telling anyone, it's your friends and family.  Be thankful for everyone's kindness.  You are going through a very rough time right now and you can use all the kindness and support people give you. Best of luck on your apnt.
