      "Content": "Hi, I'm Linda, I'm 46, had a hysterectomy about 5 yrs ago, left 1 ovary. Just about 2 wks ago both my breasts became extremely sore and tender. My nipples are hard and erect all the time. I normally hate to wear a bra but with my \"boobs\" being so sore I have to sleep in a bra. I am not sexually active. I do have breast cancer on both sides of my family. My maternal grandmother died about 10 yrs ago from breast cancer. I just wonder if my symptoms could be a sign of breast cancer???? I haven't had a mammogram but I am going to get an appt. tomorrow. Anyone have any of these symptoms? Please help me, I'm scared to death.",
