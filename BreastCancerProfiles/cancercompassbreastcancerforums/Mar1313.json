    "Content": "I started taking Aromasin two months ago after quitting femara (took femarra over a year after 3 years of tamoxifen).  Joint pain seems to be less on aromasin, but I am having a strange vibration sensation in my whole body.  Feels like an earthquake is beginning or I am standing too close to an oncoming train.  My doctor doesn't have anything to say about this.  It's not a normal side effect she claims. Not sure she believes it.  Has anyone else experianced this problem??  Any advise?",
