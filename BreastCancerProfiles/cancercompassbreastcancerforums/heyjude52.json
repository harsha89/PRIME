Spent today getting my wife ready for another test, taking her to the hospital, sitting in the waiting room while she ingested her Barium and had another CAT Scan...those and the MRI's seem to be never ending, followed closely by a never ending stream of visits with her two oncologists. Right now, sitting on pins and needles three years out as we weather another SCARE STORM...A) maybe nothing more than a yeast infection, but doctors found abnormal cells in her pap smear...they will be scheduling some kind of a follow up on this, and B) wife has been having serious abdominal pains (maybe scar tissue) but her oncologist wants to check for abdominal lesions...so we wait. Meanwhile, I am both physically and emotionally SPENT right now...lethargic, cross, tired of sitting on this never ending bubble of uncertainty...I know, sounds selfish.  But three years into it, I am TIRED.  It's even worse, because the woman living in my house with me now is not the woman I married, not the woman that went under the knife three years ago to have the cancer cut from her breast, not the woman even who eight months later had to have a complete hysterectomy. There is not intimacy any more...least ways, not of a sexual kind.  She is angry most of the time, and when she is not angry, her sadness, her bitterness are almost more than I can bear. Surely I cannot be the only one here on these boards that feels like he is bailing water in a leaking row boat in the middle of a Tsunami and losing ground to the storm fast. What have some of you done to recharge a battery that is on dead empty? Daddy Pops hey daddypops..know what you mean about bailing out the sinking boat..my partner has only a few weeks to survive..it's only been 7 months on this nightmare journey..i can't imagine 3 years .....at least you must have hope she will recover ..i havn't had his arms wrappped around me for quite sometime now. poor guy he just can.t feel the way he used to now this  savage illness he has residing in his body. we have tried everything to reverse the cancer..i will stand by him till the end and make him feel secure with family and loved ones around him. it's the least i can do. i am still living.....",
