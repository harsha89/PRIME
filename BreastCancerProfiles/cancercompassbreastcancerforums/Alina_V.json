      "Content": "I had breast cancer Stage 1 and had surgery and then received chemo and radiation. Now my oncologist wants to put me on \"Tamoxifin\", for 5 years. I read about this drug and it has been known to produce cervical cancers. I am scared and wondered if anyone else has taken Tamoxifin ? Are there any side effects? What happens afterwards? Will we ever stop taking medicines or do we have to take medicines for the rest of our lives?",
