    "Content": "I have been taking Aromasin for about 4 years and have put on about 15 pounds, feel hungry even when I've had a big meal and was wondering about Aromasin interfering with one's metabolism and causing weight gain.  Itook Tamoxifan for 5 years, gained a little weight and then lost it after I stopped taking it.)  A second primary in 2003 and I was put on Aromasin.  Has anyone else had this weight gain experience from Aromasin?  If you have, is there a diet that is safe, healthy and effective that you've used?  I just started on Weight Watchers and hope this will help me curb my apetite and lose the weight. Look forward to hearing from you about your experience and getting your best advice and guidance.   Thanks,   Joan  ",
