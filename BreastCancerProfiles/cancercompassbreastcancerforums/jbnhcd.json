    "Content": "I am so so sorry about your sister! I do know a lady that had breast cancer when she was 38, it spread to her liver, brain, stomach and everywhere else. They said she wouldn't make it and that was 7 years ago and she is doing great today. So, never stop praying for a miracle. I know if it was my sister I would be praying just like you are! Again I am so sorry and will also say a prayer for you and your sister and family!",
