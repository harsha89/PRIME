    "Content": "Hi my Question is this.  My younger sister has had a lumpectomy,along with 8 limphnodes removed, Has had heavy drainage, and wound from surgery opened up and has been draining since surgery in April of 2006.  She is Done with Chemo (thank goodness) and is getting herseptin every 3 weeks for the next year and radiation starts this Mon. On her whole breast with a very deep and sore wound on this breast.  I'm very concerned for her comfort let alone her next hurtle with radiation.  I guess my Question is this. Has this happened to anyone else?  Her sugeon has said clean and pack this wound daily and she dose it dilegently. It refuses to heal. it has started to drain again.  She also is suppose to have a mamo this month.  Really needing some advice. Really concerned for my younger sister.  Thank you Sue",
