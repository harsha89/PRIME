He also lives four and a half hours away and i knew he wouldnt be able to see me unless someone picked him up. I had to phone him and believe it or not he was alot calmer than i thought he would be.I think i cried more then he did. Telll your mom she might surprise you.My dad was my greatest  supporter. One thing he said to me was that as a parent it was his worst nightmare but he beleived in me and knew i was a fighter. Good luck to you i hope i helped.Just remember that we as parents love uncondtionaly and when our children are at their weakest we become stronger . Im sure your mom will be ok. i know as our parents get older we worry about what to tell them but they are our parents and they need to know",

I recently had some spotting (not like a regular period) and the gyno did D&C and biopsy which came back okay. He recommended I do 4 months of Lupron, and I have had the second shot. The first month wasn't too bad, but now I'm starting to have some pretty uncomfortable side effects: hot flashes, night sweats, anxiety and depression being the worst. My blood work shows that I am menopausal and have been since beginning the Arimidex nearly 2 years ago. I am considering not going ahead with the next 2 Lupron shots. I feel I have been very fortunate so far...my cancer was caught early and the treatments to date have been very tolerable. I don't want to risk a reoccurrence, but I hate feeling this way.  Has anyone else taken this combination of drugs? How have your side effects been? Any info is greatly appreciated. I have been taking lupron and arimidex since completing my chemo and radiation. I was stage 3 with a complete mastectomy. i can understand your frustration with hot flashes night sweats and all those other terrible side affects.  i have been taking both drugs since 2006. I can tell you that the hot flashes and night sweats only last me for about 2 weeks after the injection, but when things get real hot i use a fan that i got and keep on my side of the bed this seems to work.I also have ice packs that i use if things get real hot. Please just remember that you are not alone and as bad as things get for me with feeling depressed i embrase the day and than  count my blessings. i too, wish there was another way but my goal is to keep the cancer away so lupron and armidex are my only hope for now.hope this helped  .  ",

When i was going through my treatments  the knights offered help. I was able to decline so that they might help someone else. also if your community has volanteer fire and rescue squads approach them. Tell them about her condition and ask if they would be willing to hold an event such as a tricky tray, golf outing, spagetti dinner, special dinner dance or even a steak and beer bust(this brings in alot of money where i live).  Im sure they will do something to help.Also approach the pta at the school where her children go ask them if the would hold a fundraiser . its ok to reach out to her community  youll be surprised at the response. I have been a volenteer on our local rescue squad for 21 years and we are always helping with  peolpe such as this. I hoped i helped. Your friend is lucky to have you I hope the best for her. laborerlady",

I  am a fighter so i accepted  my cancer as was ready to fight. My husband was great as well as my daughter,but my son took the news really bad. He  and I were very close but after finding out I had cancer he withdrew himself from my life. He still lives at home but keeps his distants from me. When I was going through my treatments he very rarely came in my room to see how I was and when I had my breast removed he only came to the hospital after my surgery. The worst thing is that he has become an  alcholic and a drug user. This is killing me. All we do is fight and when ever I say anthing  He tells me that this is my fault. His dad and I have offered him rehab but hes says he is fine,but when he gets in trouble he calls us to fix things. My son was a loving caring person who never left the house without kissing me good bye and telling me he loved me I so want that back but I dont know what to do.I blame my cancer on destroying this loving man .He is 25 and  i am so afraid that he is going to  kill himself with drugs and alchol  I just am at my wits end .Any Advice?",

My dr doesnt seem worried about my stage he says my chance of it coming back after treament is about 20%.
