    "Content": "I urge you to be aggressive with your cancer. I, too, have breast cancer, lumpectomy, no lymph nodes and have undergone two courses of chemo (A/C & Taxotere)and am finishing up with 7 weeks (36 treatments) of radiation. It was not easy, but I had to focus on the big picture. The reason I urge you is a girlfriend I met in the infusion center was diagnosed just as we were, but only had the lumpectomy and some radiation. 4 years later she learned the cancer had metastisized to her liver - she recently passed at age 38 and told me she wishes she had had more aggressive treatment, especially as her mother died from breast cancer. I was about to give up on the chemo when I met her and she encouraged me to stay the course. Discuss your concerns about high blood pressure, auto immune system issues and the like at length with your oncologist. I wish you the best.",
