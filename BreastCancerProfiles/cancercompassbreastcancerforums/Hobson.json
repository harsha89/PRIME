Why was breast reduction necessary?  You should have been counseled about the chance for slower healing. Thanks for responding to my question and for the advise. I am using Mederma on the scars. The lumpectomy left my nipple pulled to the side which left my breast looking ugly. I always wished for a breast reduction before my cancer diagnosis because they were very large (46DD) and I experienced a lot of shoulder strain. Thanks again. I shall call my doctor to discuss having pgysical therapy for breast therapy.",

My med. oncologist says that I do not need any medication because he explained that the medication may do more harm than good. My mammogram was fine. Should I worry about not taking medication?",

Everything went well except that the radiated breast feels very stiff and heavy. I do no know if the radiation or surgery is causing this discomfort. If anyone has had this surgery and radiation and is or had such experience and found a treatment (rubbing medicine) to normalize the feel of the breast, let me know.",

I have a burning sensation and it feels very hard and plump. I have a bilateral mammogram apointment next week and was wondering if it is wise to do it. The scars still feels very tight. Any advice and is it normal for radiated breast to have that burning sensation?",
