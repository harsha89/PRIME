      "Content": "I know what you all are going through.  I just lost my mom 12 days ago (9/27/2008).  She went into the hospital on 9/22 and we thought she would just go in for some IV nutrition and then be released back home.  We thought we had at least 6 more months to be with her.  But she died on 9/27.  I have never in my life felt such intense grief.  I feel like there's a hold in my heart that can never be fixed.  I know she was sick; she had been battling breast cancer for almost 9 years.  I just thought I had more time to prepare.  I lost my best friend, the person that I loved most in this world and I feel absolutely lost without her.  It hurts me SO much to go back to her house.  When I walk in, I expect her to be laying on her loveseat watching \"Lifetime\".  I just don't know how to get over this.  My siblings just don't understand; they weren't around much. I was the one who took care of Mom; and I don't regret one day of it.  I grew so much closer to her.  I miss her so very much.  It's an actual physical pain.",

This is the first time I have visited yiur site.  It has helped me realize that so many of us are going thru the same thing.  My sister lost here husband on Sept11 2008 and our Mom died on Sept 14 2008 which was her birthday.  They were one room away from in other and they didn't know it.  The day my brother in law passed we could not go in to see mom because she would know something terrible happened.  My husband went back up that night which the last time she spoke and she was confused but knew what happened.  They made a card for my sister and it was the last time she signed anything.  She lived with us for for last year and I enjoyed every minute of our time together.  She was always my best friend.  It was very hard on my eight year old son.  I cry everyday.  The holidays have been horrible and I'm glad they are done.  Hear is what my son told me the very first time he saw me crying so hard that I could not speak.  He said that I was being selfish because I would not see her anymore, but that she would be free of pain and she was with all the rest of her family that she hadn't seen in years and god and the angels would take care of her now.  Even though I miss her more than I can say I try to remember what my son said and have to smile a little.  Hope this makes you smile a bit.MJThat did make me smile.  :)  I am happy that Mom isn't in any more pain; and I know that she's with her parents in Heaven.  But I can't help but feel sorry for myself, I guess. It's just so hard.  The holidays were hard.  It's been 3 months and the pain of missing her hasn't gotten any better.  And lately, I've just been thinking-I can't remember her voice.  I try and try, but I just can't remember her voice.  And that hurts.  A lot.  I don't know-maybe a person never really trully gets over the death of a parent, especially when that person was their parent't primary caregiver.  I just miss her more than anything.  And I get sad when I think about how she'll never know my children.  I know I'm being selfish for missing her so much, but I just can't help it.  It's an ache that never goes away.  Thanks for the message and I'm so very sorry for your loss.  ",
