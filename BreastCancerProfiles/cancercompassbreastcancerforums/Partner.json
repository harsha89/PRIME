      "Content": "Songbird - please have the biopsy. You have little to lose but everything to gain from having this treatment done. My wife, being a busy working Mother, put off having a small lump examined and now she is fighting cancer. No matter how scared you may be of the biopsy it is nothing compared to dealing with this awful disease. I wish you well and hope you get the all clear.",

      "Content": "Hi My wife was diagnosed with grade III breast cancer a year ago and underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a bilateral mastectomy. She has since followed a course of drugs including tamoxifen. Her white blood cell count dropped after chemo and then recovered slighlty but in the last 6 months it has fallen again dramatically. Our oncologist stopped prescribing tamoxifen a month ago as it was possible that this was the cause but the count has fallen again since then. He is continuing to monitor the situation but is relucant to say what the cause might be - in particular he will not say whether this could be a sign of a recurrance of the cancer. Aside form the obvious fear of infection my wife is very anxious about this and its driving her crazy with worry.  Has anyone out there had a similar experience and do they have any suggestions as to what the cause might be?  ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your helpful comments Tre. You are right, we do need to sit down with Dr again and get a better handle on this - particularly with regard to the staging of the cancer rather than the grading. I am usually quite good at taking on information, but this whole business has turned the world upside down. Good to know there are other people out there who are willing to share their knowledge and experiences - it helps.    ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the input everyone. I appreciate the various suggestions for alternative treatments but we are putting our faith firmly in modern scientific medicine. This dreadful disease can lead to desparation and I am sure some people will seek comfort in \"miracle cures\" - which they have every right to do. Personally we will go with proven science. By way of an update, it seems Lucy's breast tissue was inherently unstable hence their being separate and unrelated tumors in each breast. The right hand side was a rare tubular carcinoma (grade I) which we are confident has been cured by the mastectomy. The grade III tumor on the left side is more of a concern. There is an outside chance it has got into the chest wall and we can't know for sure at this time. Hopefully the chemo and other treatments will deal with that - fingers firmly crossed. Lucy's oncologist did not want to give us a stage rating for the cancer because he felt that, as this is an unusual case, the statistical measure isn't really helpful. I think we both know that, on paper, the stage will be high but the lymph nodes were clear and all that really matters now is that we fight the damn thing as hard as we can. Lucy is being incredibly brave about the whole thing (braver than me). Some good, days some not so good, we are all coping. The girls are handling it well well too and we have prepared them for the impact of the chemotherapy which starts in two days time. Good luck to all of you out there who are going through similar experiences. Hang on in there.",

      "Content": "Hi My beautiful wife (lucy) and the mother of my 3 amazing children (girls aged 6, 8 and 9) had a bi-lateral mastectomy and lymphectomy two weeks ago and starts chemotherapy next week. Things are tough - particularly explaining things to the kids - but we are handling it as best we can. I have a question - the biopsy from surgery showed a grade III cancer on the left and a grade I on the right. The CT scan and the lymph results came back all clear (first bit of good news Lucy has had since this began). Does the fact that the cancer occured in both breasts mean that it is in fact metastatic, despite the CT and lymph results, or is the occurunce of cancer in both breasts considered a 'localised' event? The oncologist did try to explain this but it sometimes hard to take it all in at the time.",

      "Content": "Hi I posted a message a few weeks back after my wife had just undergone a double mastectomy following diagnosis of two separate tumors - grade III left side and grade I right side. Lucy had been coping really well with the pressure and was philosophical about the affects of hair loss following the first course of chemo - until she read an article in a magazine a couple of days ago about people who had died as a result of breast cancer. This has really rocked her and sent her into a terrible bout of depression which is so uncharacteristic. My wife is surrounded by friends and family offering support and I am doing what I can, but she is so down at the moment it is hard to break through. We have three wonderful little girls aged 10, 8 and 6 and it is so heartbreaking trying to keep family life \"normal\" for them when Mummy is crying a lot and feeling unwell. They just don't deserve this and nor does my lovely wife. I guess there is nothing anyone can really say or do to change things, we have just got to ride out this storm and hope for the best - I just needed to have a moan and get it off my chest. Solidarity and best wishes to all who are going through similar exepriences.  ",
