    "Content": "I am trying to decide my course of action. I am estrogen positive and grade 3. All diagnostic testing shows only one breast compromised. The decision between lumpectomy/mastectomy is difficult. I would be interested in speaking with anyone who has or has had a similar diagnosis. Is there anything else I should consider before I make my decision. Thank you in advance for any information shared!",
