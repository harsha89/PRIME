    "Content": "In May of 2007, I got the news that I had always dreaded/feared.  Since December, 1996, I had taken Estrotest due to an complete hysterectomy.  I was 44 years old and working at the FBI.  I argued with my doctor about taking that damn pill but I gave in and took it for 9 years with my gynocologist telling me every yearly exam that everything is alright.  The ninth year I started weaning myself off of it and by that time it was too late.  I will always believe that the Estrotest caused the Hormonal Positive cancer in my left breast.   Now I'm on Aromasin and I feel like an old 80 year old women and I'm 56.  I've taken this since September, 2007, and the joint pain just gets worse.  My feet ache and feel like they're swollen in the mornings when I rise from bed and 2 minutes later they're fine.  My knees feel like they could break especially getting up off the couch or folding my legs up under me for very long.  I move so slow, like my 79 year old mother.  I have gained some weight and my hands are swollen.  Just lately, my back feels achy, I know its my bones getting more brittle.  I have a bone-density test yearly and now I have osteoporosis and am now taking Boniva.  Sometimes I just want to chance it all and stop taking the Aromasin.  Why are there so many side effects, it's really getting me down and I'm basically an upbeat person, I love life and want my old self back.",
