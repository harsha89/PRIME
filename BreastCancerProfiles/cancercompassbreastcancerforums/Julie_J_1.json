      "Content": "I also took Femara for about 3 years after mastectomy, chemo, radiation and Tamoxifen.  I experienced no problems other minor bone density loss.  I think Femara's benefits far outweigh it's disadvantages.  My prescribing oncologist assured me Femara is a much more effective drug than Tamoxifen.   (I took calcium supplements while on Femara but slight bone loss occurred in spite of it.  Perhaps the bone loss would have been more significant if I hadn't taken the calcium.)   Good luck in fighting your cancer. ",

      "Content": "  On 5/11/2008 ritacliffevale wrote: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in April last year. I had a lumpectomy and a lot of lymph nodes removed. The cancer had spread to one lymph node.I had eight months chemo followed by 15 radium treatments. Apart from an abcess on the operation site, I managed the treatment quite well. (Even the cold cap which I found very painful, but I kept my hair.) My problem now is the awful pain in my joints due to the Arimadex.I know there are a lot of people out there with this problem, but I am finding it hard to cope. I have tried various methods of pain control without success, and at present am on a high dose of slow release Tramadol, but it makes little difference. I wonder if anyone has tried either acupuncture or hypnosis for alleviating pain. I too had the same experience - 4 months of terrible joint pain.  My oncologist switched me to Femara (which is another drug in the same class) and the pain went away. He explained that each person's tolerance is different.  What one person can tolerate is different for another's.  Have a discussion with your oncologist about alternatives. ",
