    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed in 2003 with ER+ node negative breast cancer.  I was on Tamoxifen for about 2 1/2 years.  I became post menopausal and switched to Femara and have been on that for about 2 1/2 years.  While on Tamoxifen my worst side effects were very severe hot flashes, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping.  Once I changed to the Femara, the hot flashes subsided but I still had fatigue.  I did have what I would call hot flushes and I could be freezing one minute and break out in a sweat the next.  It was difficult to get dressed in the mornings because I would sweat so badly.  I felt like I could take 3 or 4 showers a day.  I began developing pain in my hands and fingers which progressed throughout most of my joints and finally in to my feet.  I felt like it was making me old before my time.  I'm 53 and I got around like a 90 year old, it was bad.  After the drive to work or sitting at my desk, I could barely get up and walk.  Once I got going, it was better but seemed I was in pain most of the time.  I am certain now that the Femara was causing it.  I went for my 6 month check up 2 weeks ago and my oncologist said that I could stop taking it.  I'm already beginning to have more energy and the is not nearly as bad.  My doctor said that I should feel a whole lot better after being off the med for a month or so.  I'm 5 years out now and so very thankful!   ",
