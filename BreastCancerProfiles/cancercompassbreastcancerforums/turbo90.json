      "Content": "I am so sorry for your loss.  Chemotherapy is a double-edged sword.  For some, it really does work to shrink tumors and/or eliminate whatever cancer is present within the body.  Other times, it's used just to keep the patient alive for a longer period of time (as part of comfort care).  I don't know what happened to your friend and why;  but I have seen first hand the denial that is so common among cancer patients who are focused on \"getting better\" without the ability to see their own bigger picture.  My friend in the hospital just told me today that the \"Chemo is going to make me feel better and stronger.\"  Uh---no it won't but o.k. that's what she's believing right now.  In the case of my friend, she is end stage multiple cancers that started in her bile duct just since late August.  Sometimes there are no answers to be found.  Your friend had breast cancer and then she died.  As many women do.  Unlike what we are led to believe by the media and all the hype around breast cancer awareness blah blah---not everyone lives who gets it.  Also, the survival rate for any cancer patient 20 years post treatment is miraculous...not expected.  Again, so sorry for your loss.",

      "Content": "It is very difficult to feel something that you know doesn't seem right...and then do what is appropriate and necessary (in a timely manner!) to solve or resolve it.  There's  a saying \"We judge others by their actions, but judge ourselves by our intentions.\"  Sorry---intentions don't cut it when you are the one who is feeling sick and know it and yet don't do what you have to do \"now\" about it.  I have a friend who is dying right now and is still in complete denial about her prognosis and mortality.  She's talking about dancing at Christmas;  she may not even make it to Saturday.  But that's how strong a defense mechanism denial is.  She is also in one of the crappiest hospitals in our whole metropolitan area and yet wouldn't agree to a transfer.  There is no arguing with denial.  All I know I have been doing is going to see her and pray like I've never prayed before. ",
