    "Content": "I am a breast survivor of 2 almost 3 years. I must tell you I am so thankful to be alive. Thankful for drs and nurses that used their gifted hands to help me with this time frame of chemo and radiation. Not an easy thing to go through. But I am here today.  I must say that I lost all my hair ...everywhere. As of today I have very little eyebrows. I do grow hair everywhere else ...but very slowly. After shaving my legs...I dont have to shave for another month.  I am not wanting to complain...but I wish they would have more websites for people that didnt get there hair back all the way. I have hair on my head....but my bang area will not grow. So my hair line recedes back far on my head. I look mighty funny. Also the hair that has grown back is very thin and I cannot do much at all with it. I am not vain...I do take vitamins and also use a Shampoo that is supposed to help with the hair growth. Any others out there that have problems like myself. I wonder if there is a web site that will help with what kind of hair styles to get for this thinning hair and hair that is absent on the head.  I do wear a lot of hats when I go out in public. But not always does it look nice. ",
