    "Content": "Hi everyone. I'm new to the group so please bear with me if I don't know the protocol. My wife was diagnosed with Stage 3c Lobular breast cancer in 2013 and was treated with the usual mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Three years later(2016) it returned having metastised to the peritoneum, retroperitoneum and bones. She has been on Ibrance for 1.5 years.Our scan this week shows that it has progresed to the liver and spine. Her oncologists is talking about switching her to another type of chemo but we seem to get evasive answers from her doctor when we ask about prognosos and survivability. My wife has stated that she is getting tired of all the treatments, blood work and doctor visits. I am doing everything I know to keep her spirits up. Can someone please share any information about what her likely prognosos is? I'm trying to get a straight answer so that she and I can plan for the future. Sorry if I didn't work my questions correctly, it just tends to be a little emotional for me.",
