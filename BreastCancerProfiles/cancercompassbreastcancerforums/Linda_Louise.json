      "Content": "I am glad to hear that I am not the only one experiencing pain from Arimidex and now Aromasin.  I was on Arimidex for 8 months when I gradually started having mainly wrist and knee pain.  I was taking Vicodin and eventually had to add Oxycodone to take care of the pain.  After 16 months and taking 8 Vicodin and 2 Oxycodone a day and still being in pain, I threw in the towel.  One morning I sat on the side of the bed crying because I hurt so bad.  So my oncologist switched me to Aromasin 13 months ago.  The pain is starting to creep back into my life, ugh.   I have started back on taking 2-4 Vicodin a day.  I wish I didn't have to take the Aromasin, but I am too scared to stop taking it.   My oncologist doesn't know how long she wants me to continue with the aromatase inhibitors, does anyone else know how long you have to stay on these?

      "Content": "Thank you for your prayers.  I had not thought of a chiropractor or acupuncture.  I will see if my insurance will cover that.  My oncologist won't telll me how long I have to be on the aromatase inhibitors, but she does say she wants me to take Tamoxifen after that.  Thanks for the 5 year info, maybe that's the marker my oncologist is shooting for, Linda",

JODIE Jodie, My thoughts and prayers are with you. Breast cancer is sneaky.  Hardly a day goes by that I don't wonder if mine will return.  How did you find out that your cancer had returned?  Were you on Tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors?

      "Content": "Jodie, Wow, what a story.  I can imagine you were shocked to find out the second breast cancer diagnosis.  Thank heavens you needed to have surgery and they found that the cancer had returned.  I found a lump in my breast in Aug 2004, I had a \"normal\" mammogram 4 months prior.  I had invasive lobular with lymph node involvement.  I had a radical lumpectomy followed by 4 a/c and 4 Taxol chemo and then 35 radiation. Then I had to get a hysterectomy because of the high risk of ovarian cancer.  Then I started the Arimidex and now I am on the Aromasin,  I am glad to hear you are tolerating the chemo so far and the nausea is not bad!  Keep your chin up and keep up the fight! Linda in K.C.     ",
