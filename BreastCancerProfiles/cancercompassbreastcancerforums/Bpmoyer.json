    "Content": "I am 68; was diagnosed in August, 2006 with breast cancer with metastasis to the liver. After three months on Arimidex with no side effects, a CT scan showed that the liver tumor (there is apparently only one) had not responded (it had grown slightly to 5.4 cm. instead of shrinking). So now I am on Doxil chemo every four weeks. After the third infusion in the beginning of February (2007) I am now getting unpleasant rashes on the feet (I cannot wear shoes, because of the blisters and the soreness), under the breasts, and on the inside of one knee. The blisters are the worst; one blister on my big toe is as big as a nickel and about 1/4 inch high. Thank goodness, my hands have not been affected (I am a violinist). Neutrogena hand cream is pretty good. I put it on thickly about three times a day and wear cotton socks and cotton gloves until it has soaked in. I can not have steroids, because I am diabetic, and steroids cause total havoc with the blood sugar control. Has anyone found a really good remedy for Doxil rash? Some of the pain from the rashes is relieved by anti-yeast cream (Gynelotrimin); but the rash itself does not go away. Bag Balm has been recommended to me; but it is so greasy that I have not wanted to use it. Birgitte",
