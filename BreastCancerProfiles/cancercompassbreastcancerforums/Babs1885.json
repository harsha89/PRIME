      "Content": "Try not to be scared, but please be informed. My opinion is to go to another doctor, preferably a woman doctor. I was diagnosed in 1996, both my biopsys came back negative and yet I had breast cancer and needed a mastectomy. I decided to have both breasts (against my doctors opinion) removed and when removed they found pre cancer in the normal breast. You have to do everything to protect yourself. I am on my third time with this even though I had both removed. I had the \"best\" doctor in New York. She wrote a book with Rosie O'Donnell and yet she left a lymph node in that four years later proved to be my original cancer. I had to go through treatment all over again and six months ago because of that lymph node, it has metastisized. I am on treatment every week but feel fine and confident that I will be ok. My point here is do what you think, doctors as good as they are do not always have the answers. If it was their breast, would they sit and wait for six months????I highly doubt it. Seek another doctor, do not rely on needle biopsy because they are not accurate. Even my MRI the second time said \"probably benign\" and when the lymph node was removed (after I waited four months) my original cancer from 1996 was in it. I know what I am talking about. My sister also had breast cancer and where I live, it seems we could start a club. My friend has a web site called - Stayin Abreast.com. Her name is annie and she is so knowledgable. Go on and get your own information. She is in New York and she was told she did not have breast cancer when all along she had a 7 cm lump in her breast. Get your own info and do not be scared. You will be fine but do not sit back and let some doctor tell you to wait. Waiting does not do anything but make you more anxious. Contact me if you would like. Good luck Barbara",

      "Content": "Most of us believe in Gods healing power but you need to medically address your situation. I also had a lump in my right breast and found out I had lobular breast cancer. Lobular mirrors itself in the other breast in about 5 years. (thank god my husband found out that info for me). I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction. I was told it was not in my lymph nodes and decided upon cmf chemo. (I went to the \"best breast surgeon,Dr. Axelrod in New York) Four years later I found a lump under my right arm and found out that my original cancer was in it and had to undergo chem caf with total hair loss and unbelievable sickness. Had I been told they werent sure rather than it is not in my lymph nodes, I might have decided on the stronger treatment. Anyway my original point was that even though you have a mastectomy, it can come back under your arm (in a lymph node) or in the chest wall. I am now receiving chemo again because this cancer which I was told was in remission is now in my liver. All because a lymph node was left in. I am feeling fine and plan to live a long life. You need to do a little reading and decide for yourself. If you do decide to have a bilateral my suggestion is not to have a tram flat. It is painful and having your breasts removed and stomach surgery at the same time is not a good idea. Have an expander put in and implants. Good luck to you and keep a sense of humor and be surrounded by people who love you and you will be fine.",

      "Content": "I loved reading your message. It was up and up is how you need to be to survive. I am on my third time around and it is the first time I asked why me. I did everything I was supposed to do. I had a bilateral mastectomy. My surgeon (supposedly the best in New York) took out my lymph nodes and told us the good news that it was not in the lymph nodes. However, four years later, we found out that it was not the case. She left in the one that contained the cancer. I went through treatment and radiation (that left me with lymphedema) and had a port put in that broke and almost killed me!!! I lost my hair. Anyway, it has now spread to my liver and I am on chemo again. All this and planning a sweet 16! I too get turned off when I hear people talking about others. I am not an angel but you really put life into perspective when you have something serious going on. I live in a place called Rockaway where everyone helps everyone. I am blessed with a wonderful husband, daughter, and family and friends. Women recently diagnosed feel free to call me and that makes me feel as though I am helping in a small way. I hope things continue to go well for you and always surround yourself with people who care and you will be fine.",
