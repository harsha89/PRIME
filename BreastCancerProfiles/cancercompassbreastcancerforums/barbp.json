      "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2 bc in 2004, mets to 1 lymph node.  Prior to treatment I opted for the mastectomy in the affected breast.  This was after it had been confirmed with MRI that the other breast was cancer free.  After 4 years I still wonder if I should have had a complete mastectomy.  But, you can't worry about the past.  I also had an oncologist that was not postitive about my survival.  Post chemo, he ran the cancer markers and they all came back suspicious except for the breaset which was fine.  I went through a battery of tests and they thought my cancer had spread to the liver.  After a liver biopsy, the diagnosis came back negative and the lesions were thought to be a result of taking oral contraceptives.  I have a new oncologist who is just wonderful.  She watches me like a hawk and never lets me leave her office until all my questions are answered.  If you have a good relationship with your oncologist, I encourage you to talk to him.  You should never feel like he has given up on you.  And Please, do not give up on yourself.  The more positive you are, the more positive your recovery.  God Bless!  ",

I've been on Arimidex since 2/05 and will stop on 2/10. I've always taken a big fish oil capsule with my daily vitamins--and have never had a problem with an Arimidex interaction. I used to have outrageous hot flashes, and my oncologist gave me different prescriptions, now, finally they have dwindled down to a few a week. Good luck! Elizabeth, AKA RVwoman   I am curious about the meds you take for hot flashes.  I too am a 5 year survivor and will be taking my last dose of Arimidex 1/31/2010!  My hot flashes are almost unbearable and seem to be getting worse the longer I am on the Arimidex.  The same is true for the bone and joint issues.  I was given Effexor for the flashes.  I would appreciate you input. I also take fish oil with my Arimidex, there have been no issues.",

      "Content": "My hair came back the same after chemo (2005), blonde and straight.  It did appear thicker when it was shorter.  But now as it's getting longer, it doesn't seem as thick.  When I received my Dx, I cut my hair short.  When it started coming out, about 21days after my 1st chemo treatment, I had my head shaved.  The female barber gave me some excellent advice.  She told me to continue washing my scalp with shampoo, using contitioner, and to give myself a 'scalp massage'.  This would keep the scalp from getting dry and keep the blood flow circulating.  I also started using a product called 'Nioxin' after chemo.  'Nioxin' stimulates hair growth because it promotes a healthy scalp.  My hair grew fast and I kept getting brush cuts until it started growing in even. ",
