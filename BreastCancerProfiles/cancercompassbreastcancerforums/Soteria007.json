While waiting for the result of my biopsy, I can't stop the tears in my eyes thinking of my 3 children my eldest is 18 years old, 2nd 9 and my youngest is 7 years old that really needs my care because i gave birth to him with multiple congenital problem (Hypospadias, imperforate anus & he is a blue baby with TOF) he already underwent series of operations for the correction of the said problem, last year was his Open heart surgery. ..I cried because of my illness, while waiting for the result if what stage is my cancer, i was looking for a furom that could possibly help my tears. I went thru many trials in life that i could say i'm strong enough to handle this but being a human it really hurts me, and asking sometimes why all these things happened to me and to my family. Hope thru this forum i will be able to have strenght. Thank you.... Hello Godismyhealer... I read your message and wanted to hug you through the computer.  My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year so while I do not directly know what you are experiencing and what you have gone through...I do have an idea of some of the challenges that you are dealing with. I want to say first and foremost that your user name says it all.  \"Godismyhealer\".  What you have to do right now is to really and truly believe that is the truth.  Go grab your bible or whatever holy book based on your individual beliefs and pull out passages that have to do with health and healing.  Place these scriptures on note cards that you take with you whereever you go and read to remind yoursel of God's promises for healing.  You are physically a magnet and your attract to you that which you are radiating from.  You must get yourself out of fear doubt and worry.  The more depressed, scared, and stress you are, the weaker your immune system becomes.  I have actually been contemplating putting together a virtual support group for women battling breast cancer - who want to treat their cancer naturally. If that is something that is of interest to you, please contact me and let me now and i will share with you the details.  Blessings & Love to you!",
