      "Content": "I was so happy to find this site. It's so confusing with the treatment and what dr.'s order for patients. I still do not understand alot of it. It's scarey to be alone and wonder if your onc is doing the right thing for you. Maybe with some discussions I can feel better. Thanks",

      "Content": "Just got home from seeing my onc. Because I had a lumpectomy, more like partial mastectomy because of the amount of tissue I had removed, and no node were effected, I did not have to have infused chemo. I started out with Arimidix, Which caused to much pain. Then Went to tomoxifin, and then was told do to high cancer markers to start on the Femara. After 5 months I am crippled with pain. Now he is sending me for a bone scan asap to rule out bone cancer. Kind of upset. Lost 8lbs in 2 months. So, I'm just sitting here worried. I still work a full time job at a VA hospitol, and still hike almost every day. Outlook is alot, The Cancer Treatment Centers have a great rep. Have known people with death sentences who have been given a life again. So good luck to your mom. I'm just haging in and waiting. Thanks for the reply. Chris",

      "Content": "Hi Lori Name is Chris. Just got back from seeing my onc. The Femara has caused me to take pain med and that doesn't work. I'm on Durogesic patches and hydrocodone. He just switched me over to Aromsasin. ASeems like the side effects are going to be almost the same. I also see a pain management dr. for steroids treatments. I'm a high risk fro the cancer to return. So I'm really trying to stay on these drugs, but it isn't easy. Taking the pain meds helps alot because I'm still working a full time job. I hads a lumpectomy a year ago on May 11th. More like a partial mastctomy. (Lost almost half my breast). Today my onc told me I have to have a bone scan asap. Lost 8 lbs in 2months. Im Alittle on edge right now. But can only hope for the best. Hoping the new med won't be as painful. Chris",
