Subsequent installation of an Ommaya Reservoir allowed immediate treatment with methatrexate and cytological review of CSF. CSF showed positive for cancer cells too. She went to stage IV in May of 2004 and was treated with tamoxefen until Nov. Numerous bone mets and liver lesions continued to progress. She had radiation Nov '04 through Jan 05. Then she was put on Herceptin and Carboplatin-taxotere. Along with the Zometa she had been taking since summer '04. We have been told that the treatment of the leptomeningeal mets will make them a non-factor mortality wise. That these mets secondary to breast cancer are treatable. The important thing is to treat the systemic. My wife had several symptoms related to this metastatic progression. 1. Headache 2. Backache 3. Nasuea 4. Saying wrong words in her sentences often (we would just laugh this off) The speech - nausea and headache got real bad and she was admitted to hospital week of Sept 20, 2005. She is very mobile. Was driving and doing most activities up until this hospitalization. I expect her to get back to it. I see the stats on the net and wonder if the oncoogist is in denial. I plan to talk to the nurses and him next Tuesday when we are down there for a treatment. So far, she has had a personality shift. But overall she is feeling better since the nausea and headaches are gone. And she wondering why they are not getting back on her systemic treatment, most recently she was taking Gemzar. Keep her in your thoughts and prayers. I will try to update in weeks ahead. I would appreciate any thoughts-advice and-orencouragement anyone has to give. Thanks Larry Sorry to hear about your wife.  I too was just diagnosed with exactly what she has.  I too am on Gemzar and Zeloda.  Now they are deciding how to proceed with the Carcinomous Meningitis that was found yesterday from the lumbar puncture.  I don't know if one hospital is better over another.  Any advise is welcome.
