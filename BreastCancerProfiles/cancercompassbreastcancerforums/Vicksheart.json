I know i have a amazingly high chance of getting it since she found out she had it when i was a baby, but i dont have anybody to talk to about it at home, i definitetly dont want to tell my dad about it. that would be so akward. But, ive had this pimple like thing on the dark part around my nippple, sorry im not too sure what its called. I thought it was just a pimple type thing, but it wont go away! its been there for like 4 months, but not its all dried, im so scared if its too late. Can someone please help me? Cathy  Cathy,  Go to a female adult that you trust with this.  Do you have an aunt or Grandma or even a guidance counselor that you can talk with?  Never let things go, always be your own best friend and find answers.  You are strong and intelligent, don't stop until you know for sure what is going on with your body.   God Bless,   Vicki    ",
