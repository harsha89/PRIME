      "Content": "Thank you so much Springflower for all your help and apologize for all my questions but u have been so helpful and I thank you. Have talked to a holistic dr. And he recommended two products one being Avemar fermented wheat germ which has shown to be very helpful with cancer cells eliminating many tumors but is very expensive and Wobenzym N, pills of enzymes to support joint pain. This is very difficult to start over and try to do as much as possible organic and get the toxins out of your diet but also is not rocket science if we can get away from the processed foods we might make it, have you heard or used either of these products?",

      "Content": "Dear Springflower, have talked before, I started cur cumin but like the other friend did not know what to get for fucoidan or indole, I have only been on femara a month tried aredia and thought I was dying switched to zometa infusion yesterday not so bad it is doable but the fatigue is insane just with these two drugs how did u get dr to switch you and how long on femara and zometa before the switch. Because almost everything u read says after a couple years it gets bad and so what damage is this doing besides the cancer do u have any idea?",

      "Content": "I was wondering how aggressive they have gotten, I have gone for second opinion and now oncologist radiologist disagrees with oncologist he wants to be aggressive because it was missed 2 years ago, had breast cancer stage 2, 9 years ago but pain in back and everything except biopsy showed matastasise to bone, biopsy missed it and not repeated, so here we are 2 years later with stage IV do not know what to do, positive er her and pr now on femara and the aredia infusion almost killed me. And so this is for the rest of my life is what they are saying. Is all this true? Have been offered radiation to exact spot and 99 per cent can get that spot.",
