    "Content": "Hi group, My name is Dana. My mom passed away 22 months ago from brain cancer,my Dad has lung cancer and NOW my friend,I mean my BEST friend has felt a lump in her breast. She went to Brigham and Woman's Hospital here in Boston and was told it was too small to take a byapsy(??)) I mean haven't we always said early detection early cure ????My step mom had a dbl mas. in order to rid herself of cancer. I let Kate know what she should do in the process of detecting cancer , she did not listen.    I am so pisssed she didn't listen to me when I told her to demand a needle byappsy. I am asking you all as a much more informed group to suggest ways to get Kate to a proper Doctor. Thanxs, Dana ",
