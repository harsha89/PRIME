    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer.  The tumor was 2.5 cm and one node was enlarged and had cancer cells from a needle biopsy.  The cancer was triple negative.  Due to my family history, I was genetically tested and found to have the brca1 defect.  My doctors decided to do neoadjuvant chemo therapy.  Three cycles of taxotere and carboplatin administered every two weeks. I completed the first three rounds of chemo at which time I had a bilateral mastectomy.  I had six nodes removed.  The pathology report came back pathological complete response.  I no longer have cancer according to the pathology report for which I feel so blessed. Now for the questions.  My chemo doctor wants to continue with three more rounds of chemo and the radiologist want to do radiation after the chemo.  Do I really need any more treatments since I no longer have cancer?  I\u2019m just worried that the side effects from the chemo and radiation will do more harm than good at this point.",
