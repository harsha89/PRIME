      "Content": "   I have also been diagnosed with triple negative (ER-, PR- and HERneu2-) breast cancer in 1999.  I underwent a mastectomy (no chemo/radiation) and had a recurrence with surgery in 1/05 .  In 6/05 I received one month of radiation and have been on various chemos since 8/05.  Both are  debiitating. However now they are treating me with Gemzar and Herceptin because my doctor feels even though my cancer indicates triple negative, I am \"acting\" like a positive.  I am very confused by the whole situation because since 8/05 I have been receiving chemo geared towards a hormonal negative diagnosis.  But keep hanging in there - so far none of my treatments have worked but I'm still fighting.  I  also don't come across alot of people with this type of cancer but I keep looking on the Internet for new treatments.  Do yourself a favor and don't lock yourself into one type of treatment.  Look outside the box - sometimes it gives you a different outlook.   On 11/3/2007 gramdma55 wrote: I have just been diagnosed with bc. It is early stages 7mm. I asked the Dr. what kind of cancer and all she told me was common type. Then she told me that my tumor is negative for estrogen and progestrone. I have read and read and cannot find too much information on this negative thing. I lost both my Mom and sister to breast cancer and want to know as much as possible to pass on to my two daughters and niece. I am sceduled for a lumpectomy Nov 15th and then radiation and chemo was out for the breast cancer but following radiation to protect the rest of my body from the cancer cells.  ",

      "Content": "Hi!  In response to our question after I was diagnosed in 1999 at age 48, I insisted on having a mastectomy with reconstruction.  The doctors tried to talk me into a lumptectomy because ,at that point the microcalcifications were microscopic and had not hit the lymph nodes.  Chem/radiation was not part of \"standardized\" treatment required. I basically told my fiance if he was going to leave to do it now because I didn't know what was involved. (Thank God he didn't!) After that I finished up my Masters and began a career as a public school teacher in 9/00.  I also married my childhood sweetheart in 2002. I remained clear and thought I was out of the woods until 1/05 when I found another suspicious lump.  Since then I have had surgery, radiation and have been on chemo since 8/05.  I continued to work through my treatment but the chemo/radiation is so debilitating that I had to retire in 3/06 after only five years of teachinjg.  Now I just try to live and have the best time with my husband and family.  I keep looking on he internet for new treatments.  I have just started writing about my experience on the computer.  I usually don't.  It has changed me physically which also changes your mental outlook - it's inevitable.  You are not the same person. However, although I was a healthy individual, who acted a little young for her age, (rollerblading, ice skating jogging) I try to maintain my sense of humor.  I am by nature a low maintenance individual.  If I cannot attend a function or outing I don't resent my hsuband going alone.  As a matter of fact I think that it is important that he get away from all this every once in awhile for his own mental health.  I guess you can do one or two things with an illness; you can let it take you over or you can fight it out.  I'm trying to fight it out.  You have to try very hard not to think negative thoughts which is hard when none of the chemos to date have been successful.  Hope this helped.  If you need anymore info you can write me.

Thank you!  ",
