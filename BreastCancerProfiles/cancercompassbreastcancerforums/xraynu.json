    "Content": "Okay, I'm sorry, but I can not stand it anymore!  As a registered Mammo tech, I will tell you that it is NOT four pictures of each breast-- it is TWO. Four pics TOTAL!  As for the pain, well. it is different for everyone and the exposure takes mere seconds though it feels like an eternity.  This whole thing of the amount of radiation you receive is why you wait 12 months.  Most insurance companies will not pay if you try to go ONE day before 365 days.(Unless you need follow up work).  Radiologic technology has evolved tremendously since 1928 so I would not hesitate to get a test done especially if it shows calcifications that a ultrasound or MRI will not show.  Thermography can't localize it.  And just know that if you go spend a day at the beach-- forget about the amount of rads you get from a mammogram!  If I should ever have the pleasure of performing your test-- please don't ask about any new test because until the FDA approves it-- it ain't gonna happen!",
