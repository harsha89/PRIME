I don't find any of that GOD crap useful, helpful or worth a second of my time. This is a real thread about dying, I doubt you have ill intent, but please take it somewhere else.Well, Breast, This particularly posting (from Emily) is not about you or for you. The decision about taking it somewhere else is Emily's decision. And, this post is NOT ABOUT DYING. It's about Emily looking for advice about her BFF's cancer diagnosis and how to help her. Being negative and attacking God is NOT helpful advice. Your comment is negative and not answering Emily's question. It's merely a satanic attack. You have absolutely no authority to tell anyone how they should respond. Sincerely, A friend of God Matthew 7:1  our Lord Jesus Christ is our judge. We as Christians don't judge. I will pray for you.",

I read back through the posts and don't see any harsh words or judgements from anyone except Breatr Ca4. I have been involved in the mission field for many years and what I shared and what others shared were encouragements to a woman who may well be facing the end of her life in a short time - a woman who doesn't know God. As Christians we are not judging but praying for her that she does come to know our Heavenly Father while she still can. She obviously didn't want to hear anything about God or read scriptures. We know that we will not touch everyone but we are doing as God and his son instructed us to do. Perhaps, the fact that she left was a good indication that our words were having an effect on her because that means there is still hope. We may be the first, second, or third stepping stone leading to her salvation. We never know when something said will click some time in the future if not now. Everyone here showed her kindness, love, and respect even though it was not returned. To sit back and say nothing would be have been disobedient to God - and especially important to speak up in light of her poor prognosis. .................................................................................................................................................... Mark 14-15. 14 - Afterward He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table; and He reproached them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen. 15 - and He said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. .................................................................................................................................................... We did as Jesus instructs us to several times in the Bible - we took the time to share the Gospel with her - possibly the only time she will have the opportunity to hear it. ....................................According to her, she didn't want to hear any God crap and that is why she left but somewhere down the line she may rethink her position about God................. I have found that at times Christians can be the hardest on and most judgmental of other Christians but then no human being is perfect. Have a blessed day alicekay. ............... Diana There is a difference between instructing God's words with others and being judgmental and cruel . \u201cI hope you find my words helpful as you prepare for you own annihilation.\u201d \u201c It's rude to turn this into your problem and start policing the comments.\u201d \u201cIt's merely a satanic attack. \u201c \u201cThere is no need to respond back because it will just prompt other Christians to share the Gospel with you \u201c  \u201cIf you are looking for a argumentative discussion on theology, I suggest you find a site where life is not so fragile and where your hurtful words will not harm those in the weakest moments in their lives. \u201c This woman has cancer and has the right to feel however she feels. As Christians we need to love everyone regardless of their beliefs and the God I believe in is a kind and loving God. It is people like you and others on this thread that give true Christians a bad name. I will pray that the people here can see the error of their ways. Praise God.",
