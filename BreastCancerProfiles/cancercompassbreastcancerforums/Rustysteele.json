I am taking Prednisone 50mg tabs. This rash is ferociuos loking, and itches like mad. I never experienced it but I saw another women who sat with me in the Chemo room experience a similar reaction.  Tell your oncologist they have other medicine that will treat it.  The rash is most likely a reaction to both Chemo and the Neulasta combined.",

Just recently she has been diagnozed with metastatic breast cancer. It appears that she has developed a secondary spot on her spine.  Her lymph notes are not involved.  She has undergone both radiation and chemo and to my great sadness her condition has not improved all that much.  She has been and I believe still is treated for severe bone pain, but her pain is not subsiding.  She has to sleep in a special bed and is currently taking cortisone to help her with the \"overall bone ache throughout her body\" (at least that is how she describes the pain).  I am very concerned for her.  This illness is making her suffer and it is so unfair. She is a great person and despite everything she is going through, she maintains her optimism and hope.  My question is:  what can we, her friends and family, expect in the future and how hopeful can we be about her life expectancy.  I am hoping against hope that her condition will improve, that this is just a temporary set-back.  Her sister is beyond herself with worry and I am just trying to find enough information about her condition.  I know that each case has to be treated separately, but an overall information would be so helful.   Many thanks,   Aranka Aranka, Continue your search for information online about bone cancer especially in the spine. Your friends attitude is going to carry her a long way.  She will sustain herself by staying positive and hopeful.  You must enjoy her life with her one day at a time.  If you do it that way then you may look up and find that she is still here 5 years later then 10 years later.  Enjoy what you have with her and do not worry about how much longer.  Worry is not going to help or change the situation. So be proactive and plan things that can be done to help her enjoy the life she has now.  Change your question to What can we, her friends and family, do now to make sure her life is rich and fulfilling today?",

Do you actually feel any lumps in your breast?  That is one of the indicators of tumors.  Do not panick yet the swelling and tenderness could be a side effect of many things.  Just be prepared just in case cancer is mentioned.  You did not mention your age Could you be pregnant? :)",
