MY MOM'S MOM NEVER NEW SHE HAD IT AS IT SHOWED UP IN HER AUDTOPSY,.(opps..sorry, i hit the cap button) my mom and my two sisters have now been cancer free for over 10 glorious years. my aunt actually died at 32 years of age back in 1960's as it had spread everywhere. back then, they really did not know how to treat it. my mom had a lumpectomy, f/b radiation. my two sisters just had radiation. all 3 took tomaxifil for 5 years. again i repeat....cancer free.  talk to your doctor and think about the options he gives you. a great big hug for you. nan",
