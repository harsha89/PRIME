    "Content": "My wife also is stage 4 breast cancer with mets to the bones and liver.  For the lkast 3 weeks she also has been experiencing tumor fever.  Simply put as I understand it, tumor fever is the result of the tumors releasing toxins into the bloodstream.  This will continue to get worse until eventually the buildup of the toxins in the body makes an organ(s) lose function.  Toxic shock then becomes the terminal event.  Please do not stop trying treatments, espeically phase 1 or 2 clincial trials. It is still posiible for just 1 drug to stop the progression and buy enough time for a new drug to appear.. ",
