      "Content": "I am 56 andwas diagnosed in February with a 2cm tumor in left breast. I had 2 biopsies because they found 2 other suspicious spots which ended up not being cancer.  They took all three out and 4 lymph nodes which 1 had a 3mm cancer. I was diagnosed at Stage llA.  They then did oncotype DX testing which came back in the intermediate range at 27. Recurrance rate with just tamoxifen is 16% and with chemo and tamoxifen it is 13% which is not really better. I will have radiation and the tamoxifen but I don't feel the chemo improves my chances of recurrance.  I wish the decision was more clear cut. Also my doctor said if I choose not to have chemo then aromatase inhibitors work better than tamoxifen. Would love others opinion. Thanks",
