    "Content": "My wife was very rude, angry, unfaithful, disrespectful, and a fake Christian before getting breast cancer nearly two years ago. I wasn't a perfect husband but I supported my family well, took us to church, and was helpful and attentive. I only asked for one thing from my wife...A little peace. She began to follow me obsessivly and accuse me of the things she had done so many times herself (multiple infidelities). When she couldn't manipulate me further with her breast cancer, she became vindictive and used her \"cancer\" as a wedge to collapse my entire social and church family support system with lies. She then cleaned out our home, left me with our daughters, and moved to Colorado and squated (free living) in our foreclosing home in the Northern Colorado Springs, CO area. She stole thousands of dollars, lied to everyone we knew, and completely turned our eldest son and his wife against me. This is just the tip of the ice berg of crap that she has done. All the while, hundreds of her friends and church family members are fooled into believing that she was the one that was wronged. If she is the true example of a real Christian than we are all wrong if we believe it. May God condem that evil lying #$%^&! Not all men that divorce their wives after a breast cancer diagnosis are bad. there are exceptions! Some things truly are different than they appear so make sure that you hear BOTH SIDES of the story before making up your mind on this issue...",
