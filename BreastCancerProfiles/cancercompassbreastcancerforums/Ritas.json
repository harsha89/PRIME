    "Content": "Hello,I begin chemo therapy with doxil on Thursday and an interested in others reaction to this drug. It appears to be more potent than the Taxotere I was on 4 yrs ago. My breast cancer has spread to my lungs and liver and have been on a variety of ant-estrogen drugs (Fazlodex, Femara, Aromasin)since the chemo. I am especially concerned about the heart related side effects. The hand and foot does not look like much fun either. Fortunatly, I have a great support system and a good attitude. The biggest disappointment is that I will most likey have to discontinue playing golf!",
