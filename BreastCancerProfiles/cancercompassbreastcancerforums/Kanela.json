    "Content": "hi my name is sandy and i was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.. My husband was the one who found the lump and the dr. confirmed it.. There are large tumors in both breast and a verylarge cyst in my uterus attached to my ovaries.. i started my chem treatments about 4 weeks ago and i am dealing with some of the major effects right now.. the most devastating is the hair loss. I am married and have twins age 2 and a half. and had to recently put them into childare so that they could get care for.. i have some family support but not in my immediate area which is hershey pa. My worst times are when i think about my kids and the changes that they are seeing in me.. but a good friend told me that they are your kids and they will love you no matter what happens or how you look.. so far with all these wonderful new drugs that they have now i have not gotten violently sick but the level of exhaustion as people going thru this now is horrible especially when you have a family to care for.. What i would like is to have a penpal or someone that has gone thru this or is going thru and can help me or just chat for awhile.. if there is anyone who is willing to email me please do at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
