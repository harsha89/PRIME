      "Content": "Have you considered looking into finding a \"naturalist\" in your area that would be willing to help you do some liver detoxing???? I am not sure what your survival rate would be, I too have breast with mets to bones and at first they saw something on my liver.... I went to my naturapath and we started working on the detox and  my next scan came back clean for the spot they had seen on my liver...... I am a stage IV cancer patient, but not stage IV for the liver.... But I highly recommend doing something that won't interfer with your standard treatments and could actually be helpful to your liver..... Where do you live???? Maybe I can help you find someone in your area to work with you...... all the best, Yancy",

I am trying not to think about it being on an organ, but I know nobody in my area with anything like this.  Even at the clinic, I am the youngest person usually there (am 39).  Not too many people with mets breast cancer stage IV.

      "Content": "Dear Rhonda, I am sooo excited to finally meet someone who is my age etc.  Not excited that we have this awful disease!!!  My primary cancer was in my left breast too, I had found a lump in my left arm pit, by the time I got it biopsied it was already stage III.  I also had 2 more tumors in the breast itself.  I underwent 5 months of chemo (every 21 days), I had previously had a partial hysterectomy and so after the chemo they put me on \"lupron\" and \"tamoxifen\".  Since all of my cancer is estrogen postive, the lupron kept me in \"menopause\".  Well, then we had the radiation to the left side and 4 months later I had the tram-flap reconstruction surgery.  Just this past december I went ahead and got the uterus taken out too so that I could get off of the lupron and since the tamoxifen wasn't working for me they took me off of that when I ended up in the hospital for 12 days because I couldn't walk. Why did they not do any chemo or radiation on you???? I don't understand why they would take such a chance.... Anyway, none of my tumor markers went off in the time the cancer was coming back in my bones..... I let the pain in my lower back go on for WAY TOO LONG (i no longer let any pain go for more than 2 weeks) before I asked for an MRI... Last July is when they said my entire pelvic area was loaded with tumors.... Now of course almost all of my bones have some cancer in them.... My spine, my pelvis, femor bones, upper arm bones, sternum, front skull, ribs.  I had a pain pump surgically put in me that feeds my spinal cord pain medicine, so that I can walk.  I also had radiation done to my pelvic area.  I notice you said that they found some in your hip.  I know that the bone pain can be unbearable at times, I hope that your doctors will help you with the pain, if you need it.  I too had bad news again on this past thursday (5-18).  My PET scan revealed exactly what my CAT scan did, that things are getting worse and that indeed there are bigger spots and more spots of cancer on the liver.....  I should find out tomorrow what the doc says he wants to do with the regime that I am on.  I was on the \"femara\" for about 6 months.... When I saw a specialist at Duke Unv.  She stated that \"femara\" is the number one drug right now for breast cancer.  I hope it works for you.  She was a doctor that only works with women who have breast cancer under the age of 40.  She talks with my doctor here in Virginia.  How have they treated did you say your mets to your liver????  Any side effects?  Oh yeah, why did you say that they can not give cancer patients \"placebo's\"? I hope to hear from you again and get to know you better.  My heart is with you, and even though I have the best support system here with me and lots of people to take care of me, no one really understands what it is like to be \"us\".  Thank you for responding .

It is a blinded test and is supposed to be real close to fda approval.... I hope I am actually getting the drug.... I am only 39 and am terrified what my scans will show when I get them at the first of May.  So, I also have been taking some \"B\" complex to help with the fatigue and mostly I just push myself.  I am also anemic, since the cancer is in my bones..... I am on aranesip and zometa, the ararensip is suppose to help with the anemia, and the zometa with the strengthening of the bones..... Maybe your mom could do some of those things.",
