      "Content": "My mom had stage I breast cancer 6 years ago.  She had a lumpectomy and radiation.  She has been on tamoxifen for 5+ years. Recently she had excruciating back pain and they found a fracture in the T9 section of her vertabrae.  After two MRIs, blood work, and other scans, they are unsure as to what caused this fracture. A PETscan showed nothing in any other area of her bones or in any of her organs. So, we are off for a biopsy. My question....has anyone who did have breast cancer have a fracture due to aging/osteoporosis and not breast cancer spreading?  I guess I am looking for hope.  It just seems odd that she has had no reoccurance for 6 years and her blood work is clear, and it is no where else in her body.  Am I dumb to hope??",
