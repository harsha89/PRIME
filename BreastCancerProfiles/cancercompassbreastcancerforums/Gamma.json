I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!!   Hi, I have been reading all of your mesages on the message board about side effects to Aromasin. I started talking Arimidex in Feb of 2008. After a few months I started having severe joint pain in my feet and ankles and some in my hands. I also have swelling and fluid retention so bad in my ankles and feet and toes that I can't bend my feet to walk. I walk on my heels. I have complained to my oncologist several times, but it is like he doesn't care. In between visits to the oncologist, I have visted my family physician and talked to him about it. He put me on Voltaren for the pain.After many complaints to the oncologist, in July of this year he switched me to Aromasin. I have the same side effects. I think worse! My fluid retention was so bad that when I went to my family physician again about it, he had test ran on me for my heart. All is well with my heart. He put me on a water pill. He was worried about me having congestive heart failure since I was so full of fluid. I told him I was going off of the Aromasin because I thought very much so that it was causing all of my problems. He advised me to get a second opinion. I also told the oncologist back in July that I was going off of it. I told him that I felt that if I stayed on that medicine for 3 1/2 more years that I would be in a wheel chair or dead. He advised me not to go off of it. I went off of it this past Sept. 23rd. Only 10 days ago and I am already starting to feel my odd self again and my fluid retention is almost back to normal also.  I'm going to stay off of it a month and see for sure if it was all of my problems, but after 10 days of no Aromasin........... I would almost bet on it right now.",
