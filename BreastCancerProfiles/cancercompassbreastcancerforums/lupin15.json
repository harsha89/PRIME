      "Content": "Hi  I ahve been on all the meds and now on letrozole. All have side effects but i have found this one to be the best of all of them.  I have recently been to my doctors... have had problems with joint pains... started with back neck then hips...now elblows knees and hands. It is arthur as i call it OA. As everyone knows it is taken to stop your body producing estrogen which feeds the cancer. My Gp has said my body is just aged quicky due to treatment and meds.. at present trying to find meds to help. This has been on going as i have problems with my stomach and finding meds has been probmatic. I am at present trying a drug called Arcoxia to see how i go. At present only been on it for a couple of days but the difference it has made to me has been amazing. I can get up and walk without limping in the evening. Ask your GP about this drug. I have been told by him if my stomach cannot cope with this drug dont give up there are others available. Although the letrozole causes me problems the fear of the cancer coming back any time soon for me out ways the pain i have. Go and see your GP and see what he can do for you. Good luck",

Breast removed rads ok for 18 months came back chemio rads. Been clear sice then and may it continue for a long time. I also had terrible side effects with all meds but letrozole has been the best for me.",

Hi I have have been on Arimidex and stayed with it for about 1 year but had to change to really bad pains in hands and feet. (could hardly work first thing in the morning). Also had sickness everyday. Changed to aromasin pains nearly all went and walking was a pleasure again but now about 1 year on i am having pains in my stomach and really bad sickness most of the time and dizzy spells have just started. I am assuming this is the drug and really fed up. I am up the hopsital tomorrow for my MOT and going to ask about this. I have a feeling if you have side effects with one you have them with them all. Just may have to bit the bullet and get on with it. Also lost 8 lbs in 6months or so but not settled....have had bloods chcked and all is well.",

      "Content": "I have side effects on all the tablets and i am on femara..... started off fine in fact no side effects at all...slowely started which i have put down to arthur.... Now i am not sure... hands and feet seem to have been hit again like when i was taking arimidex although it is a little different. I get like sudden like electric shocks in my hands which some times stops me picking up stuff. My feet much the same some times walk Ok next min painful as hell and then i am limping...thankfully it has not been at the same time so far. I have been told that if you have a reaction to one you are more lightly to have it with them all. I have asked whether it is advisable to come off.....have been told as i have had secondary it would be best to remain on forever.... Cannot make my mind up whether to stay on or come off and take the risk of it returning quicker.... keep hopping that some wonder drug would come onto the market. Have this feeling that noone really knows whether it will stop it coming back or it is just helping to delay it??? ",

      "Content": "Hi folks not been on the site for ages but wondered if anyone else has had or is having these problems.. Will try to keep this a short as possible. Quick history.. had breast removed rads ok for 18months.. returned in lymp back of my neck..chemo rads on both neck and ovaries. Now on letrozole after working my way through all the others with various side effects. (That was over 5 years ago last treatment) Have had increasing pains in joints... not all the time so hips ( when rolling over in bed pain waking me up) pins and needles in one hand along with awful pain spasms ( this is on the side i had my breast removed/left side), get pins and needles in feet on and off, knees ache on and off, tired sometime washed out ( thing that is due to not getting a good nights sleep.) Now have muscle aching/arms feel heavy and my right arms hurts to lift but not at the shoulder at the top part of my arm. Stiff in the morning when i get up or after sitting for any length of time. Have this morning i think popped a rib for the second time in a year..( hubby lent on me... a pop sound from my chest with extreme pain-again on the left side). The doctor has been really good.. had scans and bloods done to check the cancer has not sneaked back and everything is clear. It might be that i am just getting old but i am only 53yrs young...... look forward to hearing if anyone else is having these problems and what they do...",
