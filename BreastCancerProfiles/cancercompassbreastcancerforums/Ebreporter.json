      "Content": "I had to write after reading your messages. I can relate to the pain you are all suffering with and the road you've been down with doctors and drugs. I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders placed 7 years ago. The after pain was unbearable. The breast surgeon and plastic surgeon both said they had never heard of that kind of pain. They prescribed all sorts of drugs, recommended psychological therapy....and, of course, never told me it could be nerve damage caused during their operation! It cost me 6 months of crying in bed, until I finally got the answer from the 11th doctor I consulted. He prescribed Neurontin and Effexor (and a Fentanyl patch which I no longer use because I started accupuncture and it really, really helps...also, they have since learned that Fentanyl does not work on nerve damage pain). I've switched from Neurontin to Lyrica. I have no side effects and I am feeling much, much better. I am still in pain everyday, but I can function and do about everything I want to do. I am still very, very annoyed that the surgeons did what they did and that they covered up. I know there are so many other women out there suffering the same thing and I agree that the word needs to get out and these women need to be helped. So many are silently suffering in their homes, unable to cope. Probably many are suicidal....I know I eventually was. I am a journalist and I'm thinking this would be a good Oprah topic. She may avoid it, though, like everyone else...fearing that it will scare women newly diagnosed. My pain specialist told me that up to 30% of mastectomy patients end up with chronic, severe pain, and I have since found many studies that report that. Anyway, just wanted to tell you that I did eventually get decent help and I am \"functioning.\" I know, now, how important that verb is. I was surviving the cancer and dying from the pain. What a crazy situation. But, I knew I wasn't crazy, even if the surgeons were trying to convince my family I was.",

Mariee   Yes, I did have a sudden problem with my cholesterol levels on Arimidex. My total cholesterol when from normal to 321 and my LDL to 213. My doctor put me on Lipitor (and at the same time I stopped taking Arimidex after 5 years on the advice of my oncologist). I don't know whether it was the Lipitor or stopping the Arimidex, but within 3 months my total cholesterol dropped to 164 and my LDL is 93. I suppose I'll take Lipitor forever because I've read about the benefits of it, and I don't have any side effects from it (other than avoiding fatty foods because they cause digestive problems...it sort of self governs your fact intake!).  I assume that is why you said you can't take the cholesterol drugs. Ask the doctor for more advice. Good luck to you.",

I still have a fair amount of pain especially after doing any activity that uses my upper body. I have always been a gardener but many of the activities like pulling weeds, hoeing, using the rototiller, etc. leave me in pain. Will I ever get to where I can do these things again? I am feeling pretty depressed about this. I am thinking that I made a mistake by getting reconstruction. Has anyone else had this problem? Do I just need to give it more time? Deborah Hi, I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders put in during the same operation and ended up in the most excruciating pain I could ever imagine. The surgeons told me for 6 months that they had never heard of pain like that after the operation, and they prescribed all kinds of narcotic pain meds. I had the expanders removed, on both sides, and the pain continued. Finally, I went to a pain management center and found out that my pain was from nerve damage (which the surgeons certainly did not want to tell me about!). After a few years on Neurontin, my pain doctor switched me to Lyrica, I also take Effexor because it helps with pain. They had me on a Fentanyl patch, too, but I started acupuncture last year and it helped so much that I gradually stopped the patch. Since then, the pain doctors told me that they've learned that Fentanyl does not help nerve damage. I am wondering if the pain you still have is from nerve damage. If it is, you should waste no more time getting treated. The longer you wait, the harder it is to stop. Ask your doctor if Lyrica could help. I have no side effects from it, and it enabled me to get my life back.  ",

My docs don't seem to know what to do for it and pain meds have not worked at all. My insurance does not cover alternative therapies. I'd like to hear from others who have experienced this and know if anyone has advice on what might have worked for them. Right now I'm being told to just \"live with it.\" If that's the case, I'd like to have some idea of how long it will last. Thanks for any help you can give me!Hi, I know just what you are going through. I had a bilateral mastectomy 6 years ago and suffered with the \"tightness/pressure\" in my chest that was so horrific that I just laid in bed or on the couch moaning for six months. My surgeons told me to take Vicodin, which did nothing for the pain. I consulted with the pain specialist from the hospital and she tried all different pain pills, but nothing worked. The pain was like what people say it feels like to have a heart attack...crushing, squeezing pain all around my chest that did not stop! They also told me to \"live with it\" and it might get better, or maybe not. I felt like my life was over. I survived the cancer and was dying from the pain after the surgery. Finally, I read an article about nerve damage pain from mastectomies and found my answer. Back then, they used Neurontin and Fentanyl Patches, along with Effexor. I went to the pain management center at Stony Brook University Medical Center (I live on Long Island, NY), and the doctors there put me on that treatment and I literally got my life back....after 6 months of Vicodin, and suffering. Now I take Lyrica, instead of Neurontin (for me there are no side effects with Lyrica), and I started acupuncture last year and it dropped the pain level down about two levels (on the 0-10 pain scale it's about a 2 now). The acupuncture helped enough that I eased off of the Fentanyl completely (and then was told by the doctor that they have learned that Fentanyl does not really work well on nerve damage anyway). So, I guess my advice is get to a good pain management doctor, who knows how to treat nerve damage, and ask about Lyrica and Effexor (because chronic pain depletes your seritonin levels), and start acupuncture treatments. My Empire Blue Cross plan pays for acupuncture. I am amazed that it works, but it really does. Don't let this go on for too long because your brain starts to record the pain signal and it is harder to stop. DON'T JUST \"LIVE WITH IT!\" It is the worse thing you can do. I feel for you because I know that vice-like tightness...I still have it, but it is nothing like it was years ago. Get help ASAP from a pain management center that knows about nerve damage treatment. There is also a very well known doctor who lives in the Boston area named Dr. Daniel Carr. He is a specialist in this...who used to be at Tufts. He told me about 30% of women who have mastectomies end up with this type of chronic pain. Good Luck! Let me know how you make out. Betty  ",
