      "Content": "My 75 year old sister appears to be in her last days, if not hours, in her one year fight with recurrent breast cancer.  She is in the hospital that she retired from 10 years ago.  She worked in all of the units including a stint in surgery.  Her longest was in geriatrics where she served as head nurse for many years.  We are all God's special children but she is one of those special souls that is loved and respected by all.  Always cheerfull and smiling and has been my role model in my fight with colon cancer.  I have never heard her gossip or say a bad word about anybody.  We always hold out for a miracle and pray to God that she will survive.  But, the reality is that she will be in God's loving hands shortly  She has never complained or given up hope.  She is a fighter.. My other sister went to visit her today and said she is under heavy sedation and is being kept as comfortable as possible.  She touched her cheek, told her she loved her and is sitting in vigil for all of us in the family.  This is the third in our immediate family to be taken by this horrible disease.  My Father by lung cancer and my mother by brain cancer.  God Bless and Good Luck to you all.",

      "Content": "Hi Linda - I am NED after 3 years fighting colon cancer.  My last two PET scans showed no evidence of metastices for tumors.  They have completed 6 months of chemo and we will be scanning in Dec again to see what the situation is.  It is fairly common practice to hold off on additional chemo until some time passes to check again.  Six months seems to be fairly typical.  If you are uncomfortable with this get a second opinion asap to help settle your mind.  Good Luck and God Bless!",

      "Content": "I would \"stimulate\" a father and a son in this situation.  This is inexcusable behavior on their part.  If they can't clearly see the negative effects that this conflict is having and how it is impacting their wife and mother, they should be ashamed of themselves.  I don't know what the intracacies of these relationships are, but it sounds like to me you have two men who are afraid of their own shadows.  There are other terms I would use but I consider my self a gentleman.  What ever the differences may be or the conflicts that may exist here there is a more direct way of helping this situation, and that is to approach it directly.  Help their Mother and Wife by directly laying it on the line to the daughter in law.  All of them need to sit down together with a third party counselor and resolve the issue.  Rather than take the bits and pieces that are offered through babysitting, etc., go for the long lasting more harmonius relationship that could result through a very clear understading of each others positions.  I was a drug and alchohol counselor for many years, and I found through this approach. that people could be more reasonable and understanding.  There are many professionals out there who specialize in this type of conflict resolution.  I would contact one of them and have a one on one to discuss the situation.  It could work -nothing ventured nothing gained.  Tre and others have provided some excellent ideas to help compensate for the void that exists.  I would follow through with them concurrently with whatever else you decide to do.  Grab on to some reserve enaergy and get tough with these---------------s.  This is you life and your grandson!!",

In addition. I fight like hell and stay positive and so far I am beating the monster.  I would suggest that all of us who are fighting cancer take advantage of all that is there for us!",
