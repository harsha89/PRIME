    "Content": "My wife has stage 4 breast cancer and finished 10 radiation treatments to control bone metastasis on her hip last week. A few days after the last treatment she became exhausted and weak, can't eat, is light headed and sleeping 16 hours a day. Are these typical symptoms from radiation? The oncologist instructed to stop taking tamoxifen in case this was causing/contributing to her problems. Anyone have any experience or thoughts on this?      ",
