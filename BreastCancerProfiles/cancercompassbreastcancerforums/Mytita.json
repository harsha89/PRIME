      "Content": "Hi Tre,  Thank you so much for your response. I poured over your website and took lots of notes. I take a mutivitamin, Vit. D-3, additional calcium, fish oil and an apirin daily and have done so for the last two years. I intend to visit my local natural health foods store and look for some of the other ones you recommended. My medical oncologist has suggested that I go off Aramidex for three weeks and then come see him. We want to see if all the aches, pains in joints, etc can be attributed to the med. I am also now on Fosamax, which has questionable side effects. He and I will discuss the cessation of Aramidex, trying another one or going med free. I think it a question of quality of life. He told me once that I probably would have 20 good years left. I told him I wanted more and he clarified his statement that he meant 20 GOOD years, who knows what the rest of my time holds. I am afraid that if I continue taking these estrogen inhibiting drugs I may live 20 years crippled....who knows. Even cancer free it is the disease that just keeps giving.... Mytita",

I'm not sure if by saying \"pill-free\" you mean just prescription drugs, or both conventional medicines AND supplements. If you want to reduce your risk of recurrence while living absolutely pill-free - no supplements, you would have to do so with diet and exercise alone.  It's possible, but it's a rough road and it takes tremendous commitment and determination.  However, if you are willing to take natural supplements, there is actually a lot you can do in addition to diet and exercise to minimize your risk of recurrence, while regaining your physical health. You can see an example of a natural anti-estrogen regimen on my blog:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Please feel free to use the email link provided on the blog if you have questions.  I highly recommend that you seek the advice of a naturopathic or other holistic practitioner to determine the regimen that might be best for you.  Sincerely, Tre    ",

      "Content": "Hi Maryann, I went back to my oncologist after being off Arimadex for three weeks, I think I feel fewer aches and pains....but who knows..I am 67 and active but we all develop aches. Anyway I was prepared to go off all prescription meds and do an alternative treatment with vitamins, etc. But he talked me into trying Tamoxifen. It doesn't affect bones but of course it has it's own side effects....primarily blood clots. He assured me by saying since I had taken the birth control pills for years and HRT for 10 years and had not developed any of those issues I was low risk.BUT, I think it is causing constipation...nothing to back that up but I would like to hear what other women out there have experienced with Tamoxifen.

I too took HRT for 10 yrs and took pride in the fact that my bones are in great shape. I worry about fractures, etc. if I take this med. I'm going my doctor today, (surgeon), and I know she's going to insist I start taking this med. I'm bringing all the info I have on it plus the side-effects and showing it to her. I had Stage I cancer in my right breast with 21 lymph nodes removed (all negative). After radiation, my breast looks horrible. I have lumps and bumps all over my breast due to lymph fluid, so I'm told by the radiologist. I shall find out today.... Good luck to you, I know what your going through. Maryann  ",

      "Content": "I am a two year breast cancer survivor. Everyone always cheers and pats you on the back when you say that but I am discovering that though I am cancer free now I still struggle daily with the aftermath of this disease. I had an estrogen sensitive ( after 12 years of HRT ) small tumor, no lymph nodes involved, radiation and I came through pretty well. I worked the entire time and felt like I was done with the life altering part of this. They put me on Aramidex when I finished my radiation for 5 years. After only 1 1/2 years on the med I had my Dexa bone scan and between 2007 and 2008 I have lost 15% bone density in my hips and femor bones. As my doctor said, that is significant. Now I am afraid of a fall, a broken hip would end my career and my lifestyle. It terrifies me. For most of the last year I have had increasing pain in my joints and began to feel like I was aging and falling apart. I have always worked out and I credit that with my flexibility and strength.So they put me on Fosamax this week, which has it's own side effects. Seems like they just keep giving you another med to combat what the first med does to you. I want to find a better way. My doc has taken me off Aramidex for 3 weeks and then we will look either at another cancer drug or I am considering trying another way to live my life cancer free without taking all these pills.Anybody out there who can tell me their personal experiences and how you have dealt with this. Thanks Carole",
