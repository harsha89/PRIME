      "Content": "Hi, I had a bilateral mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction in May 06.  I was told I definately should not get a mammogram for BC screening.  DIEP reconstruction is delicate microsurgery that you don't want squished between Mammo plates.  I get check ups every year and usually this means surface checks only since my BC was not in my lymph nodes.  I've been doing fine with breast cancer, however I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Thyroid cancer in March of 09.  That is another story for another board.  Best of luck to you.

Donna, This is not the time to be passive about your own healthcare.  I would insist on a biopsy, especially since you have a family history of cancer.  Early detection is key to your health.  I had suspicious clusters of calcifications that I was told was only a 10% chance of it being malignant breast cancer, but it was. I also had a nodule on my thyroid that I had biopsied and was told there was only a 3% chance that it was thyroid cancer but it was.  I also insisted on having a very small black \"ingrown hair follicle\" on my face removed and biopsied and was told that there was no chance that it was cancercerous....well, guess what?  I'm here right now to complain about all this only because I am proactive in my own health.  NO ONE is going to do it for you.  Now is not the time to bury your head in the sand.  Insist on a biopsy sooner than later.

Leemg, I post on the thyroid cancer thread as well as this one.  In fact, there are a couple of us on the thyroid thread that have had both breast and thyroid cancer.  I was diagnosed in March 06 with Stage 1 BC and was diagnosed in March 09 with Stage 3 thyroid cancer with a Tall cell variant (a more aggressive form).  My thyroid cancer was already there when I was diagnosed with breast cancer but went undetected because I was too passive and put too much trust in my doctors at the time.  It is really up to each and every one of us to be proactive in our own healthcare.  After all, you know your own body best and you know when something is wrong despite of what a doctor may tell you to ignore.

I suggest you go to www.breastcancer.org \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breastcancer.org \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.breastcancer.org -- the discussion board there is very active and there are lots of women with experience of both implants and flaps.   Post under the Reconstruction Thread and you will get lots of feedback. Hello, I had a doublemastectomy and DIEP flap reconstruction at BIDMC in Boston.  My surgeon was excellent.  He is at www.bostondiep.com   I don't know if you're near Boston but if you are it would be worth it to check it out.  DIEP recon. is major surgery (12 hours) because it is microsurgery BUT you only have to do it once if you have a double mastectomy.  I did not want implants because I was told that they don't last forever and eventually you have to have them replaced.  I'm in my 40's and I could not picture myself having that type of surgery again when I was in my 60's or 70's because I don't think I'd recover as quickly.  But that just my opinion.  I do know others that have had implants and they love them.   Atomicjoy",
