    "Content": "In 2001, at the age of 38, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Had a masectomy, reconstruction and chemo.  I was a basket case!  My kids were nine and four years old.  I thought about cancer every single minute of every day, I thought I would go crazy as the thoughts were all consuming.  I sought counseling from a psychologist who specializes in treating cancer patients and that really, really helped. The counseling helped get me to the point where I could return to work.  The thoughts went from every minute, to every five minutes, every half hour, then every hour.  Eventually, probably after a solid year I realized that I didn't have cancer thoughts every hour.  I still think about it and I am an eleven year survivor.  I am not going to tell you the thoughts go away completely, but they do become diminished and less scary.  Keep busy, surround yourself with really positive people who make you laugh - laughter really is the best medicine.  I still worry, but know that whatever happens I will be able to deal with it.  I have control over my eating, exercise and attitude but there are some things in life we can't control.  I wish you well.
