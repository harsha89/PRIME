    "Content": "Also, like you, I'm new to this site. I've been on Arimidex for many years. I was switched to Arimidex after taking Tamoxifin for more than a decade. I believed it was a \"better\" treatment. My breast cancer was in 1980 and after 7 years it metastacized into my lung. That was when I began the drug treatments. Like you, at first I didn't notice any side effects. But for the last 2-3 years I've experienced severe pain in my neck and back, specifically in the thorax region. It is truly debilitating at times. My doctor told me it was degenerative arthritus. He said it was probably brought on as a result of the radiation treatment in 1980. But as I read your and other women's remarks who are on this treatment, I have to wonder if it is the Arimidex.",
