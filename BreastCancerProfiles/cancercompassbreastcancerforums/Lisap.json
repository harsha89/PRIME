      "Content": "I also just found out my cancer has spread to my bones and my liver.  My original diagnosis was in 2005 with bi-lateral cancer in both breasts. I had a double complete mastectomy with the usual rounds of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemo and radiation. My breast re-construction failed.  Then after 18 months of chemical menopause, my periods returned, so I had my ovaries removed and was put on aromitase inhibitors. My tumor blood work was fine in Feb. of this year, then two weeks they were measured again and found to be 135.  Quite a jump from normal.  So I did the round of CT and bone scans yesterday to find out I had mets to the bones in 4 spots and also a very large 3\" aggressive lesion on my liver. The doc. wants to biopsy the liver due to the aggressiveness of it.  Also will set up radiation for the bones and put me on chemo again and either Tykerb or Herceptin, depending upon the results of the biopsy.  He did mention doing an embolism to the liver (cutting of the blood supply to that one part) to make that part of the liver die off.  Your liver one of the organs that can regenerate itself, (along with your skin). I thought I had this thing licked.  It's so disappointing to get these results.  My husband is devastated.  I am 46yo with 5 children ages 6-16 and we have no family that can help now or when I die. So, I am not as young as you, but still have a young family - and I can relate.",

      "Content": "I just saw an internal radiologist this week.  He is going to use sirtex or SIR-spheres in my liver.  This is a fairly new procedure for breast cancer mets to the liver as I understand it.  These microscopic radioactive beads go directly to the tumor to kill it.  I also have bone mets, so am a little surprised that they are willing to do this on me (but grateful!).  Does anyone have experience with this treatment yet?  I understand that there probably aren't long term numbers yet.  I am scheduled to go back next week for the docs to map out my veins. Oh, I forgot to say that my tumor is about 6cm long.  I'm also on Tykerb and Xeloda and Aromasin. I'll keep you all informed of how this goes. Lisa ",

      "Content": "My BC was diagnosed with mets to bone and liver in May 2007 and I did great until June 2008 when tumor markers went sky high and subsequent scans showed increased activity in bones (L1 and L2) and also two new spots in lymph nodes in abdomen.  Since then I have had much pain in my back and blood in my urine.  I do have a tiny kidney stone but they say it's too small to cause any problems.  I am very concerned about what is causing my pain and the blood in the urine.  Would the lymph nodes cause so much pain?  I hurt from front to back and can't sleep at night without major painkillers at night. My doctor wants me to start radiation again this week and I think this will help the pain, however, I don't see what would be causing the blood in the urine?  Anybody else have this experience?  ",

      "Content": "Hi there, I was also just recently diagnosed with mets to the bones and liver.  My CA153 levels were high (135).  That is how they found mine.  There really aren't any symptoms for the liver until quite advanced. Then I also had a biopsy done to confirm that it was breast cancer.  Mine was a pretty large lesion, though.  If your spot is too small to biopsy, they will probably just put you on Xeloda and/or Tykerb and watch you for now, although it would be good for them to know if your spot is ER+/- and Her2neu+/- Lisa  ",
