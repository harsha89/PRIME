      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer Sept. 1, 2016. It was a stage 1 and my lymph nodes were all clear. I chose to do the radical thing and had a double mastectomy with reconstruction on Oct. 3, 2016, done at the same time in one surgery! Best thing I ever did! I come off my hrt as of this Friday, I had to come off gradually because of the amount of estradiol I was on! The onco wants me to go on Femara/letrozole, after reading about all the side effects, I want to go natural! Any thoughts? I would appreciate any ideas! Thanking you in advance!",
