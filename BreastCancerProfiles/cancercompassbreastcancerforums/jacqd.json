      "Content": "Hello there.. anyone that has some insight on prognosis  into my story - please pass it on. My sister found a lump in her left breast - on the side towards the armpit about a year ago.  She refused to get it looked at, I'm sure this was out of fear.  At that time it was about the size of a marble.  It is now about the size of a walnut.  She has gone to the doctor.. has had the mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy done.  The have confirmed that it is malignant.  She is scheduled for a mastectomy on Dec 27th.  I understand that every diagnosis is unique,  but realistically... is there ANY chance that this has NOT spread elsewhere.  They won't have answers until after surgery.. but somebody must have some insight into this.  Please and Thank you.   J ",
