      "Content": "Hello Deb, I have heard back from the clinic that I am a good candidate for the surgery. :) I also found out what my out of pocket amount will be, 6500.00. Not bad considering the amount of work and the stay in the hospital and all. I have met other women who have had Dr.'s Sullivan and his team and saw the results and felt the results. Absolutley amazing! I have had Bi-lateral mastectomy with implants, I have had them replaced 4 times in 4 years! I am so tired of having surgeries. I will hopefully get started with the preop requirements in a couple of weeks. I hear the weather is HOT in the summer and humid. I don't care I will be in airconditioned facility. Please keep in touch and we will share our success. I live in Oregon. I too will be traveling a long way. Rosalie",
