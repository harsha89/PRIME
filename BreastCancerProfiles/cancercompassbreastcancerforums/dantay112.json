    "Content": "i'm 44 yo female original diag. of bc in 2000.  I was recently diagnosed with LM last week and I'm DEVASTATED!!!  I need to find that kick to get myself back in the fighting mode.  I am going to try a drug called irotecan? and if that doesn't work I'll ask to be put on Xeloda.  Right now I just had my 2nd WBR and have 12 more to go.  Nothing persay in the spine, but it was diagnosed through MRI of the brain.  Onc. says we caught it early, but I'm going to try defying all odds, I don't know what that is, but I have children to care for!!!  Just needing to get myself back in that fighting mode!  Thank you all for having this site, I hate to read the effects this beast has on us all.   Pam",
