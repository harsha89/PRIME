    "Content": "Hi there, I finished my chemo treatment for stage 3 breast cancer about 4 months ago. I had my right breast removed 8 months ago and most of the glands. ER positive, im not taking tamoxifen,im taking  exemestane which does not cause clotting. During chemo i developed a blood clot in my arm ( the arm i was given the chemo in) i have been taking cartia, low does asprin . Now 4 months later i have developed 2 clots in my right arm and i am about to start taking 5mg warfarin. Im wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them after completing chemo. I had a lot of trouble with my veins collapsing while taking blood for tests,My Dr has ordered blood tests and cancer marker test.   Thank you",
