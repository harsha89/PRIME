Feel like a thousand tiny sand flies all biting at once..over entire body, not just exposed skin. Also skin sensitive to weeding, fire ant poison. Is that from the treatments or from Arimidex?",

I talked to pharmacist and he said that the hot prickly skin was a side effect of arimidex and was capalliaries responding to lack of hormones. I have already been on fosamax, glucosamine chondroitin & calcium. He also suggested to try SAMe and see if it lessens the joint pain. Why did you change from arimidex to aromasin? Thanks again, Jay",
