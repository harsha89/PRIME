In 2004 I had bilateral mastectomies with many lymph nodes removed. I did TAC chemo and 28 rad. Treatments then. I was fine on Arimidex for 5 years then was taken off it. In May of 2011 had back pains and after being treated for possible disk problem I had an MRI which showed mets to bones especially spine and femurs. I had rads to spine for pain which didn't help then gnail implants to both femurs as legs were very fragile. In January 2012 was Dx'ed with mets to lungs and liver so went on Xeloda. I now have had some shrinkage of mets in liver and rest is stable. My doc lets me have 2 weeks off after Xeloda so I can go on holidays for 4 weeks. So far so good and still no expiration date on my foot. My back is still painful but with medication is tolerable. Best wishes for you on your journey....stay strong in spirit and the rest will fall in place. Hi azdeserRat. I have stage 4 breast cancer with mets to lungs, liver, thoracic, lumbar, and pelvic bone that caused severe anemia. My oncologist put me on monthly Xgeva injections and daily Calcium w/ Vit D. I was in unbearable pain when I first started this journey in April 2011. The pain subsided and bone got better by September 2011. I didn't need any blood transfusion since. My bone marrow was able to produce on its own. As for my back pain, it's ranges 0-2 (none to muscle fatique). My lungs and breasts are clear without surgery. I only had chemo and anti-hormone therapy (Arimedex, Lupron, Carboplatin/Taxol, and Doxil). Been focusing on eating healthy, juicing, no sugar, no coffee, reduce stress, and resting. God bless you! Stay strong and positive!",

My oncologist put me on monthly Xgeva injections for the past 1 1/2 yrs. my back has gotten better with minimal pain for the past year. Good luck and stay positive!",
