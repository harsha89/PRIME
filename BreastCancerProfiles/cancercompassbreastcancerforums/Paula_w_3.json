    "Content": "My best friend has been battling breast cancer 9 years which has metastasized to the skin in two forms. One is tumors coming to the surface the other appears as a rash. Besides many different chemos, taxol, zomeda, gemzar, etc. it continues to spread. The skin has been radiated so much that more radiation is not an option. Any other ideas/treatments out there?! Thanks and God Bless!",
