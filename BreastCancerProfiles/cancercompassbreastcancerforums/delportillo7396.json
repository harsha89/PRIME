      "Content": "Two years ago I was diagnosed with DCIS, which is non-invasive breast cancer.  I had surgery to remove the small tumor.  I was very lucky, since I didn't have to do chemotherapy or radiation.  However, the oncologist wanted me to take Letrozole for five years.  I did for seven months, but didn't like the side effects.  I stopped seeing my oncologist because she didn't believe in holistic medicine or that nutrition could make a difference.  I went to an alternative medicine doctor instead.  He suggested myomin, a natural aromatase inhibitor, bitter melon, tumeric with black pepper, calcium with vitamin D, and fish oil supplements.  He also told me no sugar, the only fruits allowed are lemons, limes, organic tomatoes, and organic berries. Buy all organic vegetables, wild fresh caught fish (frozen fish decreases its nutrional value) and organic meats (if you eat meat).  Avoid red meats, dairy, and phytoestrogens (such as flax, soy products, any sesame product like tahini sauce, etc.).  I also use safe products like aragon oil, coconut oil, apricot kernel oil for moisturizers.  I check products out using EWG's (Environmental Working Group) Healthy Living app. You can scan a product to see its rating as far as how dangerous its ingredients are.  It rates things from shampoo to foods.  So far, my mammograms have been clear.  I've read a lot of sources that have mentioned the importance of routine exercize in keeping healthy and cancer free.  I have also read about the anti-cancer effects of shitakee and white button mushrooms. They say three cups of green tea each day as well.  I jazz my tea with cinnamon, clove and cardamon.  All have anti-cancer benefits.  I know my cancer was minimal compared to others, but it scared the hell out of me.  After reading up on clinical studies and doing a ton of research, I think the key to being cancer free is to build up our immune system as much as possible and making healthy choices regarding what we ingest, put on our bodies, and surrounding ourselves with positive people and if possible, reduce stress.  ",
