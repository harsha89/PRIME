( I have been told that I will probably be on medication for the rest of my life).    I suggest you look at the scientific work (not the advertising) on Japanese mushroom extract, which I understand is used as an adjunct almost universally by patients on chemotherapy in Japan (except for blood cancer patients). I have taken AHCC+ with chemotherapy for nine months and have had no significant hair loss or nausea. The mushrooms are an old folk remedy in Japan and seem to have some enzymes in them that have a number of benefits not only for mushrooms but also for people. For example, they boost the observed activity within natural killer cells. AHCC+ and other such preparations have standardized doses. I curently take three 1,000 mg capsules a day and will drop to one a day when symptoms are entirely gone. The mushroom extract is not a cure and not a substitute for medical treatment, but do appear to have some real benefits. There has been no little or no research on this in the United States, but there is a medical society in Japan with about 300 physician members.  ",
