      "Content": "The key in cancer is an early detection. cancer detection is done through the ONCOblot blood test. The ONCOblot test helps detect early forms of cancer by identifying the ENOX2 protein, which only exists on the surface of malignant cancer cells. Cancer cells can be detected before symptoms appear and in early stages of development. Unlike other tests, the ONCOblot uses only one test to reveal all major forms of cancer. This test is highly sensitive and is a valuable tool in early diagnosis and early treatment of cancer. I've done it and I'm treating myself by taking capsol t every 4 hours.",
