      "Content": "I joined this website because I truly need some guidance and support right now.  Please help!  Although I am not the one with cancer it is my My mom that was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  My mom was officially diagnosed last year but she has previously been hiding the fact that she now has stage 4 bone cancer because she did not want to upset me or my sisters.  At this point because of the bone metastasis the doctors say that there is no reason to do breast surgery.  The doctor also stated that the cancer is triple positive.. what does this mean!?  My mom is currently taking Femara 2.5mg daily and is getting zoledranic acid injections every 3 months.  Why not radiation?  What else can she do?  I apologize for the rambling, but I am truly at a loss and devastation right now.  I am 33 years old and an RN so you would think that I would be taking this better... but I truly cannot imagine a life without my mom... and I just don't know what to do or how to help or what to expect?  Any thoughts or feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you so much.",
