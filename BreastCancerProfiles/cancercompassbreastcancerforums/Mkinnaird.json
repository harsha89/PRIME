There are days when I feel like I am 90 years old. I am 57.  I am going to try the gluten free diet you suggested.  I just keep telling myself it's better than having a reoccurence I have been on this hideous drug for 1 yr 5 mos. Feel like my mother who is almost 90 yrs. old. Before getting on this drug, I was running five days a week and at least one half marathon a year. Now I am lucky to get out of bed without feeling my ankles and knees which are filled with aches and pains. Coincidently, last year I ended up with two orthoscopic surgerys, one on each knee. I never had knee pain before starting this drug. I have gained 15 pounds and no matter what I do, I cannot lose weight. My hair has thined and my mind is slow and cloudy. Hot flashes are out of control and legs crawl all night. My gut says get off this drug. Do I did; I am already feeling 50% better within days. Go figure!!!!!!! Signed, NOT A FAN of Arimidex!!",
