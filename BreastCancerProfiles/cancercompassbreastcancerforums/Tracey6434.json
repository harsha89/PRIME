What I am finding, is that just because someone else's experience may SEEM worse off than mine, it's still my experince and I need to get through this and need help sometimes too. I have taken Nuerontin. However, it really didn't help me at all. I say if the dr is ok with your hydrcodone use then be ok with that. You deserve relief and sleep Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am hoping someone can help me because I am not finding much current on this on any boards. I am 17 days post bilateral mast and still have the drains in. They're still draining between 50 - 60 cc a day. S I doubt they'll be removed today either. Surgeon said 30 cc. But my question is this. I am still having horrible pain mostly uder my arms from sentinel node bio's on both sides and the drains I guess. But n having shootin burning pain in shoulder and across my chest. Still taking the 10mg of Oxycodone every 4-5 hours. Plus tylenol because all the ibuprofen I'd been taking for years has messed up my stomach. Has anyone else had this much pain for so long? I feel like a wimp and a baby.",

      "Content": "Laurie, Good luck with your procedures on the 10th. I know only one thing for sure. Well, maybe a few, lol! One, do not take everything you read or hear about others experiences to be your own. I was told having my drains removed was going to  be excrutiating. Well, I had them out today and I didn't even know he was almost done pulling them. And I didn't even take pain med because I had to drive myself. And the other is that my experience is mine and everyone is completely different. I wish you well. I'm here if you ever want to chat. Tracey",

      "Content": "Well, I don't know about feeling better. It's just different pain now. Thw surgeon was leary about giving me more pain meds but did. Hw said try and stay away from them. And this will be the last one I will give. So, I will have to deal with it another way and use them mostly at night when it's the worst I guess. However, I want to add, there are not many recent posts about a lot of mastectomy issuea on the internet. Many are from 2007 etc. So, I'm trying to post as much about my experience as possible. My drain removal did not hurt at all. So, although everyone is different. When that time comes for you, don't panic and remember your experience will be your own. Now I need to find sme info on relief of the tightness in my incisions and under my arms. UGH! Thinking about you.",
