    "Content": "I have metastatic breast cancer (liver,lungs, lymph glands and bones) and have had for two years.  I completed a 6 month course of FEC chemo which shrank the tumours.  I have just completed a 6 month course of Xeloda (500mg) daily for two weeks and Vinorelbine intravenously once weekly for two weeks.  I have one free week after the two weeks of treatment.  I am pleased to say that my hair is still intact, no sore skin on feet or hands at all.  Only mild diarrhoea which is really not a problem.  Side effects I have had are extreme indigestion and wind.  I have had a 'bloating' problem only twice in the six months.  I find pasta and bran cause me a problem.  One big side effect is a metallic taste in my mouth which has completely spoilt my love of white wine!  The good news is that in the six months I have had no new tumours, the bad news is that the tumour on the liver is still growing despite the chemo.  I will stay on Xeloda for the next 3 months or until a new tumour appears and or a significant growth spurt on the liver (reduced at moment to .5cm every 2 months - 6.7cm at present).  I will be honest and say I am well, look well, and a comment from the medical staff at the hospital said I looked as though I shouldn't be going to hospital! long may it continue.  I wish all of you, with cancer, the very best of good wishes, always believe in hope.",
