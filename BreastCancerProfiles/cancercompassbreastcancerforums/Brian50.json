    "Content": "I received a Whipple on November 3 for Ampulla cancer. I was having a problem with diarrhea and going all the time. I had a lit of gas and it affected my job. It affected my job so much my company let me go. I am devastated and scared and some what relieved as the pressure was taking its toll. I went to the gastro doctor and he prescribed 3 Creon before each meal. This has helped. He also prescribed Imodium, not the over the counter type. I have not taken the Imodium. I basically was starving, before surgery I weight 172 and now I am 140. I hope to start gaining some weight soon. I have 3 sisters who have cancer, 2 with breast and one with colon that spread to her liver. I am looking for a new job and anticipating suing the hospital group, I worked for. Yes I said Hospital Group\u2026 Nice Christians\u2026. May God Bless all of you. Brian50",
