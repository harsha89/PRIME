    "Content": "My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer in 1/06 and had a double masectomy in 2/06. She will be starting chemo the last week of 3/06 and is worried that she will be too ill to work throughout her treatments. She is constantly stressed about $$$ and fears that her lack of working will make her fall behind on her bills. She just barely gets by as is. Our whole family is trying to help as much as possible, but me and my 3 sisters all struggle financially ourselves. Any suggestions? Also, any suggestions on SPECIFIC supplements that might be ok to lessen the harsh effects of chemo, but won't interfere with hypo-thyroid medication?",
