    "Content": "In August of 2008 I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer.  Since my diagnosis I have struggled not only with the emotional & physical issues that are related to cancer, but the overwhelming financial burden of trying to keep my head above water. I am currently under the breast & cervical cancer insurance provided by Medicaid.  It's a catch 22 situation.  At the time of my diagnosis, I was self-employed and had no medical insurance and after my oncologist laid out my game plan, I had to make the decision to close my business in order to get the best possible treatment.  I have gone through chemo, surgery, and now I'm in radiation.  It's been a long hard road and I'm thankful for the support I've been given.  As a single mom, I have tried to keep my attitude positive and be pro-active about dealing with this disease, but I am barely making ends meet.  Are their any organizations that are set up to help out with basic needs...rent, utilities, etc??  I've looked, but haven't had much luck.  Maybe, my luck will turn around and I get some help. ",
