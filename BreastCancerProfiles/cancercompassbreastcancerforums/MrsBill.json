    "Content": "Hi Ninah, My husband has GBM, and since treatment with rads and temodar, he also developed neuropathy in his feet and hands.  It really makes him miserable because it keeps him awake half the night.  He is so not wanting any more meds to take so I guess the answers are limited.  I don't know how you feel about it, but he has found that marijuana helps considerably.  I know there are a lot of people on the various message boards here that have also found some relief.  Good grief, like you don't have enough to deal with, right! I hope you find something that works for you.  Wishing you comfort... Peggy aka Mrs Bill",
