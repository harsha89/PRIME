    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm 27, from Ottawa, Canada. I found out yesterday that my mother has lung cancer. Although I have not spoken to the oncologist, the understanding I have from speaking with our family doctor is that the prognosis in not good. I don't see her very often, and our relationship has been less than great for pretty much my whole life. Long story short, she was an alcoholic who slightly cleaned up her act after my sister and I had already moved out and developed resentment. I was able to mend the relationship between her and I, but my sister was not. Anyway, despite the fact that we aren't super close, I cannot stop crying. My head is pounding and my eyes are puffy. I've never had to go through a death in the family, and don't know how to deal, or prepare for this. She had tried to keep this a secret from everyone in the family, but of course, we all ended up finding out. I feel pity, sadness and helplessness. Anyone who is willing to chat, please let me know. I feel alone and in need of some conversations I can relate to.",
