      "Content": "Hi, I wrote in a bit ago about my mom, 54 (whom I adore) was diagnosed with stage 4 met. to the liver, she has 14 tumors in her liver...she has had 2 doses of chemo, her tumor markers went from 152 down to 59...That sounded AWESOME to me...but the nurse said...\"yeah that is pretty good?!!?!\" Is this Really good, or just ok?? I don't trust them...And what exactly does this mean?? I thought it meant that the tumors were shrinking, to me that is a huge improvement... I want to find The VERY BEST clinic for her to get a second opinion, We live in Oregon..I have heard that MD anderson is good, does anyone have any info on an AWESOME place for my Awesome mom...Cancer sucks!!!!Thanks for being here..
