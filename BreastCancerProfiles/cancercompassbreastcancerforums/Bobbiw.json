      "Content": "My thoughts are with you and your mum. A year prior to my diagnosis I lost my mom to lung cancer. We were very close indeed and it was difficult. As others have said, keep a postive attitude and enjoy the life and times that you now have, and will have more of. Having doctored with my mom through her illness please be an advocate for her. It is difficult to 'take it all in' and one certainly needs a couple of sets of ears to hear all that is being said. Question the docs, if you are not comfortable find one with who you are comfortable, be a consumer. Be sure they explain in terms that you can understand. Best of luck to you and try to stay positive. Bobbi",

      "Content": "Thank you for your response and yes a positive attitude is necessary but often difficult to maintain. My job is a 24 hour 7 day a week very high stress job. If work calls I need to go hence the inability to work during treatments as even if I am not feeling well and work calls I am the person that needs to go. And for the first time in my life I made the decision to take care of myself and not have my job come first. My employer apparantly does not want to 'mess with me' and what the ongoing treatments may involve even though I have been a valuable long term employee for 12 years. I think that they have found an easy out of the situation by filling my postion once the FMLA is exhausted. I have filed some complaints with various offices in my state but it appears that the employer has most of the rights here in the end. Sad but true. But on a more postive note, something will come up and everything happens for a reason. I will be OK. Thank you Bobbi",

      "Content": "My doctor will release me to return to work mid April, however my FMLA is exhausted on 3-26-06. My employer (who I have worked for loyaly for the past 12 years) has decided to fill my position once my FMLA runs out...UNLESS I return to work on 3-27-06. This company provides services to folks who have disabilities but will not make an accomodation for a long term loyal employee who herself now has a disability. It seems I have no recourse in this matter and even thoough I need to keep a positive attitude (and will) and I know that everything happens for a reason, you can bet that this hurts to the core. Has anyone else had this experience. How do you cope. I will have a year of weekly herceptin treatments after my chemotherapy. This in itself may make me unhirable to new employess, and never mind the fact that I am approaching 50. The cancer has been the easy part, the rest of it has been difficult. In regards to the cancer, thus far I have been fortunate in that they got it all with the mastectomy, it had not spread to the nodes and I have a wonderful team of docs and supportive family. Thanks for listening. Bobbi",
