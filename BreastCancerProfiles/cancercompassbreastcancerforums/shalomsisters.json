    "Content": "I am a breast cancer survivor for 14 years but did not have stage 4, although I know of several women close to me who have had this. I hope you are seeing an oncologist who specializes in breast cancer. YOu need to feel very confident with your doctor - know that he/she is up to date on the latest research. Don't worry about reconstruction now - (on a side note, infections are common, especially after chemotherapy, so not necessarily due to a bad surgeon - maybe but maybe not) for now your efforts should be on finding the best treatment modalities to curtail the spread of your disease. My friend's breast cancer metastized to her liver, pelvis and spine. She is getting radiation for her bones and will soon go to the hospital to have chemo put in directly into half her liver. Then 1 month later, she'll go back for the same thing on the other side. You need to treat this seriously and aggressively!! At the same time, do your best to maintain a positive outlook - pray if you so believe, have a good support network of family and friends - its not in the numbers - its in the quality. Allow yourself to grieve for a part of the day if you need that, but then let it go and do your very best to enjoy the rest of the day and the people you love. Get a second opinion and then follow your gut - that's my opinion!",
