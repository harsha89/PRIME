      "Content": "Hello. My name is Margo Rey a breast cancerr survivor! I wanted to visit the discussion board and share with you some words of encouragement.  The road to recovery is tough, however it is possible! Don't ever lose hope and beleive in yourself and the others around you everyday. You can and will conquer whatever it is that is casting doubt and despair in your life. Breast cancer is a beatable disease and you will beat it. Although it is tough, life does go on after breast cancer and always know that someone out there is going through the same thing and there are people out there pulling for you.  Since it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month I would like to share with you this video I made. I hope it inspires you to support breast cancer victims and research.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBNsKZ698ZE&feature=plcp Margo Rey ",

      "Content": "My name is Margo Rey, I can empathize because I'm a fellow breast cancer survivor. It's crucial to get regular check ups and encourage awareness to loved ones because you never know the results may be. Since breast cancer is a growing epidemic, we need to spread the word by sharing stories and supporting one another and breast cancer research. I made this video to inspire and promote breast cancer research. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBNsKZ698ZE&feature=plcp",
