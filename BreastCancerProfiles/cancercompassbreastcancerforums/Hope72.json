      "Content": "Leemg, thanks so much for words of encouragement.  I'll take your advice.  I called about the pathology report and was told that basically the surgeoun removed 11 lymph nodes and out of these only one had cancer. The largest lump was 1.5 ml. so I don't know where this places me as far as stage, but I felt the news was rather good.  The surgeon will explain the path report in more detail at my appt. tomorrow.",

      "Content": "The surgery was on right breast.  It seems longer, although doing better than expected.  The incision itself didn't hurt except while in recovery room.  The right arm where they took the lymph nodes is tight and burns some.  I'm trying to be diligent about exercises.  I can call today about pathology report to see if lymph node involvement but am going to try to wait until Thurs. when I see the surgeon, who will go over the report with me.  If no lymph node involvement I'll just have to take Femara or Arimidex.  Otherwise chemo or radiation or both might be needed.  I might be thinking ahead too far, but I wonder if there's anyone out there my age (72) who's debating or debated about reconstruction.  I have a supportive husband who says he doesn't care whether of not I have it.  I've always had \"beautiful\" breasts, even at my age, and don't know whether I'm being silly to even consider this step at my ripe old age, which would mean more surgery with even longer recovery time than the actual mastectomy.   I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts who's either thinking of it or has already undergone this surgery. ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of weeks ago, although it seems like years.  A surgeon removed  two lumps, one through wire masectomy and another he couldn't see, but felt.  I also had another section of tissue removed in the nipple region, as I'd been having a discharge from the nipple.  The pathology report stated that the tissue by the breast is intraductal carcinoma in situ, Grade 2.  The lump with the wire is grade 3 infiltrating duct cell carcinoma and the tissue close to it is grade 2 infiltrating duct cell carcinoma.  I am scheduled for a modified radical masectomy in 10 days.  The surgeon doesn't know how many lymph nodes he will remove but says the sentinel node biopsy had been found to be less effective than was previously thought.I would like to get some opinions on whether his planned course of treatment seems reasonable, based on the above.  I've been reading about lymphadema and it sounds depressing.  My surgeon says he's never had a case turn up after one of his surgeries involving lymph node removal. Thank you.",
