    "Content": "My Aunt has recently completed a round of radiation treatment to the brain and is currently trying to be weened from dexamethasone after waking up one morning with excruciating pain in the back of her neck and head.  They did this because they found out that the Breast Cancer has metastisized into the brain,  She is having severe memory loss and cognitive functioning.  She knows nothing she is doing.  However she can name her immediate family if asked.  Is this a side of the dexamethasone or the radiation?  Has anyone else expierenced this?",
