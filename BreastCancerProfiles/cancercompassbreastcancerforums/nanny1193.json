    "Content": "I had been on almost two years of  Femara with horrible side effects.  My oncologist finally changed my medication  to Aromasin and I experienced the same side effects. I developed a very painful bakers cyst behind my right knee and could hardly walk.  I do not know if this cyst was a result of the,Aromasin, but after receiving a cortisone shot in my knee to relieve the inflammation, I have been pain free not only in my knee but I am free of every horrible joint pain I experienced due to the side effects of Aromasin.   ",
