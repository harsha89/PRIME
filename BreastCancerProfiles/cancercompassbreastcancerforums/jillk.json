That being said- I'm a 6 year survivor of left side breast cancer and still get chest pain related to the surgery and radiation. Best of luck! JK",

That was the good news. Here is what he said. First he ask me if i could change jobs. Then he said to ask my oncologist about stopping the medicine, you know the one thats supose to keep me from having cancer (arimidex). He said if it is just 10% that some women decide to stop taking it. As far as the pain going away if i stop he wasn't sure. He said if i had never had to take this medicine that 10 years from now i would probably have the same problem with my wrist, the arimidex just causes this sooner. He told me to go back to my orthopaedic doctor and get both wrist injected with cortisone. So at this point i'm not sure of anything except i'm still in pain. God bless all of you!   jackie   I had the same problem with my ankles whild on Arimidex. My oncologist switched me to a similar drug, Aromasin, and the pain went away. Good Luck! Jill",
