    "Content": "I am almost 40y/o and had 3 scares so far with breast cancer. My maternal gramma died of breast cancer and alzheimers my mom has breast cancer but has luckily been in remission for the past 5 years she was just recently diagnosed with the begining of alzheimers. I recently went to the doctor and he suggested I have a bi-lateral masectomy due to the fact of my family history. If he hadn't brought it up I would have because it was something I had been thinking about. I do not have breast cancer but he said its only a matter of time before I get it. I was just wondering if there is anybody that was willing to chat and give some insight. My family is behind me 100% and thinks its a good idea.",
