    "Content": "I have a friend who had both breast  removed. She had a reconstruction. Went from a triple D to an A. she said it is the best thing she has ever done. she elected  to have the second breast removed because she asked her oncologist if she were his mother what would he suggest and he said remove them both. She is 7 years cancer free. Good luck to you I am a 2 year colon cancer survivor. i was diagnosed twice in two years. Your right it is all pure h--- but Im here to tell it!!!",
