What we don't relize it how sick it makes them feel. All we see or want to see is them getting help for this terrible cancer that struck the person we love. All the time put her first, her needs, her wishes, and if she don't want something, agree. My mom's onc doc's told me bone cancer is so very painful, and chemo really ease the pain. Also my moms spread to her liver, like your wife's make sure her doctor lets you know about the toxins in her body, that her liver can't fight some off. You AND YOUR FAMILY ARE IN FOR WHAT EVER SHE NEEDS. PUT EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE BACK BURNER. MY FAMILY AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOU. GOD BLESS LESLIE",

I also wanted to let you know that after reading your story, I am going to put her little things in a place where i can pull them out when i need them. I thought that was a very honorable and noble thing to do. Your mother is watching down on you when you need her, and those little things just make her close to you.

      "Content": "Dear Jamie, I'm going to start out by saying how deeply sorry I am for your loss. I do believe in my heart for a women to lose her mother, has to be one of the hardest things in life, and the most painfull. As like you, my mom also wanted to be home. My husband and my two children made our dinning room a bedroom for her. We put all her pictures around to comfort her. All I remember her saying when she was kinda well is (please make sure I can hear my grandkids). That is about the only thing that gives me comfort. I know she could hear them. Strenght is not the word for what comes over you when you have someone you love dying right in front of you. It is someone above helping you out.(I have to believe that).I watched my mom gasp for her breath, it was like someone was pulling my heart out. I have good and bad days, but most recently I have been having awful days. I cry all day, not just a little cry a cry where I can't catch my breath. I don't see it getting any better or easier. People will tell you it will, but I until I can get the image of her gasping for a breath out of my head, I don't see it. I wonder like you how will I go one with out my mom. I don't know, I hope one day we will.",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I know what you mean when you said (you san't believe it's only been 5 months), I say the same thing. Everyday it seems like yesterday, I see my mom suffering and slipping away and there is nothing I can do about it. I still go through that day after day. Most of the time I do fine, or I put on the (fine) face for everyone, when in reality I am doing anything but fine. I don't think it will ever get eaiser, but one thing I know for sure WE will never lose the memories. I was writing to someone else awhile ago and she tld me that she put some of her mother's personal things (purse stuff, keys, license ect.) in a box close to her, so when things get really rough she can just pull them out. I thought that was a great idea and I did the same thing, when I am really down I pull my mom's things out and talk to her. That way I feel she is still with me. That seem to only happen when I am alone. I have to children that keep me busy and my mind free of sadness, but when my son talks about his Nana or any family member talks about her my HEART aches. So I can only tell u the advise I was given, take whatever things mean the most to u, or the most to your mom and keep them close. Touch them, talk to them, and never stop talking to your mom. Ask for a sign that she can hear you and see ever once in awhile. I have to believe she is still with me, that is how I get out of bed every day. Take care of yourself. Hope to hear from you.

As I was reading your letter I sat back and relized that my mom is watching me and she is in a better place. I think I just needed to hear that from someone who is going through the same thing. People can tell you things are going to be fine, but if they never been through it before they just don't know. Hearing it from someone who has been there (twice for you) makes it seem eaiser, and makes me relize life can go on, because she is watching over me. Thank You again for your support. Leslie",

She was diagnosed in 2002 with stage IV. She has a double mastectomy, went into remission for about 3 years. On janurary 31st 2006 we found out her camcer was back, but this time it spread to her bones, and eventually to her brain. On March 9th 2006 she lost her battle, she fought for as long as she possibly could, until her last breath she was fighting. Now that she is gone I find it hard to move on with things.My heart hurts everyday, I miss her so much, and wish I could hear her.",

I don't know u or your mother, but when I read your story all I could think about is my mom is celebrating her 57th birthday with your mom. My family didn't even metion her bday, strickly because my mom was a twin, my aunt(her sister) had a very hard time. That meant nobody said a word, it was really hard. If any of this came across wrong i am sorry. I just wish i could of celebrated it with her. Ps. our journeys are very similar. Take care of yourself. Leslie",

It has been 9 months now without her, and I still feel the same way I did the day she left my world. Is this pain or numbing feeling I have ever going to get eaiser? Will there be a day that I don't cry? A day I don't feel my heart getting ripped out?   I have 2 children and I try to be strong for them, it is extreamly diffucult. It is very hard to smile when my best friend, and the greatest mom, is no longer with me.  I know she is still around me watching over my children and me, but not being able to hear her, touch her, or see her is overwhelming. I don't want to be this sad especially for my children, I just don't know how long it will be before I can call things (normal) again. GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO IS DEALING WITH A DEATH.",

      "Content": "Dear Gina, I was reading your story and it hit very close to home. My mother lost her battle with breast cancer March 9, 2006. I too was struggling with how to help her. Like your mom, mine would not tell me if she was having a bad day, sick, ect. If your close to your mom like I was to mine, you already know each day how she feels.Don't let her tell you she is doing fine when u know she is not. I remember my mother becomming very weak with her chemo. It was getting hard for her to cook and clean, she would never admit it so my family and I took it upon ourself to clean hr house and perpare meals for the week. It made life much eaiser on my mom when all she had to do was pull a meal out of the freezer and heat it up. We tried to make life a simple and carefree as possible so all she had to is chemo and rest. The main thing I can tell you is spend as much time with her as possible, that means putting everything else on the back burner and making your mom number one. Even if she does not want to be. Yes give her some space when she wants it,but not to much because you never know how long you really have. Take care of your mom and yourself. My family and I will pray for you. Leslie",
