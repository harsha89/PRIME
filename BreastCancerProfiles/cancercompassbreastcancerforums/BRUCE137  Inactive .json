    "Content": "You know I had the same problem with Prempro, but still have not found an attorney to take them on.  I was told when I was diagnosed with breast cancer and 1 lympth node was affected that it was caused by the Prempro and to stop the medication asap. I was turning 68 and had already stopped Prempro. I hope you find someone to help you, because these drug companies should be held liable.",
