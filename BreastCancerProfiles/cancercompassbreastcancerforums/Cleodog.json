      "Content": "Hi jacru1950, I stopped taking my armidex after taking if for five years April 21st of 2016, so almost one year ago. I would say it took at least six months for my joints to feel better.  I suffer from a very bad knee, so bad, I'm getting a total right knee replacement on May 4th.  My thighs still bother me, mostly though it's better than it was while taking Armidex. The biggest improvement has been not being so stiff, and being able to walk right away after sitting down. Also, I can button buttons better now too. Hope you feel better very soon, God Bless.  Judy",

I had 3 1/2 weeks of rads and a lumpectomy in my right breast. my onc put ne on anastrozole and I thought I had died and gone to Hell. I tried to get the name brand drug Armidex thru my insurance, but that was a big fat no. My onc then told me that I could buy it from Eagle Pharmacy for 30.00 a month. So if you would rather be in the brand name, here is the info. Your onc has to fax them a prescription. Eagle pharmacy 500 eagles landing dr, suite c Lakeland, Florida 33810 Phone: 855 748-2663",
