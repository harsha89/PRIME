    "Content": "My dr prescribed Fareston.   Can anyone tell me about their experiences with the drug?  Also, it says for use in postmenopausal women.   I am 41 and in chemo-induced menopause.  How do I know whether I am really in menopause and if this drug is the right one for me? I did ask the dr these questions, and I still feel I need more information.",
