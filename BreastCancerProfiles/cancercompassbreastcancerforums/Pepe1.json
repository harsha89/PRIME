      "Content": "Hi, Just wanted to mention that on breastcancer.org, there are quite a few messages from women who have contracted fibromyalgia after being on these drugs, mostly arimidex. THeir onc's have told them it's NOT from this drug, but each one said they never had a problem before being on it. I'd say the medical community is trying to do the ostrich head burying on this. More women should be concerned and bring it to everyone's attention.",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for answering so quickly. I'm sorry no one helped when you were looking for answers. I'm scared to do the radiation too, not so much for the short term effects, but because of all I've heard about down the road. I've been reading alot on breastcancer.org and they all have such horrible stories about their burns, and side effects while going through it. None of it made me feel any better about having it done. You sound very healthy and energetic now. Did you have to take any of the tamoxifin or Arimidex? Now I'm also hearing about all the pains associated with taking those and it all just makes me scared. I feel very good right now. I had my last chemo last week and I feel great. I have lots of energy and no aches and pains. I would just like to keep it that way. Starting a new regime that will cause more pain doesn't sound good right now. I just wish I could forget the rest and continue feeling as good as I do now. I do spend most of my time realizing how blessed I am to still be here. I just want to be here and feel good, too. THanks and hugs to you for having stayed the course and making it through.",
