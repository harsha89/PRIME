    "Content": "Never take a chance with breast cancer!!! Have you had a mammogram recently? I have had many and if the mammogram shows a cyst or less alarming you will!be fine! In my case I am a very small breasted woman and now I must endure further testing due to a psst suspicion area in both breasts. Do not play around, it could be very simple, is, a cyst. Sadly mine has been neglated by a no longer PCP! It is curibable depending on the nature. For ease of mind please have it done!!",
