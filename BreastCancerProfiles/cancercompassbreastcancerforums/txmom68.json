I was just told I had a complex cyst yesterday - they did a sonogram and I was told they were 99% sure that it was just a cyst. Complex meaning it isn't perfectly oval. I'm trying to find if anyone has been told this - if I should ask for a 2nd opinion. I have a history of BC in my family. Leemg, What is a FNA and does anyone think I should follow up on this??  ",
