    "Content": "I was on Arimidex for 3 months but had to stop because of severe joint pain and weakness.  Changed to Aromasin.  Joint pain got better.  However, over 7 months developed carpal tunnel problems in both hands and trigger finger in right thumb which all required surgery.  Also, had cortisone shot in wrist because of tendonitis. I have foot pain, stiffness, and swelling such that my gait is much worse than my 90 year-old parents.  It never occurred to me that these problems were related to Aromasin.  I thought it was somehow due to lasting effects of chemo.  I am sorry that I didn't find this site sooner and avoided all this unnecessary pain and surgery.  My doctor, who treats a lot of us, has not seen these side effects before, as apparently they occur in less than 2% of us.  Been off Aromasin for 5 weeks and feet seem to be getting a little better.  I hope that this continues.  You all can tell me if this is the case.  Will start Tomaxifin next and hope that I can tolerate it better than AI's.  Thanks for sharing all of your experiences.  Niki ",
