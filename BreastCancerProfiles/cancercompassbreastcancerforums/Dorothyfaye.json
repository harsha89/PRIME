      "Content": "I am 61 years old. I had a bleeding nipple in November of 2002 and in May of 2003 the doctor found cancer. I had the lumpectomy and they removed 1/3 of my right breast then. I followed up with 6 1/2 weeks of radiation. I got lymphedema in the right arm about halfway through the radiation. No one at the cancer center was alarmed and tried to tell me that the radiation didn't have anything to do with the pain and swelling in my arm and hand. In November I was in treatment for lympedema when I had a blood clot go through my lungs. I was in a coma for two days. My family was told to come and all expected me not to live. I lived. The doctors at the hospital said the clot was caused by radiation. I am now on Warfarin. In February of 2003 I was in for my mammogram and they found cancer in the left breast--it was not there the year before. I had the lumpectomy on two cancers in that breast and we waited for the pathology report. It came back clean, but we still had to go back in and get clean margins. The surgeon suggested a double masectomy or risk getting more cancer in either breast again. After some discussion with my family I opted for the masectomy. When the pathology report came back from that surgery they had found cancer in the lymp node on the right side...the radiated side from the year before. I was in terrible pain of course and had wondered if I had made a terrible mistake by opting for the masectomy. When they had discovered a missed lymp node with cancer I felt better about taking the radical surgery. I followed up with 4 rounds of chemo and am now on Femara, after being two months on Arimidex. I couldn't stand the leg and back pain and the all over sickness that came with Arimidex. So Femara isn't as bad, but it still sucks. I don't sleep at night and little in the daytime. I have the all over achy-flu type feeling, the nausea and stomach/bowel upset. Then there's the bone pain and to make matters worse, the pain across my chest has increased two-fold. I was just getting to where I didn't need the percocet before starting the Arimidex. Now, I'm back to the intense pain I had after surgery. I don't know how long the doctors will allow me to keep taking narcotics for pain. I'm allergic to most othere types of pain meds. Also I have heart problems and I fear that the Femara is reacting to my heart meds. I also have two hard, softball sized lumps under the incisions, the right side being the worst. They are very painful. The doctors seemed unconcered and keep telling me they will go away. It's been over a year now and they have only got harder and more painful. I am afraid of another misdiagonis like I was with the swollen arm. It wasn't lympedema. I had a blood clot in the arm pit and the massaging broke it loose and nearly killed me. My chest feels like it is filled with shards of brick and a steel band over it being tightened by a wrench or something. How does one know if the cancer has settled in the bone when they are on Femara or like drug since the bones ache/hurt all the time anyway? Dorothy B",

      "Content": "I was on arimidex, then femara and had bad reactions to both. Dr. put me on faslodex injections today and I got home and went to the web sites on this drug. I am on warfarin for blood clots and the bio on the drugs specifically says not to take faslodex if taking warfarin. Of course, it's after hours here so can't call doctor's office until tomorrow. Also the web information for faslodex vs Warfarin is very scant and doesn't say what happens if your doctor makes a mistake and gives you the injection anyway. He knows I'm taking warfarin...why don't these doctor's pay attention! Now what!DB",

      "Content": "Dear Velvet Thank you for your response to my inquery reguarding warfin. I have to stay on warfin for life, I had a blood clot go through my lungs two years ago and stopped my heart. I need to go in for my second shot and I'm having so much trouble with pain in all my joints, hands especially. Do you have joint and bone pain with this drug...Faslodex? Other than that I do feel better than I have since before I started these anit-hormone drugs. Arimidex was really bad for me and Femara wasn't much better. I just can't used to the idea of being in this much pain where I have to take pain pills to function--use my hands and etc.--for the next four years. All these cancer terms are new to me...what is bony secondaries? And did you say your cancer came back? I am considering not taking any drugs at all since non have been easy for me to take. What do you think? Is is worth it? Dorothy",

      "Content": "Sue: I'm glad to know I'm not going crazy. I have been struggling for weeks now to get my days and nights turned back around. That also happened when I was taking Arimidex. I was able to switch back to sleeping at night after I had quit taking Arimidex. Now, on Femara, I'm back to trying all night to sleep and trying all day to stay awake. I finally just gave up and go with it. I'm very unhappy about this, I would like to be up in the day and asleep at night. DorothyB",

      "Content": "I was put on Arimidex after chemo and was on it for about two months when I had had enough. The quality of life for me was more important. The doctor then put me on Femara which is supposed to have less side effects and I am having trouble with that too. I keep trying to decide wether I want to keep taking this drug or not. Since cancer was found in a lymph node he insisted that I stay on Femara. I can't live like this. I have no energy, I ache all over like I have the flu, my bones hurt and of course, the hot flashes. I have arythmia and take meds for that and lately I have been experiencing problems with that again. Small ones, but enough to alarm me. I am 61 years old and do not want to spend the next five years like this. I have no desire or energy to do anything. I just want to hybernate till this is all over. But I know I can't. Some days I skip it all together, it's been two and a half months since starting it. When the pain got so bad in my jawbones and teeth, I quit taking it for a couple of weeks until the pain finally subsided. I'm back on it now, but have this daily delima of whether I want to keep taking it. My doctor has given me one other alternative and that is to take montly injections that have less side effects. The idea of injections don't bother me, I had to take hormone injections before cancer... There was a brief period of time...about six weeks when I didn't take anything...I had quit taking the Arimidex without telling my doctor. After about two weeks after quiting, I felt really great. I want that back. I have to much to do to be sick and achy all the time. Now I think I am beginning to get depressed. I can't take anything for that becuase of my heart meds. That is why I joined this forum. I am desperate to know what others are doing about the side effects, how it is affecting their mind, and if the quality of life is more important. I am too scared to stop, but to stuborn to keep taking Femara... I had a double masectomy in March of 2004, I am having horrible pain still, I think much to Arimidex and then Femara. Before I started these drugs I hadn't been in that much pain across the chest. I have to take Percocet at least twice a day. Before I was on the cancer drugs I was getting off of percocet all together. I also have trouble with breathing. Armidex was worse on the breathing than Femara, but I still get into trouble now and then. It is not the percocet doing it. I have watched out for that. Just don't know what to do anymore.

      "Content": "Suzan, I had and have jaw pain, I thought all my teeth were affected and went to the dentist. She said it was probally the large lymph nodes in the jaw and neck that were affected and agreed it could be from the Femara...but of course, we don't know that for sure. I am unable to lay in any other position but on my back--in a reclining position since the double masectomy. Falling asleep is not always the problem, but staying asleep is. I wake up sometimes just fifteen minutes after falling asleep and can't get back to sleep for hours and hours. Come morning I'm so exhausted I finally sleep but it's only two or three hours at a time. I'm getting to where I am nauseous all the time now. I'm not hungry and smells turn me off, but my stomach behaves like it hasn't been fed in a week. So I have to nible on something or drink some milk often in order to stop it's complaining. My scar area, from arm pit to arm pit, has a tremendous increase of pain. Where before Femara and Arimidex, I barely needed anything for pain. I am lethargic, my eyes burn from lack of sleep and I am getting getting cranky. Every other day or so I get upset and don't take the pill, but then I get worried and start taking it again. I am so afraid of the jaw pain returning. Nothing took that pain away. I stopped taking Femara for about a week and a half and the pain went away. I struggle daily with whether I want to take this pill or not. Quality of life is very important to me right now...but so is life...I don't know what to do. I keep hoping the side effects will go away with time, but I'm reading all these things on this forum about people like yourself and others that it gets worse as time goes on. I've got a friend here in my community that had breast cancer and chemo when I did and she is on Arimidex and is not having too many problems at all. I was on Arimidex for two months at the start and that was the worst pain and misery I had. I could hardly walk. I stopped taking Arimidex for almost two months without telling the doctor. (And I was able to sleep at night and live a normal life for about a month) He was upset but switched me to Femara about two months ago. Lately I've had the \"Blah's\" big time. I'm having trouble concentrating on anything. In the past few days I have had heart palpataions and some dizziness or lightheadedness when I stand up. I have arythmia problems and take some serious heart medication and I'm also worried that the Femara is messing that up somehow. I have some diarrhea and abdominal distress. So far that's about it...Dorothy B",
