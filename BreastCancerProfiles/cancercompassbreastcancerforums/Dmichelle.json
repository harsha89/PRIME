    "Content": "Hi my name is Deana, and my mom is 69 and has metastatic breast cancer. She has had surgery about a year ago to take a tumor off on the outside of her intestine. She recovered from the surgery just fine. She has never had chemotherapy or radiation but she was taking tamoxifen for about a year. The tamoxifen gave her fibroid tumors in her uterus which will make you bleed and also will give you some hair loss. They say that arimidex or aromase hormone therapy is much better. I have taken care of my mom since her surgery but since dec of 2006 she has drastically went downhill and gets harder and harder everyday. I wish you the best of wishes for your mom.",
