    "Content": "Hi, My friend was diagnosed with \"clear cell\" bc. A rare Case of cancer.doctors don't know much about it. There is no cure or treatment for it. She had a double mastectomy and undergoing radiation now. I Like to raise awareness about this kind of bc.she is trying to find somebody with this type of bc to discuss it and find some help. I'Ve been emailing some celebrities with bc or those who Claime to be concerned about bc. So far nothing has come up.all I m trying to do is spread the word and let government know about it and raise funds for this type of bc too.  I Hope you people here can help other women who have \"clear cell \" cancer by reaching out to famouse people or other cancer organizations. Thank you  ",
