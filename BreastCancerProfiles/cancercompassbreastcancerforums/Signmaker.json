Please leave a message if you are interested in learning about metaplastic breast cancer or are suffering from it, or are someone able to help us.  We're working on a new website that will be up and running very soon.  http://metaplasticbreastcancer.org  . Thank you for your help and interest! Donna                dear Donna, our daughter was diagnosed three years ago with metaplastic breast cancer.Similar to you she had surgery to remove lump, chemo & radiation. 15 months later she found lump under arm pit and was diagnosed with one lymph node. she had  27 nodes removed and more chemo. she had all side effects again but got thru fine.She had genetic testing done and thankfully came back negative.she was 38 when first diagnosed, she is now 41 and doing well.We have had a hard time finding anything about Metaplastic breast cancer and appreciate the website you will be starting.We are located in south jersey. We as parents know how tough this is on you and your family, we wish you the best and you will be in our prayers.",

I also did the lumpectomy, chemo and radiation in 2004. By 2005, I had no cancer. Then in 2006 it came back in my liver. Again, I did surgery and chemo. I am now disease free again. I was 38 yrs. old when this started. I never thought I would live to see 40. This month I will be 41. Your daughter can beat this. I also went through what she did with losing my hair both times and dealing with all the side effects. It was all worth it. If she is having trouble with dealing with the stress of treating her cancer, there is nothing wrong with having her doctor give her anti-depressants. It is very difficult to go through what she is dealing with, and it is hard to deal with the stress of feeling sooooo sick and wondering if you are going to survive. Many, many cancer patients need help dealing with treatment, and anti-depressants can help. If her doctors ever say there is nothing else they can do to help her, find a new doctor. There are new drugs coming out all the time. The chemo I took in 2006 wasn't available when I was first dianosed in 2004. Tell her to keep fighting and keep praying. If she is feeling positive and keeps up with her treatment, she can win. I am living proof that stage 4 can be beat. I am a 3 yr. survivor and plan to celebrate yrs. 4, 5, and more. She can do it too. God Bless you all, He has certainly been blessing me and I pray that she will receive that kind of blessing too. Lisa from Dallas  Dear Lisa , Thank you so much for replying.My daughter's cancer is metaplastic and from what little we can find out about it is it very rare and agressive and not usually found in the breast. She is very positive and does all the things she should to fight this. She does not seem depresses at all but I know she puts on a good front for all of us. She has 4 girls to take care of and sometimes forgets about taking care of herself first.thanks again and i pray all goes well with you, her dad & mom thank you  ",
