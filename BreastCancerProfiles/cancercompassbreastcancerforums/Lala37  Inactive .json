    "Content": "Took Femara for over two years with no problems.  All of a sudden had terrific calf cramps and was taken off and put on Arimidex.  After two weeks on Arimidex, I had the same leg cramps as with Femara.  It took two weeks before the cramps subsided completely.  The Doctor now had me try Aromisin and after taking only 3 pills, I had such tingling in my legs, joint paid and muscle pain in the back of my thigh that I stopped that medication as well.  It has only been three days and I'm still experiencing those problems.  He wanted to put me on Tamoxifin, but I am calling it quits.  He said if I did that he would have to \"follow me more closely\".  That's o.k. with me.  I'm not putting up with these side effects any more and probably now will be able to lose a few pounds.",
