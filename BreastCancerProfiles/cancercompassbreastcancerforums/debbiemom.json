    "Content": "hey diva girl! not the advice you're going to want to hear but i would do the mammogram any day over the biopsy. First you need to ask your regular doctor to prescribe something like xanex which is used for calming anxiety. Trust me, it really works if you respect it and use it properly. Now, if you can relax, it is really wierd to lay on your stomach on a procedure table that has a big hole in it where you put your breast. The tech sits down and suddenly the table raises way up so your breast is within working distance. Next this mechanicalÂ  gripper starts mooshing your breast like the mammogram (can't remember if it hurt more, less, or the same) The real hard part is that you have to hold perfectly still for what seems like an eternity. Once the tech makes sure the little guide is pointing in the right place, that's when the needle goes in. It could be benign...keep thinking that. Debbie",
