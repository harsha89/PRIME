In December of 2003 I was diagnosed with breast cancer with mets to my liver.  I had a tiny lesion in my right breast, one very infected lymph node, and it had gone to the left lobe of my liver.  It was estrogen and progesterone positive. I was given Femara with the hope that it would help. I decided that with as dire a prognosis as this I'd be wise to really ramp up nutrition and do whatever else I could to strengthen my body.  Within two months the tumors in my liver had shrunk by 3/4; by November of 2004 there was no evidence of cancer. In September of 2005 the cancer had returned to my liver.  I went on a year of chemotherapy.  First my oncologist used Doxil, but I had a severe reaction to it.  I then went on Abraxane and Avastin.  I went into complete remission again in September of 2006. During all of this time I continued to work but I also continued to look for the best supplements to keep my body strong as well as kept up as much exercise as I could.  I also made sure to get at least nine hours of sleep each night. In February of 2008 I went to China and, while there, I visited an acupuncture university.  The doctors checked me very carefully and immediately picked up that I had had chemotherapy.  They said that there was fire in my liver but otherwise my body was very strong and healthy.  When I returned to the US there was, indeed, a tumor in my liver again.  For whatever reason, the cancer returned to one spot and was not in pieces through that part of my liver or anywhere else. The tumor was 6.2 cm. I had spoken with a thoracic oncology surgeon at UCSF, Dr. Robert Warren, in 2006 about liver resection therapy.  I returned to talk with him in April of 2008.  He indicated that I would be an excellent candidate for surgery as my body was so strong.  I had surgery May 13, 2008.  I had anticipated a rough recovery.  In fact, it wasn't nearly as difficult as I had anticipated.  I had no complications and was at the computer within five weeks of surgery!  It has been 13 months since surgery and there is no evidence of disease. Each of our journeys is very different and each of us has different responses to treatment.  I'm extremely drug-sensitive and I knew that chemo would not be easy for me. I have no idea if the supplements and a focus on nutrition I have followed are in any way responsible for the good response I've had to date, but I do know that being strong has made my quality of life much better.  I certainly don't take for granted that I have managed to live well for 5-1/2 years post-diagnosis.  I hope that this might provide some measure of hope for any of you who might read this.  While we may need to be in treatment for life, you may live for many years despite a scary diagnosis. Patricia Rain     Hi, Patricia and others: Your message was powerful and timely for me. I need some inspiration to deal with this second chapter of breast cancer. The first was a diagnosis in February 2007 of Estrogen +, Stage 3, grade one breast cancer spread to the lymph nodes, resulting in mastectomy, chemo and radiation. In February 2009, a metastasis of 1.2 cm showed up in the liver (nowhere else in the body) and a radio frequency ablation was performed which effectively burned out the cancer. Now July 2009, a second suspicious spot of 5 mm has shown up in the liver and still seemingly nowhere else. I am on monthly Faslodex shots (estrogen blocker) as of 4 months ago (after \"arimidex failure) which may take 6 months to be fully effective. We are waiting for a catscan in October to determine the next steps. If this spot is breast cancer, my doctor might consider another radio frequency ablation. However, the consulting UCSF doctor seems negative about this option, believing more in systemic intervention -- different estrogen blockers, trial chemos, PARP maybe. During the first chapter of my treatment, I just showed up for the next step. Now I can see I need to be more proactive. I have become more nutrition supplement conscious, but know I need to increase my action in this area. I am curious what your regimen has been. Also any other thoughts would be helpful. Joan M.",
