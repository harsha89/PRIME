God bless you for responding. I just had my port put in yesterday.  Last ight while trying to sleep on that side, I was awaken with chest pain so bad I thought I might be having a heart attack.  Once I got turned over to the opposite side I was able to get comfortable and no more chest pain.  I guess I am not going to be able to sleep on the side the port was implanted either.  I have my first treatment next Wedesday.  ",
