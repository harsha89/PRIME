    "Content": "I have been on femara for 4 years & previous to that on tamoxifan for 1 year.  Since my 5 year mark May 07, I have discontinued use.  For the past 5 years, I have experienced insomnia, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, anxiety and hot flashes.  The hot flashes were almost unbearable the first three years.  I have been off the femara for about 2 weeks and I am experiencing a very hot, metallic taste in my mouth ( can feel this down to my stomach), stomach aches, diarrhea and contribute these symptoms to stopping the medication since hormones are now probably starting to circulate in my body.  I will have to wait and see if this is the cause and effect. For the past 5 years, I have tried to focus on good nutrition and a moderate amount of exercise.  Exercise is very important as it provides energy and metabolizes medication in your body.  I do think the benefits are worth the side effects.  The stats show femara does substancially reduce recurrence. Anybody else had any side effects after discontinuing  femara?   ",
