    "Content": "I disagree with previous posters.  This isn't about these other people.  It is about you.  While my husband and I were dealing with his pancreatic cancer, I found it too difficult to even speak about it.  I checked caller ID and did not take any calls I didn't want to.  I felt no obligation to call anyone back.  I had my close family put out the word that it was too hard for us to talk about. Real friends sent e mails and cards, dropped meals at the door, and asked my immediate family for jobs or ideas of how to help.  They DID NOT put me on the spot of having to talk talk talk, explain, explain and explain.  Many of the previous posters have a better view of people than I do.  I think many are interested in the drama of it all, not in really helping.  People are nosey.  Some just want to feel better about themselves that they made that phone call and now don't have to do anything else.  Do what is best for you, not others. ",
