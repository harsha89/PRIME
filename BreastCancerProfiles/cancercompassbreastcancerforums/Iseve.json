    "Content": "Hi , i am a 5 yr. plus breast cancer survivor ( stage one- lumpectomy - radiation) and took tamoxifen for 5 years without feeling any side effects. After the 5 year mark i started femara and after 2 months i had to stop because i was feeling very dizzy all the time. Right after that i started Aromasin & after about two months i had terrible diarreah & itching all over my body. After blood work was done i found out my liver functions were really high. Since I stopped taking the aromasin everything is almost back to normal. Apparently it was a side effect from the aromasin. I'm Â still pending a blood test in about two weeks but i'm pretty suere it was the aromasin causing all these since i feel perfect ever since i stopped taking the medicine. My onc, thinks i don't need to take any other medicine for the moment. Eve",
