      "Content": "About a year ago,my husband was diagosed with lo grade prostrate cancer.He had a biopsy and it showed some cancer cells. Surgery was not suggested at that time.But at the same time frame,I started smelling a musty rotting smell in our apt's living room. We have different bedrooms and one bedroom is on one side of the living room,the other bedroom on the other side of the living room. The smell started to make me really sick!!! It was like something toxic was attacking my nervous system and I had a lot of psycial symtoms too. My husband doesn't smell it.He is using disposable sheets,washing his clothes in baking soda in his bathtub(can't use the washer as the smell stays in it).Everything he uses from clothes to towels will make me almost pass out if I smell them.He showers twice a day and everytime he has been out of the apartment. Nothing is working. He is going to have the prostate taken out in l0 days. I am praying the smell will go away as I cannot live like this.Has anybody ever heard of this situation????Thank you.",

      "Content": "My husband has prostrate cancer.Not real bad and the urologist said he could do a watch and wait. BUT, his smell has gotton awful-kind of putrid smelling. It even comes through his bedroom wall into the living area of our apartment.Yes ,I have always been able to smell things others cannot. He also is having a colonoscopy in 2 weeks because his home test came back positive altho it did 5 yrs ago and it was just internal hemmoroids. Can anyone relate to this smell that can filter through a wall?Granted apt walls are thin but his sheets,etc smell awful. What's worse is that the smell makes me ill-my eyelids sag,my face sags and my neck sags. My ears ring too. I cannot be around him.Thanks for listening.I am going nuts.He will be having the prostrate taken out this summer.",
