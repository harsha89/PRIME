      "Content": "I am generally on the Head & Neck board about my husband but my sister has breast cancer so tonight I'm here with all you bc warriors. My sister who has been battling breast cancer for 15 years is in Stage IV. She has mets to her spine and both lungs as well as pelvis and shoulder. Today she went straight from the doctor's office to the hospital. Her legs were all swollen and she had trouble walking. She actually fell twice today. Has anyone had this experience? They think one of her tumors is pressing on a nerve in her spine. Her kidney tests and brain scan were good. She was taken off chemo about a month ago because her doctor wanted to start her on a different combination and he needed all the old chemo drugs out of her system. She was supposed to get the new drugs this week until this happened. Any thoughts? Thanks for listening. Barb01",

      "Content": "Hi mlbieds: Hope you are feeling better now. Glad the tumor was benign. Apparently there is a tumor pressing on my sister's spine (she does have spine mets also) so I believe they are hoping to shrink it with a new combo of chemo drugs and possibly radiation. She is not a surgical candidate at this time. My sister got out of the hospital but still has some edema in her legs and feet. She's now in rehab for physical therapy and nutrition. She's complaining that she wants to go home - that's a good sign. She is walking pretty well with a walker and hopefully by the time she gets out of rehab she'll have just a cane or possibly be able to walk on her own (that may be a little too optimistic). She did have a blood clot in her lung and then after they put the screen in to prevent further clots from reaching her lung they found one in her leg. Apparently they are taking care of that and the pain from that is subsiding. Cancer is such a horrible disease. Still waiting for my husband to decide on lung surgery. He's going for his pulmonary function tests on Thursday and then once he gets the results he wants to talk with the doctor again about possible complications from the surgery. He's losing weight - now only 123 lbs - mostly because he's not eating (everything tastes like cardboard) but he is starting to drink more of the Ensure + so that is good. Hope he doesn't wait too long - then surgery won't be possible. Thanks for your reply. Hope everything goes well for you from now on. Barb01",

      "Content": "My youngest sister has been battling breast cancer for 16 years but now I think the end is near. She's in the hospital now on oxygen and having a hard time breathing. Last night she had a mini stroke so she can't talk. They have her hands strapped down because at night she gets anxious and last night she ripped our her IV. She has been having internal bleeding from a fall she had last week. They can't seem to get it to stop. She's had several transfusions and is still getting blood. The cancer has spread to her lungs and her spine. They were going to do radiation to relieve some of the pain in her spine but now I don't think the radiologist will do it. She can't get anymore chemo because she has too many complications. I'm pretty sure my brother-in-law is getting ready to call hospice in. My Mom, my brother & my other sister will be going there tomorrow. Unfortunately, I can't be there. I'm taking care of my husband who has lung cancer. He can get around but he's lost so much weight and I'm worried about his mental attitude so I think it's more important to stay with him to make sure he's okay and is eating. I'm afraid to leave him for any length of time. I did talk with my sister on the phone even though she couldn't talk back. I told her how much I loved her and thanked her for giving me a gift she didn't even know she gave me - faith. Her unwavering faith in God showed me the way. I will always be thankful to her for it. It's been the greatest gift anyone could receive. I feel guilty about not being by her side right now. I'm hoping she understands. I have so many conflicting emotions. I don't want her to suffer anymore but I don't want to lose her either. I'm just asking God to help us all get through this and to take her into his arms and love her and make her whole again.",
