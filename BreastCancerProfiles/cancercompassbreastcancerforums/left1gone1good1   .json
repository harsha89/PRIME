    "Content": "I'm a 3 1/2 year survivor and I have had side effects of pain in feet, legs, arms, and hands ever since I had chemo.  I've attributed this to what is called neuropathy.  I was on Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years and was switched to Aromasin just this past May...the pain increased greatly.  There were days I thought I wouldn't be able to walk. On a whim, I picked up a liquid form of glucosamine and chondroitin with MSM and collagen (brand name - Joint Ease by Drinkables).  One capfull each morning...and I'm feeling amazingly better!  It's been a miracle for me. Some days are still better than others, but overall, this has done the trick.  I don't like to take a lot of medications, so this is just enough for me. I've also noticed that drinking coffee and eating chocolate tend to make my symptoms worse.  That stinks because these are my only two vises... :) Hope this is helpful info.  I'm no doctor, but I'm doing what feels right for me....   ",
