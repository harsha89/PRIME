I have a pill container that I got at the pharmacy with a compartment for each day of the week. I fill in a whole week's supply and then I can tell if I've take the pill for that particular day. Give your Dr. a call. He'll probably reassure you that it isn't a problem. I also sometimes call my pharmacist about medication questions.  He know pills! Good luck! Teresa Thanks very much for responding Teresa. My problem is that I have many meds to take at different times and two I only take at bedtime. All meds but those two are in my kitchen and I do just what you suggested. It's the two meds in the bedroom that fool me. I am to take them just before I go to bed and I have a little bowl for them. I believe I must forget to put them in the bowl, or I put tomorrow night's in the bowl right away and that gets me in trouble. I get a feeling of deja vu sometimes and that convinces me I've already taken them    Lynne   ",
