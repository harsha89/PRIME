      "Content": "Dear Carole, a lot of things matter in BC. The tumor size, the nodes, and if it has metastases. Her-2 is only a additional factor. My mom had BC 4 years ago, and although I am afraid cancer comes back, she is doing just fine right now. I think you have to give more details about your BC so I can try helpping you. Warm Regards, Leo.",
