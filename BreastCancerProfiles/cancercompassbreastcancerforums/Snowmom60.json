      "Content": "I am so glad you decided to have the masectomy!!!!!!!!  Here's a situation:  Back in 1991 my mother in law was DX with breast CA, she had 19 out of 21 lymph nodes and it was grade IV she decided to have a lumpectomy since her surgeon told her it wouldn't make any difference.  My neighbor about the same age (50's) was DX about a month later and had about 23 lymph nodes positive.  She went to the medical college and decided to have a double masectomy.  My mother in law died five years later, my neighbor died 9 years later they were both stage IV.  Your very, very early stage, do what it takes, boobs are only boobs.  My neighbor had her breasts done and a tummy tuck at the same time and looked better than before the cancer.  Both of my husbands grandmothers also had breast cancer and one is alive and the other is 87 right now, they were both stage I so be positive.  I worry about my daughter and we're thinking about genetic testing for her, although I think it may be because all three of them were on hormone replace therapy for menopause but still we want to know if we can prevent it if she has the genes. Good luck! Terry",

      "Content": "Hi Josh, The waiting is the worst isn't it!  Only a couple of more days and you'll know one way or the other.  Hopefully it will be good news and just something like mastitis or something else.  If it is cancer just remember a lot of woman survive breast cancer and live a full life.  Your wife will probably try and be brave for you and your baby, let her know your there for her.  Check into all treatment options.  I saw someone on here wrote about alternatives and that's fine to check into and perhaps use with conventional medicine but I don't think I would skip the standards of care.  It doesn't matter anyway because your wife isn't going to have cancer right!  Only 25% chance out of 100 that's 75% on your side. Let us know. Terry",
