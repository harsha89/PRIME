      "Content": "Hi I'm 43 years old, last month i was diagnosed with breast cancer, last Friday July 5, 2013 I underwent Mastectomy. While waiting for the result of my biopsy, I can't stop the tears in my eyes thinking of my 3 children my eldest is 18 years old, 2nd 9 and my youngest is 7 years old that really needs my care because i gave birth to him with multiple congenital problem (Hypospadias, imperforate anus & he is a blue baby with TOF) he already underwent series of operations for the correction of the said problem, last year was his Open heart surgery. ..I cried because of my illness, while waiting for the result if what stage is my cancer, i was looking for a furom that could possibly help my tears. I went thru many trials in life that i could say i'm strong enough to handle this but being a human it really hurts me, and asking sometimes why all these things happened to me and to my family. Hope thru this forum i will be able to have strenght. Thank you....",
