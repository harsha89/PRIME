      "Content": "I've  noticed Fred Eichhorn mentioned in different threads on this site. Putting aside themail fact that his ideas have been around for over a hundred years (and have been proven, time and time again, to be false), I have personal experience with his \"treatment\". A close friend had breast cancer. It was incurable, prognosis 2 to 5 years. Late in her journey, Eichhorn contacted her. Traveling to LILLIAN, I  listened to his theories for 3 hours. My friend chose to use his extremely expensive \"therapy\", a mineral and shark collagen drink. Surprise! She died. The supplement had no noticeable effect; when she talked to him, he mentioned tests that her oncologist  had never heard of. My friend made it to 5 years before deciding She died. The money she wasted on his treatment would have been better spent enjoying life.",
