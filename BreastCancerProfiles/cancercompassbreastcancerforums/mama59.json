Good luck in making your decision. Joan L Thank you for you imput. the cyst they found you couldn't feel it It's way down deep. I'll know thursday what they find. thanks again   ",

I'm a new member and would apprecate any emput. thanks I agree with Roseann and Joan L,  I am living because I knew my lump did not feel right eventhough all the doctors said it was not cancer.  Finally, a breast surgeon ordered a breast MRI.  It was stage 2 cancer, but I am in remission now and doing well.  I believe you need to explore any possibility that you might have this disease.  All the best to you. Ann  Thank you so much for the imput. the cyst that there talking about you can't feel it. It's way down deep so I'm just worried it was  cancer. thursday I'mgoing thrusday for my mammogram then i'll know somemore.Let you know something when i get back thanks Again    ",

You have the right to a complete explanation of the situation as well as the risk.  Your doctor should do that or you should get a better doctor. Good luck. Roseann Thank you for your imput. the cyst they found you can't feel it it way down deep. I'll know Thursday what going on. I'll let you know thanks again  ",
