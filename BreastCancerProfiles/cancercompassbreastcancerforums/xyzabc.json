      "Content": "Snetrem, Shemay and Sherry, Please keep on posting about your experience with alternative medicine. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer on his birthday  (May 2007). He had colon resection. He was started on FOLFOX6 with Avastin 2 months later. After 3 months on the treatment his PET/CT scans and CEA were normal and are still normal up to now. He will be taken off chemo next month, but the Avastin will be continued for 7 more months. He is now declared a NED. We did not change anything in our diet (we eat lots of whole grains, veggies and fruits, and have our occasional burgers, fries, ice cream, coke, cakes, chocolates etc), so we are quite sure that the good effects he has experienced are attributed to the chemo-- plus, he has the right attitude towards his illness and treatment. He remains cheerful, optimistic and trusting God in everything. It is not his habit to complain, the nurses at the cancer center told us- he is their best patient ever. His surgeon also said the same thing about him. He continues to work fulltime. He is also studying and is attending classes 2 nights a week. I am now starting to research on diets that will promote health and prevent cancers from recurring. Your posts are very informative. Thank you very much.",
