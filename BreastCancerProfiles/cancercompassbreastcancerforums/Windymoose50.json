      "Content": "Hello Bahamasgirl, Yes you are stressed I am sure, you will need to find out how big the lesion is and possibly have an MRI depending on what part of the breast the cancer is in. I had the exact same diagnosis 7yrs ago and I chose to have a mastectomy as I am a nurse and beyond child bearing years.  I chose reconstruction also and am very happy with the results. I had a double sentinal node and that was removed and it had not spread anywhere. The reconstruction is time consuming afterwards but worth it. I just wish I could have had both breasts removed but I had just had major back surgery and the neurosurgon said I needed at least one arm to get up out of a chair.  So after the surgery you and your doc choose, you will know what stage you are and whether you may need chemo or radiation. Try to calm down, take someone with you to appts and take a notebook to keep track of what the different docs say. You will get through this.  See if you can find a support group in your area. It will help to hear others stories and see what kind of treatment is available in your area. Expect friends and family to be very upset, my co-workers would come into my office crying.  They were  more upset than I was.  Take one step at a time and feel free to ask questions anytime....

Slow down, take this one day at a time.  The cough does not mean it has spread.

      "Content": "Hi Nelie, Please talk to your doc about quitting neurontin and start Lyrica. Neurontin causes pretty significant dementia. My doc said no to neurontin. Then if that alone does not work, start a low dose of Fentanyl and work up until pain is better. Remember it may not take all of the pain away but if it is manageable.  You can get toe socks from sock dreams.com , sometimes just keeping the toes from touching makes the pain better. Some people try Vicks salve at night and put socks over your feet. Try to not walk barefooted.  Some people do better with socks and thongs or sandles. The toe socks will work in thongs or sandles and you will find lots of cute socks in there. Everyone has different things that help their feet.  I have been on Lyrica and Fentanyl for nearly 2yrs. I have good days and bad. Changes in the weather will affect u too..  Take care. Gayle  ",

I and several others from our support group quit around the same time. Enough was enough.... I made it four years and was miserable and it was time to quit and feel better again. My breast cancer was only stage one so I was in a very low range of having it return after a mastectomy. The doc tried me on other drugs and all caused bone aching and it was no longer worth it. I am at 7yrs and still doing ok... Sometimes quality of life is very important... :) Gayle",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine, I had one breast removed 5yrs ago and an implant put in the other.  I wanted to have both removed and the doc would not do that as I had just had major back surgery and could not have gotten up just using one arm. So I wish both could have been removed but could not. As far as pain, I went back to work at two weeks.  They took the drain out but otherwise I had no feeling.  I am one rare bird.  After the surgery my nipple sensation came back on the back of my arm(this is very rare) People in support group just love it when there is a new person and I tell them. The worst thing that happened was this intense itching in my armpit, all the scratching in the world would not stop it. I did have reconstruction started at the time of my surgery. I like my new boobs better than the old ones. I am 58 yrs old now.  You see breast cancer saved my life.  They found symptoms of early stage multiple multiple myeloma. I just had the breast cancer a stem cell transplant and I hope it gives me more years of life. I did not need chemo or radiation with the breast cancer. Take care, write any time and I wish you the best! Gayle",
