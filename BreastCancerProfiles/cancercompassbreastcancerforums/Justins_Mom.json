    "Content": "My son, who has gbm, got severe nerve damage due to Velcade.  This started in Oct and he's still got some, but is a whole lot better.  He had pain in his legs and feet.  You couldn't touch him without it hurting.  Needless to say they stopped the Velcade.  Lyrica has helped a lot, along with a foot cream that the pharmacist compounded for him.  It doesn't appear to be permanent damage.",
