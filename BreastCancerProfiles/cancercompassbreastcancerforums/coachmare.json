      "Content": "I am now on Tamoxifen and am experiencing lesser side effects than Aromasin and Arimidex. With them I had joint pain, a trigger thumb, heal spurs and heel pain. I felt like a much older person overnight. When I went off all cancer drugs for about 6 months after taking them for about 6 months, my energy increased and I had no discomforts. My oncologist suggested I try Tamoxifen which I've been on for 4 months. My body feels older and I have less energy but I haven't had any other discomforts.",
