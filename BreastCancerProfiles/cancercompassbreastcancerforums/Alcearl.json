      "Content": "My mom has ovarian lieomyosarcoma, which really means that she has a cancer that is highly aggressive and resistant to treatment. She had a complete hysterectomy, and at the present, no disease is seen on a CT. The docs aren't very hopeful, 40-50% survival for 2 years. She's about the 35 person in the world with a confirmed case of this type of LMS. She's planning a trip w/my dad while she's well enough. The rest of us are hoping for a miracle. She's only 61, and should have a lot of life left. I've decided that if there is a devil, cancer is it. Back to you, I used to run a program for individuals w/developmental disabilities, and I'm curious about your sis. Does she understand what she's going through? How tough is it to explain things to her? I hope you are finding enough support for you to help support her. Amy",
