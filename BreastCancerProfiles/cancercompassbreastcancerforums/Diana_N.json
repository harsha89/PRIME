I have been reading messages about the horrible pain caused by the estrogen inhibitor drugs prescribed after radiation treatment. I wonder if any of you would recommend having chemo rather than the radiation/drug therapy? Sounds to me like the radiation/drug therapy process is long and horrible.....I know chemo is horrible, too, but for a shorter time. Any info you can share with me would be appreciated. I see my oncologist for the first time this week, and would like to be better informed. Thanks! I was diagnosed 10 years ago on 12/26/97.  I have done 2 types of chemo/six weeks of radiation and I am currently completing my second clinical trail using the estrogen inhibor drugs (5 years of tamoxifin and now my fourth and last year of exemstane).  I did research to find these clinical trails (3rd phase) because I wanted to kill the cancer in my body.  I now have two beautiful grandchildren (4 year old granddaughter and 2 year old grandson) and life is great.  I was 45 when diagnosed and I'm planning to retire within 2 years.  Please don't be afraid of any of these modern wonders.  Please do your research and find out the side effects and remember the side effects are for everyone who ever tried the drugs.....you won't have them all.  With the modern meds and wonderful doctors I have had, I'm here and planning to hang out for another 54 years.  Catch it early and kill it well...............dianimaln  livin' life",
