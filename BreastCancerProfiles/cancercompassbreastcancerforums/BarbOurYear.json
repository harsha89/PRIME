      "Content": "Jean, thank you so much for your caring response.  I think you're right.  Hopefully they'll tell me what the plan is when I go back to the doctors on Tues & Wednesday and then I'll know if I have time to get to my regular doctor.  I just feel like I'm in the dark right now and my imagination is working overtime. How are you doing after enduring all of your treatment? Thank you and God bless you, too. Barb",

      "Content": "Dear Amanda, Thank you so much for your response.  You sure sound good natured about your situation.  I got a good laugh out of your comment about the way you and your cousin went through the whole experience and that psychologically you wanted to experience the whole thing  -- You are very funny. My good news is that the doctors told me when I went in for my blood work that the results of the PET and CT scans came back clear -- no cancer present!  The lymphoma was contained in the tumor they removed from my leg!!  They're still going to check my blood work, and I fully expect to hear \"All Clear\" when I go back in a couple of weeks. Keep up your great spirit.  Warm regards, Barb",

      "Content": "Hi everyone.  I've been diagnosed w/lymphoma.  Hasn't been staged yet, but I've had the surgery, a PET scan and will go next week for CT scan and blood work.  Chemo will probably start soon after.  Here's what I'm wondering.  I'm tired all the time.  I feel like I have a cold or something.  Have a phlemmy cough since November --- does anyone think I should go to my regular MD now to see if it could be cleared up, or just wait and see if it's part of the cancer?  We don't have insurance, so I'm hesitant to spend more money to visit the doctor if I can just wait until the chemo begins. Hope this makes sense.  What do you all think?  Thanks for your time. Barb",

      "Content": "Thanks, Pamela.  I was thinking along those lines too.  I hate spending the money for a dr to tell me I have a cold ... but, wonder if I should get this cleared up before I get run down from the chemo.  From what I read, chemo kills cells, not viruses that might be in your body.  Hmmmm??",
