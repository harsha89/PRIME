      "Content": "Thanks, I don't feel brave.  I want to cry, scream, and run away.  But none of those are options.  I have young adult children and several grandchildren and they all need me.  I am constantly doing things for others to keep my mind busy.  I just hate the wait.  Last MRI the surgeon said there was nothing to worry about and now I am advised to do the biopsy.  I was prepared to tell them I want it out, but not told to have it removed.  My husband has his head in the sand, he is just saying that everything is going to be fine don't worry.  I am looking just for a place to vent and ask questions.  I really don't know if I should be worried or just muttle through until everything is resolved.",

      "Content": "I just went for a second opinion, my ob/gyn did not even tell me that I had a lump still.  I just keep losing weight, 40 pounds now, and no one can tell me why.  One doctor told me what ever reason, it was not killing me so don't worry.  My mom had BC at 35 and I am now 38, I already have had a lump removed and other lumps form.  I feel the doctor thinks I am over reacting, but then I think these are not things going on with him so why would he be worried.  I don't know, just getting more worried.  My mom keeps saying it is nothing, my husband says nothing, my daughter is buying me wigs, and my sister-in-law has me in the grave.  There is no time for me to process everything in between all of them and on top of this I babysit my grand-daughter every night while my daughter works.  Just no time to breath!!!!!!!!!",
