    "Content": "My grandma is 76 years old, she has Polythcemia Vera (was treated with Hydrea up untill around Sep-Oct 07).  She has congestive heart failure, and diabetes. She is on oxygen for pulmonary fibrosis (she never smoked but was around coal dust from my grandpa working in the mines). She is on all types of meds, including Warfarin, her insulin of course, and high blood meds, and thyroid meds. Back in September of 07 she had a lump removed and was dx with IDC Stage 1, high Grade 3 Nuclear Grade 8.  When they removed the lump they also did a lumpectomy and said they had clear margins.  0/7 Nodes was taken and they all came back negative. The Onc told her that no treatment was needed but if she woulf feel better they could do radiation, in which she said no too. In February she noticed a golf ball size lump under her arm.  She went in to have it looked at and they set up for her to have it removed in March.  Well a couple of days before the scheduled surgery she was admitted to the hospital as she had turned sepsis.  (3-4th time in the past 2 years this has happened) Finally in April they removed the lump and did a PET Scan that showed multiple bony metastis, a mass on her adrenal gland in front of left kidney, her spine area, sternum, chest wall, thoracic, and 2 mets on ribs, her humeral head in left arm, They did a bone scan and the bone scan said the spine area was from digenerative disease (arthritis).  She is ER/PR -negative and HER2 positive.  A month after this she finally scheduled to come in to the Onc for treatment options. She started taking today ,Xeloda 6 tablets a day and the Tykerb hasnt arrived in the mail yet.  Home health care will be coming 2 times a week to keep watch on her blood with the Warfarin and Xeloda drug interaction. I know her prognosis is poor, but still she is yellow, dark urine, eats small meals (but eats), she is always tired, and out of breath really bad even on oxygen.  She now says her eyes are bothering her as everything seems dark to her (she says this is do to cataracts) She does have a teeny weeny bit of confusion but since this is nothing really new I cannot say if brain mets.  she did say the eye things been going on for weeks and the Eye Dr says each time, next year, next year to remove cataracts. She does go on the 7th of July for a Mammogram, and on the 8th they will be doing 3 different MRI's and will be going to the Onc for results on the 14th of July. If there is any information you can give our family we would greatly appreciate this.",
