    "Content": "I am currently dealing with this.  I had 5 months of chemo, lumpectomy and 33 rounds of radiation.  It feels bruised and Tylenol or Advil seem to help.  Oncologist sent me to CT scans and bone scan in October, all clear.  The pain keeps getting worse and worse.  No idea what to do. ",
