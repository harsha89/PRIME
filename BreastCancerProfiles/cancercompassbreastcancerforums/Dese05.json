    "Content": "I am truly sorry to hear you have had to live pmps for 15+ years.  Congratulations on being cancer free. I have a question for you to try to help comfort my mom.  In 2007 my mom was diagnosed with DCIS Breast cancer.  The surgeon that she had told her it was extremely important that she have a mastectomy, that if she didn't she could die.  So she had the surgery in Sept 07.  Immediately she noticed Lots of pain and asked the surgeon about it.  He ignored her concerns for 6 months before putting her in any physical therapies or addressing the pain at all. Now all the doctors she talkes to tell her she will be in the amount of pain she is in for the rest of her life.  What i am asking is, is there anything that I can do or say to comfort her? Thank you for listening to my story. ",
