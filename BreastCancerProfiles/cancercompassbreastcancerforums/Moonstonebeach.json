    "Content": "My husband took Xeloda and it was a horrible drug. He was so fatigued that he could not function. I could barely rouse him for anything. After the first round we had him switched to 5FU. He had a much better course of treatment and he was able to work after the 48 hour treatment. I know that some of the oncologists have switched to Xeloda but I have nothing good to say about it. Katye",
