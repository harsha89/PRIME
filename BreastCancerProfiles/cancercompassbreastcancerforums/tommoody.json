I don't know about you, but every history book I ever read was full of intrigues, behind the scenes dealings, and people in power manipulating their subjects through lies.  Hindsight is 20/20.  No doubt, you'd find it hard to believe that 9 million people were being murdered in concentration camps in Germany during World War II  -- that is, if you hadn't learned it in school and heard it from the authorities you trust.  Imagine if you were living in Germany during the Third Reich, and somebody tried to tell you what was going on.  You might laugh in their face and refuse to \"waste your time\" examining the evidence.  If you never look outside of that box, all you'll ever know is what's in that box. Don't just talk to your doctor. Your doctor received his/her education from the very institution that is killing you. He will tell you the same lies he was told. If he knew anything, he wouldn't be practicing mainstream medicine. Listen to the doctors in these videos. Get in touch with them if you can. \"Go to the pine, if you want to learn about the pine. Go to the bamboo, if you want to learn about the bamboo.\" (~ Basho) Surgery, Radiation, Drugs, Chemo = Medieval. The body needs infusions of vitamins and minerals, and not to be flooded with toxins. The greatest medical invention of the 20th century is the JUICER. As you put less poisonous food into your body (processed and genetically modified food, refined carbohydrates, high-fructose corn syrup, pesticide-ridden, and, yes, cooked foods), and more raw foods and vegetable juices, especially dark leafy greens, you'll be amazed at your uncovered potential.

So why not learn to walk in the SON and walk in His victory.We have 60-80 yrs. on this earth why not walk in the light of Gods word .There are 66 books of God breathed and inspired words of life, study to find your answers.What can man do to you,fear God he has your eternity in His hands.   ETMOODY",
