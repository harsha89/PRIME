      "Content": "I remember when I got diagnosed I found some of these forums and posted \"Scared, Overwhelmed and Confused\" ... and I was all of those things.  I know how you feel.  I have a special needs child who requires 24/7 care and I KNEW that I had to make the right decision so that I could be around for a long time to care for him.  I am glad that your son is doing well.  The strength you had for him will surface again as you begin to wrap your mind around your diagnosis.  That will happen. I spent a month on the internet searching and studying all I could find.  I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with DIEP flaps.  I didn't have to do chemo or radiation because of my decision.  I have peace of mind and I am completely happy with the amazing work that my reconstructive surgeon did to restore what cancer stole from me.   I would be happy to share my story with you if you would like.  It is long and I might need to email it directly to your email address.  I decided to write it to help other women going through the journey behind me.  It starts with diagnosis, goes through the decisions, and on through surgery.   This is an emotional time and may really be the most difficult time because there are so many UNKNOWNS.  Once you have a diagnosis and can make a plan, it is easier to focus.  You will remember that from helping your son through his medical stuff and it will come naturally to you. Keep you chin up and I will keep you in my prayers.  Hugs, Tammy",

      "Content": "I had DIEP reconstruction on August 13, 2009.  I was diagnosed with DCIS in my left breast and I elected to have a bilateral mastectomy to get rid of the risk of cancer going to my right breast over time.  I needed that peace of mind.  I am so glad that I did!  My surgeon is Dr. Chrysopoulo from PRMA in San Antonio (www.prma-enhance.com).  Dr. C had Dr. Ledoux working with him during my surgery and the total time for surgery cut in half... it was about 8 hours for the reconstruction.  I had the mastectomy done just prior to beginning the reconstruction on the same day.  I just finished the 2nd stage/phase of the surgery which included the nipple reconstruction about one week ago.  I am very pleased with how it looks and how natural it feels.  I am very happy that I have my own skin and tissue and no foreign objects in my body that may require future surgeries.  Once I am recovered from this surgery, there will be no need for any future surgeries.  I would highly recommend the DIEP reconstruction.  I could not be happier.  Having a diagnosis of cancer is frightening and a lot of emotions are stirred up.  I kind of see the DIEP reconstruction as a blessing because it gave me back what cancer surgery took away.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you would like to read my full story (it is 11 pages and goes from diagnosis through surgery) and I will send it privately to you.  Blessings, Tammy",

      "Content": "Hi Ron: Calcifications are what radiologists are looking for on a mammogram.  That does not mean that it is malignant or cancerous.  I think I was told 80-85% of all calcifications are not to worry about.   My mammogram last year showed some questionable areas and they did some followup studies, like spot compression views and ultrasound to look at it more closely.  At that point they told me to come back in 6 months to see if there had been any changes.  I didn't feel good about waiting 6 months and they decided to do a stereotactic biopsy which showed allowed them to give me a diagnosis of DCIS.  I rely on my \"gut\" feeling a lot when making decisions about things.   Did they tell her to come back for some more studies when they talked to her on the phone today?  Hugs to you both.

      "Content": "Hi.  I was diagnosed with DCIS in my left breast.  I did extensive research and made the decision to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with DIEP flap.  I am so very glad that I did.  I originally thought getting the implants would be the right thing to do but after seeing all the pros and cons, choosing the DIEP was absolutely the right decision for me.  I had my DIEP surgery on August 13 and just had my nipple reconstruction done one week ago.  I am so happy with the way things look and feel.  It is a major surgery and recovery, but once it is done... it is done! My surgeon is Dr. Chrysopoulo from PRMA in San Antonio and I drove 350 miles to see him.  He is posting my experience on his website so that others can read more.  You can go to www.prma-enhance.com and look under Testimonials on the left sidebar - Tammy's Journey.  I don't think my full story is there yet, but if you want me to send it to you, send me a private message with your email and I will be happy to send you my full story.  Follow your gut in making your decision.  Many blessings, Tammy",
