      "Content": "disclaimer: taking the advice of someone you have never met and who has never examined you, based on a conversation on a message board, is probably not a good way to manage your health. :-) So take what I say with a grain of salt (ie don't put a lot of faith in it). See what your doctor thinks, and the two of you should make a plan. Dear Tylette, There is something going on because you have a rash that comes and goes. Is there anything you can think of that happens to that breast that does not happen to the other breast? Does your husband favor that breast during lovemaking? Does he brush his teeth beforehand? If it is cancer, it will get bigger and you may eventually be able to feel a small knot. Perhaps one course of action would be for you to check for a mass there once a week in the shower when soapy, and for an ultrasound to be done every 3 months even if no mass is found (ultrasounds are harmless as they do not involve ionizing radiation like mammograms). If nothing turns up over the course of the next year, the ultrasounds could stop. I would still get mammograms according to the usual schedule (annually if you are over the age of 40). This is just my suggestion. If your doctor has a different suggestion, I would strongly advise you to pay no attention to me and to decide for yourself based on what the two of you talk about. If other rashes start to appear elsewhere, a good next step would be to change laundry detergents and change soaps and see a dermatologist. Is there any history of eczema or psoriasis in the family? Best of Luck to you, -Amnia",

The underlying breast cancer may be an invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). In DCIS, the cancer cells are completely contained within the milk ducts. Around half of the women who have Paget\u2019s disease will have a breast lump that can be felt at the time it is diagnosed. Paget\u2019s disease occurs in about 1\u20132 out of every 100 women with breast cancer. It usually occurs in women in their 50s, but can occur at an earlier or later age. It can affect men but this is extremely rare. It usually first appears as a scaly, red rash affecting the nipple and sometimes the dark area of skin surrounding the nipple (the areola). The rash always affects the nipple first, and may then affect the areola. It does not go away and may become sore. The area may bleed slightly. ------------------------ read the rest of the article at: http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Breast/Typesofbreastcancer/Pagetsdisease",

Aromatase inhibitors are drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors work by inhibiting aromatase, an enzyme which converts androgens into estrogens. Breast tissue is stimulated by estrogens; decreasing estrogen prevents cancer recurrence. In contrast to pre-menopausal women, in whom most of the estrogen is produced in the ovaries, in post-menopausal women most of the body's estrogen is produced in the adrenal gland from the conversion of androgens. THIS IS WHY TERRBEAR ABOVE WAS NOT SAFE EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD A \"TOTAL\" HYSTERECTOMY (\"total\" means includes ovaries). In the past, tamoxifen had been the standard treatment. Now, the best treatment is an AI for postmenopausal estrogen receptor positive breast cancers.

      "Content": "Q: \"If I do the radiation only and use natural progestrone (sic) cream, balanced nutrition and exercise as a means of trying to stay cancer free, is that just wishful thinking?\" A: Yes, that is just wishful thinking. Although most women do not get any side effects from tamoxifen, it is possible that you might. But you should not only think about what may happen if you DO take the tamoxifen, you should also think about what may happen if you DON'T take the tamoxifen. In medicine, there is a concept called the risk/benefit ratio. There is risk to taking tamoxifen, but it is very small compared to the risk of more ductal cancer. Here are the facts: the addition of tamoxifen to lumpectomy and radiotherapy in the treatment of DCIS reduces the cumulative five-year incidence of a subsequent invasive tumor by 38%. I think that eating sensibly is a good idea for a lot of reasons, but treating or curing cancer is not one of them. Healthy eating does not cure cancer. There are no randomized double-blind controlled clinical trials supporting this. I have reviewed available literature on the raw diet and although it looks like a very healthy low fat way of eating, all beneficial claims come from testimonials, not scientific trials. Exercise may possibly reduce the risk of cancer, specifically colon cancer. Exercise will not treat or cure any forms of cancer that you have already. You should eat a sensible diet and exercise. Everyone should. But it is not a replacement for tamoxifen. With regard to your wanting to use natural progesterone cream when you have ductal carcinoma - would you check with your doctor and reply to this thread with exactly what his response was? I would like to read what he said. Thank you. Best wishes, -A",

      "Content": "PET = for cancer specifically. cancer cells require a lot of sugar to reproduce as fast as they do. the injection you got prior to the pet scan is a radioactive sugar. the cancer cells suck up more sugar than the non-cancerous cells. so the cancerous areas of the body become more radioactive, and radioactivity is what the pet scan is taking pictures of. PET is probably the best way to find cancer which is why it is almost always part of a staging work up. pet scans look somewhat fuzzy and are sometimes hard to interpret unless a CT scan was done at the same time to compare the pet scan to. MRI / CT scans : similar pictures. CT scans are faster but involve ionizing radiation which is bad. MRI is slower but uses magnetism which is harmless. CT gives slightly better images of bone, MRI slightly better for soft tissues, but the difference is minimal. They are both excellent images and are not fuzzy looking. Trying to guess what to do next on your own, because you have concerns over your oncologist, is understandable. However, you do not have the years of medical basic science or clinical experience to make decisions that are anything but a guess, and experienced people on the internet have not examined you or your records or taken a detailed history so they also are not doing anything more than guessing. I know I say this a lot on this web site, but that is because it is very important. You have met your deductible so it is not a cost problem. And you are talking about something that could potentially affect whether you live only another couple of years vs many decades. Why not get a second opinion from someplace that is known for being outstanding in the cancer field? here they are. if someplace is close-by, go there. if it means a plane ride to any of them, might as well take a plane ride to #1 or #2.
