    "Content": "Well My Husband had Testicular cancer in 1995 and now this year it came back as lung cancer He has been on 2 different chemos In April when we found out his Numbers were 55,000.00 and they said he was going to die, Well so far he is still alive But the markers dont want to go down fast . they are at 6,809. and they want him to have the surgery to remove the lung. they said it should be in a 2 digit number. We pray alot and how that when he goes in to surgery that the number will be done or at lest in a small 2 digit number. it is hard. because he has been with a 24 cemo for 6 days once a month and now he is on a cemo that the first 24 hours he is on cemo and the next 5 days he is an out pateint in the hospital. I hope this will help you. that some one is going thru the same thing but different cancer. He is very strong. Well we will pray for you. so write back. thank you... Susan Cano",
