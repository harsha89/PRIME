The doctors said that at the time of the original cancer, one little cell or so was not found. It took that many years to read its ugly self. We both will accept all the prayer we can get. Thanks and prayers to you. If you are just starting this road, remember that 22 years ago they didn't know what they know now. That the nutitional side is much better and there is more information and more surviviors all the time. Blessings, Rose",

Get a good \"organic\"dentist as the opening of the mercury in the fillings can harm you as it is removed. I read that it can cause toxins to get into the system and one may not feel well for a time. So a good colon cleanse would be good if you can. The article I read is The Master Cleanse and it uses lemon. The book cost abour $3. Rose",

      "Content": "Hi, My sister in law, a twenty two year survivor, has gotten cancer again. The treatments were withheld for months then hit hard. She had has two years of chemo-multiple types and radiation. She is a fighter but is losing the battle. I am not sure the medical community that she choose did enough care soon enough. But on the othere hand, the choice is always theirs(her and her husband). Any way the chemo and the radiation aren't enough this time. No more surgeries. She is dying. she is now is hospice. At one time, she was taking the nurtition along with the mediciations. The newer doctors intergrate both. Her markers were going down and she was feeling better. They chose to stop this as the \"medical\" alone would do it. It wasn't doing it before and now it is too late. Please, talk to the doctors at cancer treatment and nurtional assistance along with the treatmens. It will help you survive the medicines. It will make your life a little easier and it is worth it. I have seen others come out of stage 4 doing both. I will and do miss the person who is going away. I hurt for her. I hate watching what this is and has done to her. Her mind, body, and life. It is hard to say goodbye. It is hard to share when the normal things are not important anymore. Sorry. Rose",
