      "Content": "I can't believe that weight gain is an issue with arimidex.  I took tamoxifen for one year and arimidex for 4.  Weight gain wasn't an issue.  Possibly the weight gain is from other drugs that people are taking with it?  I did have joint pain and hot flashes, but decided that was better than tumor. We're lucky to have this medication, side effects or not, and when you consider the success of arimidex, that should help with decision making.   Arimidex isn't for women with their ovaries.  It is to suppress estrogen production from the  pituitary gland.  It keeps androgens from becoming estrogen and drops estrogen levels to a very low state, almost immeasurable.   Living without estrogen is a challenge at first, but you do what you must to combat menopausal symptoms.   Be sure to exercise and have a healthy diet.  It's a tough medication to take, but worth it in my opinion since I am 7 years tumor free.  It may be harder to exercise with joint or muscle pain from the medication, but that did improve measurably for me after about 6 months.  Be sure to talk with your Dr about side effects and work to make them easier for yourself.   Good Luck and I hope you will be tumor free.   Susan    ",

      "Content": "anita, it will get better. It has for me anyway. I've been on arimidex almost 3 years. At first the pain was very deep, and now it just seems to land wherever there maybe would have been a future problem. It still hurts but not as bad. It's much more livable. It seemed to take at least 6 months to start to lift. Keep up with your exercise, take warm baths, take that tylenol. Have you looked into help for the hot flashes? They aren't just annoying.. they can interfere with your quality of life. There are some antidepressants that help with the flashes..paxil, and effexor. My gyn/onc had me take a small amount of megace and it killed the hot flashes, and then... I began taking neurontin for a different problem and it is doing a good job keeping the hot flashes down, so I was able to shelf the megace. I hope the femara is successful for you and you will be glad you took it. So far for me, so good. :o) SusanL",
