    "Content": "I've searched the board and cannot find any discussion.  Could you direct  me to it? First mammogram revealed suspect areas in both breasts.  A mass in the left breast.  Suspicious calcifications in the right. Then it became a matter of choosing which breast to investigate first.  The physicians chose the left.  An ultrasound was done on the left breast. 10 core biopsies were done on the left, and the results were negative, (confirmed by two pathologists), however, those results were considered discordant in light of the appearance of the lesion, and a wire-localization excisional biopsy was recommended. However, then, it was decided that the right breast -- the breast with the odd microcalcification patterns - should be re-imaged.  Only on a lateral view mammogram, did a lesion, in addition to the microcalcifications, show in that breast. The recommendation was first for a stereotactic biopsy in the right breast. Now, the recommendation is for an MRI.  Surely some radiologist and surgeon has seen these types of abnormalities before and has a bit more of an idea of what is going on?",
