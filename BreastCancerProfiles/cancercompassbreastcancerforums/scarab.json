    "Content": "OH MY Gosh!!!!   I have for the past 4 years from radical mastectomy/radiation have pain beyond anything else I ever have been through,  I have severe arm pain from lymphodema and have had surgery on my neck for nerve damages in between degenerative disc.  But I thought I am the only person going thru this, the doctors either shake their heads and treat you like a whiner/drug addict when you explain these symptoms and ask for pain meds.  I now cry each day and I literally feel worse now than when I went through all my cancer treatments etc., etc.. it is becoming unbearable.  I have had 2 c section, a hysterectomy, radical mastecomy and this pain does not even compare.  I basically go thru a cycle of no sleep for 2 to 3 days, then only to pass out from sheer exhaustion.  If I knew now ,I would have never done the radiation because all my doc said was you will get lymphodema.  Well at the time I am trying to get thru the cancer thing not really understanding what the outcome will be.  I feel I was not really told everything and of course I can't do anything now.  I am usually an optimistic about life, but now I am so limited.  I hope someone that is going through the same thing will email me so we can share.",
