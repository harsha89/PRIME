      "Content": "I am too stage iv mets to lung, live, bone, spine and brain. I had a reaction to Herceptin a few years back when first dx with breast cancer although then only stage 1a. I now do lower doses of herceptin every week and perjeta every three week along with estrogen blocker. I am also doing alternative, with tumeric, cyanne, and other supplements. I am also doing heat therapy and essencial oils. My prognosis wasn't good but now 8 months later the cancer is stable (no growth). I am independent and enjoying life. I did decline chemo due to quality of life choice. If I wasn't going to live more than months or a year I wanted to live it well. So far looking into a nother year.",

      "Content": "I was dx witH RSD when I broke my right wrist. I had to have radiation on my back and hip. I tried not to stress although for me it ended up being a very stressful experience. Fortunately a few weeks after radiation I was okay. I also had a mx with no problems of RSD recurrence. Relax, and take pain meds to prevent a recurrence. Don't put up with the pain because it can easily go into the pain syndrome.",

I have stage 4 and I am not deluding myself thinking GOD will provide a \"cure\", If that magical thinking is comforting to you, indulge yourself. I don't find any of that GOD crap useful, helpful or worth a second of my time. This is a real thread about dying, I doubt you have ill intent, but please take it somewhere else. To BreastCA4, This thread and your comments bear the marks of someone who knows much about the subject being discussed. I have no doubt that you talk from the heart when you give a stinging rebuke against giving people such as yourself who are terminal any hope. Stage4 is terminal. You are stage4, therefore you are terminal. Knowing that, you may find my comments to be useful as you prepare for what lies ahead. You sound as though you have done quite a bit of research on the subject of being terminal. There is another who recently died of cancer whose last book discussed this matter in great detail. His name was Richard Dawkins. I think he is best known for his book entitled \u201cThe Case against God\u201d. According to Mr. Dawkins, as a person advances towards terminal, they pass through five (5) stages. The first is DISPAIR. This is often accompanied by anger towards those who would attempt to give worthless encouragement. After all, the person is terminal. The second phase is DESPERATION. This phase occurs when all actions to ward off terminal appear to no longer work and all seems lost. The third phase is DEPRESSION. This phase is fairly self explanatory. When any hope of recovery has evaporated, then the end and what that implies leaves the person with no other choice than to become depressed, clinically. The fourth and fifth stages should really be lumped together since the first initiates the second. They are DEATH and DESTRUCTION. At the death of the body there comes with it a destruction of everything that was, just a moment before, that person. The end is total annihilation. Nothing that was is now there. It is as if that person never existed; if it were not for the memories still harbored by those still breathing. Richard ended this expose with a warning to anyone who might find his findings a bit too morbid. To them he said, \u201cGet over it\u201d. So, there you have it from one who knows where you are going. Now, there is another book which gives quite a few people hope, however it is not for the faint of heart. It is simply \u201cThe Bible\u201d. It talks about GOD \u2018crap\u2019, so I would recommend that you stay away since it demands an open mind and a hopeful heart. I hope you find my words helpful as you prepare for you own annihilation. Clint     Clint, it is inappropiate to say the God crap. If you don't believe keep it to yourself, and respect those who believe differently. As the stages go...when I first heard I had stage iv cancer, lungs, lymphatic, bones, spine, and liver, I had an amazing peace I was going to be ok. I knew God would take care of me. The next month was hard, but as I leaned on Jesus, He gave me a sweetness that only comes supernaturally. I had acceptance with joy. It's been two months, and I still have peace. I am not sure God will heal me. I pray that He is glorified either way. I am not ashamed of the gospel or Christ, because He is my rock. I look to Him for wisdom, and know if I live or die it is good cause I know where I am going. He is a God of love. When your time is up...it is up.",

My brother recently remarked that one of the few positives that he has taken from his own battle is the fact that he no longer wonders how he would react to the words \u201cYou have cancer\u201d. Yours is not an easy road. Nor was it for the early Israelites as they prepared to enter the \u2018Promised Land\u2019.  Moses has brought them as far as GOD will allow. The road ahead would be hard, this we later find out in the Book of Joshua. Through Moses, GOD makes the following promise \u201cThe LORD Himself goes before you, and will be with you; He will never leave you or forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged\u201d. Deuteronomy 31:8. This promise applies to you as well. Second, please fill out some more information about yourself. Before I respond to any post I make it a rule to go back and read past posts as well as other pertinent information about the person. I do that out of respect, since comments can be taken many different ways, and often are, in a supercharged atmosphere such as is on a blog site like this. Last, but not least, thank you for your friendly rebuke. The phrase \u2018god crap\u2019 was not of my own making. This particular thread quickly spiraled out of control, as I recall. I love atheists; however they are often very self assured. This person was adamant that there was no hope to be gained by touting \u2018god crap\u2019. My words were merely a reflection of the atheist\u2019s mantra. Sometimes when one sees their position laid out in their own terminology it gives them pause. Unfortunately, in this case, it did not. Please feel free to skim over my past posts. If it assists you in creating a clear picture of me and my intentions then it may very well be worth the investment of a few minutes May GOD Bless you and may the Peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you in this, the struggle of your life. Clint    Good to see you are a believer as I am. I apoloize for mis-understanding you. I do not know where to fill out more information. I am new to this board. I know my life and times are in God's hands. I am at peace, but know the journey will be hard. I agree...I will go as far as God wants me to go. Pray I will keep my eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith.",

      "Content": "Clint, I am mostly blogging on fb. It is hard to do it here cause it demands a lot to keep up. I am on my 61st fb blog. My friends are my prayer warriors. Right now radiation treatment is taking a tow on my body. Because they are radiating the back of my neck, it touches my esophagus. My esophagus is swollen and swallowing is painful. It is even hard to swallow water. I have six more radiation treatments and then a Gamma Beta Knife for a spot in the brain. Pray there is no other brain cancer found. If so they will abort the procedure and give me 2 months to live. Not doing whole brain radiation cause of possible side effects that could warehouse me. If it is my time to go, it is my time. I am at peace with God, and just now, need to get my house in order. Do need encouragement today. I know the Lord well. He is my first love.",
