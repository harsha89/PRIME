    "Content": "Hi everybody: my fellow Aromasin 'thrivers', It is so amazing to finally find this site as well and read over everyone's valuable contributing posts on grappling with the physical travails of Aromasin, not to mention all the psychological effects 'post-cancer surgery/treatment.' It all really helps to not feel so alone, isolated and a little less crazy with all the litany of painful, challenging side-effects that only '2%' of us are enduring? At least, we can keep metaphorically holding each other's hands, I hope. I am a 46 year old mother of 3 young girls (a 10 year old and 6 year old twins) who was dx with 2 different forms of estrogen + breast cancer in my right breast (2003): one aggressive, one non-aggressive, stage 2. Had three of the best '2nd' opinions out there, which all urged a mandatory mastectomy and sentinel node removal -they got 3- with a course of the most aggressive chemo cocktail known then afterwards, which was finished in June, 2004. One of my nodes came back as questionable and they wanted to go back for 10 more nodes, but I said \"No, I need my nodes more than my breast, thank you.\" I then dutifully went on Tamoxifen for 7 months, but hated it so immediately and intensely (the psychological toll was 'gi-enormous' and I did not wish to add anti-depressants to my list) that I begged my doctor to find something else. He said I was his most sentive patient. After a moth on Arimidex, which actually induced my period = definitely not good (but I have been somewhat of a guinea pig with him), he put me on a relatively new drug for the USA called Fareston/aka Toremifene, which I tolerated much better mentally (though my physical side effects to all these anti-estrogen/fake menopause inducing drugs has continually been beyond extreme to say the least). I was on Fareston until June, 2007 when I decided to switch oncologists (male to female) and hospitals...my new oncologist told me that I needed to be on Aromasin, since I am finally, officially post-menopausal and 3 years is now considered the maximum benefit for Tamoxifen/or Tamoxiffen-like drugs. For me, I have also struggled with significant weight gain, though I live a militantly, energetically healthy lifestyle. Just prior to being diagnosed, I enjoyed the best shape of my life: was running/doing Ashtanga yoga 4-5 x week. Now, I relate to all of you who feel 80, stiff, achey, painful tender feet and joints (I already have osteoarthritis in my left knee from an ACL surgery/resulting scar tissue 13 years ago to compound the pain and chronic, stubborn plantar fasciitis in my right foot for the past 1.5+ years). Swimming and biking just isn't going to cut it for that essential endorphin high! Frankly, I heartily applaud those of you with the guts to step outside the fear 'box,' ditch all of the drugs to reclaim your bodies/redefined sense of well-being by leaping into the unknown no matter what the doctors say. We are all co-creating with them as to what the real lived experience of this treatment is versus what some study says we should do or not do! My doctor just informed me that instead of ending all this drug therapy in 2009 as expected (which would be my 5 year marker on the stuff, she wants me to stay on Aromasin for the rest of my life! which I simply cannot imagine) But, we are not statistics and should trust our intuition: i.e. demand better drugs to be developed even though we are a small but growing portion of the cancer community! Let's keep dialoguing, sharing tips on what works to alleviate side-effects (I, too, eat a lot of greek 0% yogurt and calcium supplements, leafy greens, probiotics/green tea and kombucha tea, plus glucosamine/chrondroitan, bone health supplements. Cox 2 inhibitors for inflammation, blood builder pill - all from Whole Foods. I avoid red foods like someone with rheumatoid arthritis should: no red wine, red meat, etc. And rest, stretch, rest, stretch, etc.) There is a book called Pain-Free by Egoscue that I highly recommend for a course of stretches to alleviate pain anywhere in the body. Massage, mustard or epsom salt baths detoxify and physical therapy also can help immensely to maintain muscle mass and tone when working out is beyond the call of duty. Thanx so much for sharing your journeys. I look forward to continuing our dialogue. Victoria",
