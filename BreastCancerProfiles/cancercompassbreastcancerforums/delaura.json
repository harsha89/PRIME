After double mastectomy.chemo and radiation I began armidex.  After 2 yrs of armidex I switched to femara.  Never had joint pain before armidex, thats why I switched. Sorry to say not much better with femara. I too am consideration stopping all medication.  I am sleeping 10 and 12 hours a night with tingling sensation in legs followed by hot flashes.  Muscle pain in arms.  I am totally bald now with no expectation of a full head of hair.  The only thing that returned was my mustache.  (a little humor there)  Dee",

I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years now, having had a mastectomy in November 2003. Firstly I had hardly any side effects and slowly but surely they seem to be building up, some days far worse than the next. I have never had nausea though, thank goodness. The main side effects which I am experiencing now are aching bones and joints, mainly while trying to sleep at night. Also tiredness and seem to want to just go to bed to rest from as early as 8 in the evening - this is sad as I always went to bed late before my breast cancer. I also contemplated coming off the drug but decided that as the cancer hasn't come back at all in almost 2 years then perhaps I am doing the right thing in taking it every day. I have been on arimidex for 2 yrs. The last few weeks  been experiencing swelling feet.  Joint pain is minimized by tylenol at bedtime.  Stiffness in knees is a real problem.",

Quit radiation after 9 (of 30) sessions, no chemo.  I've been on Arimidex at a half-dose level for 4 years now.  I have very few side-effects, mostly dry skin and some bone-thinning.  I work with a distant oncology-trained acupuncturist.  I've never met him as we talk on the phone and he order comprehensive lab-work to look deeply at my 'terrain', i.e. my body that allowed the cancer to grow. He presented the option of using a half-dose in order to receive the benefits with fewer drawbacks.  We do lab-work a couple of times a year to verify that my estrogen levels are undetectable.  I asked my oncologist about this option and he said only \"it doesn't work that way!\"  I think that meant that standard cancer treatment is not yet actually customizable for different bodies.  But the acupuncturist made clear to me that the point of aromatase inhibitors is to drive estrogen levels to zero.  So, I feel confident that I am doing that with less medicine onboard.  Of course, the acupuncturist is extremely careful to present options without advice.  We're all doing the best we can with this situation.  Just wanted to note an 'outside the box' option that I've never seen on any of these boards.  My approach is a bit of a hybrid. Outside of 1/2 dose arimidex, I rely on enormous immune boosting 'alternative' therapies for now.  Fingers crossed. I had stage 4 bc with double mastectomy with limph node involvement.  Age 72 I began arimidex after chemo and radiation.  After 1 1/2 years  I have now switch to femara. I think I reallly like the change. Did not realize how much discomfort I felt with arimidex. With stiffness, aching joints swelling feet. I expect to be on some sort of medication for the rest of my life.  But this isn't bad.  So greatful I'm still here. Dee",

The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G Hi Barb After taking arimidex for 2 yrs I too have swolen ankles and feet.  This is a side effect of the drug as are hot flashes.I take tylenol at night for joint pain. delaura",
