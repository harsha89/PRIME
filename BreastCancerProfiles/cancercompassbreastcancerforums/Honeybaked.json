      "Content": "My sister stayed in Houston for 11 months. She was given the option of going back and forth, but she and her husband made the decision to rent an apartment in Houston close to the medical center. My brother-in-law traveled back and forth so he could continue to work. They decided to get her an apartment close to M.D.Anderson so that she could take advantage of all of the services that M.D. Anderson has to offer - ie. Wellness classes, yoga, therapeutic massage, etc. and so that she could be close by if she had any problems to develop as a result of the chemo (she did develop a blood clot in her lung and MRSA infection). I do not know how much was covered by insurance and how much they had to pay out-of-pocket. The chemo did not make her deathly ill. It was a very powerful chemo. It caused her to have a rash which was uncomfortable and itchy. She was more tired than anything else. But we never let her stay by herself. We have a large family and we took turns going to Houston to stay with her during the week and her husband was there as much as he could be. She would have a bad couple of days of bone and joint aches that would start the 3rd day after the chemo was given, but she was not so sick that she didn't get out of the apartment and do things. She walked at least a mile every day! She had her surgery last year on Feb. 4 followed by 6 weeks of radiation. She rang the bell at M.D. Anderson on April 8 and table danced at her daughter's wedding on April 30. She goes back to M.D. Anderson every 3-4 months for all kinds of tests, but the doctors are very hopeful that she is and will remain cancer-free. By the way, she did stop eating dairy and she drank tons of water every day to help wash the chemo out of her system. I hope this is helpful. My prayers are with you. I know it's a scary time. One other thing. She attended church in Houston and went to Beth Moore's Sunday School class which she said was wonderful. Feel free to contact me again if you have any other questions. Sis",

      "Content": "I realize it's been a while since you wrote regarding liver biopsy, but I hope you get this email. My sister had b/c with liver mets. She was treated at M.D.Anderson. She had a liver biopsy immediately after the tumors showed up on her liver. She was told that in order to know how to treat the cancer, the liver had to be biopsied. First of all, I don't know how they can possibly know for sure it is cancer if it is not biopsied. There are other things that can show up like a tumor that are not cancer on the liver. After completing 6 months of powerful chemo, her doctor called in several other oncologists - one of them being Dr. Curley who specializes in liver cancers. He is a brilliant and aggressive surgeon. To make a long story short, they told her she had a choice: to either go home in remission or stay for 5 more rounds of chemo, have a liver resection (they removed 1/3 of her liver), 6 weeks of radiation and go home, possibly cured. (No way of knowing for sure because this approach is relatively new). Of course, the liver regenerates itself so within 3 mos. it was back to normal. She goes to M.D.Anderson 3-4 times per year for scans, but so far everything is good. God bless you as you travel this difficult road. One thing I have learned traveling the road with my sister is that the very best thing you can do for yourself and your treatment is be sure you are going to a doctor who is \"going for the cure\". If you ever feel like your dr. is not doing that - switch doctors. Sis",

      "Content": "Yes!  Yes!! Yes!!  There IS HOPE!!  I could have written your letter 5 years ago (except the patient was my sister - not my mother)!!  May,2004, my sister was 50 years old with Stage 4 mets to the liver.  She also had regular mammograms that showed nothing.  Found out later that is because mammograms can't read through dense breast tissue.  (Why don't they tell us that?!) Went to M.D.Anderson and saw Dr. Estava.  After 6 rounds of chemo, he called in another doctor they call \"the Cowboy\" - Dr. Stephen Curley.  They decided to \"go for the cure\"!!  My sister had 5 more rounds of chemo and then a liver resection and mastectomy followed by 6 weeks of radiation.  She then came back home. On April 14, 2005, she danced on the table at her daughter's wedding.  Saw her other daughter crowned Miss TN in 2007 and will be at that daughter's wedding 10/17.  She has had No Evidence of Disease since her surgery even though she faithfully goes to M.D.Anderson for thorough testing every 3-4 months.  If your mother's doctor is not \"going for the cure\" - get another doctor and, please, get to a major cancer center.  It makes all the difference in the world.  My sister actually got an apartment in Houston and stayed there during her treatments so that she could concentrate on her battle without distractions.  She also used it as an opportunity to deepen her walk with God. God bless you and your mother.  My sweet nieces went through so much with their mother.  My heart goes out to you, but do NOT give up hope and do not allow your mother or, most importantly, your mother's doctor  to give up hope!",
