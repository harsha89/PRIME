      "Content": "The cancer smell is in fact the smell of 'rotting flesh' which is happening with the cancer eating it. I have a friend with breast cancer.  She's had if for years and done nothing with it.  Is very proud of surviving so long without the chemo etc (although I would have had it removed in same situation - but not the chemo) The trouble is now - it is all I can do is stand near her.  If I  have her in - the smell invades the whole house ,  I have just opened front and back doors to try and get rid of it and don't know how I can manage further meetings without her knowing how badly it is affecting me.  It's an awful sweet fruity sickly smell and strong even outside in a strong wind.   It is very sad I don't know how much long she has to go.",

I really dont't understand a smell in it's very early stages because it isn't rotting at all in this stage",
