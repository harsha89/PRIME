      "Content": "Hi Lesley. I'm 65, and my name is Laurie.  First of all, you seem to have your ducks in a row, however, wait until you get the result before you even think of panicking.  I found a lump at Christmastime, and had the needle biopsy, which showed \"mucinous adenocarcinoma\".  I was given the option of lumpectomy, after which I would have to at least have 6 weeks of radiation, or mastectomy, either one or both breasts.  I chose bilateral mastectomy, with reconstruction and implants at the same time.  The doctors didn't push one way or the other.  It was my choice.  My sentinel node biopsies (they check the lymph nodes while doing the other surgery, and they can find out right away whether they're a problem or not) were all negative.  They also sent a portion of my tumor to a reference lab that did what they call \"oncotype\", and that gives a numerical rating as to what your risk my be for recurring cancer.  Mine was low, which was great.  To shorten this a bit, what I'm getting at is the fact that the results may not be as terrible as what we automatically think.  I did not have to have radiation or chemo.  I feel great, and with my low risk of recurrence, I chose not to do the hormone treatment that they recommend when your pathology comes back showing estrogen receptor positive.  I read so many messages regarding women feeling fairly terrible while taking these, so that again was my choice.  Because I feel good right now, I don't want to take something that has fairly often caused women to feel bad.  Like you, dealing with your husband who sounds like his cancer is terminal, I lost my husband last July from Glioblastoma Grade 4, a very aggressive, fast growing brain cancer.  He had surgery, then radiation and chemo, and was with me exactly one year from the day of diagnosis.  This may slant my feelings about treatment, but because his brain cancer kept growing, I can't attribute any pain or illness he had to the treatment.  I just know that life is fleeting, and quality is important to what we have of it.  Don't worry.  You will deal with this the best way for you, but wait until you have all the facts before making decisions.  Love yourself and your husband, to death.  Then choose what route you take.  Please keep us posted as to what is happening.  Take care of you.  Laurie",
