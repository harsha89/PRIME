    "Content": "Hi. I was in exactly the same situation 4 years ago. November 2014 I found a red patch of skin on right Breast. I\u2019m in the UK so had to wait several months for tests. Nothing found in Breast tissue, but I had swelling in lymph nodes by the time I saw a Breast specialist in April 2015. Surgeon described it as \u201cOccult axillary lymphadenopathy, with Cancer of unknown primary\u201d. Plain English - Breast Cancer with no tumour. All Cancer cells were restricted to lymph nodes only. I was really lucky they hadn\u2019t spread beyond the lymph nodes, since i\u2019d probably had it for 5 months by this point. Treatment plan was 6 cycles of Chemo - 3xFEC and 3xTaxotere. All 23 axillary lymph nodes removed - no mastectomy (surgeon felt it unnecessary as no tumour), 15 sessions of Radiotherapy. I\u2019m HER2+ so a year of Herceptin and 10 years of Tamoxifen. Annual check ups with all tests have still not found a primary tumour. Currently in remission and only reminders - apart from the daily pills - is a crescent shaped scar under my arm and a head of hair that steadfastly refuses to grow back to a consistency beyond fine candy floss. I\u2019ve had people question if I ever had Breast Cancer and at times I think it was all some mad dream as I have very few long term side effects and nothing that shows physically. I\u2019ve been told by more than one Oncologist that this type of Cancer is exceptionally rare and have medical students regularly come in to consultations. The key seems to be that if it\u2019s confined to lymph nodes, as one Onc said \u201cit\u2019s a very treatable form of the disease\u201d. Can\u2019t advise on the cost i\u2019m afraid as in the UK so National Health Service picks up the bill. Good luck with your treatment. L",
