    "Content": "My mother-in-law has been diagnosed with breat cancer and secondary liver cancer as well as lung cancer. She is 76 years old. We do not see her very often because we live about 500 miles away. Over the last few months she has lost about 35 lbs. and has complained that she vomits each time she attempts to eat. One week ago, she went to the emergency room and was admitted. The first diagnosis was liver and lung cancer with a 3 month life expectancy. They told her there were no treatment options. They then discovered that she has breast cancer and believe that the cancer started in her breast. She has all the symptoms: weight loss, nausea, vomiting, bloated stomach (Tapped and removed 5 litres, 1 1/2 days later her stomach was tapped again and 4 litres was removed),and jaundice was evident today. She claims that she has little pain. She is eating next to nothing, for dinner she had the tip of a fork full of mashed potattoes, 2 spoons of soup and some tea. She put a single pea in her mouth and spit it out because she could not swallow it. Can someone tell me what to expect after this?",
