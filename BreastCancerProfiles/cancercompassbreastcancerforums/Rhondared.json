    "Content": "Tiffer, some cancers have a putrid smell. Some would also say that chemo smells too as it is exiting the body. Dont know if your husband is having chemo. I would walk in at dads and gag at smell but stepmother did not smell anything. Febreeze could not touch it. Clorox did help with sheets and bedding. Making sure to have mattress covers that are waterproof helps also. Throw out any cushions etc. that dont have water resistant covers. Make sure pillows are hospital pillows - they dont absorb smells and liquids. If your couch, love seats, chairs are not vinyl or leather throw them away. Daily hygeine is a must that is overlooked by some patients. Put activated charcoal under key areas. Scented candles help mask the smell slightly. You can always put Vicks Vaporub below your nose. Trust me it works at crime scenes with dead bodies, it will work for you. Finally, I focused on the fact that the problem was me. Your loved one cant help this and needs your support. It is tough to be reminded it is not all about you.",
