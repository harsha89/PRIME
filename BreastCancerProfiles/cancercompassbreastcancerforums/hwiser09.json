    "Content": "Hi Deezin, I am with you in your prayer for immediate healing of your breast cancer. I did some research and found out  that there are actually 4 type of Mastectomy. Total mastectomy - removal of breast tissue and nipple Modified radical mastectomy - removal of the breast, most of the lymph nodes under the arm and often the lining over the chest muscles Lumpectomy - surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it Radical mastectomy - the removal of the breast, lymph nodes and chest muscles but this is no longer common the type of  surgery  depends on the stage of cancer, size of the tumor, size of the breast and whether the lymph nodes are involved.    ",
