      "Content": "i had a mastectomy over ten years ago. about 2 years ago, I had a severe problem with lymphodema. i was treated with a mastectomy sleeve and physical therapy and this worked ok, but took a long time to actually go away. here i am a year later, and i do not have very much swelling in my right arm, but i have a lot of pain in my arm. i am taking lyrica. i just recently applied for medicaid ( I am only 61 so don't qualify for medicare) and I was denied. I have no medical insurance, and will go to the emergency room if needed. I would like to know if there are any other people out there that suffer from arm pain many years after a mastectomy and if so, how do you cope with it. I am on Lyrica but it is not relieving the pain for very long. Thanks.",
