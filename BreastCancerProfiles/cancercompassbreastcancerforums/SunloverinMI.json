    "Content": "I am in my third bout with triple negative that has metastasized.  It is hard for family and friends to understand what we are going through, but we know they are going through things too.  Share with them your love and concern for their health.  Seek someone who you can talk to about your fears, worries, concerns, etc, don't keep it in.  It will drive you crazy!  Some family/friends have cried more than I have about it.. everyone deals differently.  Be there for them as much as you can but it's ok to shed some tears about what is going to happen. ",
