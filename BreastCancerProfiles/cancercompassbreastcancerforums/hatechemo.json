      "Content": "Leukemia...Hagop Kantarjain is the chief and is very dedicated and caring. Lymphoma: Dr. Haggemeister is the same. They really care and treat the patient for a cure not for the money. Becareful of clinic Nurse Practictioners and Physician Assistance.  They can be dangerous and like to \"act' like doctors. Not all but there are many there that act thay way. Should anyone decide research medication dont sign right away...know what they know @side effects and make informed decison. Experienced 1 lymphoma doc and NP refuse to treat patient and threatened to throw them out of facitility if they did not sign up for research. This is why I left. It is illegal and dont be threatened by these bullies. Needless to say he and his NP are still there :(  ",

      "Content": "I was a rn at MDACC for a few years and the best breast cancer doctor there is now gone. Try Jenny Chang, MD at methodist houston. She was a MD a MDACC but is now private. She is the best in breast cancer treatment in houston. This is not to knock MDACC but personally I have been in the med center as a healthcare professional for many years and WOULD NOT allow my family to be treated there unless there was no other resort. They love research and get lots of money for each patient that signs up with little guarentee for cure.  I did this for years...guilty guilty guilty feelings for doing this to patient. Now I have cancer and dont want to be treated that way...",
