    "Content": "Dear Jan: I just read your message from over a year ago. Wondering how you are doing. I am a Stage IIIC ovarian cancer survivor diagnosed in December 2003. Just had a CA125 of 53.5, and will have a MRI tomorrow. I am scared and wonder if you ever had an elevated CA125, or recurrence. It is very helpful for me to converse with survivors. Thanks, and God bless you. Betsy",
