      "Content": "I had radiation on my left breast and it was hard as a rock. I have had a few surgeries on my right side to try and make them as even as possible with very little luck. I have finally found a great doctor who is up on all the new reconstructive stuff. I just had surgery again on the right side where he sewed a mesh bra inside and put an implant in the mesh bra so that the implant doesn't put weight on the skin and make it sag. On the side I had radiation on it was hard as a rock and a little deformed with indentations from radiation. He did fat grafting for that side. He took a needle and put it in the breast and moved it back and forth vigorously to break up the hardened scar tissue. Then he grafted fat from me and injected it into my breast to fill in the indentations and round out the breast. When he put the needle in to break up the scar tissue, when he was done it was amazing. My breast wasn't lumpy anymore, this was even before he did the fat injections. You should research in your area a plastic surgeon that is up on the new stuff. There are things you can do to feel better about how you look and feel after going through breast cancer.",
