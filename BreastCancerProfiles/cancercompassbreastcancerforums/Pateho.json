    "Content": "Brilliant response along with additive information!  Glad you're on board here. I have been expressing that it is all about the immune system for years.  We wonder why we have so much cancer now?  Our immune systems are suppressed!  We've had the great physicians and Nobel prizes winners telling the health community for years it's all about our immune, but has the public heard about it? No. because the BIG PHARMA doesn't make any money when we are healthy.  I have lost 7 family members to cancer and I'm sure there will be more diagnosed in the coming years.  One of my best friends was diagnosed with Breast Cancer over a year ago now.  Her doctor without any dialog on other treatments  signed her up for a mastectomy and removed all her lymph nodes. I had be informed and heard about cesium/potassium therapy.  Quench Essentials carries all the elements necessary for our survival.  I purchased the cesium and potassium for my friend with the advice on the right amount of dosage.  She took this everyday and within TWO WEEKS her tumors were found to be DRASTICALLY reduced.  So much so, that her doctor had to send her for more xrays so that they could see for themselves. There are many, many cures out there, but the bottom line is prevention. Get and Keep the Immune System in OPTIMUM condition.  Thanks for the floor!",
