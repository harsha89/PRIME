    "Content": "Hi there, Please could you help out on the breast cancer awareness campaign that I am involved with? it's for the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer   It's doesn't cost anything, takes 30 seconds and will raise awareness about the signs of breast cancer. Just register, then forward it on to other women.   http://www.breakthrough.org.uk/tlc/ Basically, we want to spread the message far and wide, but the message is much more poignant when coming from us (ie: people who's lives have been affected by cancer) Thanks Liz",
