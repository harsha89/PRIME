      "Content": "Dear Dick, I pray it is not too late to matter... but were I in your dear wife's situation, I'd be more concerned that the chemo not interfere with the benefits of the Cesium Chloride therapeutic! It is a component of all stages, but in stage IV therapy, not the whole game! There is a 7-9 step protocol which should be followed by all who need a few less cells(!!)somewhere in their bodies; raising the cellular pH is esential....& so is the expedient of not suffering the body to deal with the toxic flood of several million/billion/trillion cancer cells expiring in rapid succession: could be worse than the original state! The surgeon is at their best when they can do this both timely, and in the least traumatizing way....takes a rare concern = talent!! Interim, one should do all else one can to STRENGTHEN, REPAIR, BOLSTER all the tissues, the various immunity factors; keep fluids coursing throughout; get a little sun; add a few probiotics; a full-range amino-acid booster(even predigested, or with probiotics!)... If you are hooked up with CTCA, they'll do these & more(or encourage you to!!); for we believe the truths of what the Bible says about physiology, not what those with something else to sell have to \"opine\"!! Call if there's anything else to be said/done! In your corner, (or someone else's who now is in need!)Michael M.",

      "Content": "To all: Since the early 1950's, cancer researchers have KNOWN that cancer cells cannot live in an alkaline environment!(Nor in an oxygen-rich environment!!) As for Coral Calciums, there are always bogus products in circulation:a 64-yr-old friend had taken 6K/day for 6 years, as his femoral \"heads\" dissolved! However, in only 2 weeks of IPRIFLAVONE therapy, the surfeit of calcium-complex in various parts of his body coalesced via the ipriflavone, and he said, as he RAN to greet me @ church, \"That stuff works! I can FEEL my bones growing!\" Now, I would not use other forms of vinegar internally, and cider for only the removal of kidney calcifictions: 1 tsp in a 1/2-glass of water, 3x/day, & for no more than 2 weeks at the most! Mineralization is good, but use amino-acid chelates! Cesium Chloride is faster/stronger, & will raise the pH to 7.4 & better! The greatest error I see is those in stage IV trying a stage III therapeutic(or the like). We must always do all we can to reverse the conditions, so the cells-gone-crazy either recover, or die!Sincerely,MLM.ND",

      "Content": "My heart goes out to you. Why, when someone is suffering, are their simplest procedures fraught with symptoms of staff incompetence! I could point to several lymph-system stimulants, and to many well-documented successes in abatement of cells-gone-crazy. For now, I will point out that every cancer researcher has known (& for the longer-lived, for all this time, since the early 1950's!!!) that cancer cells cannot live in an alkaline environment; nor in an oxygen-rich environment! These are NOT ignored by the teams at Cancer Treatment Centers, but are components of the all-things-considered approaches, which should be the norm, and are at CTC (as best we can, always striving to improve; aiming for the ever-elusive \"perfection\", we grow ever closer, because we, and our patients, are seeking it!) For yet another list of what one may do for themselves as well, see: cancertutor.com. Sincerely, your advocate, MLM, ND",

      "Content": "My dear \"Hardjourney\": I know it is routine to feel defeated in such situations; but there is a responsibility to not give up: I have seen recoveries & reversals in many cases where the cancer victim(s) were given no hope! Every cancer researcher has known(since the early 1950's!)that cancer cells cannot live in an alkaline environment, nor in an oxygen-rich environment! When the bones are involved, it is imperative that not only mineralization be exponentially pursued, but chemical means of alkalination, as well as oxygen therapy(under pressure of only 2 ATM, the O2 available to the cells is 20X the \"norm\" at 1 ATM!)become critically important. The most common error made in remedial efforts is that of a partial, or weak approach: ie: use of a stage 2 or 3 therapy for a stage IV condition! When we have \"cells-gone-crazy\", all things feasible must be done to reverse the process. Since the bone marrow is compromised, it is also needful to provide a full-spectrum, pre-digested solution of amino-acids, for repair, as well as support of other sources of immune factors and blood components. Such input should be accompanied by probiotics, whole-food-source, enzymatically active vitamins & chelated minerals. A homeopathic lymph-system stimulant is needed to assist the flows thereof, as they are moved by our motion, and such is always less in cancer patients, adding to the burden of the increased toxins the lymph is already wrestling with. More pure water, taking care to not dilute the nutrients therewith ...If/when there is virtue in the removal of cancer cells, that the body's toxic burden is lessened thereby, and the surgery is not more harmful in other ways than this benefit justifies then the oncologist is a friend, indeed! Also, 10-15 min/day of sunshine, which converts \"serum cholesterol\" to Vitamion D, is important for Calcium uptake. If the cellular pH remains below 7(preferably 7.4 when in cancer therapy), Cesium Chloride may be used for immediate elevation! Yes, there are many things that may be done. In closing, may I suggest that, as our Creator is always a gentleman, never coercive, so did not make the choices which precipitated the conditions of your dear parents; (albeit that some of these choices may have been made by other than themselves, also!)but He has made the above options also available! It is quoted that \"He makes it to rain on the just & the unjust\"....what we make of this \"rain \" is up to us! A final note: for even those who do all the right things, but fail to carry forth a good attitude, failure will yet be their result! May the Spirit of the Lord sustain you in your struggle to balance the loads you are struggling with. If what I have sacrificed sleep(my pleasure BTW)to offer is of help, it will, at the very least, give the assurance that all HAS been done, and will lessen the suffering in every category!
