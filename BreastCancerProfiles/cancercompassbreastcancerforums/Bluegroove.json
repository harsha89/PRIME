      "Content": "I am a 25 year old female who was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer (Ductal Carcinoma) in September. I have undergone a left breast modified radical mastestomy and I'm now undergoing four cycles of AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxin) chemo treatments (I am about to begin the 2nd of 4 in a couple of days). I am also scheduled to begin Tamoxifen for 5 years in the spring, following chemo. Being a 25 year old and recieving a diagnosis of breast cancer was extremely hard, as you can imagine. A diagnosis at such an age brings with it a whole new set of worries and challenges, and it can feel extremely lonely sometimes, as if you're the only one at this age going through this. I began a blog documenting everything that has happened to me right back to the days leading up to my diagnosis. I continue to write in the blog daily, covering every turn and pothole on my journey with breast cancer. I thought doing this would not only keep people who know me informed about my situation and help me sort out my thoughts, but would also give young people going through a similar situation someone to relate to. I think it is very important to have that. So, feel free to read through my blogs and join me in my journey, it may not only help you but may help me to have your support. Also, if you have  blog/ diary or a website you think would be helpful to others battling cancer, feel free to post a link to this message or leave me an email on my website so that I can make it available through my website. You can also email or post a message if you would like to learn how to start a blog.  Let's support eachother! Visit: http://the-pink-diaries.blogspot.com     Thanks :-)",

      "Content": "Hi there, I am a 25 year old who is also undergoing AC chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer (beginning my second round of 4). I have always been an extemely strong, positive, and brave person--even during my entire experience with cancer thus far. Lately (the past couple of weeks) I have been experiencing some anxiety, which includes racing heart, shortness of breath, and feelings of helplessness/ anxiouness. Even more recently (the past few days) I have been plagued with an overwhelming sense of sadness (crying out of nowhere, irritability, lack of motivation, negative attitude). This is VERY out of the ordinary for me. I have never had anxiety or depression in my life, and I have to stress that I have been able to cope with my dignosis, surgery, and all the tests and appointments very well thus far. Also, I haven't even been finding the chemotherapy to be overly difficult so far (very little nausea, no fatigue, no sore mouth, one allergic reaction to Stemetil). I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't feel that my recent feelings of anxiety and depression are rooted from the cancer itself, unless somehow they have become built up inside me over the past few months. The problem is that nothing in particular gets me down, its just a general feeling of sadness or anxiety. Because of this, I wonder too whether the chemotherapy itself is having some sort of chemical effect on me. Does anyone know for sure whether or not chemotherapy (in particular Adriamycin and Cytoxin) can directly cause anxiety or depression through some physical/ chemical effect? Until then, I hope you are well! Soon all of this will be behind us :) M",
