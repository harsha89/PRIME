    "Content": "I was diagnosed with Triple Negative Metaplastic Carcinoma on 2/9/09.  2 months after I stopped breast feeding.  4.5 cm tumor on my right breast.  PET/CT finds that the cancer has spread to Lymph Notes. My medical oncology doctors are very concerned about the possibility of the cancer already spread to the entire body even though the PET/CT scan does not show.  So they are recommending Chemo (Neoadjuvent) first followed by Mastectomy. Has anyone tried neoadjuvent treatment before the surgery?  Any success stories?  I can't seem to find any testomonials. Thanks, Newmom2008",
