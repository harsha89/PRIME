    "Content": "Oh my goodness, this is like reading my own story.  I only took the arimidex for 2 months.  During that time i became so confused that i would just stare at my computer in a daze, wondering what I am supposed to be doing.  The last day I took the medication I could not get out of the bed.  My wrists hurt so bad that it radiated up my arm.  It would go so numb that I could not wake it up.  4 days days ago I had carpal tunnel surgery.  Now I am thinking that this medicine caused this.  Also, I am still confused a lot and can't remember enough to complete sentences sometime. ",
