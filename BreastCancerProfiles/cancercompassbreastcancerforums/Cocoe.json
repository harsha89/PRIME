    "Content": "Hi Patti - My mother was recently put on Xeloda.  She has cancer of Unknown Primary.  She has only been on it for 3 weeks.  Her cycle is 2 weeks on and 1 week off.  She is currently completing her 4th week.  Besides being tired,  she is doing OK.  She has not gotten any redness or rashes on her hands or feet so far and no mouth sores either. Her last blood work also concluded that the cancer levels have gone down which is good news.  We hope & prayer this will continue.  I can only give you our brief experience so far with this chemo drug.  I would encourage you to ask your oncologist any questions you may have regarding this chemo treatment.  I'm sure he/she should be able to answer all of your questions.  Good luck with your new treatment.   Cocoe ",
