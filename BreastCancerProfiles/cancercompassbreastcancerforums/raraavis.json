      "Content": "Dear PG, I was diagnosed with ER+ PR+ HER2- breast cancer in 2012. After a lumpectomy, the cancer marker didn't go down. A subsequent CT scan followed by a biopsy showed metastasis to the peritoneum. So far, I have no organ involvement. I was on hormone therapy - letrozole and Faslodex (fulvestrant) - for 2 years. In August of 2014 the marker started trending up and a scan confirmed disease progression, though still no organ involvement. I tried tamoxifen for a couple of months, but it was not effective. In November of 2014, I started Xeloda (capecitabine), which is a chemotherapy drug taken orally. A 14-day ON, 7-day OFF regimen was quite effective, but proved too toxic for me. It's always lovely when the treatment is so much worse than the disease! A 7-day ON, 7-day OFF regimen worked somewhat for a while, but the side effects still got me (mostly hand-foot syndrome and fatigue - didn't have the nausea or vomiting or mouth sores, thank goodness!) Next up is a newly-approved non-chemo drug called palbociclib (IBRANCE), which is a CDK inhibitor. Don't know the technical term for what this class of drugs is - it disprupts some part of a cell's ability to function rather than killing the cells outright. It has been used in drug trials with letrozole and with faslodex. Since I hate needles (as you know, faslodex is administered as two shots monthly. ugh), we're going to try the letrozole/palbociclib combo first. So here's what I've taken away from my 3-year medical journey: 1.The most time you can expect out of any drug is about 2 years, and there's no guarantee that you'll get that much. I did well on letrozole/faslodex, but Xeloda's effectiveness at a dose I could tolerate didn't last as long. 2. To some extent, we're all human drug trials. The poor docs keep watch on the science and try to find the best treatment for their patients. However, we all react differently so it's often a kind of crap shoot. 3. I keep being told that there are lots of drugs under investigation and that new ones are getting approved all the time. I'm hoping that as one drug stops working, there will be another waiting in the wings. I recently met a wonderful, vigorous, 90-year old woman who's been living with breast cancer for the past 27 years. Her story is somewhat different from ours - don't think she has peritoneal involvement - but it's encouraging to see that even with Stage IV, one can survive and have a decent quality of life. This lady is participating in an Eli Lilly drug trial and is off on a several-week trip to Europe in the end of July. She's truly amazing and I hope you and I do even half as well!!! Have you had any answers from any of the previous posters? I find the lack of response sad and alarming, but I'm going to convince myself that they've all moved on in positive ways and no longer need this message board. Take good care!",
