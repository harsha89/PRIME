    "Content": "My mom is on her 6th treatment for Primary Peritneal Carcinoma. This cancer is supposed to be just like ovarian. It behaves the same and is treated the same, however her ca-125 was originally 2938 and after surgery and 5 treatments it was down to 91. But now it is up to 111. Her doctor told us that this means its coming back or the test may not have been done correctly, I am scared and dont no what this means. I wish someone could answer this question correctly.",
