    "Content": "I'm searching for answers. I'm 48 and I haven't been diagnosed with cancer for years ago I had precancer cells and ended up with a partial hysterectomy. For the last 3-6 months I've had pain and pressure in my vagina and now a smell that smells like someone with cancer. No stds . I'm scared about the odor and the pain. My doctor is starting slow urine test. Can anyone help?",
