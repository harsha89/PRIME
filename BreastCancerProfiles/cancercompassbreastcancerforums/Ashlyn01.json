My mother just had a very large mass removed 46grams.The tumor was almost 6cm. The Pathology report said she is grade 3 of 3. Her ins. has 50% coverage out of network. You have to have at least 70% to qualify for care at Cancer treatment centers of america. What other option are out there? Thank You! Carrie",
