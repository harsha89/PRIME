      "Content": "Hi I am new to this site and I joined it because I have a message to get out. The man I love died on December 2nd of lung cancer. He was diagnosed in July with stage IV. It was in both lungs a lot of nodules. He recieved Taxol and Carboplatin for 6 treatments. He had a very positive attitude and gained 30 pounds (not water) he was steadily improving and had everyone but the doctors convinced that he was going to beat the cancer. Then one day he was told that he would not beat it and be on Chemo off and on for the rest of his life. That sent him into a tailspin he never came out of. His major problem was not the cancer. It shrunk 50% the first 6 treatments. His problem was anxiety and we could get no one to address it. Please you sound like you have this problem too and it should be expected and treated. His was ignored until it got so bad that they had to try too many medicines and he became addicted to Vicadan because it was the only thing he had to calm him. In the end he died and I am convenced his cancer was not as bad as originally diagnosed that it was overmedication that killed him. Get help now!! Get in touch with CTCA if you haven't already. I did for him but I was too late. Read the patients rights I posted here and don't ever let anyone take them away from you. I am heartbroken and angry and don't want to see this happen to anyone else.",
