      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I hope all of you are doing ok.  God bless all of you. Never really considered facing the possibility of bc at 30 years with 2 young children. I know some ladies have had it so much younger. My journey began with pain shooting in my right breast late last year. I was sent for my first mamo, which I went ahead and paid extra for a digital one due to having dense breasts. I had a feeling I would be called back from the waiting room for more shots and then again for ultrasound. The tech and then the radiologist tried hard but could not see the small node they saw on the mamo. (In the other breast!) MRI was recommended and that was done in January. They recommended at the time a 6 month follow up MRI in June. That was done and this time BIRADS was 4 and there were kinetic changes, but size had not changed. Being that it was so hard to see, a MRI led biopsy was recommended and that is what was done today. I have just begun to have stinging pain in the breast; started about 3 days ago at work in a meeting. Unfortunately, there is a holiday and a weekend in between me and the results  I will try to stay as calm as possible. At first I was concerned when the Radiologist kept coming back for more samples. Makes me think it was concerned and wanted to get as much tissue for testing as possible. He took like 9 samples. But I am grateful now though because I had really just wanted it removed and not just biopsied being that it is only a centimeter. The thought of worrying about what was left of it possibly changing year after year was getting to me. I believe he was really trying to just get it all out and looking at the mamo they took right after to verify clip placement, that is what It looks like He did. There is no node to even be seen anymore just black holes or air space on the mamo. Pain was minimal and staff were awesome they tried to make me as comfortable as possible and were even massaging my back. Wish all health care personnel were so kind. Being a Nurse myself and always wanting to comfort others, it meant a lot. Well...we will see what comes out of this....hugs to all....Muneera",
