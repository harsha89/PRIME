      "Content": "I am sorry you are having such pain. I know had bad post shingles pain can be... Have you asked your doctor about the Lidoderm Patches? They are a prescription patch that really works; no side effects. The medicine travels along the nerves infected with Shingles and shut's them off, without getting into the rest of your body. That's why no side effects. It was the only thing that worked for my Aunt who had shingles for 3 yrs until she tried this. Good luck and you will be in my prayers. Hope",

      "Content": "Hi, I don't know if anyone can offer up advise here. I had an abdom CT scan, which picked up 2 2mm hard nodes \"possibly breast\". It was a fluke & found by accident (or miracle), as this was was for finding an ulcer. Tomorrow, I am having a L breast Ultrasound to look at it. I had a mammogram 8 wks ago- it was normal. I went back to GYN for breast exam, she said she could not feel anything, so it must be deep & very small. Now, my sister found a 2mm golf-ball like lump 6 yrs ago. Sha also had clear mamo's all along. They biopsied- sure enough- stage 4 w mets to lymph nodes. She did chemo for 1 yr & has been CA free for 5 yrs now. The doc's said that that small node had probably been growing for 10 yrs. She never felt it, it never showed up on mamo's. So, I'm a bit spooked...& I have even been given the name of a surgeon to call..Can anyone tell me about what to expect? What to ask at the ultrasound> Will they know right away?  Thank you all in advance. And I will leave an update tomorrow after the test. But any advice would be great before hand.  Thank you- Hope.  (PS I just buried my best friend 1 month & 10 days ago to lung CA). Hope",

      "Content": "Hi, My sister (6 yrs out, survivor, had aggressive type)- said she \"felt\" a \"thumping\"-\"vibrating\"-type sensation. In exact area. She found it-all mamo's were neg for 10 yrs. And was told it was growing for about 10 yrs; (was only 1mm & went to lymph nodes when she found small lump). This sensation was right there & there only. I know all info says no symptoms, but I know she speaks the truth. She tells me: GET TO KNOW YOUR BREASTS LIKE A BEST FRIEND! She ck's ALL the time (& just found a lump; neg; had that sensation which made her ck carefully; but something called \"fatty tissue necrosis\")- anyone share info on that?",

      "Content": "My prayers are with you.  My sister had BC- she seems to be fine now (going on 6 yrs). One medication that really helped her was the Lidoderm Patch. It is a prescription but it is for nerve pain- like the kind of pain from shingles. For some reason it works for nerve pain from mastectomies. You should have your Mom try it. It is very safe, works right at the site; does not get into your system.  She said it was the ONLY thing that helped! It is just a patch but you leave it on for 12 or more hours; it has lidocaine in it. Ask your doctor for samples to try it- it took about a week for it to work for my sister. But once it kicked in, it really worked. I hope it works as well for your mom. You can look it up on the interner also. My prayers are with you.  ",

      "Content": "You should try the Lidoderm Patches. They are prescription, but should be covered. They were invented for shingles pain and work for this- (as long as the wounds/open sore is \"closed\"). The patches work by being topical- no side effects, work right on the \"nerve pain\". They are great. You may need to use them for a week or 2 but my sister said they worked 1st day for her. Just make sure they are over intact skin. Then they are safe. A God Send. You can leave lem on for 12 hrs. Hope",

      "Content": "Hi There Friend,  I just read your message- I was perusing the boards as I have a dear friend in the final stages (small cell lung); & I have found much comfort and information here. Your message touched me so much- IT'S TRUE!!!!!! Stress does cause many body changes. And reading your message struck a nerve with me, because as my friend has had to go thru this journey (she is 52 yrs old), my own irritable bowel syndrome is back in full force. In fact, my colonosopy Dr told me to take it easy as I am developing diverticulitis. And I know it's stress over caring for my friend, balancing work, family, and all of that usual stuff., I liked very much how you described how you handle your stress. I am going to try it and I am going to pay much closer attention to my own reactions so that I can deal with it better. And I just wanted to say \"thank you\" for sharing. I think many can benefit by reading this. Hope",

It is pretty rare, but if you have it, USE IT!!!!!  I'll bet you can pick up subtle changes, even in doses of any drugs or chemo & how they relate to the tumor. How lucky your partner is! Learn the scent, make it intimate. It will give you a great shot at beating this.  Also, for the sake of others, keep a journal to share. This type of thing is really the future of CA treatment! Good luck and you both are in my prayers. Hope",
