What was the outcome of the lump on the back of your neck.  I was diagnosed with Lobular Carcinoma last year and now a year later I have a lump on the back right of my neck.  Yesterday I went to do my yearly and my doctor found something on my breast so I am having a mammo today.  I was just wondering if the two symptons were related. Thanks and look forward to hearing from you. Jennifer  ",
