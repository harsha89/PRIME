    "Content": "I am always undergoing a lumpectomy with sentinal node biopsy on December 13. I am very nervous but feel pretty confident. I have a 1.5 cm tumor and the MRI came out clear. I am also hormone receptive and HER2 negative. My surgeon thinks that it hasn't spread to the lymph nodes. I really am confident in her but still VERY nervous about the surgery and anesthesia. I have never had surgery before!Â  I guess I'll be thinking about everyone else having this surgery on Thursday. Joan",
