      "Content": "I am on herceptin and tamoxifen only and I too have very bad joint pain in the same way I keep hearing so many others say they do.  I have had 4 infusions of the herceptin so far and each time the pain seems to get worse.  I never had any chemo because I chose not to.  I called my care manager and she spoke with my onco who wants me to stop the tamoxifen for 3 weeks to see if the pain gets better.  From what I understand, tamoxifen is a bone builder so I don't know why they think it is that one that is causing the pain.  It sounds to me, after reading so many different herceptin patients say on so many different forrums that they experience this same joint pain, that maybe, just maybe the doctors are in denial that it does cause extreme joint pain.  Some people seem to experience worse pain then others but it does indeed exist.  Why don't they just admit this? I read on a forrum that was dated Oct. 2006 that the preservative used to increase the shelf life of herceptin can be the cause of this pain so if you ask the onco to mix it with a saline water instead of the preservative that is normally used, it will eliminate the problem.  The person on the thread said that she tried that and it indeed helped her and the joint pain got better as time went on.  I will be asking my onco about this for sure.  I will post whatever I find out.  I figure it's worth a try.  I don't think I can continue to let this pain continue to get worse for 13 more treatments. ",

      "Content": "Does anyone else out there get depressed and find yourself crying at the drop of a hat?  I had a skin and nipple sparing mastectomy on my right side 12 weeks ago after being diagnosed with DCIS.  I was told that it was pre cancer and I would not need any chemo or radiation.  I would only need tamoxifen for 5 years. I was suppose to start fat transfer reconstruction this week actually but things quickly changed after surgery.  I am PR ER positive.  After suregery I was told that it was invasive and I was Her-2 positive, which I was told was neg. per biopsy before surgery.  So the standard of care was for me to do chemo, 6 rounds, herceptin for 1 year and tamoxifen for 5 years.  I just had my 3rd herceptin infusion today and have been taking tamoxifen for 3 weeks tomorrow.  I opted not to do the chemo at all.  1 out of 4 lymph nodes had micrometastasis tumors.  I am having a pretty hard time with the loss of my breast.  Even though I have never been very large, I am still struggling with the loss. Although I am greatful to be alive I get very depressed that I do not look sexually appealing anymore.  My husband is great and assures me that he still loves me and it doesn't matter.  Everyone tells me that I am still the same me but I don't like what I see when I look in a mirror and I don't feel appealing.  I just wish someone would validate my feelings of looking deformed and unappealing instead of just always saying it looks fine and its ok.  IT\"S NOT OK!  It looks horrible.  Does anyone else feel this way or am I just being ungreatful?   Thank God I will have reconstruction by fat graphing at Cancer treatment center of America but because of the heceptin I have to wait until I finish those treatments.  UGH! Thats another year at least.  Please, someone tell me that I'm not the only one that feels this way.  Thank you",

Then people tell me that I will feel this depression for the whole 5 years of tamoxifen, but I'll get used to it.  I don't want to get used to it, I just want to be normal again.  Thanks for letting me vent.  I do have a survivor sister  but don't want to let my mood bring her down. ",

But I did.  Please get another opinion.  You will need that peace of mind.  I pray it all works out for you.  May God bless!",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else out there has had fat grafting liposuction reconstruction surgery to rebuild their breast.  I understand that it is a relatively new procedure and I am not able to find much information about it.  I had a skin and nipple sparing maestecomy on July 3rd at CTCA and the fat grafting was started at the time of my surgery.  I was suppose to go back for 2-3 more surgeries 3 months apart to add more fat each time but after I received my pathology report I went from \"pre-cancer\", (I HATE that term!) to invasive ductal carcinoma stage 2, HER-2 positive and PR ER Positive.  Because of the HER-2+ I will have herceptin infusions every 3 weeks for 1 year.  I now have to wait until those treatments are completed before they will continue with my reconstruction.  My question is...is it normal that I still feel an uncomfortable bruised like feeling still after 14 weeks post surgery?  I have a friend that had a mastectomy only 6 weeks ago and she feels no pain anymore at all.  She did not undergo the fat transfer procedure so I wonder if that has anything to do with it.  Is there anyone out there that has been through this procedure that can share your experience with me?  Thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for responding to my message.  No I guess we did not have the same procedure after all.  I didnt think I could handle the pain involved with the trans flap.  I was advised that because I'm very active and take care of small children in my child care business, I was not a good canidate for that surgery as it leaves the stomach muscles too weak.  The kind I am having made my tummy sore but I'm sure not like yours.  I just had several small spots where fat was liposuctioned out and then they do something to the fat and inject it into the breast but they can only add a small amount each time so that the blood vessels can attach and become healthy.  That's why it takes 3-4 surgeries to complete.  It is a much less invasive procedure and it is all your own tissue so there is no chance of rejection, they don't mess with the chest muscle like with the tissue expander so there's a lot less pain and you even get some feeling back, which I already feel.  Not in the nipple of course, but where the fat has been added.  I live in Wichita Kansas and they do not offer anything like this here.  I have been going to Cancer Treatment Center of America in Zion Illinois and they have been fantastic to my family and I.  Highly recomend them.  They have so many more options and offer the most up to date treatment available.   I just can't seem to find anyone else that is having or had this same fat grafting surgery.  I'll keep searching and in the mean time I will pray that God will give you an answer and a peace about taking the hormone therapy.  I was on tamoxifen for 2 months and my onco had me stop because of extreme joint pain to see if it gets better.  There are definately a lot of bad side effects indeed.  I do believe God has given me a peace about not doing chemo for my treatment.  They wanted me to do chemo, herceptin and tamoxifen so I prayed about it and agreed to do the herceptin and tamoxifen.  God has my back for the rest.  I'm so sorry to hear about your sister in law.  Thank God you had an opportunity to reconnect.  Life is too short to hold any grudges that's for sure.  Glad to hear that you are feeling great and are able to go back to work,  Sounds like you have found your new normal.  Hugs to you and God bless. ",

      "Content": "Hi Trishabul, my name is Nanci and I have been trying to find someone else that has had the fat grafting reconstruction done when I ran across your response to scared, depressed & overwhelmed.  First of all I have to say that I too have had my days where I am so depressed and I cry a lot! But we have to count our blessings and know that God will not put us through anymore than we can handle, although sometimes I believe he thinks I am much stronger then I think I am.  That's when I have to count my blessings and remember to praise Him because he is in control.  Even though I don't always feel like praising Him or counting those blessings, it does always snap me out of the depression.  Even for just a little while.  I am praying for you scared, depressed & overwhelmed! Anyway, I am so interested in the fact that you sound like you had a fat transfer procedure.  Was it done at Cancer Treatment Center of America?  I had a right breast mastectomy on July 3rd and started the fat transfer at that time.  It was done with a liposuction from my tummy and injected into my breast.  Is this the same procedure you are going through?  It will take me 2-3 more surgeries to complete the whole breast but I am on hold because after surgery we found out that I am HER-2+ so I am doing a years worth of herceptin and my surgeon will not continue with the fat grafting until I complete the herceptin.  I am, however very concerned with your comment about the leech.  What happened to cause the bad blood flow and what did the leech do for it?  Hope you don't mind me bombarding you with questions but you are the first person I've run across that sounds like you are having the same procedure as me.  I have soooo many questions that I never thought to ask before I had the first surgery.  Been trying to find someone else that has had or is having this same reconstruction.  Thank you for any insight you can share. ",
