    "Content": "Hi to All, I too, have signed the petition (about 2 weeks ago), just before I had a bilateral mastectomy.  I feel we should have more options afforded to us and not to be dictated to by multi-billion dollar insurance companies sponsoring lobbyiests who cater to a male-dominated legislature.  Interestingly enough, my surgeon spoke about \"drive thru mastectomies\" (rolling his eyes) and in essence saying congress needs to stay out of it...yes, this from a well respected (head of dept.) surgeon in an equally nationally well respected hospital.  I chose to leave 12 hrs. after a 6 hr. surgery, emphasis being my choice, but I firmly believe we should all be able to stay for 48 hrs. if that is what we need.  A like bill was defeated, I believe, in 2005, so hopefully this time it will pass!
