    "Content": "I just started the same regimen- daily arimidex and monthly infusion of Zomeda. I had quite a bit of bone and muscle pain after the first treatment but things have been improving- I get a weekly acupuncture treatment to help with side effects. During my first bout with cancer 8 yeasr ago, I did acupuncture to offset A/C effects and never had a day of nausea- it also helped wityh fatigue. just be sure to go to a good acupuncturist who has worked with cancer patients before. It should help you!",
