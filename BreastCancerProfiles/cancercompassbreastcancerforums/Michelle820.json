    "Content": "I have had alump in my armpit area for about 5 years,a nd although its stupid of me to not get it checked soon, about 1 month ago I finally went to my gyno because the lump had gotten firmer and bigger, and she wanted to do an Ultrasound of my armpit and my left breast.  They sent me for a ultrasound, and they found that the lump in my armpit was a mass, and they also found a small one in my left breast and wanted to send me in for a biopsy, I met with my surgeon, because I am having the one in my armpit removed to be biopsied, becuase it gets in my way and isnt painful but just uncomfortable when my shirt rubs on it.  While they remove the one in my armpit they will do biopsy of the one in my breast.  Im a little worried, i asked to be completly put to sleep for the procedure but she said they will have to do a wire localization while Im awake first before they wheel me over for surgery of the one and biopsy of the other.... what happens with a wire localization?  Will they give me happy pills?  Could I ask for them?  I am a jumper and I have to watch whats going on...  will they put the IV in me before that or after?  Im just very confused and worried.",
