    "Content": "Hi, I read you story this morning and I have to tell you something that may help your wife.  There is a treatment called NAET. It is not just for cancer but all disease.  I just learned this technique 5 months ago and am treating my sister who has metastisized breast cancer.  This treatment is accupressure and kinesiology.  It can clear the side affects of chemo and may clear the cancer all together.   I am having good results.  Search the internet about NAET and read the testimonials.  The practitionaer who helped me ( I had many health problems like celiac and RA symptoms and migraines) has had good results with cancer patients and has cleared tumors of cancer.  You don't have to suffer the affects of cancer or anything else when there is a treatment that can help.  Do the research and find a good practitioner. My heart goes out to you and your family,   Amy",
