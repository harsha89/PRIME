      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. My Mom has also decided to not undergo chemo. She is in quite a bit of pain and our goal at this time is to keep her as comfortable as possible and spend as much time with her as we can. The disease has not seemed to have progressed. She has no control below her waist but still has use of her upper body. I'm sorry to hear about your Mom - our thoughts and prayers are with you.",

      "Content": "My mom was first diaganosed with breast cancer in 1992. She had a mastectomy on her right side and was declared cancer free for about 10 years. In 2003 the cancer reared its ugly head in her bones. She has gone through various treatments - hormonal therapy, radiation and in February of this year, chemotherapy. About 4 weeks ago she started loosing control of her legs and after being transferred to New England Medical Center in Boston was diagnosed with carcinomatous meningitis.  The doctors want to put her on a regiment of depocytr - which is interthecral and an oral chemo called temodar. She is 79 years old and we are very concerned about the side effects of this very strong chemo therapy. They say that this chemo will not extend her life any but may help her to regain some use of her legs - she has no feelings below her waist - they say maybe a 10% chance of some improvement. Has anyone out there had any experience with this combination of chemo - its usefeullness as well as the side effects. We want to make these last few months - the doctors say 2-3 months - as comfortable for her as possible and are concerned that this treatment may be worse than the side effects of a treatment that has not been proven effective. I would appreciate any feedback.  Thank you  ",
