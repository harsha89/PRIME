    "Content": "Hi Jan. I just read that you are a stage 4 ovarian cancer survivor of 7 years. How amazing! I was given 3 months to live without chemo and 5% chance to make it for a year, after than 20% to make it for 5 years. I recently went to my check up since my last chemo in May. I thought I would get all good news because I am feeling better, hair is growing back, some of the side effects that I have are lessening in pain and I can actually get about when I feel like it. I have not been given the ok to go back to work yet. They have me on disability. I am only 43 years old. When I went for my CT scan and check-up, they found nodules on my lungs and want me to start chemo of doxil or gemzar. I was hoping for good news and to get on with normal life but now another set back. Not sure what I want to do. I am thinking of the Alivizatos treatment instead. Could you fill me in some on your situation and how you made it this far? That is just great!!! You could email me outside this group if you want to. My email is andrie@spacestar.net. Thanks and good luck to you all!!! Keep your chins up! Prayer does help! Family is also a very good support group although they don't know 1st hand what you are going thru. They will always be there for you.",
