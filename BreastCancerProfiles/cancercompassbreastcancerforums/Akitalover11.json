I've talked to several women, and they all think they know how they got it. I have a feeling too because I have no family history of it. Between the ages of 20 and 30 I went vegetarian and consumed mainly soy products. I thought I was doing good for myself. I ate veggie burgers, meatless chicken, tofu, edamame, soy sausages....etc. I ate them EVERY day! I know they say soy mimics estrogen so am thinking this may be what triggered my cells to go crazy. Some things I read says plant matter can't do that. I just feel in my gut that this is how I got it. After 30 I ate meat again. But as I try and find the source of the meat, most of it is grain fed.....most of that grain being soy! The chickens are fed grains....soy. The eggs from free range chickens are fed grains....soy! My lotions contain soy! Why does every darned thing I try to eat contain soy! I tried to do better and am left confused by food. Other women ER positive tell me they were on hormone replacement therapy and think that caused it. Another believes it was the hormones in her birth control pills. I am just curious if others have that \"feeling\" that they know what caused them to get this? I was 41 (2012) when I had a 3.5 cm tumor in my left breast. I opted for bi lateral mastectomy. My tumor was close to my chest wall but the surgeon got clean margines. I had 9 lymph nodes removed and 3 had cancer. I was stage 2 but borderline 3. I did 4 rounds of chemo and 36 radiation treatments. I was on tamoxifen for almost a year which made me have a hysterectomy and ovaries removed. I also was having problems with my vision. I couldn't focus my eyes. I switched to arimadex a month ago and hate it already. I have had neck pain and pain between my shoulder blades that has floored me and I can't do anything. My right foot also feels like it is broken. I am just wondering what and how others feel about food........Hi I would like to say that as far as the Arimidex and Aromisin are concerned, I'm with you on that. I have had so many side effects, I cannot walk barefoot feels like I'm walking on my bones! I have extreme bone, joint pain, fatigue muscle aches. My doctor gives me two norco per day just to participate, otherwise I just couldn't get through the day. This October will be my five year mark on this drug, andni wonder if my life will be pain free? I know the scar tissue will be there, but I will go from 95 back to 61 years old maybe??",

No, milk, sugar, best to stay on a natural foods diet.  Cancer is due to PH negativity in the body, keep your body PH at 6 or above and cancer cannot live or thrive in an oxygenated enviornment.  I have done much research in the 6 yrs since being DX'd.  I've found most oncologists are in the dark explaining what cancer is, why it thrives and how to get it out.  I was told I would not see 2012, and I needed to consider putting my affairs in order and visiting friends and family....otherwords, go plan my funeral.  If i'd listened to oncologists, I would be in the ground.  When first dx'dw/DCIS,pr/er positive told I need mastectomy, chemo/radiation/reconstruction, the routine...well, i'm not one for body mutiliation, so I did research, found an oncologist/breast surgeon in NewYork who has been doing Laser Surgery.  Has been named doctor of the year twice in NY State, results show a better outcome with hardly any recurrence of cancer vs. standard surgical removal.  Also, less chance of cancer cells escaping into the body and reestablishing new territory.  As for the cause, I had genetic testing, long interviews...I'd had lyme disease, then ChronicFatigue Syndrome, then debilitating arthritis, which I still have, but it is INFLAMMATION that causes most diseases, heart disease, and I believe also cancer.    I wish you all the best, but do stay focused on YOU, do the research, learn all you can - Read:  Genocide -The Cancer Coverup/Kathleen Deoul, If I can help further, please buzz in.  God Bless....( LaserBreastCancerSurgery.com \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://LaserBreastCancerSurgery.com \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LaserBreastCancerSurgery.com )I immediately called and went....no paid, no cutting, no body mutiliation, I kept my breast, removed the tumor, got clear margins, got  up off the table after surgery, went to dinner that night, flew  home 3 days later.   My reports had stated I was already Stage 4 - thanks to a misread mammogram that missed the tumor, so why would I believe more garbage from oncolgoist????  I saw my scans, read the reports.  I had 8 -9mm tumors in my lungs,liver, all soft tissue, plus invasion in my spine, pelvis, ribs.  I opted for natural, within 3 months I had rid my body of all soft tissue tumors and pronounced secondary remission, I still had invasion in my spine and pelvis, but the ribs invasion was gone.  I then opten for CSCI, I've had reduction with this remedy, but will have to go through it again, still, it beats the misery of medical hacking.  Yes, i'm a bit snarky, but it was the brilliant medical world not paying attention that caused this misery, then they want to further inflict more misery.  Cancer is all about the money...many of us on this site have learned that secret.  I'd advise you google Mina Bissell/TED--she is a top cancer researcher, then go to Ben Goodacre, listen intently, learn what cancer really is and how to beat it.  It can be done.  I am now healthy, no fatigue, no health issues, my tumor markers are all normal, all stats/bloodwork are normal.  Onco's said it couldn't be done without chemo -  But, they don't tell you chemo kills more people than the actual cancer.  Causes heart attacks, host of problems, radiation causes the heart muscles to harden and leads to heart failure.  Keeping the body PH in check is the secret.  I got all my soft tissue void of tumors using the Kelmun Protocol and also the Aspargus puree - which is same ingredients in Indole 3/Carbinol, which you should be taking, along with other cancer fighers, keep your immune system in good working order and it will do more to cure the cancer than anything any onco can offer.  They know it, but who wants to give up a million or more to keep the cancer industy going than admit there are other ways to health without the miserable side effects.  I still have cancer, but it is completely under control and I will not let it rule my life, my onco is amazed, asks me what i've done, I know that research and learning everything possible is the key, not following protocol that brings in the big bucks.  You have to be determined and learn everything there is about the enemy, and you can win.  I have and I will continue to do so. Very awesome You have taken control of your life. Sugar is cancers friend. Remember that everyone",

After going to my primary MD and an orthopedist I realized it was from the Arimidex and I went to my oncologist who took me off the med for 3 weeks. He then put me on Aromisin which has been easier to tolerate. It works a little different. I still had joint pain and stiffness for 31/2 years. About 2 months ago the pain went away leaving me with only stiffness. ....I will be finished with it in 14 months. I wonder if the stiffness will go away or if this is the new me. My joints feel older than the rest of my body. I used Naprosin for pain relief. I am happy to have good treatments and glad to be alive but it is at best annoying. JaneI like that \"at best annoying\", I have had carpal tunnel surgery since being on Aromisin. My joints in my hands and feet are stiff and painful. It makes me feel a little better to know it is the medicine and maybe it will get better when I stop taking it. My five years are up in October with this drug. I always feel like I am alone with these horrible side effects. My son did make a salve with St. John's wart and rubs my feet. I always get relief. He has me on cod liver oil and other supplements, ghee for vitamin k2, magnesium etc. I feel like a big baby because I still take Motrin and up to two norco to get around",
