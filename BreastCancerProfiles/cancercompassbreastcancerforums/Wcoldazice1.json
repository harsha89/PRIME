      "Content": "I have posted on this site several times. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago. Since then it has metastis to her spinal fluid and then to her brain fluid. I am not going to embellish on this. This disease is horrible. My mother lost her battle with this disease on Aug.4, 2006. She was a brave woman and refused to let it take her until she was ready.

      "Content": "Dear Sir, You seem to know a lot about this disease. I am very sorry for your loss. i was wondering if you could possibly give me the specific symptoms that your loved one endured during the end. My mother is at home with hospice and is in complete denial. She swears that she is going to beat this cancer. She is experiencing shakes, vision problems hearing problems and equilibium instability. She confuses me. I am not sure what to do. Is she fooling me or herself or both? She was first diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago and was diagnosed last June with cancer cells in her spinal fluid and in the brain. She refuses to bathe and is not getting enough fluids. I can't be there because of finances and she swears that she's going to move here in June. Is that possible or is she just living in a fantasy? I would appreciate any help.",
