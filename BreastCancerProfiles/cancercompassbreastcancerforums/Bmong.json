And now...two weeks after first treatment, she has started to lose her hair and is tearyeyed off and on. I want to make her feel better. I offered to shave my head, but she said not to. I don't know what I can do or say to make her feel better. When she crys I cry. Does any one have any ideas for me.                                        Kim  I am in the process of my hair growning back due to chemo for breast cancer.   My husband supported me with his reminders that it is only temporary.  When I would get down, he would remind me again.  I have worn a wig since June 18, 2006 and would not have been able to accept baldness without it.  I had people tell me how nice my hair looked & ask where I got it cut (these are people who didn't know I had lost my hair).  If she doesn't have a wig, I certainly would recommend her to be fit for one - she will feel much better about herself, I'm sure.  It's alright to have tears - I did a number of times but snapped out of it.  Just keep reminding her that it is only temporary & it will soon be behind her.  Good luck to both of you & God bless you for wanting to be supportive for your mom.  Bonnie",
