      "Content": "I got the news at age 44 on 9/11/01 and was scared to death like you. I advise you to get some books from your library and find some time to read about breast cancer. The more you know the less scarey it will be. I had an aggressive tumor too that was treated with A/C prior to surgery. My 3.5 cm tumor shrunk nearly in half which allowed me to have a lumpectomy vs a mastectomy.  Chemo will be a tough battle but you'll survive like me",
