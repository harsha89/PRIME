I am rooming with two ladies who have inflammatory breast cancer and both are doing very good. The treatment at this institute is low dose radiation and hyperthermia (heat). Please go into this site, as you will find this treatment very interesting. In my case the treatment is effective. They have been doing this treatment for over 30 years. In Gods Work, Raymond D.",
