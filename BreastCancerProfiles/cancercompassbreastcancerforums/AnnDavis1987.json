    "Content": "My best friend has been dealing with nonpruenal mastitis for about a year and told me that she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer 5 weeks ago. She told me that she had the option of chemotherapy instead of surgery, and that chemotherapy could now be done with pills. The only pills she produced were valproic acid (which I found is a psychiatric medication prescribed for a mental condition that she has, but also has been tested with promising results in patients with breast cancer when used in tandem with chemo) and antibiotics. She has not been sick, losing hair, tired, or scared. She has had a healthy appetite (including a fair amount of alcohol consumption), continued to smoke cigarettes, and had plenty of energy. The only hospital visit she has allowed me to attend was for an ultrasound, in which the doctor said he saw no abscess. I have seen no documentation of her having cancer. Today she told me that the last five weeks of her oral chemotherapy were ineffective, that there was no tumor but the cancer cells had spread to her lymph nodes and is hence inoperable, and that she has advanced to stage III. I'm alarmed by her lack of symptoms, her consistent energy, and the absence of additional medications. I looked up her doctor and he is listed as a biological doctor at a free clinic, not an oncologist. She has a history of pathological lying and I just wanted to ask people with experience if anything I'm describing resembles a woman dealing with stage III breast cancer or if I'm being insensitive by doubting her. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",
