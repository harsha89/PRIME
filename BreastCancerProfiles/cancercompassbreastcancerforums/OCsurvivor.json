My hair is back.  I finally got it back to the color I like.  My hair came back curly and thick all over......I had thick hair orignally tho.  Thank goodness for my flat iron.  So far my cancer is gone...will go to doc next week.  For anyone out there the hair, eyebrows, eyelashes etc does come back....my hair on my legs and armpits tho does not grow hardly at all.........not complaining......that is a good thing.  Good Luck Everyone!",

That is the only way I can describe it. I am trying to wait long enough before I get color on it.  Does anyone know how long you should wait....I've heard maybe 6 mths.",
