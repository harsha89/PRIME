Your friend is fortunate to have a physician willing to be careful & offer bipsy. My mother was told in '05 that the calcifications that showed up on imaging, finally, did not require biopsy & was characterized as a PITA when we kept calling. Less than a yr. later she was dead from 'benign' calcifications that pathology identified as agressive stage 4 breast cancer. The same happened to my eldest sister the following year. My youngest sister had 'benign' calcifications removed w/lumpectomy the next yr.  Pathology later identified her 'recurrences' as a multitude of malignant calcifications missed by imaging due to breast density but only after she fought for 'prophylactic' bi-lateral mastectomies based on family history. By then she was stage 4. By the time I was able to convince a physician to MRI & biopsy in 2009 at age 43 I was in stage 3 w/8 'tiny' malignant calcifications in my left breast. Post 'prophylactic' bi-lateral mastectomies (a fight for me as well as lumpectomy was strongly recommended) allowed pathology to identify more than 120 calcified DCIS lesions, tiny, small & large, bi-laterally stage 3, including lymph nodes, all missed on mammogram due to breast density. In my family calcifications=malignant cancer & mammograms are entirely useless due to hereditary breast density. Stereo biopsy while not the most pleasant of experiences, could have caught our malignant calcifications & saved several young lives. If it were me, I'd encourage my friend to celebrate the opportunity for biopsy & the relief or immediate treatment options it may bring. Best of luck to your friend. ",

The decision between lumpectomy/mastectomy is difficult. I would be interested in speaking with anyone who has or has had a similar diagnosis. Is there anything else I should consider before I make my decision. Thank you in advance for any information shared! How may I help? I was dx'ed in '09 w/estrogen positive, stage 3 DCIS at age 43. I factored in family history & breast density which had impaired mammogram results. You may want to consider; family history, breast density, confidence in your oncologist, getting a 2nd opinion, how likely worrying may affect you post-lumpectomy, your age, your gut feelings about appearance, skin-saving reconstruction if you choose mastectomy, radiation's effect on reconstruction & Lymphedema among other things. I have personal experience w/both lumpectomy & mastectomy. I'm happy to talk if you'd like. In any case, you're in my thoughts. I'm very sorry about your diagnosis.",
