    "Content": "Hi \u2013 I am a genetic counselor who does breast cancer risk counseling and I wanted to share some important information that women on tamoxifen should be aware of. The FDA recently recognized the role that a gene called CYP2D6 plays in how effective tamoxifen can be in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer. Up to 7-10% of women taking tamoxifen may NOT be getting any benefit from this medication due to their specific genetic make-up. There is a test to determine if you are one of these women who does not benefit from tamoxifen. DNA Direct has worked with the oncologists who are studying this connection and we have detailed information on our website (www.genesanddrugs.com) for you to learn more. This testing is useful for postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer who are currently taking, considering taking, or have taken in tamoxifen the past. You can order the testing on your own directly from the website or your physician can complete the online referral form. Testing is simple and painless. Please contact clinical services 877-646-0222 or expert@dnadirect.com to talk with a genetic expert. Because this is a new type of testing, we are inviting a limited number of women to have this testing done at no charge. In return, we ask for feedback about your testing experience.
