      "Content": "Hello!  I'm going through the same thing. I was diagnosed with Breast cancer in 2/07 (age 38) at stage 1, ER +, BRAC -, had lumpectomy, radiation and now I'm on tamoxifen. In December there were 3 tiny non calcified nodules found on my right lung and my oncologist said we'll watch and wait. Just had my 3 month scan with no changes, so I guess that's good for now.  I have a long smoking history and even though my cancer was caught early I have a bad feeling this might be early lung mets. I have a long smoking",
