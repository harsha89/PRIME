    "Content": "After any major surgery, the body begins the healing process. Part of this process includes the forming of adhesions. Adhesions are tiny fibrous bands that build up around areas that have experienced trauma or surgery. These bands become like a thick glue that can restrict range of motion and cause pain and tightness in the areas surrounding the trauma. For many women, post mastectomy pain is caused by this build up of adhesions.  There is a manual physical therapy called The Wurn Technique® that breaks up these adhesions, resulting in decreased pain and increased function. If you would like to receive more information about this treatment, visit http://www.clearpassage.com/adhesions/post-surgical-adhesion I hope you find this information helpful.
