      "Content": "Turtle Thank you for the quick response. I am not sure what to do. I have followed up with mammo's but not a pap. As a matter of fact, I haven't had a pap in several years. I feel fatigued and since the chemo feel a lot of pain in my major joints. I have gone to my primary care doctor but because of my insurance I have had to change doctors a couple of times. I just wasn't sure if I should go back to see my oncologist or not.   I hope you do well on your journey and it is a journey. I have learned so many things about myself on this journey. Good, bad and indifferent. I have to say that it was truly a blessing for me to travel this path. I feel that God has given me victory over the cancer but sometimes we have to go through difficult situations to show us what is important in life.    ",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer 7 years ago. I had an Oncologist that did not have very good bedside manners and really didn't seem to care much about me or my situation. I had been on tomoxifin for 5 years but after that I did nothing. My question is simple, should I still be seeing an oncologist?  ",
