      "Content": "Hi all, I am in Indonesia. We really need advice for my wife treatment. My wife is 44 years old. Family history from her no one have a cancer. My wife has had 2 times operation for her breast. Firstly Doctor has been made Excision operation for about 12X8 mm size of the tissues. Then the biopsy result was Medullary Carcinoma Mammae. By its Biopsy result has been made for the second operation about 3 cm around of the first operation and taken 15 pcs lymph node. From the biopsy and IHC Clear and clean from the tumor and malignancies and outwarding appearance of P63 gave positive reactions in the immune cells in the ductuli mioepitel no need to continue for treatment. But the results of the first excision biopsy operation concluded Medullary Carcinoma mammae. It has been requested again to IHC for the final decision and the result is Estrogen and progesterone Receptor Negative, and c-erb B2 positive. Doctors Oncologists finally make a letter to Dr. Radiation Oncologist to do 30 times the radiation. And then later on chemotherapy. He said although there was no malignancy of the tumor at the surgery BCS, as it is standard procedure. I think it's very painful. As Doctor said Medullary is less aggressive compare to others type of carsinoma and good prognosis, So, Does she still need to radiation and chemotherapy? Thank you for your kindness to us. A restless husband",

      "Content": "Hi Kayatlanta, Thanks for your replied. One thing still a question in my mind, if no more identified on tissues margin 3 cm far from first excition and lymp node of tumor or malignancies, does it still need tratment or it is only pretending to make sure? So if it gives all things type of treathment already, is there assuring no more metastises in the future? Best regards, Mick",
