      "Content": "I retired, after 41 years at the Postal Service, on Jan 2, 2015 and started chemo 4 days later! Next week will be my last (15th) Herceptin infusion. I've had a lumpectomy, 6 rounds of chemo and 35 days of radiation. Now I will be on Anastrozole for 5 years. The side effects I experienced are tinnitus and neuropathy on the bottom of my feet. My heart doesn't seem to be as strong as it used to be either! But hey, after all, I am 69 years old. Nothing is as it used to be! During this last year I have lost, in addition to my hair, 30 pounds. Something I've been trying to do for 25 years. But I wouldn't recommend chemo as a diet! The steroids I received during chemo help with my arthritis. But I wouldn't recommend it for that either! I became more and more concerned when I found it hard to find someone with Her2+/neu cancer. Nowhere did I see that it was rare. I concluded that people are not to be found because they don't survive! Pretty upsetting - but now I attribute my silly deduction to \"chemo brain\". Not thinking clearly! We can and DO survive! So, to keep my cancer at bay... I've changed my diet, thanks to foodforbreastcancer.com \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.foodforbreastcancer.com and go to a cancer support group at a nearby hospital/fitness center, and joined the Livestrong program at the YMCA. It's free and helps breast cancer survivors regain their strength, stamina and balance. I was alway very physically active but the chemo knocked me for a loop 10 out of the 21 day cycles. And it progressively got longer each cycle. The last chemo session seemed to take a couple of months before I was strong enough to leave the house. I would love to hear what women do/not do to stay cancer free. According to foodforbreastcancer.com we (her2+) need a different diet than other cancer survivors. Staying clear of foods with phytoestrogens like soy. I (may be mistakenly) believe ever word I read there because my oncologist tells me absolutely nothing! I think I should be searching for a new oncologist online too! I hope everyone here is doing well and will respond telling me of their methods of keeping well!",
