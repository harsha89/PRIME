    "Content": "Hi there, I was wondering if anyone else had advanced BC and is now in remission or was in remission? My breast cancer went to my lungs and mediastinal glands Oct 07. I had radiation to the lungs and hormonal treatment.I am oest+ and prog + but hercepton -.Originally I had invasive ductal carcenoma grade 3 to my left btrteast. My CT scans have been clear all 2008. I am wondering how long the hormonal treatment is effective for? Was on Zolodex before I had an oopherectomy and now only on Arimidex. Would love to hear from someone with similar situation.",
