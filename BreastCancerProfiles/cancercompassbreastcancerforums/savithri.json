      "Content": "i am sorry to hear about the cancer. i had bilteral mastectomy nearly 12 years ago. it was awful as i felt part of my womenhood was being taken away from me. what the doctors did is to use the fat from the tummy to rebuild my breasts i didnt want anything inserted. they said that was the best,and they told me that i was getting a tummy tuck as well,so i thought why not. it took a while to heal but i noticed the size and shape had changed so i dont know i think you must talk to the doctors and tell them exactly what you want. takecare and keep in touch..     ",
