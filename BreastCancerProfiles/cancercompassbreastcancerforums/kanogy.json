    "Content": "Hi:  I was diagnosed with IBC in early March of this year. IBC is clinically diagnosed...you're doctor will physically look at the symptoms and diagnose that way.  I presented with an enlarged breast, peau d'orange skin, inverted nipple and pain in my breast.  After a mammo and ultrasound, I had 3 biopsies.  Cancer was found in a small lump in my breast (which the doctor could not palpate) and in my lymph nodes under my arm.  The inflammatory part of it was \"clinically\" diagnosed.   If you fear that your doctor does not know about IBC, I would definitely ask.  If he/she seems put off by your question, I would go elsewhere.  IBC is very aggressive and treatment must start quickly to ensure good results.  Feel free to e-mail me privately if you would like to talk more about IBC.   HUGS ",
