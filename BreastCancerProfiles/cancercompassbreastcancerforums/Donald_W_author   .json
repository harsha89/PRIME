      "Content": "I simply could not agree with Tre any more!  Spot on advice Tre. Though I am a Buddhist, one of my favorite quotes comes from Mother Teresa.  She once said, \"I know God will never give me more than I can handle.  I just wish sometimes he didn't trust me so much.\" I'm going to post the last paragraph from my new book because I think it's extremely relevant to this conversation and I wish to help as many cancer patients and their loved ones as possible.  \"As you begin your contest with cancer, I\u2019m going to leave you by giving a pre-game \u201cpep talk.\u201d  Vince Lombardi, legendary football coach, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not whether you get knocked down, but whether you get back up.\u201d  I believe there\u2019s more wisdom in those words than most pieces of advice you\u2019ll come by.  You are going to get knocked down.  It\u2019s life.  But see it for what it is, know that it\u2019s a normal process, and pick yourself back up.  The more you move forward through trying times, the more you\u2019ll grow to appreciate those times when you\u2019re on the other side of them.  They will change you for the better if you appreciate them.  This is a \u201cteaching life.\u201d  Learn from your experiences.  Live your life.  Love those that deserve it.  Write a book.  ;)\" Good luck and never hesitate to lean on all of us here.

      "Content": "While I'm not a doctor, I have had a lot of lymph nodes removed over the years.  I've never had any issues with working out like the ones you've described.  My advice is to go for it.  Your body will adjust as it's a perfect machine designed to survive.  That being said, if any of the knowledgeable care gives on this site disagree with me, I'd defer to them.
