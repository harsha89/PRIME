      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy June 28th and another surgery on July 12th because oops they missed the lymph nodes. I went to my oncolegist on monday inquired about a pet scan, he said they give to many false positives and then they find themselves chasing things that are not there. That a blood test for certain organs is a better bet. Don't know if this helps good luck : ) hollyhobby",

      "Content": "Hello to you, I went in for my second surgery to remove my lymph nodes. It was the worst pain i have ever felt in my life so far. The doctor had to go into my muscle, i took 2 vicodine every 5 hours it was like taking baby asprin. My lumpectomy was easy compared to this surgery. the good news is he took out 29 lymph nodes all are neg. I 'm so thankful. I'm going to have to go for radiation soon hopefully it won't be to terrible. The oncolgist wants me to take Tamixifen i haven't started it yet. I want to get over this pain before i have to deal with hot flashes,   It was interesting when i went to the oncolgist the nurse told me not to have my blood preasure or blood drawn from my right arm for ten years that it would cause Lymphadema. I wonder why my surgoen didn't tell me that. I hope all is good you all of you. Just healing Hollyhobby",

I had my Lumpectomy it went well, i got my path report today i had a 1.4 cm tumor they got it all and i have clear margins, unfortunetly i have to go back next thursday for surgery again because the report said there were no lymphnodes in the tissue that the doctor took out. He said he's 98% sure they are not infected but he can't take a chance with the other 2%, that he needs to go deeper into the armpit : ( Could be worse could be better, I know when God brings you to it he will bring you through it and i thank him every day for allowing me to open my eyes and see another day. Thank you very much for giving me a place to talk about cancer. Hollyhobby : )",
