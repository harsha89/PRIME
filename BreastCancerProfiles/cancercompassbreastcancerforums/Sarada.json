    "Content": "Dear Copper, its OK to breakdown and cry. Anybody would when you see your life crumbling in front of you. In my case, I was the patient. I was 36 when I was diagnosed with two young daughters. All through my surgery and chemo the one person who was my rock was my husband. He kept me going even on the worst of days during chemo. It was not till nearly a year later after I recovered that he admitted to me that he was scared and cried alot. I pray that your wife is fine and that the test results show that she has no cancer but if she does then just take one day at a time and stay strong. God bless.",
