    "Content": "Hi my sister was diagnosed with ibc the day after Christmas 2006 she started chemo right away and then in may they removed her breast, then she started radiation until july. She called me on monday and said that she didnt feel good and her lungs hurt and it hurt to lift her arm. she came over and showed me her underarm it had a very large hard lump like a brick and was red and hot. She went to the doc on thursday and the surgeon said that it was another tumor she went back friday and the doc said that it was a bad infection so they did an mri. saturday morning she went into sugery and they took a biopsy and some tissue from her armpit she has to be in there for 4 or 5 days.Up until this she doctors were so impressed with how well she was doing she went to work while doing chemo and after radiation she went right back, the doctors are baffled as to what this. they said that they couldnt read the mri its like they are not telling us everything. My family will be praying for you!!!",
