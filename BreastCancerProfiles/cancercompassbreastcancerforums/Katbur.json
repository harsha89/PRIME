    "Content": "Hi all - I've been in remission from Stage III Breast Cancer for just over a year now. I have two kids 7 and 3 and livein Wilmington, NC.  I've started a blog www.aftercancernowwhat.wordpress.com that I'd love you all to come visit. It is a work in progress, I'd like to expand it over time to include other cancers and such. I think we need almost as much support when treatment is over as when we're in the thick of it.    Peace and love to all - Kate www.aftercancernowwhat.wordpress.com ",
