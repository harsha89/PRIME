    "Content": "Hi, I am new to this board and I know how you feel also. My mother was diagonosed with brest cancer in 98 and it was in remission a year or so later. The cancer returned in 03. It has been a very difficult 3 years. My mom was just diagonsed with brain cancer and they found some more spots on her bones. When they first found out the cancer was in her bones she was in terrible pain. The pain has been managed and she is taking vicadin and morphine for pain. She is actually taking about 15 different pills. It seems as if they are always prescribing her something. They have to medicate the side affects of the other medications. But any way, she is not doing to well right now. She just completed 15 rounds of radiation and she started kemo again last Monday. I am so scared of losing my mother. WE are so close. Tears are feeling my eyes just thinking and writing about it. I think my mother is dying. She had to stop working again and she doesn't have much of an appetite. I am so devastated by this disease. I don't know how long my mother has and I don't want to know actually. We just have to live everyday like it is the last. I am so sad and it is hard for me to focus. I am a collage student and I would love to graduate before my mother passes away, but I don't know if I have time. I want her to be proud of me. I just want her to be weel and stay with me as long as possible. I want anyone who knows God to pray for me and my family. I need strength. Thanks in advance",
