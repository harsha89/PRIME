    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in Feb. this year.  I had a fairly large tumor and 3 lymph nodes involved all of which were removed.  No other areas were affected the surrounding tissue was negative and bone scan and other tests were negative too.  Now after getting through 8 treatments of chemo I was about to start radiation and during the mapping for the radiation the ct scan showed some possible areas for concern around my spine.  They are doing a bone scan to rule out bone mets.  I feel absolutly fine.  I have no pain.  I guess I just feel confused.  I know that bone mets is common from breast cancer but showed no symptoms of it and had all the negative tests.  I am hopeful that the scan today shows nothing but prepared for the possibility that it shows something.  I know that they will give me the anti hormones as mine was positive to hormone and that there are things they can do to stop progression of any disease but still...... this is a scary thing.   I am ecouraged by reading some of the posts here you all seem to be very supportive and that is a blessing.",
