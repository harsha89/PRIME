    "Content": "Hi There are a lot of alternatives to chemo. I have stage 3C breast cancer and am right now doing therapies that have had a lot of success. People I know personally are now cancer free without chemo or surgery. The jury is still out with me, but I can tell you I've never felt better, more healthy than I do now with the therapies and diet. If you are interested, read Cancer Free by Bill Henderson. It's a good start.  ",
