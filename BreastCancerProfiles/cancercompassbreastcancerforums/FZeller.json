      "Content": "I was DX in Dec. 1999 with invasive ductal no lymph nodes involved.  Had a lumpectomy, CMF, 32 radiation treatments, 5 years on tamoxifen, and 3 years on Aromasin.  I am 4 months from being 18 years out.  My cancer was never found on a mammo, or ultrasound.  I just knew something wasn't right no lumps either.  Finally got a surgeon to do a biopsy. Anyway long story short.  Monday went for my yearly checkup.  Mammo being done no problem so I wait for the radiologist to read to see do we need more views routine stuff.  However, this time she came back and said they needed more views.  Okay anxiety now.  Took views then off to see what radiologist says.  Another 15 min. later came back said sorry we are trying to get a room to do an ultrasound.  Now major anxiety!!  They all know me so they were explaining everything they were doing showing me what they were looking at etc.  Then they say we need to do a needle core with Ultrasound guidance.  Well that was the next day on Tuesday.  Said it would be 2 to 3 days.  My surgeon then said she would call me as soon as she got something and she did in less than 24 hours she called said I haven't got all markers in yet but it is invasive ductal again. Biopsy showed markers today all the same as before ER/PR+ Her2-,  she is now requesting a FISH test on the Her2 to make sure it is a correct reading.  So still waiting for that. I know a Mastectomy is first as I can't have radiation.  Now she is waiting for the Her2 so she can be sure of which chemo this time.  We will have a port placed for chemo as my veins will not be able to handle the chemo again.  She has already said chemo every 3 weeks for a year.  This new cancer is 6cm from the other.  My surgeon and her nurse are also BC survivors with bi-lateral mastectomies.  We all have great communication with each other.  Talking about reconstruction but not really sure I want that I'll soon be 62.  Has anyone on here ever have a recurrence so many years later after having done chemo, radiation and 8 yrs on anti cancer drugs and have it come back in the same place.",
