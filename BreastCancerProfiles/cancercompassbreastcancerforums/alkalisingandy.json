      "Content": "Hi i took my wife to Dr Morter 13 years ago. He is in Rogers, Arkansas USA.  he was one of the few that was trying to get people to \"alkalise\" I have only just got back to alkalising, with \"innerlight\" in the UK. There is so much talk about Testing for pH, and a lot of misconceptions. The only ph testing Kit  i would use is from Dr Morter's clinic. You have to follow certain instrucions for a propper diagnosis. It comes complete with instructions. for urine and saliva. You can't just spit on the Litmus paper. I also got his book \"Correlative Urinalysis\".he is a wonderfull person. please look him up, you won't regret it. Wishing you a happy Xmas and good health in the new year. andy --Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed. Consider private reply.
