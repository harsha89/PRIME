    "Content": "My father's prostate cancer mets. to his liver he was sent to a hosp. that does a procedure called chemoembolization which chemo is injected into the liver then they use a gel type substance to block off the artery that feeds the liver, there are alot of articles on the internet related to this procedure it has been very succesful either stopping the tumor from growing or killing it completely. My father is having this done on thurs. we are hoping it is successful, I think this could be an option for you to research. We are going to St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee, we were sent there through my dads Dr. at CTCA. Good Luck.",
