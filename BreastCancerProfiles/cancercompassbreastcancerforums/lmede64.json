      "Content": "Due to mammogram results, I had a needle biopsy done. Since it was 10 years ago, I don't fully remember the procedure except that it was quite uncomfortable. It also seems to be a bit archaic to be standing in a room with needles sticking in your breast. Anyway, despite the fact that I got a false-negative reading, I'm glad I went ahead with it. Apparently the \"clear\" reading came from the end of the tumor that was clear. My doctor told me we could just keep an eye on it through bi-annual exams, or if it made me nervous, we could take it out. I chose to have it taken out through a lumpectomy. My surgeon was totally shocked when the labs came back on that procedure as positive. They had to follow up with a wide excision to get clear margins. Even though I only had a stage 1B cancer, I pulled out all the ammo and had chemo and radiation. It's been 10 years of remission. Don't wait! Take charge!",

      "Content": "I was shocked to be diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago. After all, I didn't fit the profile as I knew it. There was no family history, a normal length of mensesI, I gave birth at the age of 19 and spent relatively little time on birth control pills. When I researched it further, I found that these facts account for a very small percentage of breast cancer. Despite this, every time I went to a new doctor (due to moving) I had to fill out a new form which asked questions about those same factors. It was very frustrating and when I dared to question the validity of these questionnaires, I was met with blank stares.   This week I received an email from http://www.armyofwomen.org/ inviting me to participate in the HOW, Health of Women, study. See below:   We are inviting ALL of you to join us in a new approach to research that may tell us: HOW breast cancer starts and HOW to prevent it, the Health of Women Study (HOW)!   EVERY WOMAN can take part in the HOW Study regardless of whether or not you have had breast cancer. You don't even have to leave your house to participate!  The HOW Study is an on-line study!   The survey was easy to take, and I strongly feel that this data will be meaningful in the understanding of breast cancer.  ",
