I was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer in Oct 2005.  I had six lots of FEC chemotherapy and 3 weeks of radiotherapy.  So far I have been fine. I would love to hear  any info you manage to find about this type of cancer, as I have very little knowledge like you about what our chances are.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, Its Jacky S again. Just to update, I recently had a recurrence in the scar tissue from my mastectomy. So obviously the FEC and radiation did not work for me.  However it has been removed successfully and am now hoping for no more recurrences.  Still haven't been able to find anything which could be of any help.  Jacky S.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, I would be very interested in talking to others or joining a website for mataplastic breast survivors.  I am 46 years old and was diagnosed in 2005. Had mastectomy,chemo (6xFEC) and radiotherapy.  Sentinel node biopsy was clear. my oncologist said I was stage 2, grade 3.  I had a hard time with chemo, but radiotherapy was much easier.  Am now fit and well.  Just trying to get on with things and stop worrying about re-occurrence.  It would be so much easier if there was more information about metaplastic cancer. My tumour was also non hormone receptive. Is this normal with this type of cancer? JS  ",
