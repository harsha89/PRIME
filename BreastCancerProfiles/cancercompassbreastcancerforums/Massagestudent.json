If you have had experience with massage therapy, please reply to this message. Thank you! Laura   My name is Sabrina Wix and I am a massage therapist student. I now know how well massage treatments work for cancer patients. My mother is a survivor of breast cancer going on three years. When I started massage school I didn't know the effect it would have on cancer. But after helping my mother I now know how well it helps. If anyone is interested in receiving a massage just e-mail me and I will give you a good rate for treatments. Also if anyone is interested in the state of Indiana it is not licensed and we are going to the state house Feburary 8th, for a protest for them to start licenseing it.                                            Thanks,                                          Sabrina Wix",
