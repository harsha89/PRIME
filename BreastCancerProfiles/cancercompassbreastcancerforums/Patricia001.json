      "Content": "Sharon, thank you for the response. It was VERY encouraging. (I realized I made a typo...not 23 years 2-3 years). I really need to hear good stories right now and yours fit the bill. I know there are things I can do for myself. I'm loosing weight too fast and I concentrating on eating really good qualtiy of food. That's a lot for me right now. But I know I'm getting better...less fear, etc. Thank you again. Your reply really helps. Patricia",
