      "Content": "I feel like I'm in a joint pain club... at least I don't suffer alone. I have been on arimidex now for 5 months and can't believe how weak my hands and wrists are and achy breaky arms and legs....it must be what arthritus feels like.  Has anyone found any relief with Turmeric ?  I have heard that people who suffer from arthritus find relief with this spice ...heard this on Peoples Pharmacy years ago and today in a Yoga workshop it was suggested for joint pain...I said yeah!  Let me have it.....I made my first \"turmeric milk shake\" this evening having  been given a recipe today and it was delicious.. Here it is:   1/4 teas. turmeric and 1/4 c. water ...bring to boil and boil down to almost a paste...Add 1 C. almond milk, 1t. honey and bring to boil..Remove from heat and whisk in 1t.almond oil...sprinkle with nutmeg or cinnamon and Voila...It was good!  I'll try drinking this every evening and I'll let you know.",
