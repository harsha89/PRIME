      "Content": "Hello This is my first visit to this website that was recommended to me by a very good friend. I hope you guys can help me with my problem. I had a right lumpectomy in Apri '08. Everything went well, surgery, treatments(my treatment was new called mammosite--which they inserted a balloon cath in the hollow area of the breast area where the tissue was removed and went for radiation treatments 2 times a day for 5 days only), no chemo was suggested.  As I said all went well. Now, after almost a year I have having severe pain on the incision area so much that at times I cant move my right arm, it hurts alot when I cough or sneeze and the pain radiates to my chest at times.  I am unable to get out of bed in the mornings sometimes because of the pain. Has anyone else experienced this before and if so what have you done?     ",

So, how do I find out if its from radiation or something else?  Do I suggest to have another biopsy done to confirm or have an ultrasound? ",

      "Content": "I just returned from my 6 month mammo and was told by the radiologist that 2 microcalcifications were found, but nothing to worry about until I at least get 5 or more calcifications.  She also stated that these calcifications might have come from the radiation treatment I received last year.  I was very frustrated and have an appt with both the regular physician and my general surgeon next week.  I am strongly thinking of just having my right brest removed and have reconstructive surgery so that I wont have to worry about it for awhile.  I had a lumpectomy last year and only received radiation(call Mammosite, a new type of treatment which involved treatments of 2 times a day times 5 days only) then I was given a clearance.  That was last year, now supposedly I have to wait until I get 3 or more calcifications before anything can be done???  Can anyone out there give me any type of advise ?",
