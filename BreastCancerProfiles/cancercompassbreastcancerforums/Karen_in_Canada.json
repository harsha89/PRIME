    "Content": "I too had IBC! Now NED for over a year and taking Arimidex - sleeplessness, weight gain, joint pain - you name it. I was also taking Effexor to control the hot flashes but it actually worsened them so now I don't take anything. I just bought a bottle of Melatonin as a natural sleep aid but haven't tried it yet. Good luck to all of you.",
