      "Content": "Hi...I have been taking Femara for almost two years now.  I had stage 2 breast cancer.  I am very grateful that this pill is available to me....but I havn't felt the same since I began this therapy! I have cramps and stomach trouble I can't sleep at night My hips ache most of the time If I am not feeling chilled...I am breaking out in sweats! I get cramps in my legs as well as achey feet....Is there anyone else out there who is experiencing what I am?  I would love to go off the pill...but I am so afraid that the cancer will come back!  Has anyone tried taking the femara less often...perhaps every other day? Hoping to share some opinions! Murphy",

      "Content": "Thank you for all of the answers to my questions on Femara.  I am still taking it...and still suffering from hip and knee pain.  The joints in my fingers are giving me trouble as well.  I have developed 3 trigger fingers.  I have found that with exercise the symptoms feel a litttle bit better!  I am happy that I have estrogen positive Breast cancer and that I am able to take femara..but, BOY...it's rough!!  I now take advil at bed time, and it aliviates some of the joint pain.
