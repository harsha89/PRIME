      "Content": "Hi Joan, I just read your email and can't believe your markers are that high and they are not already doing chemo. Mine are only 45 but I have been going through chemo for about 2 1/2 years. I don't know if I told you that or not. I do have \"Chemo Brain\". So you are not going to CTCA? I am truly anxious to find out what they have to offer me. My onc says there is no cure and I will be on chemo the rest of my life. Well that is fine and dandy, as long as I am alive, but I sure would like a little quality to go with it and that is what is taking me to CTCA. I will surely let you know how things go and if you are not going there now you may want to consider it. Kepp me informed on your progress and let me know if you have any questions about the different chemo's and their side effects. God Bless you as well. I will keep you in my prayers.",

      "Content": "Hi Joan, I don't know exactly what you are wanting to know. I can tell you that I had breast cancer when I was 36 and went cancer free until August of 2000 at which time it came back in bones. I have been taking chemo since then and so far have been on 7 different kinds of chemo. I have just now made an appointment with CTCA and I am looking forward to my visit on the 25th. Tell me what you want to know. I have much experience.",
