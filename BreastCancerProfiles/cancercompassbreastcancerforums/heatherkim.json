    "Content": "My mom was on Carboplatin and Taxol and suffered nerve damage from them. She did not get the nerve damage until her second to last treatment and that was in March. She is still on Morphine and started taking Neurotin. Neither one helps for the pain. She cannot stand for too long and she can't sit for too long. The nerve damage is in her butt and legs. We are now filing for disability because she cannot work like this and the Dr does not know how long it will last. Researching these drugs they both are good for causing nerve damage. Good luck to you and hope it gets better for you.",
