    "Content": "I would very much like to participate in the MBC support group you are forming. Eighteen years ago, at the age of 41, I was diagnosed with breast carcinoma with sarcomatous metaplasia in the right breast. After recently reading everything I can find on Metaplastic Breast Cancer, there's no doubt in my mind that this was the type of cancer I had. Rare, agressive, triple negative, spindle cells, sarcoma, etc., etc.,etc. I had a modified radical mastectomy (no reconstruction) and was lucky to have had a very agressive oncologist who said our best chance to beat it was during the first fight. I had 4 chemo treatments (adriamyician, cytoxon, 5 FU) and 7 weeks of radiation. I had no lymph node involment, but as we all know that doesn't mean much with this type cancer.  I made it. And I know how incredibly lucky I am and not a day goes by, even after all these years, that I don't thank my lucky stars. NOW, my 39 year old daughter has just found a lump in the same breast in the same place as mine. I am frantic. She is scheduled for a biopsy in two weeks. In the meantime, I'm anxious to see if there is any genetic link to this hideous disease.",
