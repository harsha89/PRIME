    "Content": "Has anyone had Zomatta Intervenous Treatments?  I am a breast cancer survivor 13 years & now it is in sternum & rib. I have been receiving intervenous treatment every month for 6 months & now starting to get them every three months. My question is has anyone had a jaw bone problem being on this treatment? It really scares me to read about the side effects it does to the jaw bone.  I really do not want to get these treatments anymore as I do not want to deal with something severe as losing the bone in the jaw!  I have enough to deal with trying to get this cancer under control. Anybody out there know if once off the treatments, then you do not have to be concerned about this side effect?  Or is the damage already done? Joan",
