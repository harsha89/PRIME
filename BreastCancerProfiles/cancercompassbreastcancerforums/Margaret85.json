      "Content": "Hello, I hope you were able to find a gift for your Mother. I am sorry to say that I did not see this blog until today. I wish I had seen in a year ago! I first want to let you know that I hope your Mom is doing well after her surgery. I am the president of a company called SPirited Sisters Inc.. WE were founded by 3 sisters,  2 of whom had cancer at the same time. Our mission is to enhance the environment in which people are asked to heal and recover. To that end we designed and currently manufacture the Original Healing Threads. These functional and fashionable garments are perfect for many medical situations, but are particularly wonderful for mastectomy patients. Our soft fabric; our revoluitionary, discreet break-away panels; our large interior pockets that conceal drainage bags, monitors, and pumps, all combine to bring the wearer dignity, modesty, and a sense of empowerment. We totally believe that ones mind, body, and spirit are involved in one;s healing and recovery. Our products totally express that and make the wearer also feel the power of the mind and spirit. We offer tops, and pants with break-away features in sizes XS - 3XL; 7 differenct colors. We also offer a number of other gifts appropriate for anyone undergoing any type of medical treatment. Again, I apologize for getting this to you so late in the game, so to speak. Our Original Healing Threads make FABULOUS gifts. Our customers send glowing e-mails of testimony of the warmth and comfort offered by them, I invite you to check our our website, www.healingthreads.com.  Thank you and my best wishes to you and your Mom,  Margaret (Peg)",
