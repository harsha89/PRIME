    "Content": "Hi, I am in stage 4 breast cancer also. I am taking taxol once a week for 6 weeks and then 2 weeks off. This makes my second time, the first was 11 yrs ago. My choices were to have my breast removed or go for 6 wks of radiation. I had my breast removed and continue my life pretty much the way I had. Now here I go again. I was in shock for a few weeks but I'm starting to get my bearings again. With my search through the internet and other sorces for my chances of beating this again I haven't found anything that says I'm a dead duck, so keep trying to educate yourself on what you are fighting, but keep fighting!! My cancer has come back pretty close to where it was before and then has gone straight through to the bone and lung no lynph nodes effected. I thought I had made the right choice 11 yrs ago....this time I'm hoping that also. NO ONE CAN TAKE HOPE FROM YOU AND DON'T LET THEM!!!!!! Keep your hopes up, Deb",
