    "Content": "Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C is just as powerfulÂ  as IV C if you take 12 packets a day. I've taken both so I can vouch for the Lypo-Spheric. It's absorbed differently then oral Vitamin C so it goes right into the cells. It has a different technology. You can do some research. There is a 1/2 video about it somewhere on the net by Dr. Levy. Let us know how you like it.",
