    "Content": "I have not been diagnosed,  but feel as though I have a body odor. And of course, some will talk about you,  some you ask won't tell you the truth... But I have a doctor's appointment coming up, bc I was worried. The other thing is I'm barely having a bowl movement, unless taking laxatives. Back pain... I've changed my eating habits... No junk {sugary foods},  no sodas. Water, water, water,  some juice, not much. Eating more fruits & veggies. HELP! ",
