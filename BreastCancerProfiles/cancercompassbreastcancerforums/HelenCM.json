      "Content": "I am due for a lumpectomy on Monday, and am concerned about the guidewire insertion procedure. Everyone I have spoken to says the procedure for this and the insertion of the radiation ink is very, very painful, and one cannot get any pain relief or local anesthesia. Does anyone out there have any feedback on what this procedure is like, and the best way to prepare for it?",

      "Content": "Hi all: I was just diagnosed with both DCIS and a small invasive ductal cancer tumor in my right breast. Two different surgeons have said I am a good candidate for lumpectomy and radiation. I have small breasts, and have decided not to do any reconstructive surgery. My gut is not giving me any guidance on this one....I would love to hear your thoughts. On one hand, I want this cancer out of me all the way (mastectomy), but on the other hand, I want to take this one step at a time. My greatest fear is not the mastectomy as much as them missing some small cancers in the future. I would love to hear your thoughts.",

      "Content": "I just had a lumpectomy, and my nodes are clean. I have been reading messages about the horrible pain caused by the estrogen inhibitor drugs prescribed after radiation treatment. I wonder if any of you would recommend having chemo rather than the radiation/drug therapy? Sounds to me like the radiation/drug therapy process is long and horrible.....I know chemo is horrible, too, but for a shorter time. Any info you can share with me would be appreciated. I see my oncologist for the first time this week, and would like to be better informed. Thanks!",
