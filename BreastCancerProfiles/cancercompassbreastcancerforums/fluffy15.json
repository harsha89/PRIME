    "Content": "Moonwalker, Thank you for your story.   I have to say I have had joint pain and muscle aches.  My potassium has dropped since having thyroid cancer in Oct. 2007 and I have extreme muscle weakness, twitching, cramps and they tremor all the time beginning exactly one year after radioactive iodine.  Sometimes, by the end of the day I can hardly walk because my knees and ankles hurt so badly.  I have been through three endocrinologists, my primary dr. and an integrative dr.  The integrative dr. has been the biggest help, but he isn't covered by insurance.   I have read several accounts of radioactive iodine causing bone and muscle pain.  It is is so very odd that my endocrinologist tells me that radioactive iodine has no side effects.  I know this is untrue, as I have salivary gland damage.  I make almost no saliva, which is irritating and sometimes painful - because it gathers in the jaw and has to be massaged out.  It creates stinky breath and this is embarrassing because my daughter and husband recently made-up a song about mommy's stinky breath.  I am going to see Rheumatologist tomorrow and we'll go through another tap dance.  My primary dr. suggested glucosamine (spelling?) and I'm off to get that.  I also take calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, B complex and fish oil (now my good cholesterol is low and the bad is high...).  He said it takes about 3 months to work.  So, why not?  I'll do this and maybe try massage and accupuncture.  I have a 3 and 6 year old and holding him is sometimes miserable, but I'm hanging in there.  I have always been mentally strong.  I know I will work through this, but it is frustrating when my preschool friends are working out and I can barely push my son around the neighborhood in a stroller.  It takes a toll after a while.   Good luck to you!!!!
