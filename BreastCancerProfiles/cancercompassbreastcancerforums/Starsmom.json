      "Content": "Luara is not doing well at all. Her Breast Cancer spread to her liver and things don\u2019t look very good right now. She told us that she is loosing weight fast and is starting to put food in a blender to try to keep it down. Her stomach is so swollen she looks like she is 4 or 5 months pregnant and she is in a considerable amount of pain. She continues to bleed from an unknown source though the bleeding is light, none the less it continues. Wednesday (May 31th) she is flying to OK to see her doctor, we are very afraid that he will tell her that her Liver is failing. I was wondering if anyone had any Buddy Passes, Frequent Flier points or other resources that we may not be aware of. My sister and I have spent so much money going back and forth from FL for visits (we are in TX ) or appointments that we are pretty tapped out financially. Because these appointments happen at the last minute the flights are pretty expensive and it is adding up fast. Granted if push comes to shove we will continue to do whatever it takes to be there to give Laura all the support in the world. We have not seen her in almost a month and our hearts our breaking at the thought of how quickly things are changing for her. Anything that you can share would be appreciated.

      "Content": "  Dear Supporters,   Thank you so much for your support and advice during these last few years. My darling friend of 33 years passed away April 26, 2008.   Frankly I am still numb no one ever expected her to pass Laura fought this disease for 10 years she always believed that she could beat it. Two weeks before she passed she was still reading labels and wanting to know about every medication and side affect before she put that med in her mouth.   Her courage and strength are unremarkable we all learned so much from her. My sister, Laura\u2019s best friend put together an incredible slide show honoring her sister friend of 33 years now she has taken in Laura\u2019s 17 year old son to ensure that he gets a good education and stays on track with his life he is a remarkable young man. At her service he said \u201cI am everything I am because my mother loved me. She educated me, she taught me about music and life, she loved me unconditionally and she led me to God\u201d.  Her husband\u2026well lets just say he has moved on already\u2026   At times I am at peace with her passing because I know that she is not in pain then there are times that I am so overwhelmed with grief that I fight back the tears. I have gotten physically sick to my stomach at times when I think about the fact that she is not here. My heart aches to hear her voice and hear her laughter.   I know that she has her dancing shoes on and I know that she is dancing, smiling, singing and laughing with joy because she is finally healed mind, body and soul\u2026and I know that she is in Heaven.   You would have loved her\u2026   To those of you fighting this battle and for those who have lost a loved one my thoughts and prayers are with you.   Maria   Laura Sunset April 26, 2008 Beloved mother, daughter, wife, sister, and friend...in our hearts forever...",

      "Content": "Thanks for the info. I just went to see my family doctor and took my mammos with me. He said that he was surprised that the Radiologist wanted to wait since one of the three looked suspicious. The plan is to biopsy everything on Tuesday. Thanks again for writing back, Maria",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a Mammogram done in Oct it came back with a \"suspicious\" growth so they did a sonogram. The Radiologist said that there was a growth but she wanted to watch it. I mentioned a friend of mine with stage IV Breast Cancer that had metastasized but the Radiologist who was also a doctor insisted that we just watch this growth. A few weeks ago I felt a lump under my left arm and finally went to see my GYN last week. After she did another Breast exam she re-read the notes from the Radiologist and recommended that I have a biopsy done especially since my lymph node was involved. She said that the surgeon would most likely remove the entire lymph node. To be honest I thought that the lymph node was the lump in my breast but after doing some reading it appears that there must be two separate masses am I correct? The GYN also mentioned that I have two smaller lumps at 3:00 that were not there during the mammogram or the sonogram and they appear to be in line with the larger lump. Can anyone tell me if it sounds like there may be two different masses or can the lymph node be in the middle of the breast about two-three fingers away from the areola. The more I research the more confused I am getting. Thanks, Maria",
