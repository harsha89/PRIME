    "Content": "Dear Mathew, I would seek a second opinion if I were you. And maybe a third. It is scarey when you don't have a clue as to what may be happening in your body. I pray that everything is fine with you. Don't let your fears dominate you. Sttress can bring on alot of symptoms that may make you think that you have something more serious. Please seek the opinions of at least 2 more good and reperable doctors first. See what the 2 out of 3 have to say. Let me know what happens. You are in my prayers. Linda",
