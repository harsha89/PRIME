      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy last Friday and went for my post-op visit with the surgeon today.  He told me that the lymph nodes are clear of cancer but not all the tissue around the cancer in my left breast.  It is suppose to be a slow growing 1.5 cm. cancer.  I am completely shocked with the outcome. My husband and I could not believe the news, and I think the surgeon himself was a little surprised.  I am due for another surgery next week and hopefully radiation after that.  Has anyone out there had more than two lumpectomys????    I am 67 years old and still in shock.  Thanks for any info,  Monika       ",

      "Content": "Good Morning, I went to see my oncologist for the first time yesterday, he was recommended by my surgeon.  I had two lumpectomies within 4 weeks. The oncologist want to have a oncotypedx test done to determine which treatment is the best way to go.  I was under the assumption that I  just needed radiology and I am done.  Now he is throwing in the  possibility of chemo, which scares the heck out of me because of so many side effects, not so much the hair loss part but all the other stuff. I would like to hear from anyone who has heard about this oncotypedx testing, I know it is fairly new.  Thank you and god bless",

      "Content": " Hi Bookmum, It sounds like are not going through a good time in your life and I hope that all goes well with your husband also.  When it rains it pours and you can certainly attest to that. Thanks for all the info and I will certainly get The Shack, I know I will find plenty of time to read once everything gets started.    Lots of good luck to your and your family.

      "Content": "Hi,  Yes, I had the oncotypedx test done in December. I was fortunate and my score was a 6, so I started the radiation treatment in January. A 26 is very high, and if I were you I would most definitely have the chemo and the radiation after that.  My oncologist had told me that anything over a 15 he would recommend both and you are much higher then that.  We are lucky that they gave us the option to take this this test.  So please listen to your doctors. Let me know what you decide and I hope and pray that all goes well for you.    ",
