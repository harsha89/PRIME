    "Content": "My suggestion would be to look into alternative treatments.  They do not cause the body harm....like conventional treatment often does.   Supplements, exercise, etc that help your immune system.  It will allow the body's pre-programmed processes to help extend your life.  I was diagnosed in '02 breast cancer w/node involvement but estrogen negative at age 52.  Did NOT do radiation or chemo as suggested b/c I saw what it did to my husband.  He was diagnosed at 42 with cancer given 2 years to live (no treatment available already advanced to his lungs) and lived 12 years!  I asked him what he wanted to do the rest of his life, as we drove home from Johns Hopkins where we again heard THERE WAS NO TREATMENT.  He said., \"live in the mountains\".  SO, we dropped out, moved to WV, camped, canoed, biked, hiked and built a beautiful house in the mountains overlooking a river.  In other words we enjoyed our lives and put cancer out of our minds.  LIVE A DAY AT A TIME...that is REALLY all you have for sure. MY MESSAGE IS LIVE YOUR LIFE....don't let cancer scare you.   It is not going to kill you by tomorrow.  If fact, after all the treatment, you may just step off the curb and get hit by a MACK truck! Now, I do eat right, exercise, take suppliements, particularly enzymes, vitamin C, vitamin E, green drinks, buffer ph, COq10, things that I have learned over the years help my immune system.  I still have cancer.  The particial lumpectomy done in 2002, did it for awhile.  However, l do have a lump under my arm now that is getting bigger. I did got to Duke this past Nov. thinking maybe there is a \"targeted\" therapy but there is none.  I had not seen a doctor for over 5 years! Again, I got the chemo and radiation treatment talk, but I feel fine.  I work full time, enjoy the beach..(moved 3 years ago) and just refuse to take treatment that will make me sick. Good luck, Candi",
