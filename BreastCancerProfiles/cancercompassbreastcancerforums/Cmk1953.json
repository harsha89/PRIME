      "Content": "I also have stage 111 with pos.nodes, Had a Ct that showed lesions on liver. They did a ultrasound and showed a cyst with two other lesions but no cancer. Your doctor should order more tests and get a tumor marker blood count. Don't be discouraged, sometimes set backs are part of this journey of Breast Cancer, keep a positive attitude.",

      "Content": "Yes it does travel unfortunately and sometimes is can be crippling. My foot surgery had nerve injury to the left heel when they took out a bone spur. That lead to the RSD and then pain management at University Hospital Jacksonville, Fl.It seems to get worse after any new injury and in 2001 I injured my left finger and when they tried to correct by doing surgery on my finger the tigger sent hot pain to my left hand. Not I am dealing with RSD on the left side of my body. I cannot use stairs due to the pain, and now with the Mastectomy, right breast, last Sept. the pain can be difficult at times. The pain management can help relieve pain but in some people it can be worse. Try to find a pain doctor who knows about RSD. Back in 1991 there weren't alot of doctors who dealt with pain management.Now they are in tune with us. It is nice to know that someone else is out there dealing with Breast Cancer and RSD at the same time. Let me know what happens, God speed, Colleen",

Now I have breast cancer and my rsd is acting up again due to all the chemo drugs and my immune system not responding well. There is a rsd site www.rsdhope.org that can give you some answers. Good luck colleen",

      "Content": "Hello, I am in the middle of Chemo treatments. I had four cycles of A/C and now two of Taxotere. They stopped giving me my treaments due to the fact that I woke up 4 days later with swelling of the face and tongue. I hate when I have to stop and start again it is very stressful and now I have to see what they will give me next. Anyone out there who had a disruption on treatments? I heard taxotere was the best to fight recurrence,since I have stage 111 with 2 pos.nodes.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your healthful comments on your side effects. I did receive steroid treatment but not enough mg. I guess. They said that my Chronic hive outbreaks contribute to the effects of the drug. I don't like taking steroids because your body gets dependent on them. They put weight on you and then with all the immune problems with the Chemo Drug no wonder we have toenails that bleed and fall off and edema that causes us not to want to go anywhere. I did want the best treatment for my cancer but if I had to go back with more of this drug I would not do it. I am in the process of Radiation now and who knows what the side effects on my skin will be because my onocologist still wants me to take the Decadron for allergy reactions. I will see what tommorrow brings.",

      "Content": "Mary, I have just read your message and wondering why they shouldn't give you anything you need. Although Ct scans are micro, they can see other parts of your organs. This was the case for me last month when I went into get a chest Ct after my lumpectomy. They found densities on my liver, so they did a sonogram and found cysts not cancer at this point. Plus the markers were low, so I insisted to get a whole body scan after my chemo and radiation next spring. Doctors want to use their own protocol when it comes to treatment, but in my case I have gone through 3 surgeries, stage 1 to now stage 3 because some doctor didn't give me a test I needed 2 yrs. ago. So I agree with the woman who says it is your body and if you want to get a scan even if it means something else comes out of it, then scream at your doctor until he or she listens. Life is too precious God speed Colleen",
