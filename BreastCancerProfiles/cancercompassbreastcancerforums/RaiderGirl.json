Hope u are doing better. I call it the \"beautifully brave\" syndrome. I have been sliced, diced , fried and filled with chemicals. I think its ok to be a little unhappy about it. I hear often that it is important to stay positive. That is a bunch of malarkey. It has been proven that the suppression of feelings causes stress which in turn causes all kinds health issues.  So if you miss  how your hair was, just say so. Missing what you lost does not mean you are ungrateful for your life. It means you had to endure a great deal of changes for the sake of life and those changes are difficult. I cry alone for a few minutes everyday. Then I force myself to shake it off and move on but I AM going to cry. I have good reason, so much is changed and I miss the old me. I wish you the best.",

But they dont know for certain unless there is a biopsy. When(if) the biopsy comes back clear for cancer you will probably have another mammogram is 6 months to see if those calcifications changed. I was diagnosed with stage 2 ductal carinoma on July 28 2014. I cried from the moment I had the biopsy to day of surgery. I was in distress and panic. My husband helped me one night by addressing each fear one by one. I can tell you that happily the things I feared the most did not happen to me. I am now over treatment and healing well. Its easy for me to say, hard for you to do but try to be calm, now that what is already is and that may just be nothing at all.  I wish the best for you.",

I will share with you what my dear husband said to me when I was diagnosed. He said \" I am certain that along the way I am going to say or do something really stupid. I am certain that I will not recognize your needs, I am certain that I can not possibly know that it feels like to be you. I ask of you to not shut me out, to tell me plainly what you need and want, to forgive me for my shortcomings and also remember that I need your love and support just as certainly as you need mine.\" Everything he said is true. One night I was in such a state if despair , fear desperation and he helped me by addressing each fear one by one.  I think its important for you to know that the menopause she is experiencing is not normal , healthy menopause. This is a nuclear, turbo-charged, mutant menopause. Tamoxifin stops the bodies ability to use estrogen. Estrogen is a womens \"feel good\" hormone. She sadly has  none of the benefits. Ask her MD if he can Rx Effesor, its an antidepressant that will reduce the hot flushes. Also ask if she can take something like Activan, which is a mild calming medication. She needs more than will power, she needs medical help. She is suffering. Your post was heart breaking and I see sincere. You said you became fraustrated and spoke w/o thinking, that you did not mean to hurt her feelings. You said you feel you failed her. Tell her that. exactly like that. The mere fact that you feel that you failed and that you fear you can not change it proves that you are a good, caring man. Go pat yourself on the back and talk to your wife.",
