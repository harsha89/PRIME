    "Content": "I had radiation on my left breast nine years ago for 6 weeks after a lumpectomy to remove my cancerous tumor.  Within a year, it resulted in so much scar tissue that it caused pain which mimicked a heart attack.  They even admitted me into a hospital overnight for testing because the pain was so intense but it was just the scar tissue from the radiation on my left breast and not my heart.  Three years later, I had to have a mastectomy of my left breast because of this intense pain and because I would never know if I was really having a heart attack because of the pain from the scar tissue from the radiated breast. I also opted for reconstruction at that time.  However, since then, my reconstructed breast shrunk to half the size of my other breast.  I was told that this can occur when a breast is radiated and then later is reconstructed.  As for the tingling in the arm, I also suffered with that for about five years. I personally would never get radiation again.  If the cancer should show up in my right breast, I would have a mastectomy and not a lumpectomy which requires radiation.  However, everyone is different and I do know several women who did not have scar tissue (or arm tingling) and thus their recuperation was far better.  Good luck!",
