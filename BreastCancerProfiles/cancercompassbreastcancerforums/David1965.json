She had a lumpectomy, radiations and chemo over ten years ago and her annual mammograms have all been negative(she had one two weeks ago). To make a long story short, while we were intimate recently I smelled cancer near her left breast ( my mom had breast cancer, and I will never forget the smell) She is going to get and ultrasound, probably within the month, but other than that is not taking me seriously. I am very upset about this. Am I over-reacting? I care deeply for my partner and don't want to lose her. Does anyone have any input? Yes you can smell cancer. My partner had a sour wine like smell. I deep cleaned the bedroom and replaced bedding pillows and everything that I could think of because I was not sure where the smell was coming from. I did not want to say anything that would embarrass my partner and I knew he took at least two showers per day. The smell did not go away. This went on until about one year later he began to bleed while at work. I met him at the doctors office. I asked if he was in pain he said no, that he just started bleeding and called his doctors and they wanted him to come into their office immediately. He was diagnosed with inoperable colorectal cancer within a few days after test results came in.",
