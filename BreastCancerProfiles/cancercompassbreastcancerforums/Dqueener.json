    "Content": "I have just been diagnosed and I'm considering the diep procedure on both breasts. I am encouraged with all the comments here, however I noticed they are all several years old. I would be interested to hear from those posters as to their satisfaction with their breasts years after the procedure. Would also like to hear from current patients as well. Thanks in advance. Btw my procedure will take place at Vanderbilt in Nashville .",
