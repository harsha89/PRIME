    "Content": "Hello, I am 3 years out from Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in the right Breast. I had 2 lymph nodes affected. I chose a double mastectomy because my left breast had suspicious areas that needed to be watched.  Anyway, all during my chemo and now 3 years later I have consistently had a high CEA level.  Just last month it came down to 9, but will probably jump up again.  I have just finished with CT/Scan, Bone Scan, and in 2 days will have another PET Scan.  My oncologist is somewhat puzzled.  Everything so far shows no cancer.  I also am diagnosed with R/A, Osteoarthritis,Sjogren's Syndrome and now Discoid Lupus.  I am just wondering if any of these other conditions could affect my CEA level.  My Oncologist hasn't really seemed too interested in these other conditions.  He lives and breathes cancer!  Does anyone know if this is possible?",
