Thanks. Maryann  Hi Maryann, Congratulations on getting through the radiation. Do not be alarmed - a lot of people have problems after radiation.  The pins and needles sensation should go away with time, as your nerves have a chance to heal.  Consistent dosing with a complete B complex vitamin might do a lot to help speed that along.  Just remember that nerves heal at a slower rate than flesh, so be patient.  Also, talk to your dr - ask them what they recommend to decrease discomfort.  (You might also get responses from others who have been through this and found solutions that worked for them.) As to the lumps and bumps, radiation is VERY hard on both the lymph system and the immune system - you may be retaining lymph fluid in your breasts and that can feel pretty lumpy.  Some women find that their breasts are much more fibrous after treatment. Also, you may find that as a result of the radiation, your breasts are more sensitive to hormones, caffeine and some other foods that can cause lumpy breast tissue. Plus there is bound to be scar tissue that will feel lumpy and bumpy. To be on the safe side, make an appt with the dr, and get a breast exam, find out for sure if that's all this is.  Ask the dr to take a little bit of time teaching you how to examine your breasts - especially teaching you how scar tissue feels compared to normal tissue, and the characteristics of  fibrous densities that may have come about because of the treatment. I also recommend you purchase a copy of Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th edition, and start reading. Lots of very valuable information there on what to expect after treatment, and how to take care of yourself to promote optimum breast health (as well as spiritual and emotional health.) Sincerely, Tre  I am only at ten of 25 treatments and have ten to fifteen lumps that hurt a lot the size of nickels and line lumps on the side of were my breast was and the line and needles thing already started I also have to a of pain every am when I wake all over my body. I did get cinr chemo induced neurogical radioaparhy misspelled sorry. And that was effective g my hands to my shoulders and my feet to my hips that seems to be a bit much. I told the docs after my first taxol chemo session I have terrible pain in my legs and arms like my bone were gonna explode and they said it was normal I had the second treatment of taxol and it was worse I could hardly move and the third one was tragic and they finally said I had enough when I said I couldn't feel my hands and feet. I was making dolls all day everyday to keep my mind off the cancer and thought the pain was from doing that too much. But it wasn't it was the chemo. Now it won't go away. My questions are why am I getting the hard lumps so soon why do they hurt so bad and what am I gonna do about the neuropathy thanks for any help. Oh I already have fubromialgia, sciatica , Austio arthritis, degenrative disc disease, had fractured my hip and lower back have chronic Lower back pain and partial paralaysis of both lower legs I can't spell what the name of it is starts with an r raidodicularpatjy ?? And a lot of other things I am disabled",
