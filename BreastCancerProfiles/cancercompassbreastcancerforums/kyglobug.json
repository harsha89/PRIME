    "Content": "While many post reports of bad or noticeable side effects from Arimidex, I have actually had none, over the last 5 years, except for a small amount of weight gain, which I control with a low sugar way of eating.  But now, it is time for me to discontinue taking the medication, per my oncologist, and I am awash in new fears of recurrence.  While I had a bilateral mastectomy, no lymph involvement, and later total hysterectomy, I do not feel safe; however, I don't want fear to rule my life.  My mother has been taking it for 11 years - she never had surgery, and Arimidex actually caused her large tumor to shrink to almost nothing.  The oncologist says there is a reason for her to be on it, but the long term risks outweigh the possible benefits for continuing past 5 years for me.  Has anyone else faced this issue?  I know I am lucky -- no recurrence/no bad effects/fairly small chance of recurrence.  But I hate to give up my \"safety net\" of this drug therapy. ",
