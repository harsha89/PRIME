God bless you for responding. My wife had a port implanted approx. one month ago. her chemo will start in one week. she is very unhappy with the way it feels. if you would email her she may be able to help, you are not the only one: but the medical staff seem to make you feel that way.I hope finding someone with the same problem will help you.",

So much for the clowning idea?  It will have to be put on another burner for now. Jodie areyou her2 pos 3+ ? herceptin responds to the 3+ much better. If you had your test using IMC staining ask for FISH test. this will give you a better result.make sure you are 3+, if not ask your dr for other treatment ops. I pray you have better luck with this.I can give you case study info to support this",
