Hi, I started on Femara in January by the first of March I could not move from so much joint pain, I was swithed to Aromasin and after several weeks I started feeling so much better with just a few mild joint pains but now for the last 4 weeks, it all seems to be back, my knees hurt espescially my right, it makes cracking noises and my fingers ache, my thumbs , my left thumb sounds like I have bone on bone moving it. I can barely walk,  I will call my oncologist tomorrow , but wonder if I will be able to feel better on any of these.
