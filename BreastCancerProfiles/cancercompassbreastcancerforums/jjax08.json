      "Content": "All...I've tried Femara, Arimidex, and now have been on Aromasin for over 2 years.  I had joint pain as well as neuropathy.  The joint pain was nearing unbearable about 18 months ago so I decided to try accupuncture to relieve the pain.  It worked!  The very first treatment only lasted about 24 hrs., but I knew there was something to it.  I had to go 2X/week for a few weeks, but after the 6th treatment, it really lasted.  Over time I was able to use it to just ward off the pain and only went once a month.  Currently I have not been in 2 months and the joint pain has not returned. (I only stopped going due to an accident whereby I am recovering from a severely broken leg.)  Anyway, I would highly recommend accupuncture for pain relief.  It is so much better than taking yet another chemical medicine that you don't know what new side affects will result. Good luck to all.",

      "Content": "After taking Aromasin for about 4 months I was researching other side affects and came across this discussion.  Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories as I wasn't sure if I was the only one having bizarre side affects.  My oncologist just shakes his head when I complain of the severe neuropathy in my hands (yes, it awakens me at night from the pain) and what is going on with my feet? I had taken Arimidex first (about 4 mos.) and couldn't stand the bone pain in my legs...could barely walk.  Switched to Femara and lasted about a year on that until the pain in my feet and joints became too much.  Aromasin is my last choice for an AI which my doc says I need to be on for another 3 years!  My sympathies to all but at least we are not crazy and we are not alone.  I just hope these drugs haven't permanently caused harm to my nervous system and joints.  And thanks for mentioning vision changes.  I thought that was a problem with my contacts.  Does anyone have any more info. about that?  Should I change my prescription or wait it out?",
