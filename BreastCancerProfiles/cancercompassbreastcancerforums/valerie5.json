    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and removal of a node in February 2014. On the recommendation of a cancer care forum I bought a Bravado-silk-seamless-nursing-bra from John Lewis in the UK costing £30. It was perfect for the purpose. I am a size 36D and needed a bra that was soft and comfortable but gave good support. The Belvia stretchy vest type bras were not supportive enough and all the sports bras I tried were far too tight and would press on the sore area after an operation. The Bravado bra was perfect it was comfortable enough to wear all day and night which is what I was advised to do after the lumpectomy. It also gave good support whist the wound was healing. Any movement of the wound is painful initially and this bra gave very good support without digging in or rubbing. This bra is sold in small, medium, large and extra large sizes I would recommend if you buy one that you make sure that it is large enough. The manufacturer showed medium was appropriate for a 36D bust measurement on the box. This was too small I needed a large. For a few days after the operation I also needed to add an extension to the back strap to accommodate the slight swelling and wound dressing. The extensions can be bought in large M&S stores in the UK. I also found this bra very comfortable to wear during the radiation treatment period. Please note that if you buy a light coloured one it will show stains from the felt tipped marker pens that the radiotherapist use. These are difficult to wash out. I don't know what I would have done without this bra it made the recovery period a great deal more comfortable and helped provide the support I needed to aid the healing.  ",
