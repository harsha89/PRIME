    "Content": "I have been taking the Arimidex since August 2010. For me the side effects were not as bad as Tamoxifin. Since being diagnosed in 2008 and having two separate mastectomies and a prophalyctic hysterectomy in 2010(where they found ovarian cancer) I have taken tamoxifin, femara, and now arimidex. what I have taken for the leg pain and cramps is oste-biflex once a day, plus caltrate ,and 1000 units of vitamin d. Its not for everyone, but after chemo my vitamin d levels were very low and are just starting to become normal. This has helped a lot with the leg pains. The only other real problem I have is headaches every morning when I wake up.  Good luck to you. I hope this helps a little.    ct",
