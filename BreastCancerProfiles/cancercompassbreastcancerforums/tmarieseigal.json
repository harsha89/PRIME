      "Content": "Hello: I had early breast cancer and had a lumpectomy in 2009.  shortly after I found out it spread to my bones and had cancer in the uterus.  Had a full hysterecomy and all seemed fine.  Just recently I had thyroid cancer and had to have that removed.  Now after another pet can my cancer is in my right hip.  I will be starting radiation and will start taking Afinitor and aromasin.. I started aromasin last week, I seem to be ok.  I just got the Afinitor approved and will start that drug tomorrow.  I am a little nervous about taking this one since there is a long list of side effects.  I starting a new job next week and I want to be at my best.  Has anyone here have had any experience with this drug for breast cancer??",
