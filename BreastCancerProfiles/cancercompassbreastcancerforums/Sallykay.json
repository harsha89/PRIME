      "Content": "Hi Bette, My name is Sally and I'm from Texas. I am on my 7th cycle of Xeloda 1500 mg twice a day on a week off a week. I am experiencing the problems with the hand foot syndrome too. I am interested in the name of the cream your doctor gave you. I have sensitivity in my finger tips and the soles of my feet. Places on my feet turn bright red and feel feverish when I am standing or walking for very long. I have had some fatigue but the fatigue is a lot worse this time. I am going to ask my doctor about the Adderall. I use to take Adderall when I taught. I am now retired and have not needed it. But if would help the fatigue I would like to give it a try. Thanks so much for sharing your information. I am brand new to this site and am not sure how to find others who have similar problems. Sally from TX",
