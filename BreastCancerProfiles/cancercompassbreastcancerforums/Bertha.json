Then I feed drained the rest of the day and tired. My doctor thinks I am a hypocondriact. But thes symtoms are real. I have even had a kidney infectection. My cousin had been taking this for 4 years and her intestine got infected from all the medicine.It started to eat away at it. She died 2 months after the removal of her intestine. Have you hear any thing about that? I also had a kidney infection, I had to go to a second Dr. for that.Because the oncologist only takes bood work, My white counts are always low. Do you know if that is normal.",
