    "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your aunt.  I have inflammatory breast cancer.  I had chemo first to reduce the size of the tumor, then had surgery to remove both breasts.  Now I am doing radiation.  My cancer was a stage IV.  Since doing chemo the tumor in my liver has disappeared.  Chemo was a great benefit.  I only got sick two evenings after the first treatment.  After the other 11 treatments I did great.  I was afraid of the side effects before I started but the benefit far outweighed not doing the chemo. ",
