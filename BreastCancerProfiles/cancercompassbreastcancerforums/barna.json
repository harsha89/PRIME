Did you have a mastectomy, chemo or radiation as treatment?  Did you follow any specific diet after treatment? How many cm. was your original mass?  Any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",

It took me over a year before I actually spoke to anyone else who had this because of its rarity. The National Cancer Institute will send you info from the Textbook of Rare Cancers if you request it from them and there is a website at http://www.metaplasticbreastcancer.org Hope this helps! ",

The radiologist can tell from the ultrasound and mammogram if these lumps are suspicious.  If you want 110% peace of mind have the doctor send you for an MRI of your breast.  It is a simple screening, and it will see anything the size of a pin head. Push the doctor, he will send you for the MRI b/c of the breast pain.  Your medical insurance has to cover it. Unfortunately, breast tumors CAN be painful.I had constant pain in my left breast and was diagnosed as having a triple negative metaplastic(not metastatic) tumor with a sarcoma. However, I will say that the mammogram and the ultrasound were suspicious and I was sent for a biopsy. I have also communicated with others with this diagnosis and they also experienced pain. I delayed getting a mammogram for several months after the pain started thinking that it couldn't be breast cancer because of the pain---I was wrong.",
