    "Content": "I found a lump in my left breast in October and went straight to the doctor since it runs in my family. He ordered a mammogram and ultrasound, I had that done at the beginning of Dec and then was sent to a surgeon because one of my lumps ( I have several in my left breast) had a shadow and was fairly good size.  I have a biopsy done last Friday and am very bruised and sore. Even under my arm is sore. The surgeon called me yesterday afternoon late and said that the lump he removed came back benign but things aren't lining up with what he saw on the mammo's and ultrasound. He now wants to do a lumpectomy after another mamogram and ultrasound next week. He said he was fully thinking the lump he biopsied was going to come back as carsinoma. The lump he biopsed wasn't the one that my ob/gyn was concerned about. He told me not to worry , to let him worry. But as I look online about stuff for lumpectomys it says that it is usually followed by 6 weeks of radiation.  Can anyone offer some advice , been thru this or know someone that's been thru this same thing?   Thanks!!",
