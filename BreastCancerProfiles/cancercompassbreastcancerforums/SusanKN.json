    "Content": "Oh gosh-- I've been on Femara, Arimadix and now Aramasin.  At first my oncologist said it was my thryroid, etc and I changed oncologists.  The new onc gets it.  I'm 57 with invasive lobular carcinoma and was very healthy.  I instantly turned into a 90 year old and at first had my hips x-rayed, then my wrist and then my ankle....they hurt so bad I cried at night.  Nothing broken but my spirit!  I'm two years clean and my husband and I have just finished 6 weeks in the Colorado mountains--hiking fourteeners, and moderate mountains every other day.  Its the first time in two years that I've felt good.  I'm also on Herbal-Life's Advanced Joint vitamins and I'm not pain free, but am much closer to feeling my age!!!  I just have to figure out how to work out this aggressively when we return to our home in AZ... hiking, swimming, weight training.... Ladies don't give up!!!!",
