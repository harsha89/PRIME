    "Content": "I began taking Arimidex in late June and from the beginning had a constant headache, very slight so I didn't worry too much. Then the bone pain started and got worse very quickly. My oncologist wanted me to switch to \"something else\" right away but I was determined to stay on the Arimidex if I possibly could, so he put me on a short course of Vicodin for the pain to see if the side effects would lessen over the next 6 weeks. I had been feeling tired and not sleeping but thought it was the effects of the Vicodin. I'm hardly taking any and now have become seriously depressed. This past weekend I had a major meltdown, crying uncontrollably and barely able to function - depressed and sleeping every minute I could slip into bed. I called his office and he told me to stop taking the Arimidex immediately and come in to see him, so I'm sure he'll replace it with something else. I'm terrified to stop it, as he told me it was the best option to keep my cancer from recurring (my mother died in May from metastatic breast cancer), but I couldn't go on the way I've been. Has anyone had to switch from Arimidex, and if so to what and how are you doing on your new medication?",
