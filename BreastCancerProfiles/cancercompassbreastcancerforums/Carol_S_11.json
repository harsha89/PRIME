The cancer had spread to one lymph node.I had eight months chemo followed by 15 radium treatments. Apart from an abcess on the operation site, I managed the treatment quite well. (Even the cold cap which I found very painful, but I kept my hair.) My problem now is the awful pain in my joints due to the Arimadex.I know there are a lot of people out there with this problem, but I am finding it hard to cope. I have tried various methods of pain control without success, and at present am on a high dose of slow release Tramadol, but it makes little difference. I wonder if anyone has tried either acupuncture or hypnosis for alleviating pain. I am a 5 year breast cancer survivor.  I was also on Arimidex for 5 years.  I started off with headaches and they went away.  Then maybe a year later I had joint and muscle pain.  I am 58 and would feel 88.  I am off Arimidex now and I still have pain, but I think it is slowly leaving my body.  Try 1,000 mg. of Vitamin D every day.  This seems to help.  It is becoming very popular.  I would lay off the Tramadol if it doesn't make a difference.  Use 2 Aleve.  That may help.",
