      "Content": "   I need some advice. I have fybrosistic breasts and it is very difficult to notice any lumps because they are already very lumpy, but I have been told that if it is hard and pea size to check it right away. My problem is that for the past year  I have noticed my upper right armpit with lumps. They get swollen and are painful 2weeks before my period starts. After they reduce in size and but do not completely dissaper. I have informed my obgyn and family physician and both give no concern about it, they can't even feel the lumps. They just say the same thing reduce your about of coffee and caffeine, but the lumps are starting to bother me more and more and I'm getting very scared. Please any advice would be appreciated.",
