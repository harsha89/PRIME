    "Content": "Ach, Seriously? I have had breat cancer twice and could totally live the rest of my life w/o seeing it again (please God) but my hair this time is awful. I am 58...do I really have to wear a wig the rest of my life? I think it was coming in thin on top and top back before I even started my Arimidex which we switched to Exemestane to see if that would help...didn't at all. So, it is so thin on top that you can see the orb of my scalp through the hair. Then there is the huge extremely thin area at the top back which men call a Bishop's cap. I got it. Last time I did chemo my hair came back just as it was before. I used to be a hairdresser so it may be even more painful. Has anyone experienced this and is there a solution?",
