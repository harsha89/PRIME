I had a reoccurence of breast cancer after 14 yrs.!  In 1989 I had BC & had a mastectomy, reconstruction & 6 mos. chemo. It also put me in menopause at 41 yrs. Then I didn't take any drugs after that and was ok for 14 yrs. until 2003. I found a small bump near my sternum & yes, it was BC again - a tumor near my implant and it had also spread to my sternum bone.  So I went thru 8 mos. of chemo & 6 wks. radiation. Then I started taking Femara (both times the BC was estrogen positive.)  I have many side effects from Femara: bone pain, joint pain, lower back pain, weight gain, and lots more wrinkles then ever, plus it made my cholesterol go up!  (I am now 59).   At first my oncologist was going to put me on it for 5 yrs. but now he said he's leaving me on it indefinitely since it's keeping the cancer away. I was surprised when he said that but then again, I do want to stay on it if it keeps me safe. Of course I know there are no guarantees with this disease but at least Femara is what we have now to help us.  As far as the side effects you are having now, all I can say is that they probably will subside as your body readjusts  to the drug. But also be prepared for new ones to pop up ... I also have been taking Fosamax to prevent osteoporosis (it's a once a week pill with no side effects) and trying to exercise more which helps with the stiffness I seem to have all the time. But overall, even tho the side effects aren't pleasant, I am still here !!!!!  I hope I have helped you a little bit. Do write back if you'd like.    HadiaDear Hadia, Thank you for sharing info.  I quit smoking and started walking and jogging at the same time I started Femara.  I guess with so many different things popping up at one time, didnt know what caused what.  My feet are sore when I first get up.  My wrist and one thumb.  My back is also stiff.  Had adverse reaction from calcium supplement,quit taking that.  A large tendon in my arm has popped up to the surface, and is somewhat sore.  I should be thankfull that my cancer was treatable.  Guess emotionally I will stable out.  Or maybe start taking something to make me feel less stress.  I have also put on 8 lbs.  I have dieted my whole life, and now I cant lose any weight.  I am just maintaining my weight.  Kimarie      I also take femara.  For 3 years. Really frustrated at the belly fat.  HELP!!!!  I am 50 and I was always thin.  Lumpectomy and radiation in 1996, tamoxefin, then cancer came back in 2003.  Had mastectomy and chemo, now taking femara.  Just don't feel like me.  Happy to be surviving, trouble accepting the weight gain.  Feel like its my fault but it could actually be the femara and I am blaming myself endlessly!!!!  Do you have this problem?",
