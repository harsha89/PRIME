Sorry, let's try this again.Contradulations on your perfectly clear mammo and normal pap!  Good luck with the biosy next week.  I had a cervical biopsy about a year ago, not so bad.  What I failed to mention in the introduction is that 4 days after the lumpectomy I had a total hysterectomy (no cancer detected but glad it is all gone).  This is why Arimidex was recommended. I really trust my Oncologist, I think I just got overwhelmed.  Thank you for your incouragement.  You will be in my prayers.  You R1 Too  ",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, This is my first posting.  I have never done anything like this in my life, but then I never had cancer before either.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in January '07,  a lumpectomy in February, and a Sentinal lymph node biopsy in March (which was clear).  From May to June completed 35 radiation treatments.  I have been taking Arimidex for about 8 weeks.  I have the same problems that many here have expressed; pain in hands, back, feet, ankles ect. , problems getting up in the a.m.  Then I read Roz57's message about her positive experience with Aromasin.  It gave me the courage to call my dr. and fess up to the pain.  I was so afraid that one AI would be as bad as the other and the thought of eliminating all of the AI's was way to frightning. I have an appt. with the onc next wednesday.  Thank you Roz57 wherever you are. You R1 Too",
