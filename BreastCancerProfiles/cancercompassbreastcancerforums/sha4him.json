      "Content": "Kim, I to have idc age 45.  I often can't sleep, (I think its the tamoxifen) but I am glad I can pray for you.  When fear wants to grip me and I have turned to The Word...you have my attention, God, what are you saying to me?   Usually he is asking for the load back, because he never looses. I can't believe all the mini miracles I have been blessed with these past few months...sometimes I have to try and remember some of them and slowly just a bit more peace comes.  Sending you a hug!
