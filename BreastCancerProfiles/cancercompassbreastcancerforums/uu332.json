      "Content": "Hi, As someone that has researched and tried almost every alternative treatment I can say that for me the most effective was spicy food (specifically the scotch bonnet chilli of jamacia- I bought it in powdered form on ebay). I add it to all of my food and also other chillis help like cayenne (not store bought powdered because they irradiate them for shelf life). I would just buy others whole dried and grind them. Within a month making a HUGE dent. All other alternative therapies had very little effect. Also upping natural vitamin c without taking in sweet fruit (such as ripe lime juice in water) really helps for fatigue and pain but didn't make a dent like spicy food-capsaicin in the hot peppers was found at a study at cedars sinai found it caused cancer cell suicide of 80% in prostate cancer. It didn't affect healthy cells. If you have any other questions about alternative therapies I would be glad to answer.",
