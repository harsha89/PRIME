    "Content": "Anyone else using Hoxsey treatment for breast cancer?  I've just started it and am shocked with how quickly it is working.  I have been using natural methods for 5 1/2 yrs for Invasive Ductal Breast Carcinoma but never really 'unhooked' from sugar.  Hoxsey doc convinced me that nothing will work if I keep eating white sugar.  Although I've brought the markers down to a very low point I want zero!!!  Hence I've decided to do what I wanted to do from the beginning - go to the Clinic and get started on the Hoxsey protocol.  Great experience there.  I'm feeling subtle but certain improvements.  Will return for checkup, scan, bloodwork in 3 mos.  Love to hear from others who used this method.  Those folks I met there that are healed had every cancer but breast - just a quirk of that one day, I guess. Happy Healing to All!",
