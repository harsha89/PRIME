I had a lumpectomy for stage 1 node negative breast cancer in my right breast.  I suggest you ask your surgeon about the OncoTypeDX test to determine whether you would benefit from chemo.  They send out a sample of your lump to a lab in Calif.  There is only one in the world that does this type of test at this time.  They will rate the sample as low, intermediate, and high for probability of reoccurrance in 10 years.  If it comes out Low, they will not recommend chemo.  I was on the low end of intermediate so they left it up to me and I decided to do only radiation.  I am 59 years old and the chemo only improved my chances by 3%.  Without chemo my probability of reoccurrance in 10 years is 15%.  The cost is 3,000 but my insurance paid for it.  They will check with your insurance company for you and have steep discounts for those who don't have coverage.  I think it is well worth it.  I had my first radiation treatment today.  I will have 6 weeks, 5 days a week.  I wish you good luck with your journey. Roseann I just got back from my Oncologist and from what he see from my report He feel that I'm at low risk also, but he is sending my sample for the OncoTypeDX for the DNA testing.  He said he would put me on hormone therapy.  I hope the testing comes back low because I would just die if I needed chemo.  But for right now I'm dancing the HAPPY DANCE.Teresa",
