      "Content": "It's terror. I just went through stage 2. I went to 7!doctors. I could not believe in any of them they all did the same horrific treatments. I was given 3 months to start treatments or it would be too late. I read, researched and found a doctor that made sense. He explained THE GREECE BLOOD TEST to me and since insurance DOES NOT cover real cures I continued in a big hurry. Dr.forsyt he in Reno treated me with the Greece results and IPT chemo. I am completely well. I wrote a book about my healing. 174 Pgs I found a tiny hard lump,couldn't find any Dr. That would take it out. They only wanted to do biopsy. The lump was growing so fast while doctors did nothing but send me here and there. I went to CA (I'm in NV) and begged a friend of a friends doctor to take it out. Once it was out I has 3 months. Jumped off of a radiation machine, couldn't go through it! Left 4 different standard of care chemo facilities after seeing the.wither ing women. A sea of balding heads, pain sadness. Looked for the right answers. Suzanne's book gave me a list of Dr.s and the best for me turned out to be Dr. Forsythe in Reno. He understood my time problem and worked with me with great care and speed. I was right to have had the tumor removed, I was right not to have had radiation. I was right not to have standard chemo!!!!! I'm 74, in great health and want to share my cure. It was the hardest job ever. It takes great effort to find YOUR path. Your little voice will know when you find it.",

Bless the heavens!! you are so very smart.  So many test results are \"misread' they wanted to take of my daughters breasts-both!.  Completely wrong.  There was nothing there. I take my book to the canter centers and hand it out hoping to save someone the humilitation and pain that radiation and conventional chemo inflick on countless patients.  Its barbaric and just wrong. You are wonderful, keep spreading the word(s)!!",

These are simple but potent measures. This should keep you in remission. Watch your blood through testing and if anything begins to appear - there are potent measures that will not harm you but will kick the cancer cells. For blood they have some good hyperthemia measures and put the blood through a magnetic process. So much new exciting things out there in corners of the earth that believe in cures.

They seem brainwashed by insurance companies the doctors and the media. All the foundations that seek cures. THE GREECE BLOOD TEST SHOWS THE CURES. IT'S THE HALLS OF KILLING. Going through the beautiful buildings and pretty doctors that might as well have hoods and Axeses. They almost had me talked into the frozen caps to save my hair and wanted me to have psychological counseling since I was resistant to conventional chemo! When being tattooed for radiation I got up from the guerny and ran out the door. I knew I had to run from all standard-of-care treatments. It's all about money. Donations should be for the real cures not the killing halls.",
