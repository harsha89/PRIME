    "Content": "Dear Jan, It seems you are doing all you can. (follow oncologist's prescriptions and finding other ways to strengthen your body). However, if I were you, I would not believe this 1 year or 3/4 years survival thing. Many people have beaten the time limits their doctors gave them. Keep doing all you can for your body (conventional and sensible alternative medicine) but tells your body and yourself you are going to live many happy years (with no limits in minds). I read an interesting book regarding all this but cannot remember the title or author's name. The author is a surgeon that specialized in cancer. Anyway Jan. Have a wonderful new 2004 year and many, many afterwards. Kindly, Concetta",
