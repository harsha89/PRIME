    "Content": "Is anyone taking zoladex shots? And if so, what side effects do you have?I have to take them every 4 weeks. My gyno. has agreed to do a hysterectomy with removal of ovaries, but my oncologist is completely against it and says the zoladex shot will stop the ovaries from producing estrogen. I also take arimidex. Side effects are fatigue and pain. They seem to have gotten worse since i started getting the shot.",
