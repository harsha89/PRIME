    "Content": "I was so glad to read your message before I had radiation, and now that I'm done with it I must tell you that I had no side effects either. A little bit of a sore nipple for a while but used Aquafor and a no-stick gauze pad I picked up at the drugstore and it quickly healed. I feel very sorry for the women who have horrible experiences, what a nightmare on top of a DCIS diagnosis, but for those who may be reading this and are frightened, I'll say it again...it all went very smoothly for me. In fact, I had my last radiation treatment at 7:45 am and flew to Disney World at 10:50 am that same day. Although I will admit to asking for a doctor's note that indicated I couldn't stand in the sun for very long...alleviated some of the wait for the rides. I must tell you I have no guilt about that at all!! What the hell, I had been through 7 weeks of radiation treatment and a lumpectomy, dammit! I deserved a break!! But I had no fatigue (thank God) and in fact I started a rigorous exercise program of walking or biking 10 miles three times a week when I started the treatments. I never really exercised before this. My doctor told me it would help alleviate some of that \"cancerhead\" and just general depression that I had following my diagnosis. And she was right. I have heard that several large breasted and heavy women tend to have horrible experiences with skin reactions but my oncologist told me only 10% of all patients receiving radiation for breast cancer experience side effects. Regardless, if someone does have side effects she told me they can be quite debilitating...but for anyone reading this who may be nervous (and you must be crazy if you aren't nervous!!) just know that many women get through this okay.",
