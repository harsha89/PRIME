    "Content": "Hi - I'm new to this forum, but I also have dense tissue.  History of regular mammograms, but was on watch list due to inverted nipples.  They found lobular carcinoma in March this year when they did a ultrasound followed by an MRI.   Do some online research, but what I have found is that a tumor shows up white on a mammogram and the normal dense tissue is also white.  White on white masks the problem.  I insisted on the MRI -and it showed the lump.  Carcinoma confirmed by surgery in April.  Just finished radiation.  Hope this helps - all the best. ",
