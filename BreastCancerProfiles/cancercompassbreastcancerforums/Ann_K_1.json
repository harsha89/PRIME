      "Content": "I have had a mastectomy for invasive and non-invasive lobular cancer in-situ tumor grade 2. During the surgery a positive lymph node was found in the breast tissue. I did not have sentinel node nor axillary dissection done. I have been on a number of supplements including ellagic Acid, essiac, Indole-3, green Tea and flax seeds. It has been suggested that I take chemo. Four rounds of A-c and four rounds of Taxol. Has anyone out there just used alternative methods instead of the conventional/ I have agreed to take the Arimidex but nothing more. Any information would be appreciated. Thanks, Ann",

The tumor was 95% estrogen receptor positive. merry Christmas and a Joyous New Year. Love, Ann",

      "Content": "I recently had a total mastectomy wtihout the lymph nodes being touched. During the surgery, a lymph node was found in the breast tissue, the surgeon removed it and it was found to be positive. The oncologist suggested axillary dissection, radiation, chemo and tamoxifen and arimidex. I had planned to take Arimidex and fortify this with a macrobiotic diet and supplements. Has anybody had any experience with this? When the biopsy was taken I was told I did not need chemo, now the plan has changed. Any information would be appreciated. Thank you, Ann",
