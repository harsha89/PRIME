    "Content": "I'm stage 4 breast cancer on chemo over 14 months now and I am fine, but my name is Debi, not Tracy, she is my sister who forwarded this site to me. I'm on Taxotere, Hercepton and Zometa. For the first 8 months I was on taxil and Carboplatin. My advice to feeling well and maintaining a normal life while on chemo is to eat well, lots of fruits and veggies and raw stuff, take vitamins even though they tell you not to, keep a positive attitude and most of all, pray alot. Make sure if you go the chemo route you go to the best place. Don't compromise. Ask your doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist to talk things out with an neutral person. Join your local support group, you learn the absolute most from people who have been there. I have 2 children ages 4 & 7 and I refuse to die. I want to see my children through college. In the beginning when I was getting radiation and chemo at the same time, I would take small doses (.25 mg or less) of Xanax to get me by but now I don't even need it. If you want to chat you can email me. God Bless you & take care of yourself.",
