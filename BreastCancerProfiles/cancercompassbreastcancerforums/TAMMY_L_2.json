    "Content": "Hi, I am Tammy - stage 4 breast cancer. I have been fighting for 6 and a half years and I will continue to fight. It's what I have to do, I have one child of her own. I want to be here for that and much more. I am 41 years old and on my fifth chemo. I just finished my third radiation. At this point we all know life is too short. Each day, one at a time, step by step, we will live to fight for a new day. Remember it's worth it. Stay strong, keep in touch with your god, stay true to your self and live each day like it's your first!",
