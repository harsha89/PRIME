      "Content": "We have a family friend, Amy R (maiden name) who is having recurrance of breast cancer and having a complete mastectomy there today.  She is now married and I'm trying to find out her married name.  But in the mean time if there's any way to get a message to her, we would like her and her family to know we are all praying for her.  They lost her brother Jeff to cancer several years ago.  Also, let them know our Mom, Jewel had a R mastectomy yesterday, but no lymph node involvement and she is doing well.  I am a nurse and know with HIPPA you can't tell us anything, but if there's any way possible, we want her to know we are thinking of her and PRAYING for her.  Tell her we love her.  Thanks!",
