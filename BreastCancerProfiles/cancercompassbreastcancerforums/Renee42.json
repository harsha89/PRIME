    "Content": "I am 42 years old and was just found out I have breast cancer.  I do not know the specifics yet.  I do know that I have it in the left breast and my lymph node was positive also. I have an appointment with a oncologist at KU Med. Center on Thurs. I am scared to death that I might have the cancer someplace else also. My back starts hurting and my mind starts telling me I must have cancer in my bones or just all over.  I can't tell you what a nervous wreck I am. My Breast Care Specialist said that I must have aggressive cancer due to the fact that it is already in the lymph node.   A nurse from KU called me and said I will be doing 14-20 weeks of chemo.  I will be having chemo every other week or every third week. She told me they will stop the cancer in its tracks and shrink it so I will not have to have so much removed.  My right breast is clean.  I feel so much after talking to the KU nurse.  She acted like what I had was nothing unusual.  She also told me that if I do have a spot on my rib or lung, they can get it with the chemo.  Anyone else out there in my age bracket in the same boat?  ",
