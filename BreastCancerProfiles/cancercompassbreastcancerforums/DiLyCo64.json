    "Content": "As a 2x breast cancer survivor, I have some insight into this. I think they won't do the double mastectomy because the cancer is already out of the breast tissue. Therefore, the double mastectomy is not likely to change the outcome, plus, it is NOT an easy surgery (I know because I had it). I was a candidate because my cancer was still localized, just in the breast tissue, and surgery was a way to remove all cancerous cells from my body. I had already HAD chemo, and radiation, so I was extremely lucky that when the cancer re-occurred, it JUST showed up in the same breast it was originally in. Surgery is something my doctors only recommended when they were sure the benefits out-weighed the (considerable) risks.",
