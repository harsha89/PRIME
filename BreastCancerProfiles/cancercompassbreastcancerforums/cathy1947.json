    "Content": "I guess I am wondering if anyone out there has gone thru this. Diagnosed with stage 2. Do not need chemo but will be doing radiation. Had one unclear margin. 2nd lumpectomy was to clear that and another margin turned up with pre cancer cells My lymph nodes are clear.3rd lumpectomy is necessary. Am just curious if this is something someone else has been thru",
