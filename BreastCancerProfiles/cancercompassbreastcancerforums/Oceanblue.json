      "Content": "Hi sorry to hear your news.  Five years ago they found a lump in my  breast and everything happened so fast you can barely digest it.  My lump was cancerous and I was stage l cancer.  I had to do 6 months of chemo and could not handle radiation because it was to close to my heart.  I never thought I would make it through all of this and did not really know what I was capable of either.  It makes you very strong but slow down you don't have lots of answers yet.  Maybe the lump is not cancer.  I had one of those as well.  If it is cancer and you need further treatment - not it is not pleasant but you have a long life ahead of you and family I am sure that truly cares about you.  Don't give up ship.  Have your friends support you through all of this - don't say I really don't need anything because you might need their help.  Life is worth living as long as you get back your quality of life. Maybe this is a setback for a short time.  Now I am cancer free for 6 years and just finished tamoxifen for five years and because my cancer was agressive I will be put on   femoura (sp?)  I am so happy to be here.  My husband left because I have two handicap children and I am so happy to have them a part of my life.  No we really don't know what road we will be going down but most of the time there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Hang in, do what you must as it is only a short time of your life and hopefully that got it in time.  Good luck - write anytime.",
