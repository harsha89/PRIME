    "Content": "Can anyone tell us more about this Inflammatory Breast Cancer? Our mom has it and she is only 58 years old. Never sick and one day a lump came up. She had a rash around the right nipple on her breast and it was always itching. She felt for lumps but never felt one. We have heard that the lumps go up and down. Is that true? Well it has been 16 months and she is getting worse every day. She now is on 8-9 different pills a day. Not sure if we change doctors and take her to the Cancer Treatment Center of America if they can help her or not. We need a little direction. If anyone knows about this cancer please let us know. We LOVE our mom very very much and we are not ready to lose her to this.",
