    "Content": "I've been on Arimidex for 2 yrs after lumpectomy/radiation for high grade DCIS. All that was pretty much a non-event; a snap to go through. A few months after starting Arimidex my oncologist said I needed to go to Curves when I complained of weakness. One year of that did nothing to help so I canceled. I can walk just fine, but getting up from a squatting position is impossible without grabbing hold of something. Rising from a chair with a sleeping 20-lb grandbaby is also impossible. Heavy pots are hard to handle in the kitchen. I'd like to stay on it the full 5 yrs to give myself the best possible chance of staying cancer free, and I'm not even sure I can blame Arimidex for my problems. I am 64, after all.",
