      "Content": "Hi. I resorted to alternative treatment with my lung cancer. That was about all I had left. That was in March of 2003. I have been in full remission for more than 4 years now. Check out my web page www.survivingsmallcell.com By the way, I recently received an email from a patient with stage IV breast cancer and mets to the liver and lung. She went to the same clinic I did for alternative treatment, She is now in full remission. Incidentally,  I called the clinic to deliver the good news in case they hadn't heard. They told me that the couple was unbelieving and grumbled the whole time. They are still in disbelief apparently. Well, I guess you can't ever please some people.   Good Luck and God Bless, Jim.   ",
