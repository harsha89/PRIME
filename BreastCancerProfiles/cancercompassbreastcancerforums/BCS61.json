Good Morning - First, take a deep breath.  Second, go get a mammogram.  May not be a cause for alarm, but you need to go. I have the same blackish discharge on my right nipple also.  Had a galactogram (sp) done and all results fine.  Still having discharge after 6 months but they are keeping an eye on it.  I am 49 and was diagnosed around Thanksgiving with Stage 1 breast cancer on the opposite side.  Had lumpectomy and finishing radiation tomorrow.  Do you have any family history?  Please let us know how you are.",
