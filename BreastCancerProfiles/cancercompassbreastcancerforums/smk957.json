      "Content": "I had a bi-lateral Masectomy in June of 2010, a had a few complications (I put too much stress on one side and the stiches came loose).  I had reconstruction at the same time as masectomy and when I had the second set of stretchers put in I got a infection on one side and had to have the stretcher removed.  I am having surgery in May to continue with the reconstruction.  I also would get up in the morning and wonder will I ever feel like myself again and get up in the morning with some thought other than I had cancer!!!  One day I got up was showered and had my make up on (which I haven't been wearing since my first surgery) and was having coffee on my deck with my dogs reading the paper.  I was waiting for my friend to come and we were going shopping and lunch.  As I was sitting there I realized that I felt like me!!!  It was a great day!  I still have some things to go through but I know when this journey is over I will still be \"me\".  It is a long road but well worth it.  I don't regret my decision and I have the most awesome doctors anyone could ask for!! Hang in there, this too shall pass! Hugs and prayers to all battle any illness",
