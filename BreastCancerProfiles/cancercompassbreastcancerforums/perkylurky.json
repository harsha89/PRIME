    "Content": "Hi there! im new to this site.  I too am having the cement hardness in my left breast.  I had stage one lumpectomy in 2008.  Went through the raditation.  Early in 2011, the breast started getting very hard and my nipple sticks straight out. I haven't had any pain with it though.  Again, the doctors don't know what has caused it, but offer no treatment.  Seeing the oncologists again Oct. 5th. My breast is getting larger not smaller.  I'm also in a research program so maybe there is something we can send in for the future of others going through this. ",
