    "Content": "So it has been 2 months since my mother lost her battle with breast cancer. She had been suffering so bad the last 3 months that at first it was a relief that she wasnt hurting anymore. Now I have come to the realization that she is gone. Some days are good but most are bad. She was 59 and had a pretty tough life. She was a beautiful woman both in and out and didnt deserve the hand that she was dealt.  It pains me to think about the fact that she knew she was dying. I could never muster the courage to ask her how she felt about it. Even though we knew and we think she knew she was dying we never spoke about it because we always held out hope. now I wish we had asked her. She was just starting to enjoy her life again having beaten cancer twice when it returned. My sister and I both have young children that my mother adored. Every waking moment she thought about them and it was like the cancer took a backseat. I cant believe my daughter, who is 18 months, will never know her Nana. Everytime I think about that i break down. She loved her grandkids so much and all she wanted to do was see them grow and prosper. Im sure Im not the only person who is dealing with these issues. I would love to hear from others who have gone through this or are going through this to see how you are coping.  For now I try to smile and keep reminding myself she is in a better place. I just hope she can see my daughter and enjoy her now.",
