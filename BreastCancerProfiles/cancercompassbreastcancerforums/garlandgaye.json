      "Content": "I just had a double-mastectomy and breast reconstruction 3 weeks ago after being diagnosed with breast cancer. My plastic surgeon who did the reconstruction is concerned about the lymphedema in my breasts, one much worse than the other. My breast is hard as a rock and swollen. He, too, said I have to \"wait and see,\" as \"the body will eventually take care of it.\" He said gravity is part of the problem, so a vacation in space would be helpful (for those of you too serious out there, he was joking of course). I have had FIVE surgeries in that breast over a 30-year period (3 breast biopsies, 1 reduction, and the latest). He said every incision ever made in that breast is certainly part of the problem with the \"flow\" of the lymph channels. He has warned me much about the possible dangers of infection because of the lymphstasis, and has told me to call him night or day if I have fever, redder/hotter/more swollen breasts. He said infections can be very dangerous and that I can't wear any kind of bra that would be tight-fitting - and certainly not an underwire. I can't even imagine having a bra ON with this edema in my breast. I'm extremely uncomfortable. I'm wondering if sitting at a computer half the day when I return to work this week is going to aggravate the condition. I'm going to check into the lymphatic massage, but I AM going to talk with my surgeon about this possibility before I proceed to the nearest lymphatic massage mobile! Thanks for all your insights regarding this problem. Gaye",
