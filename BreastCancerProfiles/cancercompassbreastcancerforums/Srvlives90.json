      "Content": "My mom has breast cancer. She tells me not to worry, but i can't help it. Being the oldest male in the family, i am kinda the man of the house even tho i am several hundred miles away from her. She always took care of me and i just want to make sure she is gonna be ok. I'm extremely scared of what will happen. My mom is the strongest person i know, and yet i don't know what to do i find myself sitting up at night not knowing what will happen. I hate what has happened to her cause i hate any problem i can't fiond a way to help fix. I mean, with something like this what can i do? She has the bravest face in the world, and i don't like to admit it, but i'm scared of what might happen to her. Does anyone have any suggestions of things i can do? And does anyone know the survival rate of someone with breast cancer?",
