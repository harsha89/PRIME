    "Content": "I just found this site, while searching for info. on cancer odor. I know this thread is old, but was hoping others had more to add on this topic. Particularly, I'm curious about how long people noticed the odor before the diagnosis. I have a friend who began emiting a horrible underarm smell shortly after the birth of her daughter.Â  It was evident that she was clean, but the odor was unbearable. About 3 years later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Once she underwent her mastectomy, the odor disappeared. It seems that, had she heeded that warning and altered her diet and lifestyle, she may have been able to avoid the cancer. Two years ago, I began having the same odor. It got so bad that I was carrying spare t-shirts around and ducking into public restrooms to wash throughout the day. After being rebuffed by my PCP, who offered to write me a prescription for an anti-perspirant with high levels of aluminum, I went to a doctor of Chinese medicine. She diagnosed me with Spleen and told me to eat plenty of orange and black foods, avoid sugar, dairy and fried foods. It took me a year and a half before the odor became manageable, but it's still there and comes out if I get stressed or eat outside of my perimeters. My question is, should I be concerned after two years? I've been to doctors, but they don't accept my concern. The Chinese \"spleen\" diagnosis also includes the pancreas. I'm considering getting a CT scan, but am worried about the contrast dye and wonder if I should wait a little longer. Any thought or stories of your experiences would be very helpful.",
