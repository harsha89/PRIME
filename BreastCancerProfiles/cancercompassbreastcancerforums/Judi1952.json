    "Content": "Hi Vickie, I am Jude and was diagnosed Stage IV metastic breast cancer a year and a half ago.  I am 61 year old and also have been treated for panic disorder and anxiety.  I, too was terrified.  The drugs I am taking-Arimidex and Faslodex have helped to prolong my life.  I understand when they stop being effective, there are others waiting in the wings.   Meditation or prayer helped me enormously.  Keeping a gratitude journal every day helps me stay positive.  I also plan long weekends every month to do something for myself.  That gives me something to live for.  Also I took a poetry class at my cancer hospital.  It helped me put down on paper my sorrow and grief.   Does your cancer hosptial offer therapy or a support group?    Hope this helps.  XOXXO",
