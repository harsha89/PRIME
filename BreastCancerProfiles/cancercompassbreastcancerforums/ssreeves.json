    "Content": "I just found this thread and see that it's been a year since the last posting. My sister has NSCLC and it was March of last year when she exhibited signs of LM disease; slurring of speech, headaches, memory loss, difficulty walking, etc.  A lumbar puncture confirmed the diagnosis and a shunt was put in her head to relieve the pressure that had built up. A few weeks later when she stablilized she started receiving three drugs:  Taxol, Alimta, and Avastin.  She responded wonderfully, but had to stop both the Taxol and Alimta  due to reactions from both drugs. She has been on Avastin only since October and still continues to do well.  Our fingers remain crossed that she continues to respond so well.   Hope this might provide some help to those suffering from this disease.",
