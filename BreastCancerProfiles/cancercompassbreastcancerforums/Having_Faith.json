Long story short, Thank you for your support. I will be back on here. I need to talk to other women who are going through the same thing or have already been there. Faith and prayers to all.  Ann Hi Elaine, I hope it turns out to be nothing! I just hate the waiting. It seems to take a life time to get results back. I was shocked that my mammagram came back so fast. Usually it take at least 11/2 to 2 weeks. I made it through it once, I know I can do it again. Just a little frightning, knowing something showed up, 7 yrs later. Thanks for listening!!   Ann  ",

Alot of prayers and having Faith pulled me through. My 2 girls were so happy. Took alot of worries off their mind as well. I need to get on here more, but I work 12 hour days, not alot of time. Days are flying by so fast. Take Care I will get back on soon. Ann",

Trying to be strong, but don't know for how long!!!    I am so sorry to hear about your phone call....I am a cancer survivor and I can't imagine what must be going through your mind right now. The phone call that all of us survivors never want to receive.  You are so justified in your feelings right now.  The loss of your son, what can I say, I have a 24 year old son and a 25 year  old daughter.  That is something I don't know if I could live through, losing one of them.  I can tell that you are a really strong woman even though you probably don't feel that way right now.  I don't know if there is anything I can say to you right now to make you feel better except that I do believe you must have faith...without it, we don't have anything to believe in.  I hope you keep in touch with this board so we know what is going on with you.  I would love to hear from you and if you just need to vent or talk.....I will be glad to listen....my prayers are going out to you tonight......write back sometime, take care of those daughters and know they love you more than anything....
