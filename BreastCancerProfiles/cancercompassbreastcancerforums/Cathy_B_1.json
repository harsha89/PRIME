    "Content": "Hi, My name is Cathy I am a 3 year breast cancer survivor. I have had Lymphedema for about 2 years now. My cancer doctor sent me to therapy for it. No cure right now. The only treatment I know of is massage, wrapping with bandages and exercise. I sure hope they come up with a cure.",
