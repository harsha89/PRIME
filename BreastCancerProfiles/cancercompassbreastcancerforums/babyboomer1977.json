      "Content": "I am going off of all the anti hormone pills that I have tried because first I was put on Armimidex and it caused me to have upset stomachs all the time and feel weak and in extreme pain walking and pain in my utrus and blurred vision and extreme hot flashes where it feels like someone threw a fire ball at me! Than she suggested that I take Letrozole and it cause extreme hot flashes and gave so much pain in my legs that it was hard to walk at all! And it to caused nothing but upset stomach too! and also light headedness too!  And recently she suggested for me to go on Tamoxifen!Tamoxifen which I read from the FDA that they said that women in there 50s have a very high risk of taking these pills!",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone has gone off of Armimidex because of the side effects! I was diagnosed for breast cancer late stage 3 and had my lump done in dec 2011 and chemo and radiation in 2012 ! My chemo doctor told me that she is worried that if I go off of these pills that my cancer will come back! But I think that the pills are not doing me any good being in pain all the time and feeling crippled and extreme hot flashes and upset stomach and dizzyness. Does not help me one bit",

      "Content": "WARNING For Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) and Women at High Risk for Breast Cancer Serious and life-threatening events associated with Tamoxifen in the risk reduction setting (women at high risk for cancer and women with DCIS) include uterine malignancies, stroke and pulmonary embolism. Incidence rates for these events were estimated from the NSABP P-1 trial (seeCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY,Clinical Studies,Reduction in Breast Cancer Incidence in High Risk Women). Uterine malignancies consist of both endometrial adenocarcinoma (incidence rate per 1,000 women-years of 2.20 for Tamoxifen vs. 0.71 for placebo) and uterine sarcoma (incidence rate per 1,000 women-years of 0.17 for Tamoxifen vs. 0.4 for placebo)*. For stroke, the incidence rate per 1,000 women-years was 1.43 for Tamoxifen vs. 1.00 for placebo**. For pulmonary embolism, the incidence rate per 1,000 women-years was 0.75 for Tamoxifen versus 0.25 for placebo**. Some of the strokes, pulmonary emboli, and uterine malignancies were fatal. Health care providers should discuss the potential benefits versus the potential risks of these serious events with women at high risk of breast cancer and women with DCIS considering Tamoxifen to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. The benefits of Tamoxifen outweigh its risks in women already diagnosed with breast cancer. *Updated long-term follow-up data (median length of follow-up is 6.9 years) from NSABP P-1 study. SeeWARNINGS,Effects on the Uterus-Endometrial Cancer and Uterine Sarcoma.",
