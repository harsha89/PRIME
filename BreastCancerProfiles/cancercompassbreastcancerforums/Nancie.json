      "Content": "Thank you for your response. I have now been on aromasin for over 2 years and am happy to report that the only side effect I have is occasional hot flashes. I am back to my old self, lost the weight, and feeling great! Joint/foot pain is gone and I can do what I want to do! We all just need to stay aware of what drugs can do to our bodies. Blessings to you! Tx Cowgirl I have been on Aromasin since Nov. 2008 and the only side effect I have is frequent hot flashes. I feel almost ashamed to complain when I read about all the pain so many are having. However, I am wondering if the hot flashes can be controlled. They happen and I am soaking wet, hair, clothes and all. I even get them when I am in the pool at the Y in aerobic's class. Can anyone help me with them. My oncologist said he could give me a pill, but I take so many now, I just didn't want to take anything else. (I've had 5 since starting to write this). Nancie",

      "Content": "Hi Sheila, Thank you for answering me. I went to the otho dr. yesterday and he said that surgery was indicated now, so it will most likely be scheduled for the 1st of Sept - waiting to hear. My oncologist has not called back so I haven't gotten his take on all of this. My knee is painful all the time now, and is keeping me from things I used to do so freely. You mentioned weight gain; that has not been a problem, thank heaven; in fact I have recently taken off 20 lbs. and hope to take off some more before the surgery.",

      "Content": "I have been on Aromasin since Nov 09 and in Dec 09 had a torn miniscus repaired and now they want to do a knee replacement. I'm willing because the pain in my knee is constant and I want it gone. But, after reading in this site, I'm wondering if the aromasin is contributing to it. Any comments on that. Nancie",
