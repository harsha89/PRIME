    "Content": "As of a few months ago, I noticed a hard lump in my right breast. It's not sore and is even sometimes hard to find.  I'm going to the doctors on Tuesday to have it checked out, but I've recently noticed my body odour has changed. I've never been a sweaty person, but now I'm sweating a lot and my odour is horrible. After showering I'm fine for a day, but then the smell starts. I'm waking up in hot flushes and having panic attacks for no reason at all. I don't know if there is any connection with any of these symptoms, as there is no history(that I'm aware of) of breast cancer in my family, but I'm noticing that a lot of my hair is coming out(not dramatic amounts but more than usual). My menstrual cycle has also changed quiet a bit in recent months(short period or none at all).  I'm 27 and any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you. ",
