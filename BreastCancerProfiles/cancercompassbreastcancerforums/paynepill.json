    "Content": "It has been a rough year after bilateral diep flap. Everytime i feel i am finally going to feel normal again a new problem arises. the latest is my skin feeling very prickly and breast that hurt so bad that even the water from the shower hurts. Everything I read about this surgery sounds like it is the way to go. I do not understand how I could have so much pain from it and be the only one. Can anyone else understand this. Going for a MRI, hopefully they will figure it out.",
