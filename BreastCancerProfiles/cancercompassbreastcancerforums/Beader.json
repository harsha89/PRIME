    "Content": "Hi Kim, I've been on Femara for 6 months and my side effects are hot flashes, a bad case of the \"blues,\" and a constantly stuffy head. I don't have allergies and believe the \"stuffy head\" is from the Femara. So far, no joint pains but wondering if that will eventually show up. I haven't gained weight, am able to work out at the gym, no sleeping problems but again, I feel as though my energy, my spirt has been taken from me. My quality of life has changed. I don't know if any of these problems are temporary or something I have to live with for the next 5 years while on Femara. I supoose it's a matter of \"damned if you do and damned if you don't.\" I just want to know if these side effects are temporary?",
