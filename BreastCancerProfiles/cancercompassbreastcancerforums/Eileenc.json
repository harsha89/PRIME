    "Content": "Hi,  I can understand your confusion about the use of Dexamethasone in combination with chemotherapy.  Dexamethasone is the generic name for the steroid, Decadron.  Research has found that cancer cells exposed to Dexamethasone are more susceptible to the effects of the chemotherapy drugs.  So the Dexamethasone is given to enhanse the effects of the chemotherapy.  Since the dose is relatively small and given for such a short term it is not necessary to taper off the drug, it can be safely stopped.   And usually any side effects from the Dexamethasone are mild because of the short term use of the drug.  The Dexamethasone may temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure and possibly lead to the patient experiencing some agitation.  If these symptoms occur,  be sure to tell the doctor and appropriate medications to control these symptoms can be prescribed for the time the Dexamethasone is needed.  I am a retired registered nurse and also fighting recurrent uterine cancer.  I do take the Dexamethasone in combination with my chemotherapy.  And I do experience spikes in blood pressure, so my b/p medication is increased during the time I'm taking the Dexamethasone.  I hope this helps relieve your apprehension.  Good Luck to you and your Dad.  Please keep us up to date on how he is doing.    Love,  Eileen     ",
