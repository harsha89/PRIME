    "Content": "A gift for your Mother...material gifts are lovely, but having gone through cancer treatments, what would be nice would be a letter expressing your feelings and memories of you and your mother throughout your life.  Tell her what she means to you.  You could give her a 'certificate' telling her that you will go with her to any appointments she may have in the future, if that is possible for you.  Going to treatments alone can be very lonely.  Plan a weekend getaway, or longer, just you and your Mom, when she is feeling stronger.  Give her the gift of TIME, sharing time with YOU is what is important. I wish you and your Mother a happy time ahead.  Judy",
