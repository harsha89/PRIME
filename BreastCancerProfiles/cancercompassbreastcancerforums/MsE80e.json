      "Content": "Good morning. I am brand new to this site.  I have one breast removed in 2011.  No reconstruction.  I'm 80, almost 81 years old.  Am finding these last years of my life hard to tolerate.  Am using hydrocodone to take off the edge of the discomfort.  Went through an exercise program, but it didn't seem to help.  Also, quite frankly, I was so tired that after a couple of months I didn't follow through with the program.  I am not in screaming pain...just constant discomfort and uncomfortable sleep, so maybe I shouldn't have signed up on this board as entry I've read seems to be from people having much more trouble than I am.  But my life has changed, and then doubly so because of a cardioversion in which the doctor placed the shock paddles right on the scar tissue of my scar.  I didn't go to sleep until the shock knocked me out.  I haven't been the same since.  The combination of the mastetomy discomfort is much worse since that shock.  So, someone, tell me about Neurontin.  Please.  ",
