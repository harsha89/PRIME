      "Content": "Guafinison is widely used in fibromyalgia.  I have taken it for a while.  What I found that works for me, is 1cc of My-O-Den with 2 cc B-12 in an injection.  I have been taking this medicene for 2 years now and I had my first flare-up in 18 months at Christmas.  You take this every 3 days during the week.  It is also available in a sublingual (underneath the tongue) form, also.  My doctor has almost all her fibromyalgia patients on it with equally good results.  Calvert-Gamble Pharmacy in Biloxi ,Mississippi, is the supplier. Hopes this helps. missi4kids  ",

For those who have been there, was there anything that you wished you had that you didn't?  Hi!  I am going Monday for my biopsy, but from my US and irregular size of my lump, they are pretty certain I have cancer.  I have had several major surgeries and I always take too much to the hospital.  It has been my experience by the time the Dr. sends me home, I still don't feel like doing anything.  But the things I take are my own pillow, especially a squishy one.  It forms to your body and makes it easier to push this against the area of surgery and helps you sit up, stand up, walking, coughing or sneezing.  This is called splinting.  Take your own body lotion, the hospital kind is gross.  Take your own house shoes with a rubber sole.  The hospital puts these itchy socks on your with rubber tread on them.  Take your own tolietries and soap.  Again what the hospital can provide you with, is cheap and gross.  I like to take pj bottoms to wear under the hospital gown, you are not going to feel like putting your top on, plus there are those IV's.  Take an IPOD, program your favorite songs and some of those soothing songs, water running, nature, etc.  These will keep you calm and will block out all the noise.  Hospitals are noisy, especially at night.  Take some crackers and peanut butter or some other favorite food that is slightly on the bland side.  You can eat this, if you find the hospital food terrible.  Before I go in for surgery, I have my hair done and cut if necessary.  When a stylist does it, it seems to last longer.  I actually went 2 weeks without shampooing in the hospital and it still looked like I had it done.  Make plans to have someone do your hair after coming home, as it will be difficult to hold your arms up for long periods of time.  Think about a manicure and pedicure, but be sure to use clear polish.  This is something you probably won't feel like doing for awhile.  In the hospital if you are having a lot of pain, take the pain medication every 4 hours, whether you need it or not, the first 24 - 36 hours.  If you can get your pain under control at the beginning, you will do better as you heal.  BTW, I am a registered nurse and we always do that for surgery patients and it really works.  On the home front, buy groceries, etc and stock up for your family.  Check your schedule and if a child needs to go to the orthodontist, make plans now to get someone to take them.  When someone asks you, if you need help, say yes and tell them what.  Most people don't know what to do, when a person is recovering for surgery.  Ask them to feed your family for a night, take your kids to soccer, come over and visit with you, have them bring coffee or a smoothie, etc.  Don't be a hero.  Sleep whenever you feel tired, even if its all day.  Sleep is one of the best way to heal. I don't like someone to come stay at the hospital to help, usually they don't have a clue. That's why you have nurses.  But visits are good.  I don't let my husband spend the night, because the chair or cot they give him is so uncomfortable and he twists and turns and moans and groans all night and I can't get any sleep.   I hope this is helps.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Let me know how you do.  My prayers are with you.  Blessings, Leigh Anne   Le    ",
