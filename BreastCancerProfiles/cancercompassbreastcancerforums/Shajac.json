Let us know. Sharon.",

      "Content": "Hi Marietta, I had mastectomy last year June, left breast and then radiation. Was stage 1, removed some lymph nodes for testing. NOw also clear of cancer and this year also had pain in ribs just under the left breast and also huge lump on ribs. Saw my oncologist and then went for all tests (blood, scans, ultrasound) and all were clear. Also had pulling sensation when I lifted my arm. Have intensified my exercises and this has helped. Last month went to see breast surgeon regarding reconstruction and she suggested it was due to lymphatic system redirecting itself - - - - anyway, just hope this is the same for you. Good luck.

I dont know what hypodensities are, so cant help you there - can you not speak to your GP to find out if he/she knows at least what that means - otherwise, suggest you ring your oncologist - surely they can take the call just to answer one question? If you are worrying about this then you need to speak to someone who can provide answers sooner rather than later. Good luck!! Let us know. Sharon",
