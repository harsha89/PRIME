    "Content": "i was told in june 2008 that i had a cyst they refused to take it out until it grew to 6cm or more. they took it out two weeks ago and two days ago they told me it was lucky they operated because i have metaplastic carcinoma. i am now waiting for a ct scan to find the extent of the cancer. i am angry that it took so long to be found out. has this happened to anyone else?",
