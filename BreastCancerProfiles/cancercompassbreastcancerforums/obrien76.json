    "Content": "I had a biopsey four months ago on my right breast and it turned out ok, but to be safe and more lumps the doctors decided to do a MRI 2 weeks ago and my doctor phone a lump he is worried about on the left side at 5 o'clock. Â My problem is they want to do a biopsey now and i have a huge skin graph that covers my breast from a burn when i was 2 years old. i remember the pain from my right side and can't imagine the pain i will go through when they go through all that scar tissue. Does anyone know how they would go about a biopsey in this situation?",
