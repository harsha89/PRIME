      "Content": "You\u2019re right, I should be having regular mammograms.  But health insurance underwriters don\u2019t seem to penalize an applicant for not having diagnostic exams.  If nothing is known, you\u2019ll get covered, but do due diligence in getting screened, and find a problem, they may decline coverage.  Actuarial statistics quantify the risk (frequency) of breast cancer in a large population with good accuracy, while the condition of any one individual member is unknown. Ironically, not knowing places me in the pool of average risk that is insurable with a sound actuarial basis.  I was verified to be 100% calcification free of common micro calcifications nearly 13 years ago.  The common micro calcifications were found, removed and tested benign.   The insurance companies employ the best actuarial mathematicians available, and they\u2019re formulas will determine whether or not I fit the pool of average risk that is insurable.  If they do, I will be covered, and then I may go get another mammogram. I\u2019m told that they will not require a mammogram as a basis for determining insurability; their decision will be made on the basis of my history. Meanwhile, I will enjoy life an not fixate on probabilities too much.  I\u2019ll post the results.  I do not recommend to anyone to do what I have done.  Regular mammograms are important.    ",

      "Content": "I am 62 years oa age.  I had a mamogram 12 years ago, where the imaging discivered some micro calcifications.  A biopsy was done that removed all of the tissue containing the calcification specs, and zero cancer cells were found.  I never went back for another follow-up mamogram, and have had no symptoms of cancer at all. Im now applying for health insurance, where the questionaire asks about abnormal mamograms in the past 10 years.  I have had no mamograms in the past 12 years, therefore no abnormal mamograms.  I told the insurance company's medical specialist compiling health history about the old mamogram, even though it was older than the 10-year past time interval called for in the questionaire. Does anyone know how the underwriters will rate this old \"abnormal\" mamogram.  Will they disregard the finding of benign calsifications since the event is 12 years past, and I have no evidence of cancer ever.  I'm alive and well at 62.5 years of age, and will have the insurance policy for only 2.5 more years until I reach medicare age.  Is my risk of developing breast cancer so great in the next 2.5 years that the health insurance industry would declinc coverage or significantly rate up my premium, based on a voluntary mention of the old \"abnormal\" mamogram, that resulted in a benign finding? I decided to drop mamogram testing after the traumatic biopsy that left me scarred and feeling pain for some years afterwards, and for what?  About half of all mamograms reveal calcification specks and the vast majority are benign.",
