    "Content": "I have lymphedema of the breast also.  Following my lumpectomy and removal of lymph nodes last March I had lymphedema of the arm and hand, following 33 radiation TXs the lymphedema started in my breast which is now 2 cup sizes larger than my unaffected breast.  I saw my radiation oncologist last month who said this was edema a would take a long time to go away.  Also saw my breast specialist who is my surgeon who said she had never seen lymphedema in the breast and sent me back to my lymphedema physical therapist for treatment and who said she has never seen breast lymphedema this bad.  We will start taping my breast next week to try and move the fluid along with massage, I am allergic to adhesives, skin burns under tape, so I'm really putting myself out there to get this resolved.  I got a compression bra last week and the support has really helped with some of my pain.  I will be getting a compression pump and torso garment for the breast and hand and sleeve garments for hand and arm.  I hope this is going to work.  I have a constant tingling sensation on the outside of my breast and have sharp pains off and on throughout the day throughout my breast.  Should I insist on an MRI or biopsy to make sure this also isn't cancer coming back?  I read a message from someone in 2008 that had breast lymphedema and a mammogram that only showed calcifications after biopsy it turned out to be cancer.  What should I do?",
