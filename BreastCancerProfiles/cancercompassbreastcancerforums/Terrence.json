The past two weeks have been very difficult for me. On July 15th, my mother, the joy and strenghth of my life informed me that she had found a lump in her breast. The past weeks have been so crazy....however, on yesterday I learned that my mother has breast cancer. Her pet scan is scheduled for next week and I will have more information. It is so hard for me because I reside 1400 miles from her. Of course, I will plan to go home to be with her during this process, but in the mean time...it's really tough. I will use this site for support, education and just as a sounding board to help us through the journey. On last year, I began an advocacy role in the fight against breast cancer for others....not knowing that this too would be apart of my personal life. I am strong and so is she. Together with the grace and mercy of God we will make it! Thanks for having this site Angela Hi Angala, I sympathise with you and your mother. I am a survivor of colon cancer Stage 3 and have been clean for the past 8 years and living a wonderful life. I am in South Africa and would like to point you to a wonderful initiative by a drug company and it is called Moments In Time. I got involved with the project last year when I was invited to appear on the calendar for this year, I have once again been been voted onto the calendar for next year. Being ascosiated with the MIT calendar is great as I have met wonderful folks who have gone through cancer treatment and come out smiling on the other side. To you and your Mom don't give up and refuse to let this setback get you down, a positive attitude will see you through and tell your mother not to be shamed of the lack of hair during chemo but to rather look on it as a badge of honour in her fight against the disease. Have a look at www.momentsintime.co.za  you should find inspiration from these wonderful people featured on the calendars for the past number of years. All best regards to you and your Mom, Terrence Jacobs. Pretoria. South Africa  ",

      "Content": "Hi Steph, Having gone through the colon cancer scene 7 years ago, now going into my 8th year, I can only suggest giving your mom all of the support and love that you can. I like to suggest that people look at a website here in South Africa www.momentsintime.co.za  and you should come away from this feeling touched by the people featured on the calendars. Best wishes, Terrence",
