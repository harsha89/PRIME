    "Content": "I have a 44 year old friend named Mindi that was diagnosed 12 years ago with breast cancer.  She had her breast removed and went through chemo and radiation.  Then 6 years later it went to bones.  Again she went through chemo and radiation.  2 years ago it has went to her brain with too many tumors to count and she went through radiation and was on xeloda and tykerb for the past year with really no real results.  Now her oncologist wants her to try going on Navelbine with her Tykerb tomorrow.  She can either do this, or do nothing and wait to die.  I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience with these medications and knows of any prognosis?  She is a single mother of a 15 year old and is really having a tough time deciding what to do. Any information would be helpful. Thanks, Debbie from Washington",
