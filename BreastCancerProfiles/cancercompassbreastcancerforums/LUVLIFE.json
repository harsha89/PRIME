I just looked at the label and it said high fructose level. Now I am scared.  Also, should people who have gone through cancer stay away from sugar altogther?  No cake or ice cream,  even once in a while?  Lastly, my nutritionist said to stay away from soybeans and flaxseed.  On this site I am reading that it is GOOD. Is there an expert out there that can advise me on these questions?     ",
