    "Content": "Aloha everyone, I am truly amazed and inspired by all of you. I am researching for positive treatments for my mom's recurring breast cancer that has spread to her bones and posibily liver. Prior to finding out she has recurring breast cancer, she underwent Heart Valve Replacement Surgery 3 weeks ago and due to some water surrounding the heart 2 weeks after surgery she had to go in for drainage and more scanning and tests. After the drainage around the heart, the results of the xrays and scans showed spots on her ribs, spine, skull and some possibly on liver. This was a devastating blow to us all. Today she is dealing with more liquid accumalating around lungs (not sure if this is surgery related?) that will need to be tested and drained hopefully tomorrow if her blood counts are at least at a 1.5 level. My concern is that the oncologist at the hospital recommended that treatment will be based on whether the liquid around lung is cancer positive then he said she would need immediate chemotherapy treatment. Which is scary as she really wanted to avoid this. I see a holistic doctor and recommended mom to visit her first before making the decision on chemotherapy because she is already weak and not so healthy in the hospital. She has been there for 11 days now and the food they serve her is horendous and not very healthy at all. I bring her fresh fruits and nuts and some home cooked soup that is way more yummy and healthy for her. My only concern is because she is on blood thinners, she is not allowed to eat alot of dark green vegetables such as spinich because it can thicken the blood (medical advice). I am not sure on the full list of veggies, but all the vitamins and supplements springflowers has listed looks promising but not sure if it will be safe for mom's heart. Please help with any advice. I really appreciate you all for starting this forum and for making our family feel there is hope and some light with this evil invader! God Bless and best wishes to you all on beating this cancer. Take care and look forward to updating as much as posible. A hui hou, Alaana",
