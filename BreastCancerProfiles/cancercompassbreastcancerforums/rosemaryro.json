      "Content": "There is a drink called karela juice, it kills cancer cells in 24 hours. I am taking chemo drugs. I was bleeding from the behind but it was related to my breast cancer. It was ovarian cancer. There are numerous clinical trials. It was not the first time I actually bled from the behind though. I was misdiagnosed as having an ulcer, it causes bleeding to from the behind. I am drinking a lot of water and having bowel movements. I have good bowel movements now. You should try to find a clinical trial to get into. ",

      "Content": "The smell is bleeding, but I have bleeding and my friend and the cardiologist said it was not life threatening, but it does smell I try to buy more beans or pinto beans, white beans, cajun power and syrup, to syrup my beans, fiber is the problem. I have been slugging in the bathroom for 27 years. The reason is fiber. Okay so it smells and bleeds there, I had a few operations to relieve it, one was a leeching of the glands and scraping segments. It is really in the lower descending part of my bowels before you expel. The smell is still there, my friend and cardiolgist came to my house. They are okay guys.. ",

      "Content": "I think if you try to drink guanabana tea, I bought mine from Andiagio Teas, you can clean that smell up. I am trying to incorporate more mango, papaya, strawberry slushes into my diet. Guanabana tea is like chemo. Papaya is called paw paw fruit, and I just buy the mango, papaya, strawberry in the freezer section of the grocery, I also buy papaya and mango frozen fruit, I find these in the dollar section and make smoothies. But the tea is often good and you have to drink it with Agave sweetener. It is good to clean yourself out and these fruits help like chemo would.",
