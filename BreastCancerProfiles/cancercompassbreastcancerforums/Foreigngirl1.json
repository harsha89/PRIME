      "Content": "Please let me know your opinion on the result of my ductogram (It was indicated since I had non-spontaneous bloody discharge from 2 ducts from my right nipple - only upon squeezing it. the ductogram was only peformed on one duct since the discharge stopped from the 2d duct. No it looks like the discharge stopped all together from both ducts) There is mild difuse duct ectsia and small cystic collections are opacified. In the mostal distal portion the first and second order tributaries contain multiple small filing defects and discountinuour segments of reduced filling/distention suggestive of internal lesion and/ or debris. I am scheduled for mammary duct excision but want to know the chances of benigh outcome. Thank you very much in advance for your answer. Foreigngirl1",

      "Content": "I had a duct excision surgery on Friday indicated for bloody non-spontaneous nipple discharge from two different holes in my right nipple. The surgeon said after the surgery that she personally did not see anything abnormal. I had a ductogram prior to excision that did show some filing defects in the duct. Do you think that experienced surgeon can actually predict the outcome of pathology? Waiting for results is driving me crazy.   Any opinion or personal experience sharing is greaty appreciated.    ",

      "Content": "I am 41 years old with no family history of breast cancer. I had a normal screening mammogram in September of 2008 (4 months ago). 2 weeks ago I noticed bloody discharge from 2 ducts (close to each other) on my right breast. The discharge was not spontaneous, I squized the nipple during my monthly self breast exam. I went to the breast specialist and they did an ultrasound (normal), Aurora breast MRI (normal) and mammogram. Mammogram showed a small cluster of microcalficiations not in the same place where the bleeding ducts were but in the same breast.  The radiologist could not clearly explain to me whether these calcifications were on my September mammogram, whether they were missed or whether they were new. She said thee were undeterminate (score 4) and recommended a stereopatic biopsy that I had done yesterday (results within a week or so, long wait..) She said it\u2019s 50/50 chance of good/bad outcome. I also I had my ductogram yesterday and the radiologist told me what she found a bunch of stuff there (the word she used was \u201cdebris\u201d) She said is indeterminate \u2013 if it\u2019s a pappiloma, it\u2019s a bunch of them\u2026 or something else (scary stuff). Now I am referred to a surgeon to do a surgery to remove the duct (under general anesthesia) and take a biopsy of it. She did say again 50/50 chance of good/bad. The more procedures are done the more I am freaking out\u2026.. Any word of wisdom/encouragement for me? Could it be cancer even if MRI was absolutely normal (not enhancement, etc.) What is the percentage of benign outcome in this situation? My radiologist is supposed to be top notch but not very sympathetic. If it\u2019s not benign can it be invasive and not DCIS with the normal MRI? Thank you very much for your attention to my questions. With great appreciation   Foreigngirl1",

      "Content": "Thank you very much for your response.   Yes, I am married (my husband is very supportive) and I have 2 kids - ages 12 and 7. I met with the surgeon today to discuss my ducts excision. She was nice and more positive than my radiologist. Still waiting for biopsy results....It's very hard to wait.   Good luck with your recovery. Hopefully the worse is behind you!",
