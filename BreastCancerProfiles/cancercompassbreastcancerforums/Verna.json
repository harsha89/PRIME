      "Content": "I have stage 1 grade 3 DIC.  Have had 2 lumpectomies with margins and additional lump.  Just completed 4 sessions of chemo and now my options are a third lumpectomy or mastectomy.  I am 76 years old.  Lymph nodes were good. Radiation would follow lumpectomy but not mastectomy. Having trouble deciding which way to go.  Has anyone had 3 lumpectomies?  ",

      "Content": "I have decided to go with the mastectomy rather than another lumpectomy.  This is not a recurrence but the two lumpectomies didn't get all margins and additional lump found in second lumpectomy.  This all started in August of 2011.  My surgeon and oncologist decided to try chemo first after 2nd lumpectomy and a mastectomy after.  Then the surgeon came up with the 2 options after the chemo.  After much thought it seems foolish to me to get a third lumpectomy only to worry about what is left in the piece of breast that is left.  I am scheduled for surgery Jan. 13 and will know a week later what was found in the breast.  I'm hoping the chemo took care of any margins.  Thanks for your input.  Mine is stage 1, grade 3, triple negative.  ",
