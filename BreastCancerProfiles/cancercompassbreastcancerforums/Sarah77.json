      "Content": "  On 7/16/2008 Biscotti wrote: I had stage one breast cancer and had 16 weeks of radiation. At this time (Feb 08) my doctor put me on Arimidex. I had side effects like weight gain (16lbs) in two months. No sleeping and horrible increase in my arthritis. I couldn't hold a pencil. When I saw my oncologist he put me on Aromasin that I have been on for 6 weeks. My arthritis is somewhat better and my weight gain has slowed but I still have hair loss and depression not to mention i don't sleep anymore. The doctor told me I could opt to not take any drug and take my chances. I am totally confused and feel so alone. So do I stop everything? I am sixty-five and would be on it till I'm seventy. Besides all that Aromasin costs me $390 a month. I am a wreck. I would appreciate any input. Thanks Rosalie Dear Rosalie: My doctor tried to put me on that stuff to but I refused.  I found natural products that do  a great job.  Go to brevail.com I take it every day.  It is a flax seed lignan. It was discovered by a lady plastic surgeon.  Also try Estrogem Defense you can order it at 313-561-6800.  These products will protect your breast from estrogen with no side affects.  Of course your doctor would never agree to this because they are taught to push drugs and a lot of doctors get a kick back from the drug companies.  I have been taking these products for two years and doing fine I am also a breast cancer for two years and am seventy years old.  But please go to brevail.com and read up on this doctors advice.  She gives a lot of tips on vitamins and minerals that you can greatly benefit from.  Thimgs like selenium, turmeric are to mention a few. Also, mammograms are crap.  Try looking up themograms on your computer.  They are much more accurate,they are done buy infrared cameras.  No one touches you and they are much more accurate.  Your insurance probably will not cover it but believe me they are well worth it.. I hope this helps you. Shirley Prescott Valley, AZ--Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed. Consider private reply.

I am going to go for it.  Also,  Mammogerams, are crap.  Check out Thermograms.  they are wonderful, thats what I do. your insuranmce probably won't pay for it but a thermogrami is well worth it.  No one touches you it is done with heat sensetivity.  No pain and is very accurate.  I hope this helps . ",
