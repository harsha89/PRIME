Apparently it has had great results.  At the same time I started taking the drug, I started walking 3 days a week and going to curves 3 days a week.  I have never been one to exercise but was really sticking to it.  My feet and hands started hurting and my hot flashes were worse and I was extremely tired and felt heavy.  I could stand to lose l5 lbs but I'm not large and had been doing this routine for 6 weeks.  I'm 63.  I thought I should be feeling good.  I had also been eating healthier and taking supplements.  I decided the only way to see if it was the Aromasin causing the problems was to go off of it.  Within two days I felt better. I have been off of it for a little over two weeks.  You can't help but question if you are doing the right thing.  I felt like I was finally taking control of my life with the exercise and diet and I have alot of faith which has really given me strength.  I feel so blessed to have been given 5 years.  But when I look back I really didn't do anything significant or meaningful.  I didn't think there would be a 2nd 5 year pill and in some ways I wish there hadn't been then there wouldn't be this question.  But I feel like all I can do now is take care of myself the best I can and turn it over to God and hopefully make a difference, whether I have  6 months or 6 years.  I look at life so differently now.  The last 5 years were more about me and now I hope to make the next 5 more about others and give back.. I hope to go on a mission trip this summer. I hope the Tamoxifin works for you.  I still haven't talked to my onchologist yet but am waiting for a call from her today.  I tried arimidex before I took the fareston and I couldn't take it either. I wish you the best and would like to hear from you. JoAnn ",
