      "Content": "Thanks a lot for the great advice.  I ended up going to the breast surgeon who did a biopsy. It came back as fibroadenoma which is fantastic! 'm really glad I listened to myself and went because the other docs didn't think I had a tumor or anything at all for that matter.  I still have to go back in 3 months though for another checkup and probably a few more after that just to make sure nothing changes with it.  Thanks again everyone!!",

      "Content": "I'm wondering how possible it is to be misdiagnosed with fibrocystic breast disease instead of cancer?  I went and had an ultrasound and mammo done today and that's what the technician for both is saying.  They were both pessimistic to begin with even doing the tests.  First I had the u.s. and the tech for that was like, \"looks like fibrocystic breasts to me, but I have to let the doc decide if you need a mammo\".  The doc saw a few worrisome spots so I had a mammo as well.  The mammo tech said the same thing but added, \"you're too young for this to be cancer, so I'm sure it's just fibrocystic.\"  She even went on to tell me I should cancel my appt with the breast surgeon because it would just be a waste of money.  Are these people just disregarding me because I'm only 27?  Should I still go to the surgeon and request a biopsy?  I'm so confused and just as worried as before I had these tests done!!  Thanks!!",

      "Content": "Thank yall very much for all the wonderful advice.  The mammo report came back as being \"probably benign\".  I'm still a little worried, but more than likely, it's just fibrocystic.  I go to the surgeon tomorrow and we'll decide where to go from there but probably all I need is repeat mammo's for a little bit!  ",

      "Content": "I am 27.  I first found a lump in my right breast when I was 15.  Went to the doc and had an ultrasound done on it.  Doc said it was half liquid and half solid but nothing to worry about.  So I thought nothing else about it really.  For the past three years I haven't been able to feel it.  I thought it had went away.  A couple days ago, I started to feel it again.  Could this ever become a problem or is it still nothing to worry about?  Or, could the original one have went away and is this a new lump?  Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can give me.  God bless!",
