    "Content": "Hi,   I had a lumpectomy and Sentinel Node biopsy in April, and felt like my breast and under arm had healed... I just finished chemotherapy and am starting radiation.  About a week ago I started having pain under my arm, on my side, and in my breast (which feels swollen, like just before one's period--but I'm post menopause)--it started soon after the simulation for the radiation, so I assumed it was due to the long period of time I had to lie with my arm in an uncomfortable position, but it isn't going away.   I called my surgeon who agreed that was probably the issue, as it wouldn't be post-surgical pain at this point.... but as I say, it's been over a week since the simulation... and it's not getting any better...  I don't know who to ask about this--the medical oncologist, the radiation oncologist or??? Or, am I just being dumb and it will go away on its own?  Any ideas?   Thanks so much.",
