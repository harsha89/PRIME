      "Content": "Hi Diana, Nice to finally see that there really are more survivors on this site who were treated at CTCA. I hope you're doing well. I'm in complete remission with stage IV lung cancer and had no surgery. It's been two years since my last chemo. I continue to take the advice of the naturopath at CTCA and take my daily handful of reccomended supplements. It seems to be working, all scans have shown no changes. Call it \"stable\", call it \"remission\", I'm just happy. Stay cool Diana.",
