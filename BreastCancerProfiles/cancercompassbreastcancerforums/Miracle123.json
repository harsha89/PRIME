My Dad was taking 1st cycle of chemos along with Dexamathasone but then Seroids were gradually tapered down and stopped but he was about start his 2nd cycle of Chemos. he Continuied taking Chemos without any steroid so after taking 3rd Chemo (2nd cycle) he had weakness in his left side of the body (right brain was operated) that he was unable to move his left hand and left leg. But then doctors immediately started Dexa and now slowly he is getting his movements back. We are confused whether it had happened because there were no support of any steroids or it was actually a side effect of Cheo itself. Thank you",
