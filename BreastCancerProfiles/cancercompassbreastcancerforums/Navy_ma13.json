I had a left mastectomy, wanted the other gone but the surgeon would not do it. I did 8 rounds of chemo. 25 radiation treatments. I now take arimidex for 4 more years. My cancer fed off of hormones. Thats the reason for arimidex. I also stay away from soy and anything else that acts like estrogen in the body. I hope you find the thing that will slow your cancer. Just like you I enjoy life and grateful for all that I have.",

      "Content": "My neighbor does not have breast cancer. She has Ewing Sarcoma.She turned down any treatment. After surgery she hired a dietitian who works with her doctor. It has been three years for her and she is getting along fine. I have stage 3 breast cancer. ER positive. I chose to do the whole ball of wax. Mastectomy, chemo and radiation. I started Arimidex a year ago. This is actually a hormone blocker. My cancer feeds off of hormones. When possible I avoid soy and para bens. They act like estrogen in your body. My oncologist said to eat mostly fruit and veggies,sea food, chicken and very very little red meat. Also manmade sweeteners, I would always discuss what you want to do with your oncologist. I won't even start a new vitamin unless I ask my doc or the pharmacist.",
