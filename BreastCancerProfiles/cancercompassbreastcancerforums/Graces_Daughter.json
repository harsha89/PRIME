    "Content": "My mother just died last Thursday of metastatic breast cancer, she went every year for her mammogram because her mother died of breast cancer.  The doctors told us mammograms sometime don't pick up everything so I go for mri's plus mammo's.  The past couple of times I've gone for mri's they say they are watching something in my right breast, and I've been going every six months.  I tell my gyno that my right breast is sore all the time, but he assures me he feels nothing and not to worry.  I have had calcifications removed two years ago but they were not cancer.  Should I sit and wait?",
