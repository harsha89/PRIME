    "Content": " I had a lumpectomy with radiation for 33 treatment s. I have neck pain, loss of strength in the arm and numbness where the node was dissected . I too feel that I have been discounted by my Dr. I only had Duct Cancer in Situ in 2006 and they made it seem like a simply day sugery with no lasting side effects. A little cut here and little cut    under the arm and take a Percocet and you are good to go .The breast is still hard and painful and I am in constant pain. Thankfully my regular Dr understands that I am truly in pain and is a great help with adequate pain relief.  I often wonder if I did not have very good insurance that they would have insisted on all the radiation for a cancer that was removed with the core biopsy.",
