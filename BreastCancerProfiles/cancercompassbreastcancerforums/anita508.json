In January 2009, I was put on Femara by my oncologist after 6 rounds of chemo and radiation for stage 2 breast cancer.  By the summer of 2009, I had difficulty walking with severe pain in my knees and hips.  With his suggestion, I stopped the Femara and stayed off it for 6 weeks.  My joint pain did subside, but he told me I had to go on another cancer maintenance drug because my breast cancer was estrogen positive.  I have been on Aromasin since early September, 2010 and my joint pain is not as bad as when I was on the Femara.  It has not gone away completely, but it is so much better then while I was on the Femara.  I intend to stay on Aromasin.  I do still ache when I get  up in the morning, but I find that exercising, by walking or using my stationary bike does help.  You mentioned your hair thinning and I have noticed mine is thinner also, but I use a volumizing mousse and that does make my hair seem a little thicker.  I am hanging in there with the Aromisin only because my joint pain is not as bad.  I guess I can deal with the hair problem for awhile.  I was diagnosed in March 2008, so I have to be on the maintenance drug for a few more years! Let's hang in there.",
