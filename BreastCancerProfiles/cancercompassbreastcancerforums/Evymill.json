    "Content": "Hi, I know you asked this question long ago but I found a new alternative for mammography that is in tests yet but I hope they will get that on the market very fast because I am 41 and never did a mammography because it \"freaks me out\" just the thought of squeezing my breasts flat! I saw the pictures, it gets like a pancake!!!  I wanted to know who was the person how invented mammography. Certainly is NOT a woman. Shouldn't someone find an easer way? Now they did find it, but there are a lot of studies and a lot of bureaucracy to go through yet. Hope they get it out there faster, I need to start screening my breasts! http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/pr/current_research/Cone_Beam/",
