    "Content": "Annie, I saw your request for support when I came on the board to check postings for Canine Bladder Cancer.  My Westie, Willie, just lost a 2 year battle with the horrible disease.  I realize that our circumstances are not the same but the emotions are.  Willie of course couldn't tell me that anything was wrong and to please take him to the vet.  We did catch his cancer early and we were lucky that the treatments we used gave him a comfortable and extended life.  None the less, I felt the same things you are feeling.   You just have to take it one day at a time....and try to take some time for to do a few nice things for just you, even if it just taking a long shower or a walk to nowhere outside.  Do what ever you can to center yourself.  Also, allow yourself to feel what you feel and be okay with it.  Toward the end of Willie's battle he wouldn't eat well.  I was so worried about him and I would get so frustrated because he just couldn't take a bite of the food I fixed him.  I couldn't be angry at the sick little guy but I felt so desperate.  Finally I learned to tell him he was a good boy and walk away for a while, returning after I regained my composure to try again.  It takes practice to learn when you've had enough....and to walk away at that point, just for a little while. I know that you will find the strength and courage to get through this time.  I hope that the doctors are able to help your mom have a good quality of life for as long as possible. Take care, Sue",
