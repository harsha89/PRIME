    "Content": "Hi Sher, It is a tall order to add to what Dave has said. Here is how it went for me (I have multiple myeloma). I had some anxity before my chemo (everyone has to some degree), I said seranity prayer several times a day. The day of my first chemo I felt very calm and in control since that was my first day of fighting the beast back. Since then I have one more round and felt even more better, think of yourself as super human who has lots of support from your higher power, family and friends of CC and outside of CC. Tell yourself that you will not get side-effects from chemo and drink lots of water. If I read about side effects of chemo I am taking, it is scary. So I decided to read themÂ ONLY once to be aware of them. When I am getting chemo, I think of this powerful liquid flowing through my vains and killing the beast and putting it away for good. Also, we do somthing special on the chemo day. It does not have to be same very week or chemo day. Just something special. Now go and drink lots of water. Jay",
