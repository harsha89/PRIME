    "Content": "Hi Dee, I started taking Arimidex about a month and half ago and am experiencing redddish of my eyes similar to what I would look like if I had just stopped crying. I went to an eye doctor and asked about whether the medication could have resulted in the reddish and dryness and she said she didn't know. I have noticed a deterioration of my eye sight too. Don't know if that is due to medication or age or both? I am seeing another eye doctor MD for a second opinion. Maybe he will have something difinitive to share with me, I hope. Have you seen an eye doctor Thanks, Jill",
