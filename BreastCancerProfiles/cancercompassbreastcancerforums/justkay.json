    "Content": "It is known that hair can grow back a different colour, especially grey or curly after chemo. I suppose it's as though you've had a chemical perm or colour! Finished chemo in June 2006 hair started growing back about 3 months after. As soon as I got stubble on my head...off came the wig! I had thick, straight hair before chemo and when it grew back it was still thick but quite curly and only a slightly different shade of brown, a bit darker I think. I hate curly hair but everyone else seems to think I look great with it. I get it cut about every 3 months and it gets straighter every time. Â ",
