    "Content": "I'm interested in the vitamins you take. I was diagnosed with Stage 1A infiltrating low-grade ductal carcinoma. Thankfully the rumor was very small and I was able to have a lumpectomy without the need of reconstructive surgery. I am now beginning radiation treatments. I recently began Arimidex and would be interested in the vitamins you take. I also have Grave's disease which will make fatigue management more hard. I would appreciate any help if possible.",
