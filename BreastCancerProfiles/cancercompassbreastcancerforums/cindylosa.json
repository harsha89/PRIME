      "Content": "Hi all,  My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer with metastatic to the lung 2 month ago. I read that once the cancer metastasized there's a high chance that it's already spread all over the body. Also I read that early detection of other locations of metastasis will  increase survival rate. We live in a small city in Indonesia, and I think cancer treatment in our country is not as advance as other country. So I want to know how does the location of metastasis detected ? Is there any specific tests/machine to scan cancer ? What should I ask my mom's doctor about this ? ",

My whole life turned to darkest Once I heard the bad new from my mom's oncologist as her time is running out shortly.. My life is upside down. It breaks my heart. It cant be any more pain. I have cried my eyes out all days and nights. But I still believe in a miracle. My mom - love of my life - has been diagnosed stage4 grade2 Her2 positive breast cancer with the bone metastatic. She got the ulcerating breast with terrible infection. Any survivals around? I need your help. Please i need some advises. My mom was also diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer with metastatic to the lung 2 month ago. It was really devastating to our family. But, we believe that even the smallest hope is hope. Live one day at a time. She is not dying because of cancer, she is living with cancer. Cherish every day given to us. I understand that it's very hard, but you may not break, you have to support your mom. Happiness is just cure for any disease. ",
