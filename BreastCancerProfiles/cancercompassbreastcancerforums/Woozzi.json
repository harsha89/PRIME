      "Content": "Linda, Thanks for the information.  My GYN refuses to give me any thing at all, thinking it will interfere with the Femara.  She doesn't even believe in an estrogen creme, saying even a small amount can be absorbed thru the skin and counter the pill. I don't know what to believe, that does seem a bit extreme to me but you know how it is.  When you want to do everything to save your life, and a Dr says it is so, you listen.  I do see my Oncol. in a week and I will be sure to get his opinion too.  Perhaps his will be different.  Wooz",

      "Content": "Hello ladies, After reading thru postings, I quickly saw that I was not the only person to have atrophied skin kin down under.  I am 53 and had stage 2 breast cancer treatment in 1998, lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.  Then immediately started the 5 years of Tamoxifen, only to start another 5 yrs of Femara which came out just when Tamoxifen finished up for me.  So now I am into 8 yrs of this stuff and the atrophy has gotten bad.  I had taken up long distance biking post cancer and most of my activities in life (away from work) revolve around it. It is hard now to spend 20 miles on a bike let alone 75.  So I tried to take up running.  That is going pretty good but amazingly, I find that even by just running 10 miles, my vaginal skin gets aggravated.  I haven't had a mate for years  but am sure that when I am lucky enough to be blessed with one, sex will be painful.  A lttle rubbing in that area puts holes and tears in the skin that hurt for a week or two.  Yadda, yadda, you get the idea.  My gyn is aware of the problem and a few years ago she cut the skin where the clitoris is because it was fusing over.  The skin just fused together again.  I am not even sure what I am supposed to lok like down there anymore but I am sure it is all out of whack.  I now see ads for labia surgery.  Most of it is meant to be cosmetic but I am hoping there will be some available to me that will give me comfort.  Does anyone know if this condition will improve when I stop taking the Femara?  Right now, my gyn says there is nothing she can give me to treat it while I am on the drug.  So what can happen surgically and medication-wise when I am done with the Femara.  I can't wait. Woozz",
