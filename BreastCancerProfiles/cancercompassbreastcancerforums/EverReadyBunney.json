I will send a private email and give some tips. Unfortunately the lady below probably had a good suggestion but you cannot post openly on this site as you don't want private information hanging out there. Hope she sends you a private email.

She had a lumpectomy, radiations and chemo over ten years ago and her annual mammograms have all been negative(she had one two weeks ago). To make a long story short, while we were intimate recently I smelled cancer near her left breast ( my mom had breast cancer, and I will never forget the smell) She is going to get and ultrasound, probably within the month, but other than that is not taking me seriously. I am very upset about this. Am I over-reacting? I care deeply for my partner and don't want to lose her. Does anyone have any input?   Yep,  Me to.  Noticed underarms, urine and fecal smell strong and yellow in color.  Mentioned to Onc. who things I don't eat enought or eat to much green veggies.  I think he thinks I'm just a little crazy.",
