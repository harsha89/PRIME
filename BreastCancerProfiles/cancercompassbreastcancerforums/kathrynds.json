    "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for 3 years...was active during chemo and radiation.  After riding in 2 100 mile bike rides, I was put on Femara.  Within 3 weeks I had knee, then thigh, then shooting pain and throbbing in my legs.  I took myself off Femara and went back to Tamaoxifin.  I have the best physicians at Brigham and Womens in Bosotn who have not been able to figure out why, after almost 2 years I still have pain in my left legt and have gained 20 lbs because I can't exercise.  FINALLY 2 weeks ago I had MRIs of my hip and spine and found I have a lumbar spinal stenosis that looking online, Femara is known to cause.  Seems my nerves are being pinched.  Just to have a diagnosis after all of this is progress.  Everyone says...\"The Femara can't still be in your system,\"  Right...it just ruined my spine.  Not sure where I go from here.  This has been constant pain for almost 2 years with no one able to figure it out.  Well, my spine has changed...I'm sure because of the Femara. Go get MRIs of the spine!",
