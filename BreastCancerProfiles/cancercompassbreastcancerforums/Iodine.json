    "Content": "I was diagnosed in July 2003 with spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma appearing almost inside a cyst. After a lympectomy and no node involvement I was treated with A/C and taxol and 12 weeks of radiation. The A/C and taxol were dose dense which means given every two weeks. It was tough at the time I went through the chemo but things have gotten better and I am still surviving and hope to continue.... I also did complementary massage and accupuncture through the whole process and have continued the massage twice monthly. I go in for check up every six months for follow-up. I had a second opinion at Sloan Kettering at time of diagnosis and they recommended the dose dense treatment.",
