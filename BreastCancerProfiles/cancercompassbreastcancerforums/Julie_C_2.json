      "Content": "Susan H, I was dx with breast cancer 10/02 had surgery 11/02 and chemo 12/02. After all was said and done I thought my shoulder and arm would fall off. I talked to my oncologist regarding the discomfort I had and all he said was not to use it so much. After a lot of research online I found a website with some exercises for just the problem. I found that the more I used my arm the better it got. Hang in there and reach for things and stretch. I also had a physical therapist tell me to reach and stretch using the top of the door frame. Also, I live in Florida and swim in the Gulf of Mexico and swimming seems to really help. There is no effort and it doesn't hurt while in the water. Good luck. I wish you well. Julie C.",

      "Content": "Robyn, Sorry I haven't responed to your question on the website for the exercises sooner. If you are having so much trouble I think you should seek help through a physical therapist. I know my oncologist told me not to use my arm so much. How dumb is that??? I still have the numb and aching feeling but not any where near what it was. Website:www.breastclinic.co.uk/aftercare.htm I hope it is still an active site. It was last summer that I found the site. Good luck to you and I wish you well. Take care, Julie",

      "Content": "Hello Jackie, I am so sorry to hear about your breast cancer. I had breast cancer October 2002 and I remember the day they told us. I thought my whole world would end. We did a lot of research and found the best treatment besides the surgery and chemo was the support I got from my family and friends. I beleive that a positive attitude and support from family and friends helped me through this. If not for that I'm not sure I could have handled it. Please know that this is another bump in the road of life and you will cross over that bump and go on. I lost my mother to breast cancer and I remember her telling me while she was going through tx \"Life is not fair\" but if you have hope and faith it will help you understand it more. Hang on to your support group, be strong and take good care of yourself. I will be saying a prayer for you. Thoughts and prayers, Julie C",
