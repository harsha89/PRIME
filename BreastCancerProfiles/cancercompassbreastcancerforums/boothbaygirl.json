It gave me pleasure to go to my job everyday and to be around cheerful positive people who responded well to receiving the same outlook from me.  It also gave me something to focus on that wasn't my own problems. So hang in there and keep your chin up. I hope it goes well for you, and I'll be rooting for you.",

I was on another site, one that deals mostly with ovarian cancer, and there was a bit of chat about Parp . . . but it wasn't working well for the woman taking them in a trial.  However, we know nothing of her circumstances or disease. More and more it is becoming very apparent that everyone has a blend of disease specific to themselves, much like DNA is, so it is important not to be discouraged by other's results. I would be very interested to learn more about Park inhibitors.  Can anyone out there add to our base of info? Thanks!",

      "Content": "Dear confused, i am sorry that you are scared and in pain. Chances are it is not something cancerous, as often the cancerous lumps are basically silent until they get big enough to be felt manually. However it is true that standard mammos really never tell the whole story. If i were you I wouldn't rest until you get a second opinion from a doctor or clinic whose specialty is breast health. I'm not sure where you are, but there are some very good places around the country. Also, you may want to look into having a digitally enhanced thermal mammogram done. Not a lot of places have these machines, but in your case it would be worth it to find one and damn the expense. This is not the time to get stingy with the pennies.!  I know that H. Lee Moffitt in Tampa has one, so probably some of the other large institutes do too. Get a second or third or fourth opinion, and keep going until YOU are satisfied. Don't settle for anything less.",
