      "Content": "Hi i am very pleased to hear that you are doing well and beating this very rare condition, i am the same as yo diagnosed with angiosarcome induced by radiation recieved 10 years before. Went to surgeon that i had seen for 11 years with bruising on left brear same one that had the brest cancer at that time had lumpectomy chemo and radiotherapy. treatment for the angio has been misdiagnosed to begin with and i was sent away he said changes to the skin, i went back 3 months later felinfg i was being paranoid, but went anyway had biopsy taken a week later told that it was still chenges but because it was changing more the best thing to do was have a mastectomy, he said to go on holiday and so i waited 5 weeks i feel he gave me the wrong info but anyway when i came back they were still saying changes of the skin,, i told them that this is not changes to the skin this is cancer, so after the mastectomy two weeks later woke aat four in the morning and the scar had popped lots of blood and fluid, said infection well i was getting dressings done three times a week, well 2 weeks later saw another consultant and he toock another biopsy, wemt back in a week and was told that we needed to take more skin and i had anothe four biopsies and a scan that my husband had to demand, to get this action and the biopsies taken we had to make a complaint to pals which is a patient leiasson at the hospital so they new we ment business. two weeks later had op wide excition of chest wall meant to find lymph node shown on scan but didn't, well the dressing was meant to stay on 2 weeks, there was so much fluid we had to patch it up, my daughter who is seventeen said you must see them today, so i did thar was about the 7th day so they had to remove it, it didn't look as if there had been a skin graft done, i had to change dressings twice a day that over theweeks went up to four times a day going into the doctors surgery three times a week, the practice nurse and i were saying this is getting worse she phoned the hospital, and so did i, more biopsy and weeks wait i rang the hosp week later as they gavr me a letter for three weeks i really didn't want to wait that long, so i was told on tha phone that it was more angiosarcoma and that there was no cure they were refering me to a professor hassan at the oxford cancer reserch centre and that a letter had already been sent to him so i saw him two weeks later and he sorted some cream to get rid of the sluffy stuff which had grown over the wound which they kept satng did not smell but it surely did. i was popping the area to get rid of fluid buidup three times a day and it was popping at night i would get a puddle on the floor each time like my rottwieller had peedwith a full bladder. I also have been having chemo, on my fourth month, and the fluid build up and the pain and the sluffy stuff is stopped on gone, pain much improved, so i am nearly a year on and feeling reasonably good chemo is ok no side affects or sickness the chemo is paclictaxol once a week for weeks then one week off. sorry for such a long message but hope you will let me now what treatment you recieved, and how you are feeling at the moment good to hear you have done so well. Many thanks, all the very best, Ashlea",

Good luck for the future.",
