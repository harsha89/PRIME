    "Content": "This is all very interesting and I certainly appreciative all of the thoughtful comments. My mother was diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC approximately 2 months ago.  She is a lifetime non-smoker and has been on Tarceva.  We hope it is working, but won't know until her PET Scan in a few weeks. Here is my question for anyone who can answer it: I read somewhere that pumpkin is good for fighting cancer.  Does anyone know anything specific about that?  Also, does anyone know if lentils are good, bad, or indifferent?  I know that they are a good source of protein, which I believe is what my mother needs. Anyway, depending on the responses I receive, I was thinking of whipping up some big batches of pumpkin soup and lentil soup. Thanks, Robert",
