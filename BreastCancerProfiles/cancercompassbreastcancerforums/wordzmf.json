      "Content": "Hello Fellow Survivors, I'm new to this site but am overjoyed to find out I'm not alone with the aromatase inhibitor pain. I just took a holiday from approximately 2 years of Aromasin at my oncologist's suggestion. I was considering having surgery to correct a bunion because I was having so much foot and leg pain I would look for any excuse not to go for a daily walk. (Also, I used to be a runner and had given that up as well due to pain.) My doc suggested I try going off Aromasin to see if that would help before opting for a surgery that might not be the solution I was looking for. Boy, am I glad he made that suggestion! Within days of going off the Aromasin I started feeling like a new woman--the 50 I am rather than the 80 I felt. Not only did I get back to a daily 40 minute walk, I even felt like running again. The bunion was not a factor at all. I have also been having what I thought was tendinitis in both arms--that cleared up too. My fear of cancer recurrence has won out though; after a 2-week \"vacation\" I started taking the drug again. Today is my 5th day back on and I'm starting to get the stiffness and pain again. However, what I'm taking away from the experience is this: it's helped me a lot just to know that this pain is due to the drug and I didn't create it. I also found that for me it was reversible and that gave me great peace of mind. I may not be able to keep running, but I'm going to grit my teeth and keep walking. (The drug also caused so much bone density loss I had to go on Boniva this year, so I must keep up the weight-bearing exercise.) There are two things I have found helpful, so I'll pass them along: I got custom orthotics made at Foot Solutions, and they help to an extent. The pain is still there, but my feet are supported the best they can be when I have to be on them a lot.(And that's helpful for the bunion!) Also, I have considerable pain in one wrist and wear a carpal tunnel splint at night. It helps a lot.",

      "Content": "I'm taking the Aromasin after having breast cancer, but my pathology was also estrogen-receptor positive. Next week I will reach my 6th anniversary since my original diagnosis. My treatment consisted of surgery, radiation and chemo. Post treatment I took Tamoxifen for a little more than 3 years. It kept making my endometrial lining grow like grass, so I had a hysterectomy (including ovaries) to stop that. Since that made me post-menopausal, my oncologist switched me over to Aromasin in 2006. I can see why you feel different from all the breast cancer survivors taking the drug, but hang in there--you are a survivor, too. Hope you are able to tolerate the side effects and that the drug works for you.",
