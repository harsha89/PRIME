    "Content": "Hello!   I'm 34 and BRCA 1 positive.  I am almost 15 weeks pregnant and just diagnosed with Breast Cancer. Its been decided that I will start Chemo ASAP, have the baby about 37 weeks, and have a double masectomy about 3-4 weeks after delivery of the baby.  Any others in this situation or have been in this situation?  Any advise or information would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you so much!",
