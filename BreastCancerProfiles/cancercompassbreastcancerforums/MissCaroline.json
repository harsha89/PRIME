I would rather have this cancer come back and have surgery all over again than to take this Arimidex drug.  I was told that I would not have to have chemo .... duh (Arimidex is a chemotherapy drug).  I would rather have a quality of life.... and it's my life.  I would like to hear from others going thru this.  ",
