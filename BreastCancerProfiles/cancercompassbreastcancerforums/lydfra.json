    "Content": "I just had my Diagnostic mammogram completed and the results came back with the following: Additional Diagnostic evaluation confirms the presence of a cluster of calcification in the upper outer aspect of the left breast. Some of the more inferior calcifications appear to be fairly coarse. There are however a number of microcalcifications noted as one progresses superiorly and laterally within the cluster. There is also some questionable branching suggested. There is no associated mass lesion.  Conclusion: focal grouping of calcifications in the upper outer aspect of the left breast which demonstrate sufficient pleomorphism as to warrant histologic correlation at this time.  I was told that I do have extremely dense breast and was given a Birad 4. I have consult scheduled in 6 days with a breast surgeon. I am very shocked with the results. I am 42 and have no history in my family of breast cancer. I am trying to think positive but the wait and see is driving me nuts. Can someone please shed some light at to what my diagnosis is. The terminology used is very foreign to me. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you! ",
