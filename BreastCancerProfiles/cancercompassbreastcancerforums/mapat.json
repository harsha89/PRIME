      "Content": "?Book recommendation: The Complete Natural Medicine Guide to Breast Cancer-- A Practical Manual for Understanding, prevention and Care by Sat Dharam Kaur (Naturopathic Doctor) This book covers an enormous amount of information, from understanding breast cancer to the many topics we have covered here, and much much more.  Whether you have chosen strictly alternative treatment, or as complementary to standard treatments, this covers, in-depth, many, many options.  I originally got it from library, but bought my own copy from thriftbooks.com for just a few dollars. Really helps increase understanding of just what we are fighting and our options, especially natural ones,  for doing so.  ",
