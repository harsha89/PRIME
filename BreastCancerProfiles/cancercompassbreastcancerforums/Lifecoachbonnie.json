      "Content": "I have been told by several medical people that once you stop taking Herceptin, your body will go back to making the protein. That it only works while taking it....Any other views on this......While are the patients not being told about this? Could it be that this drug cost about $60,000 a year to take?    ",

      "Content": "Thank, your answer is what I was hoping for that I knew from other research. Once the Herceptin is stopped after a year, which is the standard of care now for early breast cancer my body will go back and work as it has done before the cancer in 1999 and the cancer in 2006. My tumor was 6mm this go around and in 1999 4 cm ~was only treated with A&C for 4 weeks. I am Her2 3 staining. The tumor came back in the scar line and in the same location as the first in 1999(tram flap). I have been two three hopitals and no one seems to know how to treat me. So, the current one suggested taxol for 12 weeks) & Herceptin including up to a year and the Arimidex for 5 years. I am very very low postive Er & neg PR. In 1999 I was negative on both. I am not even sure my results are correct on this past tumor)very low positive er..I was told first time that Hormone theraphy was use less for me, and that I had a 85 percent chance and then is came back.. So, thank you very much. I am not going to put myself at risk by staying on Herceptin or starting Arimidex. I just wish that the patients where being told up front that when Herceptin stops so does repressing the cancer cells if there are any. So, you are putting yoru self at risk for Heart problems, in hope of keeping the cancer from coming back. My friend is not even 40 years old yet, she had heart attact already from it.. The Arimidex is causing a lot of side effects and interfering with quality of life for many. So, we as patients have to remember that our cancer is a business for many and reseach a lot before making any personal decisions on our care....Get second opinions and third if neccessary! Thanks,  ",

      "Content": "Thank you for your note. I am still researching this product. I have a relative in the pharmacy business, that told me to take the research serioulsy before I go on it. I am trying to have a open mind. I have always been very active and able to get out of bed at  5 or so and go until dark. I don't want any more of this treatments to slow me down. I don't want to have a older in body before my time because of drugs. So, I have a lot to decide. I am happy for you that it is working. I am most likely focus on ammune system building with vitamins, exercise, changing food habits and less stress. Most other countries are having success in these area's instead of hormone treatments and destroying our bodies with chemicals. So, have to make a good decision...regarding the quality of life I want. Stay well and write again",

      "Content": "From my research and speaking to people that make this, you must already be post-meno. to do this and ER postive. Where you ER low or high postive. Your report would tell you. How large where your tumors may I ask? First time where 4 cm, second this pass March 6mm. Same breast after a Tram flap done... I was already on A&C the first time. Just finished Taxol, most likely going to not continue with Herceptin either....According to the Research by NIH and information on The Komen site, it should be suggested for node positive or 1cm tumors only. The major effect is Heart Failure....So, lots of decisions to make, when faced with this!   It has been explained to me, that all the symtoms of menoplause will come back.hot flashes, vaginal issues, skin dryness. The bone pain is very common from the message board and one of the major side effects. I am 51 and you? I am not going to take. I am too active to be slowed down by these drugs. Most women I have spoken too, by the third month they have had it with this drug and the side effects. You must ask your doctor what are your risk of return and rate of suviour with out it and most of all~What quality of life do you want to have while you do survive. This is my second time. Are you on Herceptin? thanks, for writing Bonnie",

They want to place me on Arimidex,and I have high quality of life values. I am almost 51 and I am very concerned about these bad side effects vs the real risk of really increasing my risk of long term survial. From what I am ready it is most likely going to make me, feel like 70 with the joint pain and bring back all the menoplause stuff, that has been long gone. Any body feeling like me?  ",

      "Content": "Hi, this is my second time with breast cancer same breast after, tram flap and 4 rounds of A&C strongest chemo given. In March I had another tumor in the same area as the first along the scar line. Just had lump removed. It was invasive in the breast area so I did radiation and just finished 12 weeks of taxol....It was worse then the first go around. So, my thoughts have been that it has destroyed my body, immune sytem, and these drugs are effecting a DNA that no ones ever tells us about. You have to really rely on your gut, and do research on what other countries are doing for cancer. They focus on the immune system. Are you Her 2 postive? ER & Pr postive? So, I did Taxol & Herceptin for 12 weeks together. I am supposed to do Herceptive for year every 3 weeks, but it has major heart issues. I belive we must really research......I am 51 and you may I ask. The personal answer I can give you is, ask yourself about your quality of life and what you want to do with rest of your life and how do you want to feel? I have been to three hospitals, because my case is so unusual. Have you gotten a second opinion? Write back Bonnie  ",
