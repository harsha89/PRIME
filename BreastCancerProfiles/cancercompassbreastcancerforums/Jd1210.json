    "Content": "My wife (48 yrs old) was diganosed with Spindle cell metaplastic breast cancer in 11/05. There is really a lack of information on this disease. Basically she decided to have a double mastecomy in March. She has refused chemo and radiation. We could not find any data supporting chemo. An onclogist described this disease as a sarcoma. They did offer traditional breast cancer chemo/radiation, but my opinion (I am surly NOT a doctor) is this disease is sarcoma in a breast, not \"breast cancer\". She feels fine, other than some mild pain in the mussle tissue where the breast were. Good luck finding a cancer center, we used the University of Pennsylvania system. One oncologist we saw in Philadelphia said their office sees 3,500 patints a year, and maybe 3-4 people with this disease every 5 years. I suspect that you will find out yourself that this is a very rare cancer.",
