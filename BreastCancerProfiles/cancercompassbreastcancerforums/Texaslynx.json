Nipple comes next. Throughout my entire cancer journey, my rib cage has been tender, but more so lately.  Is this possible still a year later?  My bra hurts it, and every once in awhile I will get those throbbing pain under the rib cage but most of the time it just aches. It even looks like it sticks out more on that side. Of course I am terrified of bone mets or even liver mets and will ask my onco when I go next month, but my husband keeps reminding me that this has bothered me the whole time--I just think it is worse now.  Some people have said rib cage pain is common--just wondering if it would continue even a year later?  Ache is not bad enough to take anything...maybe an Ibuprofen or something. Also, it does not seem to hurt as much when i get up. Any advice to help my sanity would be great. By the way, I did not have chemo or radiation, nor do i take any pills. Cancer was a wierd one, with a 6 cm tumor. Surgeon told me she was very aggressive in getting all the tissue out. your help is appreciated!   Molly    Hi molly Our situation is similar..single mastectomy on right large mass,some nodes removed lympadema now.  you are probably the only person I have heard that had no chemo/radiation. Just removal.. exactly like me.. would love to bend your ear.. now 6 months later decided to look into reconstruction  and the reconstruction doc. Freaked and said I was not given proper medical care. Since no chemo etc..  sent me to 2 doc. Asap to discuss treatment.  But I had a petscan it was clear.. all boggled.  Reconstruction doc. Doesn't want to do my surgery for fear factors since I have gone against protocols.. did you experience this.. and I have extreme amounts of rib and back pain just started 3 weeks ago. After resuming my normal life ,working with my horses,cleaning stalls etc.. pain is sometimes so bad I feel as if I have a broken rib.. but then pain moves to other side. So I know it is muscle,ligament,  issues all around bra area.. ",
