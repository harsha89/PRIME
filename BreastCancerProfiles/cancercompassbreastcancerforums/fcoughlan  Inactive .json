    "Content": "My sister had her mastectomy in 2004 - since then she has twice battled bone metastases and recently meningeal cancer.  Now there is a brain tumour and her lungs and kidneys are invovled and she has ascites fluid and her bone cancer is active again.  In a period of three weeks she is now pretty much bed ridden although we can get her in to a wheel chair for short periods.  she has lost more than 20% of her bodyweight in six months, she is confused.  She has very little pain.   No one has asked the \"how long?\" question.  I would like to know ... even just a ball park",
