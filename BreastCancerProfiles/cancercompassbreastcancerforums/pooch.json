    "Content": "I am responding to the messages from women who had adverse reactions to Zometa.  I just had my 1st  IV treatment in Nov. 2008 & had absolutely no side effects at all.  I've been on Arimidex for about 13 months after going off Tamoxifen when I had an adverse reaction.  I hated Tamoxifen; I had a 24/7 appettite while on it & gained a bunch of weight.  I've had a positive experience w/ the Arimidex & NO side effects.  While on the Arimidex I've been able to lose 47 lbs. & exercise at CURVES every day.  I also take 400 mg of Coenzyme Q10 which was recommended by a 5-yr. Breast Cancer survivor...when I looked it up online I read all kinds of positive things.  I mentioned it to my Oncologist who replied that he had many patients taking CoQ10 but it was not something he could give me an Rx for as it has not been FDA approved.  When I started taking the CoQ10 I rapidly regained my energy which I had lost during Chemo/Radiation & Tamoxifen.  Today I feel WONDERFUL & Full of energy; I used to go to bed at 8:30 every night but now I can stay up until 11 PM  or later if I want & don't feel horrible the next day.   I don't remember what my screen name is so i'll just go by Shayna.",
