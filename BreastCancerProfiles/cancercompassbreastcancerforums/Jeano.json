      "Content": "Hope you have received the answers to your questions by now. I had a masectomy last April with 15 lymph nodes cancerous and removed. Then had 2 different chemos and 35 rounds of radiation. Have been told my cancer has come back strong already and am now on Arimidex. Understand lymphema has to do with the swelling of the arm after the removal of the lymph nodes. I am grateful I have not had that happen. Right now just daily dealing with the pain (most likely from the medications I am on) and the extreme nausea. One day at a time. Have you started your chemo? And how are you doing with it? Keep your hope up. God Bless you. Jean O",

I did not have a Dr. Ketterl but had Dr. Citrin but was very pleased with his aggresiveness with my cancer and also his attitude. Everyone at the Cancer Center is very positive and treat the whole person. Please be encouraged. I went there after being told there was \"no light for me at the end of the tunne\" by my local oncologist but last month was told at the cancer center that my petscan was clear for the 1st time. Now am on Arimidex and trying to regain my strength and appreciate each day the Lord gives me.",

      "Content": "Mary - are you going to the Cancer Center? They seem to be so helpful on all areas. I have been there twice and they refused to give me more chemo in March even though my oncologist here in town almost insisted on it. As you said, it had to do with the quality of life. I have tried Darvocet but got sick off of it. Am considering acupunture which they also do at the Cancer Center but it is so expensive here with no ins. help. Each of us are different. My sister died 17 yrs. ago from breast cancer and she had a strong threshold of pain and would take little meds until the end. I am not like that and hope you don't feel weak because you are different from your mother. God bless you in your decision. Jean",
