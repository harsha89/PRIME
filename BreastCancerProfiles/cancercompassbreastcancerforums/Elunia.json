    "Content": "Dear Theresa I deeply symphatise with you.Having a loved one diagnosed with cancer is not an easy thing to swallow. I have ovarian cancer 1C/grade 3 had NO metastasi.I refused chemo and other meds prescribed by my Oncologist . The situation your MOM is has nothing to do with Ceragem massage bed.I have one and my cancer did not come back I use it a lot.. Oncology department where your Mom was diagnosed did a SLOPPY job treating your Mom properly.It's OK to have chemo but also have apositive and nourishing diet. They don't want you to know that. I base this statement on my own experience with oncology department in one of the Cancer Centres in Canada. Your Mom had cancer metastasized to her Nodes after the treatment of chemo.No wonder....chemo if you read all about it is a very toxic stuff that they put in your Mom's vains.This toxic sludge KILLS fast multiplying cells and other cells in your body. Your body needs good nourishing fuel to recouperate after the bombardment with chemo.So, my guess is:cancer was stronger after chemo then BEFORE because your MOM was poisoned with chemo first and how do yoy think that works.Guess. I changed my diet completely I do not eat: white sugar(sugar FEEDS cance-Honey is OK but raw honey and little a day), white flour, processed foods,do not drink coffee-period! (I do coffee enemas every day) I do not smoke and drink alkohol not even a sip..No chips, cookies, pastries. No sweetened juices etc.etc. If you need more info What I do to help myself with my cancer write to me at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
