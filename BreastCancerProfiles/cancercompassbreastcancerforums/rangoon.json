    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am happy to have found the message board. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004. Last month I was told I have Liver and Bone Mets. I was having blurring vision and a droopy eye so an MRI was ordered. Yesterday I was diagnosed with CM. After reading what's on the internet and how fatal CM is...I'm really scared. I'm seeing a Neuro Specialist at the Mass General Hospital next week and hope to get more information for my treatment. Right now, I'm on Xeloda, every 2 weeks withÂ 1 week off, and 1x a month Zomeda. The Xeloda is helping the symptoms of the CM (blurring vision, disorientation, etc). I've been off Xeloda for the lat 2 days and I've noticed that my vision has digressed. If anyone wants to contact me please do so. I would love to hear from others who are going through this.
