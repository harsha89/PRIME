    "Content": "Hello, My mother in law has stage four breast cancer. She has had four treatments of Perjeta and Taxotere.  Clinically she is responding very well, not so much with side effects.  One thing has stumped us.  Within the last few days her breast that has the cancer has significantly decreased in size and now is much smaller than the\"healthy one\".  I have googled everything i can imagine and even spent thirty minutes on the phone with someone fro American Cancer Society who couldnt help me! Hasanyone else experiencedthis side effect? She will beable to call doctor tomorrow, but doesn't seem very common. Thank you for any input.",
