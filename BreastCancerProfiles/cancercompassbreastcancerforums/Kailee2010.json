Yes I'm for sure going to get another doctor! I called my doc back today to ask a few more questions. Cause he was the One in the beginning that something was def. Wrong with my left Brest and now since I only got the ultrasound done and he hasn't got the results back yet, he is telling me I need to move on with my life. When I am not feeling well and I'm week feeling and there has been changes in my left breast. I just don't understand. I feel like he should try harder to figure out if there is something there! I know I'm very young for someone to get breast cancer, but i want to know why my breast is doing what it is not the answer I need to move on with my life. It's so hard tho making my mind up with what i want to do?",

Reinventing the wheel is not the answer... Gayle I agree with Gayle. Please find a doctor that will give you a mammogram. They are great in detecting early malignancies when they are most curable. I can understand you being scared. I have been in that boat many times. Please update us with what you find out. (((hugs))) Conniethank everyone for giving me some advice on what to do! I also was just looking at my breast yesterday like I raised my arms and stuff in the mirror and I noticed that where I found the lump it's dimpled in a lil not to noticeable but def diff and it's a lighter color then the rest of the skin on my breast. I am going to try and get in a different doctor Monday but it's just so hard to find a doctor that can get me in soon. I'm scared I always talk about it cause it's hard not to but my husband and my family don't like talking about it. I'll keep everyone updated!",

      "Content": "my name is kailee, in 2009 I got into a car wreck and 1 month later I found out I was pregnant. During that time my nipple started inverting on my left breast so it hasn't all was been that way. Now when my nipples get hard my left nipple does not come out and it is painful. I never got it checked out because I never really thought anything of it. Well about two weeks ago I was holding my daughter and she had her head on my left breast when she lifted her head that breast was sore. I stared to feel around and I found a pee size hard lump in that breast. I told my mom and she told me to get it checked ASAP. Breast cancer runs in my family on both sides. I ended up going to the doctor today. Felt the same as me and told me something was def wrong and ify nipple hasn't always been that way then something is for sure diff. He referred me to get a mammogram at the breast center that day. Once I waited, got in the room thinking I was getting a mammogram the nurse told me the doc in their office thought I was to young to get one so he was going to do a ultrasound. He did one and told me I have dense and fibrese breast and that could mean that I'm prone later to get breast cancer, but he isn't worried cause I'm young! Well if my breast has had a sudden change and is getting painful and I'm prone to get breast cancer why is he not worried? I'm not sure what to do? I'm stressing myself and feel like there is really somethig wrong! But scared to go and ask more questions? Anyone have advice for me??? Thanks for taking time and reading!",
