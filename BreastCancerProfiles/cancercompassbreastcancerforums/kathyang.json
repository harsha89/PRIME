    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer February, 2014, had a lumpectomy in April 2014, followed by 4 chemo and 30 radiation treatments.  I started taking Anastrozle on 10/31/14.  Like a lot of you are saying I had no side effects until about 6 weeks ago.  I was questioning whether or not I was imagining the symptoms since it seemed so strange for them to start almost a year later.  I'm glad I found this site.  I feel better mentally knowing that the delayed side effects are, unfortunately, normal. Most days I have the feeling that you get right before you get the flu.  Headache and body aches pretty much everyday.  Atfirsttaking Advil or Aleve helped the aching but not so much now.  Sleeping through the night is a whole other story.  I will see my oncologist in about a month. Like a lot of you said I too do not want to stop the medication.  The plan is to stay on it for 5 years. I don't know how long I can stand feeling this way.  It's very frustrating.",
