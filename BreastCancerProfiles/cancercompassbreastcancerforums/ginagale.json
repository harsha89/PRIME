The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G After 3 years, the hot flashes have not gotten better, but I am determined to take the Arimidex.  I am getting better results taking 1200 IU of Vit E daily. Black cohosh caused headaches.  The swollen ankles come and go, it does not seem to be tied to diet or anything like that.  The swelling will last about 3-4 days then go away, only to show up again.  Has anyone taking Arimidex experienced pain throughout the body, feels like blood veins are aching, last a few minutes and then always followed by hot flash with profuse sweating? I've tried to think of how to describe the feeling in my body that usually begins in lower legs and moves upward, then the hot flash. \"Feels like blood veins are aching\" is the best description I've heard. I don't have the profuse sweating, just the hot feeling all over body. My oncologist has me taking 2000IU of Vitamin D3.  Post surgery I was stared on Femara but the joint pain and stiffness was intolerable. My oncologist switched me to Arimidex and the side effects are still there but not as bad as with the Femara. Lately the stiffness is getting worse but my 5 years will be up in 7 more months. I'm very encouraged by the messages I've been reading that state their aches and pains mostly subsided when the medication was stopped.",
