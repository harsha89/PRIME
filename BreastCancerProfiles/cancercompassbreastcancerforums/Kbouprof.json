    "Content": "Hello-   I am a researcher from the University of Oklahoma who is studying on-line social support for health-related issues. Despite the large number of groups dealing with health-related topics in recent years, there is relatively little information about people's perceptions of the usefulness of these groups.   If you would like to participate in a brief survey about on-line support groups, the link to the survey is:   http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/W/Kevin.B.Wright-1/supportnet2.h   All responses are anonymous, and I am willing to provide participants with information about the study results once it is completed. In addition, I would be happy to answer any questions to related to what is currently known about on-line social support.   Thank you,   Kevin",
