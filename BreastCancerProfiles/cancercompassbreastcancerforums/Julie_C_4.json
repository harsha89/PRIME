      "Content": "Hi Candace, I know how you feel about the feeling of having a safety net. I have colon cancer. I was diagnosed in Nov. of 2000. I had a complete hysterectomy in April of 2002,and through biopsies, I learned that the colon cancer had spread to my right ovary. My oncologist told me to \"go live my life\" in Aug of 2001 after initial chemo. Well there were no follow-up tests done, and the cancer had spread. I'm not telling you this for you to assume the worst. I just want you to make sure your doctor orders whatever tests are necessary. I felt worse when I learned the cancer had spread. If it had not been for my gynecologist ordering biopsies on the ovaries, I don't know if I would still be here today. I'm still seeing the same doctor, only now I am assertive about scans etc. I am doing quite well now. There is no measurable cancer in my body. I guess when you're on chemo, you do feel safer, but you have to be positive, and advocate for yourself. After all you've been through, take some time to celebrate. I wish you good Luck Julie C.",

      "Content": "Hello Holly, I guess it's not that uncommon for people to experience depression/anxiety when they have cancer. I had this even before I was diagnosed with colon cancer in Nov of 2000. Have you discussed these feelings with your doctor? Maybe he or she can give you a mild medication to help you through. I myself hate meds, and I chose not to take any, but for some they can help. Sometimes, support groups are beneficial too. Sharing your concerns with others,and knowing you're not alone can lift your spirits. I experienced such feelings, and I felt like I was in limbo as far as my future was concerned. I just try to stay as positive as I can and I am thankful for each day I have. Good luck to you Julie C.",
