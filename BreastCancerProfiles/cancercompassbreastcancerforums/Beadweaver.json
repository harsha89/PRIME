    "Content": "Hi Danka, I had a rad masectomy on my left breast when I was 40 years old. I am now 56. I had no active nodes but still did chemo for 9 months (that was a yuch). I think it was a year later that the Tomoxofen study came out and my doctor had me on it for 5 years.I had no side effects, no problems. Since then I have been on Evista to maintain bone mass. No problems, no side effects.",
