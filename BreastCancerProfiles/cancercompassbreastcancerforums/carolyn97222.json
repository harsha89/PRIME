      "Content": "NORMAL mammogram - URGENT - READ THIS DX April 2008, 60 yrs., Right Breast - 2 Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma tumors, diameters 9.5 & 3.5 mm, Nuclear grade 3, ER & PR +, HER negative, Lymph vascular involvement Node positive (8/21), Right Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) April 2008   I am 61 years old and have had at least 30+ normal mammograms. In fact in Jan. I had a \"normal\" mammogram and ultrasound. BUT, I knew something was wrong because I had dimpling and an inverted nipple in one breast. I had pain in both breasts, and I had heard that breast cancer was not painful so I wasn't worried. Boy, was I wrong! Because of the dimpling and inverted nipple, they did an MRI. I was shocked to find out that the one breast had a 4\" and a 1.5\" tumor - basically, my whole breast was full of the two tumors. It was estimated that I had the large tumor for 15-20 years. Later I was told that I had dense, fibrous breasts and that's why all of the mammograms were normal. Recently, I told my 40-yr old daughter to demand an MRI after her normal mammogram and ultrasound. It was discovered that she had a 1/2\" tumor! So, if you know of anyone that has been told they have dense, fibrous breast tissue, tell them to demand an MRI in order to get a much more accurate exam of their breasts. This could save thousands of lives a year! I went thru 6 treatments (3 weeks apart) of (ACT): Adriamyacin, Taxotere, & Cytoxan with a Neulasta shot the next day to increase my white blood cells.  I made a chart and kept a daily list of side effects for digestion, fatigue, pain, sleep, bowels, etc.  It made it so easy to tell the doctor what days I was having problems.  During treatment it seemed that the 4 thru the 10th days after treatment were the worse for me - I lost 8-10 lbs. each time, and I gained it back the next 2 weeks.    I had 6 weeks between chemo ending and radiation starting.  I have finished the radiation, and now I am on Femara (hormone suppressor) for 5 yrs. and Boneva (bone strengthener) for the rest of my life.    Suggestions include:     *  have a port installed in your chest for chemotherapy.  It makes treatment so much easier.           *  ask your doctor or nurse for a prescription for Emla cream - it numbs the skin for your port and any blood draws.  You need to put it on 1.5 to 2 hours prior to the treatment - put saran wrap around it to prevent staining your clothes.       *  I suffered no chemobrain like a lot of patients.  I contribute that to the fact that every night I used my brain a lot by playing Scrabble and other games.         *  The thought of losing my hair was much worse than the actual loss.  I fought to keep it as long as I could.  I used a hair net nightly and was very gentle with my hair.        *  You can purchase inexpensive wigs from a site that the American Cancer Society recommends:       www.tlcDirect.org       *  You need to watch your diet (these are things my         medical oncologist @ OHSU (in the top 100         hospitals in US) has me doing:               *  cut out all sugar - cancer feeds on sugar               *  don't eat grapefruit or grapefruit juice                   during chemo and/or radiation               *  don't take any antioxidant vitamins                          during chemo and/or radiation.

I am scarred to death of Adriamycin. Has someone had experience with this? I have had a real hard time in chemo, ending up in the hospital with neutropenic fever. I am giving myself Neutopen injections. Also I have a bad itchy rash I am taking antibiotics for. Please, help me. Blessings, Bonnie I had the same diagnosis as you do.  I completed 6 treatments 3 wks apart of Cytoxin and Taxatere and Adriamycin (TAC) which ended the end of Sept.  I didn't have nausua - I took Emend which worked great.  I did pretty good on TAC until the last month which I suffered severe fatigue - I was unable to stand for longer than 5 min, needed a handicap cart when out shopping.  The fatigue continued for about 1-2 months after treatment ended.  I started to get my strength back, and am doing quite well now.    Good Luck - You are in my prayers!

      "Content": "  On 11/28/2008 trehouse60 wrote: Hi Bonniee, Actually, there is LOT that you CAN eat, so rather than give you sample menus, I'll just tell you good food choices. Fruit:  Any kind of berry is great, and you should eat berries as much as you can - just avoid added sugar (fructose or honey is ok.)  Tart cherries (black cherries) or tart cherry extract are excellent choices. Any Citrus fruit - except grapefruit and bananas (unless you need them for the potassium - then one banana a day is ok.)  Especially papaya and pineapple - either eat the raw fruit or get extracts (papaya tablets and bromelaine extract.) Lemons and limes are great. Apples - the more sour apples are better.  No more than 1 large or 2 small to medium apples/day, and eat both the skin and the seeds.  Cantelope provides needed vitamins plus vitamin B-17.  Seeded Grapes - concord are best, but red or black will do - eat the skins and the seeds (try to get organic grapes, if not - wash well with warm soapy water and rinse, rinse, rinse.)  If you can't get seeded grapes, use Welch's 100% concord frozen grape juice concentrate, and make it with steam-distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water. (Any kind of water with chlorine in it is a no-no for drinking and cooking.) Black currants are a great choice. DO NOT eat pomegranate or drink pomegranate juice.  Juices:  Welch's concord as mentioned above.  Mangosteen, noni, goji.  NO orange juice unless unsweetened and then only a little bit. DO drink Lemonade from unsweetened 100% pure lemon frozen concentrate or actual squeezed lemons - mix with pure water. Apple cider vinegar:  get an organic brand, use as much as you can tolerate as often as you can tolerate, on salads, vegetables, in cooking.  If you can tolerate it, drink a tsp in an 8 oz glass water/day.  Apple cider vinegar extract tablets are ok, too. Vegetables:  cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kale, spinach, endive, radishes, beets (pickled beets are ok, but not Harvard beets - too much sugar added.)  Carrots in moderation ( no more than 1 medium carrot/day).  Celery in moderation.  Lettuces and greens.  Asparagus. Cabbage. Bok choy and chinese cabbage.  Parsnips (but not turnips.) Peppers - red, orange or yellow are best as green peppers can cause a lot of heartburn, especially with chemo. AVOID peas and corn and sugar snap peas . Lima beans , snow peas, are ok but in small amounts infrequently.   NO SPROUTS. Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes - as many as you can eat, in whatever form you can eat. If you can't get tomatoes, get a lycopene supplement and follow the label directions. Rhubarb is an excellent choice - as little sweetener as possible to make it palatable.  Sweetener: organic crystallized fructose - available at health food stores, some grocery stores in the organic/health food aisle, and online.  Can be used for cooking and on cereal, in tea, etc.  Use as little as possible. The herb stevia is an excellent choice.  You can also use very small amounts of pure honey and pure maple syrup.  AVOID:  nutrasweet, aspartame, phenylalanine, any kind of artificial sweetener.  Dairy:  as little dairy as possible.  For milk, raw goats milk is the best choice.  Raw cow's milk or sheep's milk is ok.  If you can't get raw, you need to try to find organic milk from grass fed cows that are not given any hormones. 100% organic butter rather than any kind of margarine. Any kind of cheese should be organic - hard cheeses are a better choice than soft (except cottage cheese, which I will address later.)  Limit intake of cheese.  Ice cream IS NOT a good choice, although a little bit now and then is ok.   YOGURT should be limited, and should be unsweetened - no more than once or twice a week, unless you want to use it with flax seed instead of cottage cheese (see below.) Eggs:  organic, farm fresh from range fed chickens. No need to limit intake, but should be soft-cooked  - just enough to be done, as too much heat destroys the sulfur, protein and other nutrients in the egg.Try to eat at least one egg a day. AVOID HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.  AVOID ALL FORMS OF SODA POP.  (Exception:  ginger ale or lemon-lime soda if needed for nausea or heartburn.) Nuts and seeds:  almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts are ok. Apricot kernels are an excellent source of vitamin b-17, if you can tolerate eating 5 - 6 a day (if not, don't worry about it.)   Roasted pumpkin seeds are a great source of omega fatty acids and protein - see my blog.  Squash seeds can be roasted the same way. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/roasted Avoid sunflower seeds, peanuts and brazil nuts.  NO peanutbutter.  Oils:  100% pure organic virgin expeller-pressed coconut oil from raw coconuts (not dried chopra.)  Expensive, but absolutely the very best choice of oils - melts at a much lower temp, so you won't need to use as much.  Can be used for cooking, salads - even on your skin - anything that you would use any other kind of oil.  Next best choice is 100% pure organic extra virgin olive oil. Avoid:  safflower oil, corn oil, any kind of vegetable oil that has hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated fats (also known as trans fats.) Linseed oil = flax oil - I do not advise using it. Meats:  the less, the better, although if you go totally meatless, you do need to supplement with a good vitamin b-12 (see my blog, \"buzzing the B's - vitamin b-12).  I totally avoid fish and sea food - the earth's water supply is drastically contaminated, and it gets into the fish.  Wild Alaska salmon, or any fish/sea food that comes from far northern very deep cold waters would be the best choice if you want to do fish.  I recommend fish no more than once a week. If you want to supplement with fish oil, I recommend krill oil - very expensive, but really the only way to ensure that you are getting uncontaminated fish oil. Chicken - best if range fed that isn't given any hormones.   Beef - needs to be grass fed without hormones.  Pork - not a good choice.  Lamb/mutton - infrequent. The average person in industrialized nations eats WAAAAAAY too much meat - I recommend maximum intake of 3 - 4 ounces of meat 3 - 4 times/week.   Turkey needs to be range fed without hormones. Be very careful with organ meats - no more than once a month.  Beans/legumes (except peas):  as much as you can stand to eat.  Dried organic beans/legumes  are the best choice - soak in pure water before cooking (soak at least 8 hours to break down the components that cause bloating/gas.)  This is a major source of protein and roughage, and contains MANY cancer fighters.  Beans and legumes cooked with onions and garlic add an extra boost. Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Grains: Organic brown rice is best, otherwise long-grain rice.  (White rice is a poor choice.) Whole grains:  wheat, oats, spelt, etc - I have an article on my blog listing good choices.  Avoid, white flour and processed pastas - whole wheat or spinach pasta is ok.  Cous-cous is ok. Buckwheat pancakes is an excellent choice - go ahead and use butter and maple syrup on them!  Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Chocolate:   dark chocolate that is at least 70% cacao is an excellent choice.  NOT fattening, but offers a lot of cancer-fighting nutrients.  ALCOHOL:  avoid ALL alcohol except red wine.  3 - 4 ounces of red to dark red table wine/day is ok - will help fight the cancer - the sugar in the wine carries the phytochemicals to the cancer cells, so is ok. Do not use a beverage wine for this - way too sweet.  I use Taylor Lake Country Red Table Wine -  that is the very least tannin content and sweetness you want.  Anything that's darker or dryer would also be ok. Juicing/smoothies:  - a great way to get nutrition fast.   add a 1/2 tsp organic powdered brewer's yeast, and powdered lecithin for nutrition. You may need to add just a little fructose or honey with these to make it palatable, and it's good to add some crushed ice.  Barley grass powder or wheat grass powder are also very powerful additives. If you don't juice or make smoothies, I suggest you supplement with barley grass or wheat grass tablets.  Just remember to take with food. SOY:  I would avoid completely. FLAX:  breakfast only - this is my routine: I make sure to eat no later than 1 hour before going to bed. I do not eat or drink anything other than water  for another 8 - 10 hours.  First thing when I get up - a handful of grapes with seeds (concord, red or black grapes.)  If I can't get grapes, I use 6 - 8 ounces of Welch's 100% pure concord grape concentrate - non-pasteurized, mixed with steam-distilled water.  THen I eat about 1/2 cup small curd cottage cheese (organic when I can get it) with no more than 1 tsp ground flax seed. I add salt and pepper for taste, and I sometimes throw in  no more than 1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds or a small handful of dried black currants. Cranberries would work just as well.  I drink 10 ounces of brewed green and black tea - I just use 1 green tea bag and 1 black tea bag, and I steep it pretty strong, adding fructose to taste. . (you could do one or the other if you don't like them combined.) COOKING tips:  as much as you can, use onions (fresh, frozen, or powdered or minced), garlic (fresh or powdered - but not garlic salt), crushed red pepper, turmeric, and cumin. If you don't like cooking with onions or garlic, or if you're getting chemo and can't handle the spice food, I recommend you take an odorless garlic supplement. Fresh, raw, organic fruits and veggies are the very best choice - but not always possible.  Flash frozen is the next best choice - canneries do a pretty thorough job of washing fruits and veggies before freezing them, and with todays technology, everything you get in the freezer section is now being flash frozen, except ice cream and dairy products.   Canned (unless home canned in glass jars) - should be the very last choice.  Exception is tomatoes - but try to buy brands that do not have the plastic coating inside the can, as this is broken down by the acids in the tomatoes.  If there is anything specific that I haven't mentioned, and you want to know if it's ok to eat, just send me a message.  I'm not sure where you live, so don't know what regional foods you might choose.   I have a few recipes on my blog - they are all ok for anyone with cancer to use. Take a look at my series on the B-vitamins \"The Buzz on the B's\" - there are like 8 or 9 articles (I don't have my B-17 article published yet, and that one may take a while - have hit a few road blocks!)  Unless I have specifically mentioned to avoid something above, ALL of the foods that I list in the vitamin B articles are ok to eat.  Look at the articles on ancient seeds and grains, and on functional foods.  Take a look at the Lemon Volcano Drink (enter that in the search box - it will pull up several articles - one has a recipe.)  That is an excellent detoxifier, if you can stand to do it with the cayenne pepper.  It provides the cancer fighting benefits of citric acid , capcaisin in the pepper, and maple syrup. In fact, I recommend that you read through the whole blog, as you get time.  I've scattered cancer fighting information, including a lot about foods, throughout just about everything I've written on the blog.  There also is other advise, such as incorporating humor and laughter, exercise, detoxification, etc. I cannot emphasize enough that you need to be drinking plenty of fresh pure water.

      "Content": "  On 11/28/2008 trehouse60 wrote: Hi Bonniee, Actually, there is LOT that you CAN eat, so rather than give you sample menus, I'll just tell you good food choices. Fruit:  Any kind of berry is great, and you should eat berries as much as you can - just avoid added sugar (fructose or honey is ok.)  Tart cherries (black cherries) or tart cherry extract are excellent choices. Any Citrus fruit - except grapefruit and bananas (unless you need them for the potassium - then one banana a day is ok.)  Especially papaya and pineapple - either eat the raw fruit or get extracts (papaya tablets and bromelaine extract.) Lemons and limes are great. Apples - the more sour apples are better.  No more than 1 large or 2 small to medium apples/day, and eat both the skin and the seeds.  Cantelope provides needed vitamins plus vitamin B-17.  Seeded Grapes - concord are best, but red or black will do - eat the skins and the seeds (try to get organic grapes, if not - wash well with warm soapy water and rinse, rinse, rinse.)  If you can't get seeded grapes, use Welch's 100% concord frozen grape juice concentrate, and make it with steam-distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water. (Any kind of water with chlorine in it is a no-no for drinking and cooking.) Black currants are a great choice. DO NOT eat pomegranate or drink pomegranate juice.  Juices:  Welch's concord as mentioned above.  Mangosteen, noni, goji.  NO orange juice unless unsweetened and then only a little bit. DO drink Lemonade from unsweetened 100% pure lemon frozen concentrate or actual squeezed lemons - mix with pure water. Apple cider vinegar:  get an organic brand, use as much as you can tolerate as often as you can tolerate, on salads, vegetables, in cooking.  If you can tolerate it, drink a tsp in an 8 oz glass water/day.  Apple cider vinegar extract tablets are ok, too. Vegetables:  cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kale, spinach, endive, radishes, beets (pickled beets are ok, but not Harvard beets - too much sugar added.)  Carrots in moderation ( no more than 1 medium carrot/day).  Celery in moderation.  Lettuces and greens.  Asparagus. Cabbage. Bok choy and chinese cabbage.  Parsnips (but not turnips.) Peppers - red, orange or yellow are best as green peppers can cause a lot of heartburn, especially with chemo. AVOID peas and corn and sugar snap peas . Lima beans , snow peas, are ok but in small amounts infrequently.   NO SPROUTS. Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes - as many as you can eat, in whatever form you can eat. If you can't get tomatoes, get a lycopene supplement and follow the label directions. Rhubarb is an excellent choice - as little sweetener as possible to make it palatable.  Sweetener: organic crystallized fructose - available at health food stores, some grocery stores in the organic/health food aisle, and online.  Can be used for cooking and on cereal, in tea, etc.  Use as little as possible. The herb stevia is an excellent choice.  You can also use very small amounts of pure honey and pure maple syrup.  AVOID:  nutrasweet, aspartame, phenylalanine, any kind of artificial sweetener.  Dairy:  as little dairy as possible.  For milk, raw goats milk is the best choice.  Raw cow's milk or sheep's milk is ok.  If you can't get raw, you need to try to find organic milk from grass fed cows that are not given any hormones. 100% organic butter rather than any kind of margarine. Any kind of cheese should be organic - hard cheeses are a better choice than soft (except cottage cheese, which I will address later.)  Limit intake of cheese.  Ice cream IS NOT a good choice, although a little bit now and then is ok.   YOGURT should be limited, and should be unsweetened - no more than once or twice a week, unless you want to use it with flax seed instead of cottage cheese (see below.) Eggs:  organic, farm fresh from range fed chickens. No need to limit intake, but should be soft-cooked  - just enough to be done, as too much heat destroys the sulfur, protein and other nutrients in the egg.Try to eat at least one egg a day. AVOID HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.  AVOID ALL FORMS OF SODA POP.  (Exception:  ginger ale or lemon-lime soda if needed for nausea or heartburn.) Nuts and seeds:  almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts are ok. Apricot kernels are an excellent source of vitamin b-17, if you can tolerate eating 5 - 6 a day (if not, don't worry about it.)   Roasted pumpkin seeds are a great source of omega fatty acids and protein - see my blog.  Squash seeds can be roasted the same way. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/roasted Avoid sunflower seeds, peanuts and brazil nuts.  NO peanutbutter.  Oils:  100% pure organic virgin expeller-pressed coconut oil from raw coconuts (not dried chopra.)  Expensive, but absolutely the very best choice of oils - melts at a much lower temp, so you won't need to use as much.  Can be used for cooking, salads - even on your skin - anything that you would use any other kind of oil.  Next best choice is 100% pure organic extra virgin olive oil. Avoid:  safflower oil, corn oil, any kind of vegetable oil that has hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated fats (also known as trans fats.) Linseed oil = flax oil - I do not advise using it. Meats:  the less, the better, although if you go totally meatless, you do need to supplement with a good vitamin b-12 (see my blog, \"buzzing the B's - vitamin b-12).  I totally avoid fish and sea food - the earth's water supply is drastically contaminated, and it gets into the fish.  Wild Alaska salmon, or any fish/sea food that comes from far northern very deep cold waters would be the best choice if you want to do fish.  I recommend fish no more than once a week. If you want to supplement with fish oil, I recommend krill oil - very expensive, but really the only way to ensure that you are getting uncontaminated fish oil. Chicken - best if range fed that isn't given any hormones.   Beef - needs to be grass fed without hormones.  Pork - not a good choice.  Lamb/mutton - infrequent. The average person in industrialized nations eats WAAAAAAY too much meat - I recommend maximum intake of 3 - 4 ounces of meat 3 - 4 times/week.   Turkey needs to be range fed without hormones. Be very careful with organ meats - no more than once a month.  Beans/legumes (except peas):  as much as you can stand to eat.  Dried organic beans/legumes  are the best choice - soak in pure water before cooking (soak at least 8 hours to break down the components that cause bloating/gas.)  This is a major source of protein and roughage, and contains MANY cancer fighters.  Beans and legumes cooked with onions and garlic add an extra boost. Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Grains: Organic brown rice is best, otherwise long-grain rice.  (White rice is a poor choice.) Whole grains:  wheat, oats, spelt, etc - I have an article on my blog listing good choices.  Avoid, white flour and processed pastas - whole wheat or spinach pasta is ok.  Cous-cous is ok. Buckwheat pancakes is an excellent choice - go ahead and use butter and maple syrup on them!  Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Chocolate:   dark chocolate that is at least 70% cacao is an excellent choice.  NOT fattening, but offers a lot of cancer-fighting nutrients.  ALCOHOL:  avoid ALL alcohol except red wine.  3 - 4 ounces of red to dark red table wine/day is ok - will help fight the cancer - the sugar in the wine carries the phytochemicals to the cancer cells, so is ok. Do not use a beverage wine for this - way too sweet.  I use Taylor Lake Country Red Table Wine -  that is the very least tannin content and sweetness you want.  Anything that's darker or dryer would also be ok. Juicing/smoothies:  - a great way to get nutrition fast.   add a 1/2 tsp organic powdered brewer's yeast, and powdered lecithin for nutrition. You may need to add just a little fructose or honey with these to make it palatable, and it's good to add some crushed ice.  Barley grass powder or wheat grass powder are also very powerful additives. If you don't juice or make smoothies, I suggest you supplement with barley grass or wheat grass tablets.  Just remember to take with food. SOY:  I would avoid completely. FLAX:  breakfast only - this is my routine: I make sure to eat no later than 1 hour before going to bed. I do not eat or drink anything other than water  for another 8 - 10 hours.  First thing when I get up - a handful of grapes with seeds (concord, red or black grapes.)  If I can't get grapes, I use 6 - 8 ounces of Welch's 100% pure concord grape concentrate - non-pasteurized, mixed with steam-distilled water.  THen I eat about 1/2 cup small curd cottage cheese (organic when I can get it) with no more than 1 tsp ground flax seed. I add salt and pepper for taste, and I sometimes throw in  no more than 1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds or a small handful of dried black currants. Cranberries would work just as well.  I drink 10 ounces of brewed green and black tea - I just use 1 green tea bag and 1 black tea bag, and I steep it pretty strong, adding fructose to taste. . (you could do one or the other if you don't like them combined.) COOKING tips:  as much as you can, use onions (fresh, frozen, or powdered or minced), garlic (fresh or powdered - but not garlic salt), crushed red pepper, turmeric, and cumin. If you don't like cooking with onions or garlic, or if you're getting chemo and can't handle the spice food, I recommend you take an odorless garlic supplement. Fresh, raw, organic fruits and veggies are the very best choice - but not always possible.  Flash frozen is the next best choice - canneries do a pretty thorough job of washing fruits and veggies before freezing them, and with todays technology, everything you get in the freezer section is now being flash frozen, except ice cream and dairy products.   Canned (unless home canned in glass jars) - should be the very last choice.  Exception is tomatoes - but try to buy brands that do not have the plastic coating inside the can, as this is broken down by the acids in the tomatoes.  If there is anything specific that I haven't mentioned, and you want to know if it's ok to eat, just send me a message.  I'm not sure where you live, so don't know what regional foods you might choose.   I have a few recipes on my blog - they are all ok for anyone with cancer to use. Take a look at my series on the B-vitamins \"The Buzz on the B's\" - there are like 8 or 9 articles (I don't have my B-17 article published yet, and that one may take a while - have hit a few road blocks!)  Unless I have specifically mentioned to avoid something above, ALL of the foods that I list in the vitamin B articles are ok to eat.  Look at the articles on ancient seeds and grains, and on functional foods.  Take a look at the Lemon Volcano Drink (enter that in the search box - it will pull up several articles - one has a recipe.)  That is an excellent detoxifier, if you can stand to do it with the cayenne pepper.  It provides the cancer fighting benefits of citric acid , capcaisin in the pepper, and maple syrup. In fact, I recommend that you read through the whole blog, as you get time.  I've scattered cancer fighting information, including a lot about foods, throughout just about everything I've written on the blog.  There also is other advise, such as incorporating humor and laughter, exercise, detoxification, etc. I cannot emphasize enough that you need to be drinking plenty of fresh pure water. Minimum 64 ounces/day, as much as 80 - 100 ounces /day if you can tolerate it.  (If you weigh less than 125lbs - not more than 72 ounces/day.) Steam-distilled or filtered by reverse osmosis are best. I purchased a home steam-distiller when I found out I had metastasis - one of the very best investments I've ever made.  My partner and I know use steam-distilled water exclusively for all our drinking and cooking needs.  There is a link for A-1 Distillers in my blog.  I purchased the 1 gallon, metal-topped distiller - came to just under $120 including S&H, and the service is great: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Let me know if you have more questions.  You're welcome to use the link on my blog to send me email - just identify yourself as Bonniee from Cancer Compass in the subject line the first time you write.

I am 61 years old and have had at least 30+ \"normal\" mammograms. In fact in Jan. I had a \"normal\" mammogram and ultrasound. BUT, I knew something was wrong because I had dimpling and an inverted nipple in one breast. I had pain in both breasts, and I had heard that breast cancer was not painful so I wasn't worried. Boy, was I wrong! Because of the dimpling and inverted nipple, they did an MRI. I was shocked to find out that the one breast had a 4\" and a 1.5\" tumor - basically, my whole breast was full of the two tumors. It was estimated that I had the large tumor for 15-20 years. Later I was told that I had dense, fibrous breasts and that's why all of the mammograms were normal. Recently, I told my 40-yr old daughter to demand an MRI after her normal mammogram and ultrasound. It was discovered that she had a 1/2\" tumor! So, if you know of anyone that has been told they have dense, fibrous breast tissue, tell them to demand an MRI in order to get a much more accurate exam of their breasts. This could save thousands of lives a year! If a woman does not have insurance for the MRI, ultrasound, and yearly exams, they can contact the Komen Foundation (503) 552-9160 to get them paid for. You need to demand an MRI at least every 5 years to be safe. Carolyn",

The oncologist told me right away I will lose my hair, she even said this before I asked...guess this must be the number 1 question they will get. It WAS going to be MY number 1 question..... I am bothered about losing my hair, but I know all the worrying will not change a thing...I have already gone wig shopping. I shopping, I have not purchased the wig yet, but it is on hold. Right after I get my first chemo treatment I am heading right over to get that wig, because I know then there is no turning back...it's a done deal. The reason a wig is so inportant for me is I am a teacher for Preschool/Kindergarten children. I feel I need to look as normal as I can. I wish I could be like the other women that mentioned above and just wear a different hair style every day....just to have fun with it. But I don't know if I can as I am trying not to cause the children to really notice I have a sickness that causes hair loss....But I will wait and see. At first I will try to hide it from the children just so I don't have to answer a lot of question they might have....BUT if they discover....who knows maybe I could have fun. I do have a plan on buying a cheap wig and having it in the classroom for the kids to style it. I would like to offer a suggestion about wigs....Mind you I have not worn one yet other then to try on. I have shop at many, many, many stores in two different cities....I believe it is going to be one of those \"you get what you pay for\".  The mose comfortable and real looking wigs I have found range from $175.00-$300.00. Please keep in mind I am no expert and I have no knowledge of the places through the cancer society or hospitals that make wigs available to women for free. I did find some places will take a % off the price if you are a cancer victim. Off the wig subject and back to the treatment..... My questions are: I have heard this treatment is one of the most tolerable of treatments....Many have said they have not missed much work or had many sick days. Is this true? What are the secrets?  I read about drinking lots of water....What is the advice about scheduling days to get Chemo? I work Mon-Fri, and want to miss as little days from school as I can? Only a few of the people I have met during chemo have been able to work full-time, but the majority work only part-time or not at all.  A lot of women take medical leave, get time donated by others, etc.  I was on Taxotere, Cytoxan and Adriamyacin - 6 treatments every 3 weeks.  These meds are out of your system in 24 hours.  Drink lots of water to get them out as fast as you  can.  On the first treatment I had many more of the side effects than the other treatments - mouth sores, diarrhea, etc.   Make sure that you don't use any antioxidant vitamins - A, C, E, etc.  Don't drink or eat grapefruit or grapefruit juice while on chemo and radiation.  They protect all of your cells including the cancer cells they are trying to kill. Some oncologists allow the vitamins, but the larger cancer centers and medical schools don't.  I was not able to work at all.  The day after every chemo I received a Neulasta shot which kept my white cell count up where it needed to be.  No one told me that the shot could cause severe bone pain - so the day after the 1st shot, I had severe bone pain throughout my whole body, and it lasted for 3 days.  I was in bed for those 3 days.  After the 2nd shot, when I felt the pain coming on, I immediately took Vicodan to control the pain.   After each chemo treatment between the 4th and 9th days, I was down in bed all the time, and I lost 10 lbs. each time - weight was gained back within a couple of weeks. The last 2 months of the 5 months of chemo, I suffered severe fatigue and was in bed most of the time.  I was unable to stand longer than 5 minutes.  If I left the house, I had to be in a wheelchair or handicap cart.   It's been 6 weeks since my last treatment, and I am getting much better.  Good enough that I am ready to do the 6.5 weeks of daily radiation treatment.  Fatigue comes with this, but it's supposed to be less than with the chemo.  After the radiation comes Boneva - a bone strengthener which I will take forever and Femara - a hormone surpressor -- which I will take for 5 yrs.  Both of these come with the fatigue also.   I feel that a reliance on God and a positive attitude are the 2 most important things that one can have to win over this disease! Oregon Health Sciences University's Cancer Center here in Oregon (this is where I go for treatment) just got a $100 million donation from Nike.  So we should see some new things, aka diagnoses, treatments and medications, coming from them within the next few years.  TIPS: 1.  Ask your doctor for Emla cream.  You put it on the entry to your port (if you have one; they are great!) or the area where they will be injecting the meds and/or taking blood. The cream is great - EMLA Cream is a topical anesthetic. In other words, it is a cream that numbs the skin where the needle goes, and you don't feel a thing!!!  NOTE:  for best results use it 2 hours prior to the injection and cover it with a piece of saran wrap. 2.   As far a wigs go, this is the web site that the American Cancer society recommends on their web site.  The wigs are great, and they are reasonable prices.  You can have a nice wig for $40-50.  They also carry mastectomy products as well.

I lost a lot of hair during the 3rd week of treatment.  There are some things you can do to keep your hair longer:      1.  Wear a hairnet to bed - it also keeps the hair mess off of your pillow.     2.  Be very gentle with your hair when washing and drying - blot, don't rub.        3.  Let hair air dry naturally - don't use a blow dryer.     4.  Don't use a curling iron.  Carolyn",

The oncologist told me right away I will lose my hair, she even said this before I asked...guess this must be the number 1 question they will get. It WAS going to be MY number 1 question..... I am bothered about losing my hair, but I know all the worrying will not change a thing...I have already gone wig shopping. I shopping, I have not purchased the wig yet, but it is on hold. Right after I get my first chemo treatment I am heading right over to get that wig, because I know then there is no turning back...it's a done deal. The reason a wig is so inportant for me is I am a teacher for Preschool/Kindergarten children. I feel I need to look as normal as I can. I wish I could be like the other women that mentioned above and just wear a different hair style every day....just to have fun with it. But I don't know if I can as I am trying not to cause the children to really notice I have a sickness that causes hair loss....But I will wait and see. At first I will try to hide it from the children just so I don't have to answer a lot of question they might have....BUT if they discover....who knows maybe I could have fun. I do have a plan on buying a cheap wig and having it in the classroom for the kids to style it. I would like to offer a suggestion about wigs....Mind you I have not worn one yet other then to try on. I have shop at many, many, many stores in two different cities....I believe it is going to be one of those \"you get what you pay for\".  The mose comfortable and real looking wigs I have found range from $175.00-$300.00. Please keep in mind I am no expert and I have no knowledge of the places through the cancer society or hospitals that make wigs available to women for free. I did find some places will take a % off the price if you are a cancer victim. Off the wig subject and back to the treatment..... My questions are: I have heard this treatment is one of the most tolerable of treatments....Many have said they have not missed much work or had many sick days. Is this true? What are the secrets?  I read about drinking lots of water....What is the advice about scheduling days to get Chemo? I work Mon-Fri, and want to miss as little days from school as I can?

Ann It took me about 5 months to start regaining my energy and strength back.  So hang in there. Also, Femara isn't a chemo drug - it's a hormone suppressor.   It has been known to have a lot of severe effects including fatigue for over 32% of the women taking it.  II have been on it for a month now, and so far I have no side effects.  Side effects can start up months after you start on it.  For some women the side effects are so severe that they stop taking it even though they know it's prolonging their life. Talk to your doctor about the fatigue because it's hard to know whether it's the chemo or the Femara.  Carolyn",

      "Content": "You need to demand an MRI!  See my story below: NORMAL mammogram - URGENT - READ THIS DX April 2008, 60 yrs., Right Breast - 2 Infiltrating Ductal Carcinomatumors, diameters 9.5 & 3.5 mm, Nuclear grade 3, ER & PR +, HER negative, Lymph vascular involvement Node positive (8/21),Right Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) April 2008   I am 61 years old and have had at least 30+ normal mammograms. In fact in Jan. I had a \"normal\" mammogram and ultrasound. BUT, I knew something was wrong because I had dimpling and an inverted nipple in one breast. I had pain in both breasts, and I had heard that breast cancer was not painful so I wasn't worried. Boy, was I wrong! Because of the dimpling and inverted nipple, they did an MRI. I was shocked to find out that the one breast had a 4\" and a 1.5\" tumor - basically, my whole breast was full of the two tumors. It was estimated that I had the large tumor for 15-20 years. Later I was told that I had dense, fibrous breasts and that's why all of the mammograms were normal. Recently, I told my 40-yr old daughter to demand an MRI after her normal mammogram and ultrasound. It was discovered that she had a 1/2\" tumor! So, if you know of anyone that has been told they have dense, fibrous breast tissue, tell them to demand an MRI in order to get a much more accurate exam of their breasts. This could save thousands of lives a year! Carolyn      ",

I will be 28 years old this year and unfornately, i was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in December of 2007 when i was 26.  Triple negative is a very aggressive form of breast cancer.  This breast cancer does not respond well to hormonal drugs.  The only thing that will treat triple negative breast cancer is chemotherapy and radiation treatment.  I get so terrified of relapsing and having a recurrence and losing my life that i don't know what to do.  Reading your story about how you are still alive after 5 years has given me some hope.  Thank you for sharing your story and may God bless you.           I'am sorry that you had to go through breast cancer at such a young age. Its hard no matter what age you are , but it can make you feel like that much less of a women in your own eyes and make you feel that others see you in the same light. My cancer was also a negative receptor. My cancer was not run by my hormons, so i will always live with the chance that i will either have cancer in my remaining breast, or i will develope ovarian cancer like my mother died of. My doctors are currently trying to get me sponsorship for the braca 2 test, which cost over 3,000 dollars. But i stay positive, i have four kids to live for and a wonderful husband to be and i think your health is related to how good you mental state is. If you continue to picture a healthy ,cancer free future for yourself i believe you can make it happen( with consistant followups to you doctors of course) Good luck to you! Thank you for writing to me.              Dulcey One way to get around paying for the braca 2 test yourself is to do what I did.  My mother is over 65 and is on Medicare, and Medicare will pay for it for her.  Since her test came back negative it is assumed that I am negative as well.  Give it a try.  Carolyn",
