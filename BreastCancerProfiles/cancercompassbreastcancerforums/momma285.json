I would love to be able to talk to someone so I don't feel so alone and so sad.  Dealing with the pain of treatment is a hassel, I am recieving Chemo, and also am in a research study to try and help as the cancer has spread to my lymphnods. thanks for taking the time to read this! Hi Enrique I know when ur diagnosed with Cancer it is the worst day of your life and every test u take puts more fear into u and every treatment u agree to ur hoping it's the right thing to do. The way I make it through when I'm feeling sad or afraid I pray and ask God to  give me strength to make it another day and he gives me peace because it too hard for my family to hear me talk about it.  So when ur having a bad day go to God in pray and he will give u peace in your spirit.  He'll listen when no one else will. God bless",
