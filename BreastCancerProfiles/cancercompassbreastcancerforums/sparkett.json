She is on the same meds you talked about. Help me encourage her. and help me know what to be for her. It is in her bone. She is now having difficulty raising her arm because of the growth. Rose I was told I had breast cancer last year in Sept. after going about a year having trouble walking, the doctors for a year had been treating me for arthris. After they discovered it was breast cancer and had spread all through out my bones, they started me on tamoxifen and zomata, but also they were able to do radiation on the major tumors in the back and hips so now I can again walk with out pain after the radiation. Hope maybe this will help, I know just being able to still do the things in life I enjoy have helped me cope this last year, even with the cancer I can enjoy life now.",
