    "Content": "A few wks ago out of the blue a bright pink mark the size of my pink showed up on my left breast-about the size of my pinky as though I had been burned by an iron. No texture issues with the area. I saw the Dr, she wasnt concerned. The mark has lighted up a tad but is now beige with slight pinkness, but its still there.  I decided to push for a biopsy as Im nervous of IBC.  Would IBC redness lighten up and turn a light beige? I read the IBC mark can be bruised looking, which mine is with a slight pink tinge but its pretty light not dark.  I did have a breast MRI 5 months ago which was clear, not sure if this matters. Wed couldnt come soon enough, Im pretty nervous. Its not normal to have a spot on the breast this long.",
