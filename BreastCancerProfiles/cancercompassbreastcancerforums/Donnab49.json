    "Content": "I was diagnosed with rectal cancer August 10, 2005. I had surgery August 31st and the cancer was removed. Although they got the cancer, they felt I needed chemo and radiation as a preventive measure to keep the cancer from coming back or showing up somewhere else. I was given 5 treatments of 5 FU the first week of October. By the 5th treatment, my mouth had blisters. The oncologist looked at my mouth and said, \"Mucocitis...antibiotics won't help..rinse mouth with baking soda and water\". A few days later my mouth had gotten progressively worse. I was unable to eat or drink. I went back to my doctor who gave me a shot of Neulasta and told me it would take about 10 days before I would begin to get better. The next day I was admitted to the hospital due to dehydration. Over the next 14 days, I was treated for leukopenia, thrombocytopemia, stomasitis, and mucocitis. I was diagnosed with having a toxic reaction to chemo. I am back on my feet, but now my doctor feels that I still need a month of radiation treatments. What I'm wondering is whether it is \"safe\" to have radiation treatments after what happened with the chemo treatments.",
