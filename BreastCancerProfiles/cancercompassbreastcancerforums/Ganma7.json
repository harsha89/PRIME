      "Content": "Hi, I am new to this forum.  I actually have two daughters with breast cancer at the same time.  The first one, Joy, is about to finish her chemo.  But my question is for the other daughter.Traci.  She has just been dianosed with breast cancer..  Before they do surgery, her Dr. ordered an MRI and Genetic blood teating. Joy, her younger sister, tested positive for the BRAC2 Mutation. They did Traci's Mri Wed. and her dr. called her Friday.  He said they found spots on her liver that concern him.  Now she is scheduled for  CT scan with contrast for Tuesday.  Has anybody had this experience.  If so, what was the outcome?   I feel like I could write a book about my two girls.  I feel like I am in a nightmare and can't wake up.  I hope writing my feelings on this forum will help me and my family through this.  Joyce in Georgia",

      "Content": "Lisa,  Thank you for your responce.  You are so right about having faith in your dr.  We have had such good vibes with Joy's drs.  She is the one that was diagnosed in Feb.  Traci is just starting the process of all this right now.  She will be doing the ct scan with contrast about her liver in the morning.  All of this is about too much to absorb.  She is seeing a different dr than Joy, but we have confidence in him also. Bless your heart!!  Sounds you have been and are still going down a rough road.  My heart and prayers go ou to you.  I would like to hear how things are going for you.  Take care. Joyce in Georgia",
