      "Content": "in 2005 I was diagnosed with lymphoma stage 3. I enrolled with AP John Cancer Institute on their CAAT protocol. However, CSUF mis-diagnosed the type of lymphoma and the CAAT protocol was formulated on the CSUF diagnoses. Even with the wrong protocol, the CAAT began to break down and shrink the tumors.  The CAAT protocol is one that you need to be on for a minimum of 6-9 months for it to be totally effective. The CAAT diet and protocol must be followed thoroughly. I am happy to say that I am alive today because of my faith in God, and by His guidance in selecting doctors, therapies.I ended up having to have chemotherapy (only 6) and did not get sick once because the CAAT helped me clean out all the toxins and had begun to break down the cancer tumors. It is now 11 years later and from going from a 2 days to 2 weeks to live diagnosis, I am now cancer free. Thank you AP John Cancer Institute and the CAAT protocol. An institute is a learning center and AP John has done extensive study on cancer and how the cells develop. They are credible and his studies are credible. ",
