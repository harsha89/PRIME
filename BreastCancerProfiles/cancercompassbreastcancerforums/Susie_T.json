    "Content": "I am so sorry. I will try to give you the other side of this coin. I was diagnosed with breast cancer November 2000. I didn't want to talk about it or think about it or admit I had it. It was the hardest thing I had to do in my life to sit my children and their father down and tell them. I had to talk about it, explain, try to be strong for them, try not to cry so they didn't get scared...more scared then they were I should say. Then after that I had to tell my Mom and Dad. I told them to tell my brothers and sisters because by that time I couldn't say it or explain it or act brave and strong any more. My Mother wanted me to join a cancer support group. I couldn't because that would mean talking about it again...and this time to strangers. I knew they would understand because they had all been through it but I just didn't want to talk about it to any one any more. What I did do was concentrate on getting better. I went to the Internet, read all I could, found treatment clinics, looked for new drugs, new treatments, I kept myself positive. I told every one around me to be positive, keep me focused, tell me jokes about any thing. I told my family I would let them know what ever the doctors said and we would discuss it...one time. Then back to life...normal. I was scared. My boyfriend was scared but he stayed by my side 24/7 to hold me when I needed it, make me laugh when I needed that. You have got to get involved. Show her that you are there 100% no matter what. Take her places to show her things\u2026the park, the zoo, picnics. Read to her about the good things that happened today, current events. If she talks let her and that is the time to ask questions when she is ready to answer them. Make life as normal as possible for her but always show her you are there...you will be there. It will let her know she is not alone on this journey of her life. Even though you cannot know what she is going through totally and you cannot go with her to the end of this journey she will love you for traveling with her as far as you can. May God be with you for strength, love, and peace. May He walk with your Mother also.",
