      "Content": "My wife (age 42) was diagnosed via MRI of the brain with carcinomatous meningitis on Sept 20, 2005. Subsequent installation of an Ommaya Reservoir allowed immediate treatment with methatrexate and cytological review of CSF. CSF showed positive for cancer cells too. She went to stage IV in May of 2004 and was treated with tamoxefen until Nov. Numerous bone mets and liver lesions continued to progress. She had radiation Nov '04 through Jan 05. Then she was put on Herceptin and Carboplatin-taxotere. Along with the Zometa she had been taking since summer '04. We have been told that the treatment of the leptomeningeal mets will make them a non-factor mortality wise. That these mets secondary to breast cancer are treatable. The important thing is to treat the systemic. My wife had several symptoms related to this metastatic progression. 1. Headache 2. Backache 3. Nasuea 4. Saying wrong words in her sentences often (we would just laugh this off) The speech - nausea and headache got real bad and she was admitted to hospital week of Sept 20, 2005. She is very mobile. Was driving and doing most activities up until this hospitalization. I expect her to get back to it. I see the stats on the net and wonder if the oncoogist is in denial. I plan to talk to the nurses and him next Tuesday when we are down there for a treatment. So far, she has had a personality shift. But overall she is feeling better since the nausea and headaches are gone. And she wondering why they are not getting back on her systemic treatment, most recently she was taking Gemzar. Keep her in your thoughts and prayers. I will try to update in weeks ahead. I would appreciate any thoughts-advice and-orencouragement anyone has to give. Thanks Larry",

      "Content": "Hi Jill: This wicked cancer puts everyone it comes in contact with in scrambling mode. We have been told that this is most treatable when it is a progression of Breast Cancer. BC Mets to the meningeal usually respond to treatment. Is she having headaches, nausea-vomiting, interrupted speech? Yes, dizziness is a symptom. Ask her oncologist to refer you to a good \"neuro-oncologist\" or at least a \"neurologist\" for exam. Tell them what you suspect they can look for all neurological symptoms. He should be offering her some options. Without treatment survival prognosis is bleak (4-6 weeks), it depends some on her health prior to diagnosis of the progression. If she is up walking around her health must be fair. Talk to the oncologist about this. Please let me know how it goes. My wife has had about 5 methatrexate treatments and seems to be tolerating it fairly well. She will have another today. She is mobile and in good shape for a stage iv cancer patient *age 42. Unfortunately her systemic chemo (Gemzar) has her in the hospital right now. Along with low grade fever that she can't seem to shake and blood pressure readings that are too low. Will keep y'all in our prayers. Larry",

      "Content": "My wife (pam) diagnosed with Meningeal progression of Breast Cancer continues to receive \"methotrexate\" through an Ommaya Reservoir for the past 9 weeks. Her legs are very weak, which is a sign of the disease. She struggles to have an appetite. Healthy at 125 lbs she weighed in at 96 lbs yesterday on tx day. She has been having some slurred speech, and her balance is poor. She fell today and hit her head, thankfully she remained concious. This is the 5th time she has fallen in the last several days. I have a walker for her, but at 42 I have not made her use it. She has a problem taking steps. I can't allow her to keep falling. She has had the diagnosis confirmed for the past 8 weeks. From what I read here, she may have another 8 to 16 weeks. I no longer believe that the systemic cancer (bones, liver, pleura rt lung, ovary) is the biggest threat to her life. I think the meningeal is the threat. Doc has mentioned switching over to AraC from the MTX. I am inclined to let him try it. She is still very alert, and although her personality has shifted somewhat. She can be and is very much in possession of herself. We are hoping the treatment will continue to give her good days. I wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving. Larry",
