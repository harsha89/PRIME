      "Content": "Hi there, I am new to this and wanted to share my story with 2.5 years on Tamoxafin.  I just had a hysterectomy and was switched to Aromasin.  I took it for 4 months and had experienced joint/ bone and tingeling pain in my arms and hands.  I am now  on femora for the first time tonight.  I hope it works better with less side effects.  I also was given pain med to take as needed.  Its hard to be on these drugs and as I read for some I agree that its worse at night and if our days are busy enough its not that noticeable. Good luck to all my pink sisters.  Jan",

      "Content": "Kim, I was on Aromasin and Femora both are Aroma inhibitors.  I didn't do well on Aromasin and was on it for 4 months.  I had all the classic side effects you might have read about..... bone pain, head aches hand and arm numbness and pain and mostly just feeling old and I am 45.  I had simular effects on Femora which I was on for 2 weeks.  I asked my oncologist to return my treatment to Tamoxafin for the remander of my 2plus years on drug therapy. So far I am feeling much better.  I hope that you do better but if you don't don't wait to long to switch to something else its quality of life remember!!!!!!!!!!  Good luck sister.  Jan",

      "Content": "hi there, yes I was on Tamoxafinfor 2.5 years had a hysterectomy  as a preventative so then I was put on Aromasin.  I had headaches arm aches and numbness in my hands as well.  I switched to Famora and nothing changed.  I stayed on it just one week and asked my oncologist to just put me back on Tamoxafin.  Since then almost 2 weeks now I am feeling much better.  My bone pain is slowly going away.  I would rather have the last 2 years of my pill therapy go easier than feel like a 90 year old at 45.  I hope that my story helps you feel better for returning to Tamoxafin.",
