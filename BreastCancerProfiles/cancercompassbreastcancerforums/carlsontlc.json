    "Content": "What a great fundraiser idea!  My name is Terry and am from Regina, Saskatchewan in Canada.  I am a breast cancer survivor (diagnosed in 1994). My favorite bible verse is Philippians 4:13, \"For I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me.\"  It is such an uplifting scripture to me and love to declare it in my life. Thanks so much for the opportunity to participate.  Take care.",
