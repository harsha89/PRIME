      "Content": "  Dear sgmstge4 Thank you for your quick response and sharing your journey! Wow! Yours has all happened at once. You are a brave girl with such a great outlook. Keep up the good work, you are an inspiration! My BC started in 1998. I had a lumpectomy, radio and chemo. Was on tamoxifen for 4 years when the cancer returned to the same spot. In 2002 had mastectomy and they reccomended no further treatment. 5 years later in 2007, I had mets to the lungs and mediastinum as I have mentioned before. Having confronted primary cancer both previous times, then the stage 4, I accepted that it was the end of the road. Of course it is absolutely wonderful that the hormone treatment is working and I am in remission. I just am finding it hard to believe that I am no longer dying. Having gone thro the scenarios repeatedly, getting my house in order, it is so hard to switch back and forth between living and dying. I want to fully embrace life, but find myself bracing for the mets return. This feeling has intensified since my oopherectomy in Nov 08. Perhaps I am in full menopause adjustment phase and out of balance emotionally? Love Barb  ",

      "Content": "Dear Tre Thank you so much for all the info you have responded with! I actually came across your web site before I found cancer compass, trying to get answers. You have really done your home work and have so much to pass on. I have already made a start with some of the supplements you suggested.
