This is all so confusing to me.  As I read your post, you already had Stage IV BC and your tumor was removed.  My daughter was first diagnosed in June 2016 with Stage IV BC with mets to bones and liver.  I asked when would they remove the tumor and the doctor said \"probably never; we won't put her under unnecessary surgery.\"  Her tumor size originally was 8 cm but her latest scan says the tumor has shrunk to 6 cm.  I just don't understand why some tumors are removed even though the cancer has spread and some tumors are not removed.",

      "Content": "Again, thank you for your civil comments.  I call ahead and get the results of my daughter's scans, etc. because I want to know if I should have questions.  Since she seems to resent my asking questions, I decided maybe I should not go to her doctor's appointments with her.  She had an appointment last Friday and I intentionally scheduled another appointment for myself.  She came over to my house later that day and questioned why I would schedule something else, knowing she had a doctor's appointment that day.  I figured it was finally time for me to let her know that I feel her appointments are more stressful when I'm there.  Anyway, some of the air was cleared and she did actually say she wants me to come to her doctor's appointments with her. She is divorced and has no children -- therefore no support group.  I don't know if you read this or not but her latest ultra sound indicates the tumor is 6 cm but the person writing the report said they could not get an exact measurement without doing an MRI.  Of course my daughter doesn't know what the report said because she hasn't  seen it.  I asked how her appointment went and was there any discussion about her having an MRI.  Answer: no.  Have I mentioned she hardly ever sees the doctor.  A PA talks with her and writes notes.  I once asked if there's a protocol as to how often the patient sees the doctor and the answer was \"if the patient is stable, they don't see the doctor.\"  That didn't make me feel very happy.",
