      "Content": "Answer to original post - Yes, as others have mentioned, it can definitely cause muscle and joint pain.  I have created a quick drug facts (education points) if someone needs it related to this drug. I am sure most of you know some of the information already that is included here.  What is it used for?Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal women only - most likely for 5 years. Oral Tablet/Capsule?25 mg Tablets taken once a day. How to take it?Take it with food. Try to take at the same time of the day. Missed Dose? Take it as soon as you remember it. My rule of thumb is if it is less than 12 to 10 hours to your next dose then skip it and take the next dose at regular time. Side Effects? Most common:Joint pain, tiredness, headache, increased sweating Over the counter medications?Okay to take Tylenol or Advil for pain if you don't have any other medical issues. Hope this helps. I just wanted to provide some basic information. I will be happy to answer any specific questions you have.  If you need information about any other drugs, please do not hesitate to let me know. I will try to answer as much as I can. My background - Pharmacist practising in oncology for 7 years. ",
