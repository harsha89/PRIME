So off to a Pet scan we go. Anyway Mum has being taking femara the minute she was diagonsed and ever since then her arm has ached. The ongologist said that the ache was not from the femara. Has any one else taken femara and had an ache? thanks, Anne",

      "Content": "Hello,  My Mum was on femara before taxol and did not have any neurophy with the femara. The taxol is another story, she was in so much pain with the taxol and all it did was cause her ca125 level to increase from 450 to 817. She is now on a drug that is basically the A covered in a fat to protect your heart in AC. This is working and her ca125 level is now 625. People have told me that it takes a few months for the pain in the hands and feet to go after chemo.   Take Care.",

      "Content": "My Mum is having surgery next Tuesday. She has confirmed er+ and pr+ breast cancer under her arms. They cannot find the cancer in the breast, so either they just can't find it (she has had an MRI and PET scan) or the cancer has destroyed itself. Any was they are removing her lymph nodes and breast. SHe is 64 and the surgeon recommened removal. It will be tough, but gives us better piece of mind. Just wondering what the recover for this op is like. She will probably start chemo 2 weeks after surgery.",

      "Content": "Hi, My Mum had radical surgery and all lymph taken out. The Dr's did a mamogram, ultrasound, MRI and Pet scan and could only find cancer in my Mum's lypmh nodes. The Dr's recommended radical surgery. He was right 3 tumors 8mm, 17mm & 10mm were found in the breast. All 22 lymph nodes were positive with Met deposits and spread outside the lymph nodes. Mum's cancer is PR and ER positive. I am so worried about all nodes having cancer. Did any one else have this. We are yet to find out the next course of action - but the surgern this chemo, rediation and then chemo again for 9 months. Also I can't find out what Met deposits are, I assume this is that the cancer cells have small deposits, but are yet to be full cancer cells. Does anyone know? I am very worried.",

      "Content": "Hello, On tuesday my Mum was diagonised as having stage II breast cancer. Last May she had a momagram and she told them about some lumps under her arms. The momagram came back ok and the doctor did not check out the lumps. She had a core biopsy under her arm and it showed breast canacer. She has been put on a hormone treatment Femel and is having a MRI scan is a few weeks to determine where the lump in the breast is. When the lumps shrink she will have surgery and then radiotheraphy. I am 33 and my mum is 64, my dad died at 58 with a brain tumor. So this news is just the worst news I have ever received. When my dad had the tumor we were told someone with a similar tumor had lived 2 years but he died in 12 weeks. As this is all very new, I was hoping to hear from someone that had been in a similar boat and really want to hear that they have lived many years after the treatment. This is a hard time, so any news or advice would be appreciated.",
