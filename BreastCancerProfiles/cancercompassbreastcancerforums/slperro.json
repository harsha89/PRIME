    "Content": "I had surgery for breast cancer almost 2 years ago and was diagnosed with stage 3 infiltrating lobular breast cancer. Two lymph nodes were positive for cancer and the tumor was 8 cm in size. I elected to have bilateral mastectomy due to the higher percentage of this cancer infiltrating the other breast. I was unable to have chemo because of very low white blood count. I had 25 radiation treatments and was then placed on Arimidex. My Oncologist has recently taken me off this drug because she doesn't feel that it's doing it's job ( tests show more cancer but they can't find it), and she has put me on Aromasin. I am 65 years young and feel 165. I have absolutely NO energy, have regular head aches, have lost my appetite ( not a bad thing) have a constant upset stomach and suffer from nausea. I have bone pain as well. At times it feels like it would be a lot easier to just quit especially since I know this will go on for another 4 years. My grand babies are what keeps me going, although its getting harder to be grandma with little or NO energy. It's very good to hear that I'm not the only one experiencing these symptoms",
