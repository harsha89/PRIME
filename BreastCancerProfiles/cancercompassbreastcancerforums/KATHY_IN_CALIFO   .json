      "Content": "My message is out there in the universe somewhere so I will start another.  After lumpectomy and radiation I have been on Aromasin for 8 months.  Through talking with other women in a cancer support group and a close friend who is on arimadex I think that the aromasin side effects are not as bad as the arimadex.  I have been on aromasin from the beginning so don't have a personal comparison.  I also began taking several supplements for some of the side effects and have had them clear up completely or become more manageable. The first thing I noticed was the arthritic joints in my hands.  I had a lot of swelling too.  I started taking a capsule form of tumeric  and also Bromalin which I found at the local health food store and noticed a difference in a few days.  I was able to take my ring off again.  Just after my surgery I started taking increased dosage of vitamin D3.  I now take about 1400 iu a day along with 1000 mg calcium and a good multi vitamin.  I have taken fish oil for several years but just upped my dose to 3000 a day +  1500 mg of vit. C.  I'm not sure which if any or all of these have made a difference but I am tolerating it fairly well.  I also started back at Curves and go 5 days a week.  The exercise helps with stiffness.  I haven't had a bone density test done yet but will schedule that next. I have been doing this without insurance so I'm trying to do as much as possible on my own.  So far, so good.  Thanks all of you for sharing your experiences.  ",

Thanks, worry wort? I've been having similar sypmtoms that they, oncologists aren't explaining.  I now have aligator skin like leather on half my breat and is numb.  Now sudden pain underneath the breast and going down a vein.  Who knos?  I might get an utra sound and see the Dr. Nurse tomorrow.  We shall see. It's been 11 months since my surgery and about 6 months since radiation tx.   Thanks for the feed back.  I'm wondering if you are taking one of the aromatase inhibitors like aromasin(that's the one I'm taking) arimadex or Femarra (sp?).  I called the radiation oncologist nurse yesterday and she said she had never heard of any reaction like this.  Today I'm scheduled to have a mammogram and I'm also going to call the medical oncologist and see if there have been any reactions to aromasin like this.  Just a long shot.  Good luck to you and keep me posted if you can.  Here's my direct email if you would rather do it that way. --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

Thanks for your feedback.  I kind of suspected something like that although I haven't been back to see the radiation oncologist, not on my favorite person list.  Anyway, half way through my six week treatment the financial office(located in a different city from the doc's) called me and said I would have to pay another $2,400.  I flipped and asked what had changed and was told by the young woman on the phone that my case was a little more complicated than they had originally thought and that they had to do some more calculations.  The doctor wasn't even aware of the phone call and only mentioned it a week later.  He gave me a lot of technical stuff that I barely understood and ended by telling me that they hadn't expected me to be as big as I was.  I was so stunned that I forgot to ask big how?  Tall? (I'm 5'10\") fat?, I carry a lot of body fat but don't look it, big busted? Anyway I didn't mean to go on about all of this but was wondering what they attributed your overdose to.  A mistake in calculations?  Also I'm very fair skinned but I didn't have too bad of a burn but did get a radiation rash after my first three treatments which they wouln't cop to being the result of radiation for at least 2 weeks. I also had some pneumonitis that eventually went away.  Thanks again. ",

      "Content": "I have been taking aromasin for about a year now and am tolerating it fairly well. I have friends in my support group who started on Arimidex or Femmara and have switched to Aromasin. Aromasin (exemestane) is different from the other aromatse inhibitors in that it is steroid based.  It bonds with the aromatse cells permanently and keeps them from turning into estrogens. There is an excellent article on the three drugs in \"Mamm\" magazine.  I couln't find my copy of it but I believe it was in Sept or Oct of 2007.  I would definitely give it a try.  It is different.  Another thing to consider is whether you are eating any estrogenic foods such as soy.  My oncologist says that soy is the one to avoid.  Check your supplements too.  My multi vit and fish oil both had soy so I found new ones.  You gotta read the fine print!  A lot of the low carb foods and protein supplements are soy based as well.  The aromatse inhibitors only work on the aromatase that your body creates.  It doesn't block other estogens that you ingest.  Hope this helps.",
