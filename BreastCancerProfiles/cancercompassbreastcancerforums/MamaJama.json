I checked it out since my Chiropractor recently went to one of Dr.Garcia's seminars and recommended the web sit to me.  The web site is: www.utopiaawaits.com (Dr.Carlos Garcia) Click on Services, once that pops up click on Menu on the left side. I noticed IV vitamins was listed. I didn't look into that, but I sure hope it might help you in finding what you are looking for. Member in Florida",
