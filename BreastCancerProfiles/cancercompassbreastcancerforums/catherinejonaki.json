      "Content": "I was unable to tolerate Arimidex or Aromosin. I had severe pain and swelling in my hands but it took me about 6 weeks to figure out what was causing it. I shared with my pharmacist one day and he said it was probably the Arimidex. Armosin wasn't any better. I quit Aromosin in November and started Tamoxifen. 8 months later I ended up having surgery on my R hand to have 3 trigger fingers released. I am a nurse and my hands are crucial to my job. For about a year I struggled with very simple things like opening pill bottles or taking a blood pressure. It was two years until I could wear my wedding ring. I still have some symptoms in my L hand. My thumb is triggered in the morning. Taping at night with athletic tape helps to prevent this when I remember to do it.",
