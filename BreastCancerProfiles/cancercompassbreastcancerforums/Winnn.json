    "Content": "Hi, My mom just had a double mastectomy at age 64. She had DCIS in one breast and low grade invasive breast cancer plus LCIS in the other breast.  Her nodes tested negative--does this mean she's likely out of the water for metastatic cancer? Do you think she can get genetic testing covered by her insurance (to see if she has BRCA)?  From what I've read, certain genetic factors may mean she is more likely at risk for ovarian cancer down the road? Nobody else in my family has had breast cancer, but do you think my sister and I should get tested for BRCA and anything else? Thanks for your help!  My dad's been struggling with brain cancer for the past year and my mom's diagnosis just caught us all off guard.   ",
