      "Content": "Hi Deborah, Jan here. I am an ovarian cancer survivor of almost seven years now. Stage 4. I too understand your feelings and the others who sort of just wonder what next?????? As far as the word you would rather not hear, I guess it is used a lot isn't it? I wish better things for you and all the others who have had to fight and struggle with this damn cancer. Some day I hope it to be no more. Yes, those same feelings are with me also...what is around the corner? I hope to remain strong and able to fight this beast if it chooses to return to my body but mean while I will stop and smell the roses a little more often than before. I will leave you with this quote my friend...\"There isn't a valley low enough that an angel can't carry you through it\u201d Be well.........Jan",

      "Content": "Hi Betsy, I understand your fears my friend. My C-125 usually is in a normal range and has been for quite sometime. Around 6 or 7. I have had no recurrence thus far. Very lucky. Get in touch anytime kiddo if you like. I am eight years now. And as you probably know you can go as high as maybe a 30 and all can be well. Wishing you good test results my friend. Hugs and be well.",
