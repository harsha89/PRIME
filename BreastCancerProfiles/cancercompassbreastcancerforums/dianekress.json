    "Content": "The month of October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2010, there will be and have been a total of 209,060 new cases of breast cancer, and 40,230 deaths as a result of it. One in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.  My mission is to raise awareness during Breast Cancer Awareness Month to the link between high insulin levels (insulin resistance) and the development of breast cancer in woman and men.       In 2001, researchers at the University of Buffalo confirmed \u201ca significant link between breast cancer risk and physical characteristics of insulin resistance\u201d The study, featured in Cancer Causes and Controls, was an offshoot of a much larger breast cancer risk study (10,786 women total) that followed women ages 35-69 who were recruited between 1987-1992 and have been followed ever since. The study concluded that, \u201cPremenopausal women with the highest waist-to-hip ratio (excess abdominal fat stores) were twice as likely to have developed breast cancer than controls\u201d. (www dot buffalo dot edu)). This compelling information was available to the public ten years ago!  There is a link between excess insulin production and breast cancer, but this information is very seldom discussed in breast cancer discussions. Women and men must be made aware of this link; it\u2019s a matter of knowledge being power to help prevent a devastating disease.       This March, a specialist from the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania stated that there is data indicating that people with \u2018metabolic syndrome\u2019( excess abdominal fat stores, hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and insulin resistance are more likely to develop breast cancer, especially in women who are post-menopausal.       People with metabolic syndrome, pre diabetes, type 2 diabetes\u2026.anyone with uncontrolled Metabolism B\u2026fits the profile for excess insulin production/insulin resistance.  Research is showing that the risk of developing breast cancer is more likely in Met B\u2019s\u2026and since over 50% of the overweight population has metabolism B, this is a very serious situation that needs to be large scale publicized and addressed.       The Metabolism Miracle   In 2004, Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention  published a study funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ministry of Health of Mexico, and the American Institute for Cancer Research. It proved that women were twice as likely to develop breast cancer if they were prone to consuming a higher carb diet.  \u201cScientists believe high intake of carbs (especially simple, low fiber carbs) may increase cancer risk by rapidly raising sugar in the blood, prompting a surge of insulin release. This causes cells to divide and leads to higher levels of estrogen in the blood, both of which can encourage cancer growth\u201d (www dot msnbc dot msn dot com). This statement shows a direct link between excess insulin production to cancer growth in the body. Marji McCullough, a senior epidemiologist and nutrition expert at the American Cancer Society stated that, \u201cIt leads me to believe that healthier carb sources, or at least diets containing fiber, would be less strongly associated with breast cancer\u201d ..       The  medical community is very well aware of the link between excess insulin production, insulin resistance, and breast cancer.  Unfortunately, this information is not common knowledge for the average woman.  Millions of men and women can be affected by the lack of this knowledge.        Please help spread the word that anyone with uncontrolled Metabolism can normalize insulin release and decrease insulin resistance in a matter of weeks with The Metabolism Miracle.  Spread the word and save a life!  Thank you\u2026..Diane     is the solution to this problem and can potentially reduce the numbers of women and men diagnosed with breast cancer, and save the lives our mothers, sisters, aunts, daughters, and friends. The Metabolism Miracle is the only comprehensive lifestyle program that matches all the components of Metabolism B and brings the internal hormonal environment into equilibrium.        ",
