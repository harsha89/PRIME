      "Content": "After reading about Ann Cameron and Chris beat cancer with carrot juice, I was confident that Carrot juice was my cure.  I have HPV positive tonsil cancer stage 2.  I juiced 5lbs of carrots everyday for 8 weeks hoping to shrink the tumor and rid my body of the cancer.  I was very faithful everyday 5# of sweet organic carrot juice.  Much to my dismay my cancer progressed and grew larger.  This protocol may not have work for me, but there are plenty of folks who claim it has.  Plus side of juicing is I felt terrific. I lost a good amount of weight, very pleased.  As far as curing or inhibiting growth it didn't happen for me.  Good luck on your journey.  You will find what is right for you.   Trust God and your angels. ",
