    "Content": "one year from my first chemo(ACT),it came back,or never went into remission.I went to see a doc about a really sore knee(torn cartledge) and hip pain. took a shot of cortisone in the knee,and was told basically that surgery will likely be the only answer.with the hip,he saw suspicious spots,told me my hip was bone to bone and would need a replacement.sent me to my oncologist the same day,and he ordered a battery of tests(metastised to my liver and pelvis) said the best course of treatment would be xeloda and avastin.I am having the catheter put in thursday,and as soon as it heals,I will begin drug therapy.I've been on xeloda almost 2 weeks,with mild discomfort. For those of you who do both,what it that like? how long will your treatments last? I also went to the radiologist to get me ready for 10 treatments of the pelvic area. Any idea what to expect? My mother-in-law is taking xeloda (she's83) for colon cancer,and one of the side effects are really soft nails that you can almost peel off. GOOD LUCK TO ALL IN TREATMENT. ABBE PS.my cancer started in my left breast,with 3 lymph node involvement does it seem as if many cancers come back quickly?",
