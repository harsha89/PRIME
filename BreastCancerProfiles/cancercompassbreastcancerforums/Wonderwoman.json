      "Content": "i am 48 yrs old, post menopausal and was dx with b/c in 03 - had a bi lat mast and chemo - i was on tamox for 3 yrs and was changed to aromasin - gained 8 lbs in 3 months and switched to femara - lost 6 lbs but my body aches somewhere all the time - i do run around 10 to 15 miles a week but i think it actually helps a little - i don't think the docs tell you any side effects - or at least mine doesn't - i did have some spotting and my gyno told me it was probably from the meds - i try to read as much as i can about the meds and cancer to stay informed - we have to take our health into our own hands - anyway good luck everyone - deb :-)",

      "Content": "hi everyone - i am new here but had to ask - i was dx with bc in 03 - had bi lat mast, 4 rounds AC, ovaries out, (had hyst years ago) - i am Estrogen - PR+(23%)(low) her2+ (6.9) - on tamox 3 yrs - was switched to aromasin then to femara - my joints are killing me along with other side effects - my onco has not ordered any test besides blood work -ever - (no news is good news approach) i am 48 yrs old and the more i think about all this and read all the post here, i am inclined to tell my onco that she needs to be more aggressive - i don't want to wait until something happens - so... do you think that this is a fair assumption - i'm not one to run to the doc for much if anything but now having some nausea and headachs about every 4 weeks - does anyone else have this symptom - sorry i am rambling - i'll stop but if anyone out there has any advice i could sure use it - thanks :-)",

      "Content": "i had a bi lat mast on 4/21/03 with expanders (recon) and 21 lymph nodes removed under left arm - i don't think the dr's really tell you what to expect - at least mine didn't - i spent 2 nights in the hosp - you have drains under your arms on both sides - the side where the lymph nodes were removed was very sore - i was up and out by may 3rd but only because of my son's first communion - that was my goal - i started chemo on may 12 - i think recovery takes a long time physically and mentally but you plow through it head on - it will be tough but with family and friends she will do great - just be there for her little needs (you'd be surprised how many there are) haha - anyway tell your mom good luck and i will keep her in my prayers :-)",

      "Content": "Yes - i too have a tingling feeling - i had a bi-lat mast in april 2003 with expander recon - the side that they took out 21 lymph nodes feels tight all the time - in fact wearing a bra feels better as it pulls the implants in (away from umder my armpit) i do get a tingling feeling - almost like i have to scratch under there but can't get to it so i just move the implant around and after a while it goes away - i never thought that i should tell my onco - although she wouldn't do anything - i guess i am going to have to ask for an MRI or something besides blood work - she doesn't believe in doing unnecessary testing - good luck and let me know what you find out",
