      "Content": "My mom is so sick in the hospital with this cancer that is eating away at her, she is almost comatose and I am honestly planning to kill myself. She is everything to me. I am not married, dont have kids and a huge support system. she is young too, only 66. But i know i cant handle it. I am falling apart and I have about 40 morphine ills @ 60mg which I plan on swallowing slowly in a span of two hours. The only reason I am writing is because I want to say that i understand how you and all of you feel for your loss. I will never be the same again. Some people can put things like that behind, I cannot. I know myself. The idea of dying myself sounds very appealing and I have no reason to live anymore.  I never had much use for this life anyway. I dont like what my family did to my mother and how things just never worked out for me and my sister and family in general. I graduated yale, but I couldnt give my mom the home she wanted cause my job didnt pay enough to buy a house - especially in these times. I wont be leaving much behind and I dont think anyone is going to miss me. My so called friends are pretty fair weather and i doubt they would care (or even notice) I am gone. I go to sleep every night praying I wont wake up the next day. No one believes me, but I pray I dont wake up. But god doesnt listen to me and instead takes her away, who actually wanted to live.  There is no justice and because of that there will be no peace. Not for me at least. ",
