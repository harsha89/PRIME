    "Content": "Hi,  I am fairly new to message boards and very new to this jaw bone problem. About 2 months ago I had some swelling on my bottom jaw, which I assumed was pieces of an old tooth that was extracted 35 years ago. I did a little self help and pulled a few pieces out. As time went on the exposed bone (which I thought was tooth fragments) kept getting larger. Yesterday I went to the dentist and was informed that it was bone. He ground down the bone so it was below the skin surface and said it should heal. Time will tell. The difference with me in this case is: I have never been diagnosed with cancer and I have never taken any Bisphosphonates. It seems like any research I do, includes these two facts. However I am a 54 year old male and a 100% disabled veteran with type 2 Diabetes, Fibro Myalgia and Peripheral Neuroapthy, (please excuse spelling errors) and take various drugs for these conditions, but nothing in common with other people with the exposed jaw bone condition. My dentist has no clue to why this is happening.   Thought this might be of interest to you.
