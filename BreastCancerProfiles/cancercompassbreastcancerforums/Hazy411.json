    "Content": "I had a similar experience. I found a lump, put off going to the doctor.  When I went in November they immediately did a biopsy following the mammogram and ultrasound. I didn't really need for anyone to tell me I could sense from the facial expressions of the techs who did teh ultrasound that the outcome would not be good.   Had a PET scan December 7th. Got the results yesterday.  The cancer is stage 4. It has spread to my left lung, one lymp node under my left arm, a nodule, and all of the lymph nodes between the breasts.  Not the news I was hoping for.  ",
