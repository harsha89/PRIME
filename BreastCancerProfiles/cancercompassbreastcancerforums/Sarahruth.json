    "Content": "It has been some time since I posted.  Every problem I had corseponded with femara.  I asked and asked and I was told there was no way it could be the problem.  When I finally went to a orthopedic surgeon, I was sent to two back surgeons. I didn't go.   I went to Albany Medical  to be seen by a doctor who did less invasive surgery.  He examined me, did x-rays and said there was nothing he saw wrong with my back that he  could  operate on. No problems.  I was referred to a neurologist in Kingston who ordered several tets.  It was finally diagnosed that it was a hip problem and I had bone on bone.  It has been severely painful. I walked with a walker and probably belonged in a wheel chair.  Today I am home 12 days after a total hip replacement on my right side with one needed on the left.  How much of a coincidence is it that all my problems started with femara.  I still can't stand up straight and walk without a walker and walk, but I am going to PT.  I wish everyone well and would love to hear if others had a total hip deterioration.  That looks like what happened to me.  I know 'femara' is a miracle drug, but at what price?  I have been left a cripple.",
