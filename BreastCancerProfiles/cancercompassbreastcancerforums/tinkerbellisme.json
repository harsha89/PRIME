      "Content": "Two years ago, my mother was diagnosed with an invasive breast cancer.  She had  mastectomy, chemotherapy, reconstruction, removal of the implant due to an infection she contracted in the OR, treatment with Herceptin, and yet another reconstructive surgery.  I'm extremely happy to say that she has been declared cancer free.  When I received this information, I started thinking.  When my mom came home from the hospital, she had a full support system, but what about the many women who don't?  Please take a look at this info, and if you feel the same way, sign this petition, which was started by Lifetime Television. The petition is to stop the practice of \"drive thru mastectomies,\" and instead demands a congressional bill that takes the desisions about the recovery of us, our mothers, and daughters OUT of the hands of insurance companies, and puts it back where it belongs... with our familes and doctors.  http://www.lifetimetv.com/breastcancer/petition/signpetition  ",

      "Content": "I don't know what part of the country you're in, but perhaps there is a specialty center in a surrounding city.  When my mom was diagnosed, the local surgeon she was reffered to by her family doctor (who actually specialized in heart surgery, not breast) postponed her scheduled surgery for 3 additional weeks (it had already been almost 2 months sincer her actual diagnosis) because he had a golf vacation coming up.  I know that many doctors will tell you that a delay doesn't matter, but when it's your life or that of someone you care about, every single day makes a difference!!  I'm very glad he did postpone her surgery though.  Since she told us, my entire family had been begging her to see a specialist.  She finally relented after that cancellation.  From that day, it took less than a week to have her surgery by an amazing breast cancer specialist.  He was so caring, compassionate, and professional.  I  didn't know doctors like that still existed....especially surgeons.  If you are in MD, DC, PA, VA or anywhere near, let me know and I would be happy to give you his info.",
