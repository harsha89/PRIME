I remember how I felt when I first felt the lump in my breast. And I'm sure it's even scarier because you are pregnant. Please, get to a doctor immediately! There is always the possibility that you just have a cyst. However, it could be cancer. The only way to know which is to go to the doctor, who will send you for a mammogram & possibly a sonogram as well. If it is just a cyst, you will be so relieved. And if it is cancer, it may be very early at this point. But waiting would be a very bad idea. Since you are pregnant, you would want any treatment to be safe for the baby, too. That's why going quickly is the best thing to do. I don't know where you live, but if you live in a big city, try to go to someplace that specializes in breast care. I'm sure your doctor can advise you. But, no matter where you go, the first thing is to call your doctor & tell her or him that you did find a lump. And also remind them you are pregnant, so that they take care of you quickly. I will pray that you only have a cyst. No matter what, you will get through this. Let us know how you are. Jaybird56",
