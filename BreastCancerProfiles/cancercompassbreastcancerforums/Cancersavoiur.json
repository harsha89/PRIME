    "Content": "Hello, I was told that I had breast cancer in Feb. of 2004. I went to the doctor's three time's before they told me what I had. I knew something was wrong. I felt something in my left breast last July of 2003. So I went to the doctors then, I had a mammogram done but they said it was negative. I went but again in Oct. of 2004 because it was bigger. But the doctor told me it was just a cyst. I had no test done at all. Then I went back again because it was even bigger. It was already 4 by 5 size. My whole life has changed. Can you help me deal with this somehow? I just want to know that things do get better. Thanks for listening. JP",
