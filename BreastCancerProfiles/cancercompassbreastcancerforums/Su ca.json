    "Content": "My mom has just got diagnosed with breast cancer. Her lump is about 7.5 centimeter, but it's a combination of water and the cancer itself. We don't have an exact measurement of the cancer but we're hoping for less than 2 centimeters. We have a app with her surgeon next week to set up a surgery date. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant and its a lot for me to take in. my mom is catholic and spends a lot of time with a lady whom everybody treats like if she's God disciple lets call her daisy. Well daisy was the first person my mom called after we got out of the results app. Daisy told her to hide the cancer from her family including my sister and dad. And told my mom that she doesn't have cancer. Right after her conversation with daisy my mom told me that she doesn't have cancer and will throw all the cancer documents to the trash. I'm completely scared because she's convinced that she doesn't have cancer and its not a big deal. I'm scared that my mom isn't taking this serious, any advice?",
