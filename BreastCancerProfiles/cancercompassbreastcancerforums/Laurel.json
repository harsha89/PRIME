    "Content": "Hi, I've had 3 PET scans and 1 PET/CT scan. The injection is a simple IV injection, no pain at all. The patient sits quietly for an hour for uptake of the radioactive glucose tracer, then the patient is scanned. It's a very easy procedure, but one that gleans wonderful information. This scan is so detailed it even detected a flu injection I'd had the week before! I anticipate another scan soon to determine if my ovarian cancer is still in remission. But the injection? A piece of cake! Hope you have great results, Laurel",
