    "Content": "Your message has a recurring theme in my life.  My fiance was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer on Valentine's Day 2007.  She was pregnant with our daughter and facing the reality of not being there for Kendyl.  Planning, or should I say expecting to be a part of her support group, she informed me on the way to her third chemo treatment that she was calling of the engagement.  Stating that she no longer had the capacity or desire to be in a romantic relationship.  Since we severed ties, her anger and bitterness has been bestowed on me.   I am her punching bag and the situation is only getting worse.  Attempts to reconcile have been futile and the desire to move is becoming omnipotent.  However, feelings of guilt penetrate my heart when the opportunity to date resurfaces.  Inferior thoughts of betrayal and insensitivity have caused me to pause.  Should I continue to hesitate or come to the realization that all thing must pass?  David ",
