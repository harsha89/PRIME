    "Content": "I have been questioning people for 20 years when I learn that they have/had breast cancer, or they have a friend or relative that had breat cancer. (I have a public service job that enmables me to speak to different prople daily.)I always ask them how the cancer was discovered. Guess what? In 20 years of inquiring of hundreds of people, the answer is always the same...\"Self-Examination\"!  I have only spoke to a couple people that stated a mammogram disclosed it. Instead, they will routinely say that they (or their acquaintance) received routine mammograms, only to \"feel a lump\" several months after being cleared by a mammogram. They always say their doctor told them that the mammogram \"missed\" it. Oddly enough, the lump is often quite large which begs the question \"Why was it missed by the mammogram?\"  I am not saying mammograms are worthless, but I think a study needs to be done to see how often breast cancer is discovered by the patient themselves.  I also think that we should seriously consider whether mammograms are also \"causing\" the tumors.",
