      "Content": "I know those feelings well. My bro has cancer, which has spread as aggressively as your mothers, and like your mother, my brother doesn't like to talk about it. Maybe he\u2019s just scared or just afraid to show emotion. I however, find these message boards extremely helpful as well as informative. I am always available and ready when he wants to talk about it, but I also understand that he\u2019s probably terrified. In front of him I'm strong and encouraging him that he'll beat it after all he\u2019s only 38 yrs old. All I can suggest to you is to just be there for her and when she\u2019s ready to talk about it and try your best not to break down (I know how hard that is). If you need to talk, please send me a message. Mat God Bless you, your mother and your whole family. Hope it helps. All the best.",

      "Content": "Hi, my name is Laura and my brother Nat has stage 4 lung cancer with mets to his hips and tail bone. Nat first found out about his cancer as an incidental finding, after all we went to the ER for his abdominal pains and the x-ray showed the tumor in his right upper lobe of his lung. That was February 14, 2003. Nat had a lobectomy on 4/24/03 and was told he was cancer free but was referred to an oncoligist as a precautionary measure. He did 6 weeks of chemo and during that time he was getting really bad back pains which were getting progressivly worse. Finally they sent him for MRI's of his back where it showed the bone metastasis. They stopped chemo and started radiation, 10 intensive treatments. The dr. then decided to place him on the cancer drug Iressa. The tumor markers all went down and we were both very excited. The point of my story is that the whole time Nat had cancer, the tumor markers were low and getting lower, but thats no real indication that the cancer is going into remission, on the contrary Nats dr. said the tumor marker tests have fooled them many times before and even though Nat's last tumor marker blood test was 13.6 the cancer has spread like gasoline on an open flame. It has completely taken his right lung and is working on the left lung as well as the mets on his hips and back, you can actually see them. So please don't use those blood tests as signs, please get the pet scans, they are much more reliable. GOD BLESS",
