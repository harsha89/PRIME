My oncologist says its fibro from the chemo. My body feels bruised all over. The pain in my hip is now in my thigh. My hands hurt so bad and go numb at night. At first it was just my fingers now its the entire hands. Right after chemo I had low back pain to the point of throwing up and taking 14 shows and baths in one day. My feet scream with pain in the morn.It is just escalating. This is just a short summery. There is more. Tell me Im not going crazy. Susan Hi. you are not going crazy.Two and a half years ago I spent six months in a 12 by 12 foot room receiving a trial chemo for Acute Myloid Leukaemia. Since then I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. If I had know then that I would be left like this I would have refused the treatment. My hands are severly crippled and the pain is constant and excrutiating. My knees too refuse to work. My feet, my hips, my legs make me cry, the pain is so great. I suffer suicidal depressions as well. I am 62 years old and have been active all my life, now life is not worth living. I have been prescribed a concoction of pain killers and anti depressants to help me cope but with little success. My heart goes out to you Susan and anyone else who is suffering this wicked illness. What makes it worse is that it is an invisible illness and friends think they are helping when they say cheer up it can't be that bad. I am here to say it is that bad and often worse. David",
