    "Content": "I came across your message by chance and I'm only a new breast cancer patient but I've done lots of research. All lumps should be checked by your doctor, better safe than sorry. It's possible to have cancer return in the remaining tissue after mastectomy, hopefully that isn't what you're experiencing but you don't want to ignore it. I ignored a symptom not wanting to be a hypochondriac and my diagnosis was delayed by about eight months. My treatment is now having to be more aggressive and the cancer may have spread. In future I'd rather a Doctor thought I was being a bit sensitive than leave something and it turn out to be serious.   Good luck ",
