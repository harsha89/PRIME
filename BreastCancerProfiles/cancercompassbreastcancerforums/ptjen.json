The first is a 2000 article that refers to a medical journal article that you can order from your local library (as I recall, the title is slightly different than what is stated in this article). The second and third are more recent and the third is actually from the NIH. I, too, am being treated for breast cancer after having been treated for thyroid cancer many years ago. I got lax about my mammograms - my own fault. But had someone warned me of the risk, I would have bee n more dilegent. I brought this info to my doctors - they didn't know about it. Good luck!

      "Content": "TurtleTAM: These articles probably won't help you. They refer to the link between thyroid cancer and breast cancer with a pretty strong presumption that the link may be caused by the radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer. Most of what I've seen discusses cancer rather than thyroid disorders. Good luck with both problems! On 2/1/2009 TurtleTAM wrote: Thanks for the links to the articles. I will need some time to read them. I was diagnosed in October with hyperthyroidism and then in January with breast cancer. (it has been a busy year) I asked if there was any link but no one seemed to think the two were related. TurtleTAM",
