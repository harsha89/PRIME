    "Content": "My name is Renetta I\"m 29 yrs old last month I was told that my cancer has came back. When I was first diagnosed it was Breast Cancer March 2005. I had Chemo, a Masectomy and radiation. When every thing was over I started taking Taxmoixfen I thought ever thing was over. Until I found a lump in my neck I went to find out if the cancer has spreading any where else and found out it did. It's now located in my liver and my lymphnodes. I am very scared I used to think I was to young for all of this but I soon realize cancer attacks at all ages. I'm really not sure what type of treatment I will be on I will find out this week, but I'm going to ask them about the chemo you were on. I really wish this could all go away now, but I know that's not going to happen. I know I have to keep the faith and pray for my health....",
