    "Content": "I started chemo 2 weeks after my 30th birthday and it put me in menopause.  They said it was a 50/50 chance that I would ever come out of chemo but I did 3 years later.  They said I would never have children but at age 37 I got pregnant with my first and only child.  Surprisingly they wanted me to abort but I refused and refused any testing of any kind.  My son will be 10 next week and he is perfect.  Good luck to you.  More and more women are having children after chemo.  It may depend on the type of chemo as well.",
