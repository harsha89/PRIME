      "Content": "First off, thanks to everyone who posts here.  We have drawn so much inspiration from this site.   My amazing wife of 13 years has breast cancer, and we've been fighting it all the usual ways.  We are getting very serious about the diet and the natural things you can put in your body that help it fight off certian things, and just generally living a healtheir life.  We hope these things will help her cancer, but there's just too much information out there on all these \"magic\" natrual health drugs.  What is everyone here supplementing with?  How have you changed your diet?   There are a few things we have narrowed down that we are looking at: 1) Baking Soda (seriously).  Not sure of a specific brand, or if one is better than the other.  Thoughts? 2) Fucoidan (seaweed stuff).  All stuff we've read online says it helps against cancer.  Its extracted from seaweed and there are a lot of options to purchase.  We are looking at one called fucoidan fusion? Anyone have thoughts?  www.fucoidanfusion.com , their \"fusion85\" product.   3)Organic WormWood.  Supposedly has direct anti-cancer properties. Specifically looking at this one: http://www.shamansgarden.com/c-97-wormwood.aspx  Again, I think there are multiple options on the market.  Anyone have experience here?   Any help or discussion is so much appreciated!!! Thank you and God Bless! ",
