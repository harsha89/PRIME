      "Content": "Avastin was first used on colon cancer.  Then it went to trial for breast cancer.  Since it was so successful, they cancelled the trial and put all that participated in the trial on the actual drug.  The results were so outstanding that it quickly became part or the drug regimen for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.  It is and anti-angiogenic therapy.  Avastin is not chemotherapy.  It is monoclonal antibody.  These antibodies are generally a more targeted therapy than chemotherapy   Avastin kills the blood supply/blood vessels to the cancer cells by inhibiting blood vessel formation, which starves the tumor.  It has been out of clinical trial for breast cancer for a couple of years.  It seems that they are only using it with certain types of cancer.   It was part of my first treatment in August 2005 along with Docetaxel (Taxotere).  It was also part of my third treatment which I just finished.  Given that I have Stage IV Breast Cancer which is a chronic condition, I will also take Avastin starting next month over 4 months, once a month.   You may get nosebleeds, have hypertension, proteinuria \u2013 too much protein in the urine, weakness, pain, diarrhea, and a reduced white blood cell count.  She may also have hair loss with Avastin.   I had a nosebleed maybe 2 times after blowing my nose.  I didn't get anymore nosebleeds after I stated using a saline nose spray.  This helped to keep my mucus membrane moist.  If the white blood cell count is low, then they schedule you for a Neulasta shot the day after treatment.   Go to, www.avastin.com for more detailed information.   One other note, I don't know if your mother was nauseated during treatment but if she was and if she is during this next round, make sure she eats something about every 2 -3 hours.  I think people associate nausea with you're not to eat.  I found it should be just the opposite.   These drugs collect in the stomach, this is what causes the nausea, and you need something to properly help you digest and move them through.  It doesn't have to be a big meal but a half a sandwich, ice cream, yogurt, soup, cereal, oat meal, etc.   I hope this was helpful.  Please stay in touch.  I'd love to know how your mother is doing.",

      "Content": "That's good to hear.  When I was first diagnosed in 2005 I was taking Avastin and Docetaxel (Taxotere).  That treatment went very well.  It was followed up with 2 six weeks round of radiation.  I was just about to move to seeing the doctor once a year when my lymph nodes started to act up.   I have a lymph node between my collarbone and shoulder muscle that is my barometer on how things are going.  It flared up real bad in March.  I ended up with fluid on my left lung and a 4 day stay in the hospital.  I'm on my third round of chemo.  I started treatment again last week and will get 6-9 treatments, one every three weeks.   Thank you for replying to my email.   Princie",
