    "Content": "My diagnosis was three DCIS and one invasive lump with no sentinal lymphnode involvement. Had double mastectomy and started on Arimidex in August, 2005. Three months later had severe knee pain which made it hard to walk, get out of chairs, squat down and upper arm muscle pain. Before all this started, had been very physically active with running marathons, spinning and weight lifting. Stopped taking Arimidex due to quality of life. Three months later joint pain was gone and movement was better except in arms. Tried Femora with same results. Been off all medication since March and still have upper arm pain. Trouble taking clothes off over my head, hooking bras and reaching back behind me. Daughter-in-law, a GP physican, says I need PT to prevent ROM loss. Attempting to get order for PT. Has anyone else had permanent upper arm pain due to Arimidex? Thanks",
