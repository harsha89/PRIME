    "Content": "Dear I am 39 and I have just been told that I have breastcancer. The doctor adviced primair surgery and 6 month chemoterapy. I really do not feel anything to go forward with this terapy. I do not want chemo neither surgery. I started with a diet only on fruits,vegetables and I am also taking the Bioresponse DIM medecine. I still want a child (have no children yet) and therefore do not want chemo. I would appreciate to receive some more information on a healthy treatment, medecines, way of life. Thanks.",
