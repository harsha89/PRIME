    "Content": "I had my first mammogram done in January this year and the doctor found two micro-calcifications. I did the 6 month follow up in July and was told that the two micro-calcifications did not change in size. They are about 1.3cm and 1.9cm. My doctor suggested three options: 1) Do nothing now, follow up in 6 months; 2) Do a biopsy to suck out the liquid and they could shrink by half; 3) Do the surgery to remove them. I have no pain or any other health issues. What do you think I should do? I wish you all well and appreicate any advice. May",
