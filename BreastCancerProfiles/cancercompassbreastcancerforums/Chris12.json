      "Content": "Consider various natural options, highly successful in high doses and no side effects. An excellent natural medicine website for most types of cancer is the following: Click here: http://www.cancertutor.com Pay special attention to the entire panel (running vertically) on the left margin of the website, from top to bottom which covers specialized natural medicine treatments for different types of cancer individually. Take a look at the section of Cesium Chloride as well, but bear in mind it may not work on all cancers (mainly the ones that acidify the body) and must be taken with potassium. Excellent for pain relief within days!!! To add to all of this - black cumin oil, hemp leaf oil (mosty illegal, EAT IT, don't smoke it and blacken your lungs!!!) DAILY, juicing with wheatgrass, spirulina, brocolli and berries DAILY. Add cod liver oil, turmeric and black pepper DAILY to aid absorption. Eliminate sugar, simple carbs, maybe even complex carbs & wheat in general (DAILY). 15 MINUTES SUNSHINE PER DAY. Mild to moderate excercise if possible - DAILY and you are well on your way to beating cancer!!! Healthy people need good nutrition. Sick people need EXCELLENT nutrition - that's where superfoods come in. Natural medicine is more powerful than people think, but remember when you have cancer that \"eating healthy\" isn't enough. There are foods, and then there are super foods. There are even foods to avoid which you may think are healthy, like soy (or, soya). Hemp leaf oil and black cumin oil - nature's own chemotherapy!!! Consult a naturopathic doctor (ND) if you can afford to and get some personal guidance in the area of natural medicine. Liquid Cesium chloride has been very effective in late stage cancers and when used with potassium it is non-toxic. Unfortunately after chemo and radiation the chances of being cured with natural medicines is reduced - but not impossible. Cesium chloride mentioned here is NOT the radioactive type of cesium. The cesium chloride is excellent for reducing pain within days and reducing tumour size and spread. Make ginger tea from fresh ginger and boiling water - soak in boiling water for a few minutes then strain - NO sugar if possible. Ginger helps with nausea. Try coconut oil, or desicated coconut for the fatigue tiredness. Avoid caffeine and sugar - even if they help with the fatigue. Cancer grows faster with any type of sugar as cancer cell need more glucose (sugar) to fuel their faster growth rates, normal cells need far less. There is a type of new, oral vitamin C that is encapsulated (with an oil based substance I think) that I have read about that some say is as good as intra-venous vitamin C for cancer. Google search it as I don't remember where I read it and bare in mind it might conflict with other therapies. Do your research starting with the website I recommended above. Hemp leaf oil is made by genly (low heat) boiling the leaves and buds of the female hemp plant in alcohol, till alcohol evaporates leaving black sticky oil behind - eat very very very tiny amount per day and increase dosage slowly. See: http://www.medicaljane.com/2013/01/26/rick-simpsons-hemp-oil Hemp seed oil not as effective at treating cancer, only has cannibanols and not the THC. Better to use both in the hemp leaf oil. Black cumin oil also good, but not sure about pain relief. Cesium chloride best for that and maybe hemp too. All work on killing cancer.",

      "Content": "Look at somenatural optionsto treat your cancer. What many people don't realise is that even when treatments like chemo are \"successful\" it's usually not for more than a few years, after which the cancer returns in a new chemo resistant form. When it comes to surgery, it can be highly effective and life saving when the condition is serious and operable, but then you have reduced functionality of the organ that's been sliced and diced. The reduced funtionality then makes your fight even harder, further along the line in your fight against the cancer. You may say, \"so what, that part of the organ was diseased anyway - there was no other option, but to remove it.\" This is another misconception, unless you are about to die within 1 week of not having the surgery, a diseased organ can heal and will heal - IF you provide it with the right nutrition. Not the normal, healthy nutrition that a healthy person needs, but a SUPER healthy nutrition in many many small doses throughout the day, for a SUPER sick person. Remember there was a reason you got the cancer in the first place - a large part of that may have been ntrition and not as much of that was as \"out of your control\" as you think. There are some brilliant and powerful natural options for treating various cancers - many of these are specially designed cancer protocols that all differ in the way thet treat various different types of cancer. A great site that goes deeply into this would be:  http://www.cancertutor.com I am not sure whether Cesium Chloride will work with neuroendocrine cancer, but it is a safe and very powerful cancer treatment contrary to what some in the mainstream have said about it. It must always be used with potassium to prevent a potassium deficiency caused by the cesium - do that and it will be highly non-toxic. See: http://www.cancertutor.com /Cancer/Alkaline.html Black cumin oil, hemp leaf oil, turmeric, juicing of brocolli, berries, etc is all highly effective as well. Google these options. Sugar and grains, processed foods, acidify the body, while fruit and veg reduce acidity (alkalise the body) - as does liquid cesium chloride to a larger extent. This slows the spread of cancer which spreads faster under acidic conditions and even excretes lactic acid itself.",
