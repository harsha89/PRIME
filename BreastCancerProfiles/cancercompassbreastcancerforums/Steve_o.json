    "Content": "Hi There, I would likr to inform you that when you are diagnosed with cancer the first and foremost thing you should have done is have your body PH level checked. You can simply do this by buying PH litmus paper at your local pharmacy. Cancer starts and thrives in an acidic environment. Acid levels are elevated by a diet high in pasta, bread, sweets and fried food. To bring acidity under control you must avoid these foods and concentrate on foods that are highly acidic. Calcium supplements can also change the PH levels to more alkaline. The bodies response to this type of nutrition causes the opposite effect.  A diet high in acid causes the PH levels to rise in alkalinity where a diet high in sweets and converted sugers such as fried food, breads, pasta, causes PH levels to become more acidic. Acidty levels can be so strong it begins to eat away at tissue and cause a place in the body where free radicals can remain. Thus the formation of tumors and degenrative tissue, before long the body is contaminated with these free radicals and thus you have higher white blood cells and they are so overwhelmed they and begin attacking the entire body, good tissue and bad. The immune system can no longer handle this type of situation so eventually it shuts down.   To sum it all up, cancer is in all of us it's the diet we choose that gives birth to it.",
