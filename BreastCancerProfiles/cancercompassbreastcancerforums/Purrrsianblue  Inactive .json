    "Content": "OH, DEFINENTY get the MRI!  I just had one 2 weeks ago. Nothing bad at all!  My doctor prescribed me a little valium to take the edge off.  They let my husband come in there with me the entire time, he held my hand.  I was lying on my stomach with my eyes close and was comfortable. It was not scary to me at all.  The noise wasn't even very loud, like I thought it would be. It was over in no time and was not painful in anyway. This is a must!  You have to do this to find out what it is.  The earlier the better.  I was just diagnosed with LCIS myself in December. I'm still confused about it all and I'm learning about all kinds of new things, that I never really wanted to know...ha ha!  I'm gonna write my own message for sure because I have TONS of questions. But one thing I can tell you for sure.  My MRI......was a piece of cake!  The the benefits to both of us...could save our lives!  Good luck!",
