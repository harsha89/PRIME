    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with ILC, invasive lobular carcinoma and LCIS (in situ) on early stage. First doctors suggested to do mastectomy because it's hard to catch and I just was lucky that they found it, but than in Stanford because it's early stage and easy recovery we decided on lumpectomy. Now I should start to do radiation, but the problem is that when they were putting wires for some reason they decided that marker moved and attached wire to calcification (in situ). Now after lumpectomy is done, in pathology report said that biopsy ILC part got fragmented because no ILC part founded. Probably biopsy got the most of it, but some margin should be left behind. The question is should I start to do radiation and hope that what ever left will dye with radiation or I need to do mastectomy because now it's not possible to find those cells that left over.",
