    "Content": "I have probably asked this question before.  Since the memory does not serve me half the darn time.  Swelling!  I have complained about swelling alot.  Had to get my wedding ring resized after 33 years and yesterday I had to remove that ring because it getting tight.  I was not sure if the recent swelling was due to my finger laceration swelling/infection.  I also looked up hypoalbuminemia and swelling can be from low levels of albumin or kidney issues.  Anyone else experience some kind of swelling?  One minute its leg, then one arm, lower back and stomach.  Kidney and liver function tests have always been fine.",
