    "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years follows stage 2a ER+ PR+ Her2- breast cancer with one possible node involvement.  My onc switched me to Femara last March and the side effects are getting worse over time.  My legs and feet hurt like I've been excercises for hours! It's worse in the morning.   I can barely move...my legs are so stiff and aching.  I decided to not take the Femara this morning to see if it changes.  I got on here and saw all the posts from ladies with the same symptoms.  My onc also acts like I'm crazy, but the quality of life with this drug is horrible.  Any suggestions?",
