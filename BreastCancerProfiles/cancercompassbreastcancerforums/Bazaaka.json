    "Content": "I had breast cancer in 2003; small lump.  Received only radiation treatments followed with Arimidex for the next five years.  The ONLY side effect I had from the Arimidex is loose bowels.  I must add that even though I'm 71, I'm very active and continued to be active throughout the cancer treatments.  I do aerobics three times a week, walk 7/5 miles twice a week and lift weights twice a week.  I exercise six out of seven days of the week.  I walked seven miles three days after the surgery.  In five years on Arimidex, I have experienced no joint problems other than my toes hurting--and I've had arthritis since my 20s; so, I've never been sure if they hurt from the arthritis or the Arimidex.  But now, I've been off the Arimidex for over a month, and am still having bowel problems.  In reading some of the other letters, I'm wondering if some permanent colon damage has occurred.  Or, if it's going to take a while before my body gets back to normal. ",
