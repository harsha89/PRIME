      "Content": "Question for you, how much $ did you pay for the sun? Well I paid nothing: it's rays are pure vitamin D, where do you live, and how much sun do you get.  Anyways, when the big bright orb shows up here in the northwest, I buy skim milk lol.  Well, my friend thank you for sharing though.  I have recently, by hearing God's voice, been able to use my brain ca for the betterment of society, even myself.  The thought of an orange exploding in my head is sick! I prefer strawberries because their a little smaller.  However, I have recently been blessed by a leadership role to support brain-injured folks, that fell right into my lap.  TBI network has my back w/funding and support/TBIWA.ORG, until we meet again, hopefully on here in this lifetime, you have a good'un. Sincerely, Joseph.  P.S, I did glean some unknown data from you, and I always welcome further advice,so please provide me w/more info if/when you get it! Thx a mil! :))) ",
