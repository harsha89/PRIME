    "Content": "I understand that Arimidex is for post-menopausal women. My side effects were so awful that it was too painful to work out at the gym. My bones ached horribly, and I suffered from \"chemo brain\", a condition where you feel like you are in a fog, and can't remember people's names or what you were just thinking. Weird, but true. I went off of the drug last summer so I could go to Ireland and hike around without pain. I had a great time,and felt well. My doctor switched me to tamoxifen at my next app., but I never took it after reading the side-effects of that drug. I now am back on a self-imposed lower dose of Arimidex.....I only take1/2 tablet every other day. I would not recommend this for anyone. It is just what I did to cope. My cancer was stage one, invasive ductal. Another gross side effect was the fusion of my labias and cervix to nearby walls, and atrophy of my vulva. This was all related to lack of estrogen, the purpose of the drug for estrogen-driven cancers. My gyno is now trying to balance localized estrogen therapy to rehab my \"fragile vagina\".......just giving you a heads up if you have had a similar experience. I have read a few similar stories on other blogs. I think that every person is different, and you have to make the best choice possible for yourself. Tamoxifen is for pre-menopausal women, but they were willing to switch me to it, and I am 60. Keep exercising and living well. One step at a time. JB",
