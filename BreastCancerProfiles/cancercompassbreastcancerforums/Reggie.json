    "Content": "I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer almost nine years ago. i have no evidence of disease at this time, but I did undergo a full year of chemo, surgery, chemo, radiation; followed by five years of tamoxifen; and now two years of arimidex. I continue to have hot flashes though not as severe and frequent as those on tamoxifen. I am increasingly concerned though about sleeplessness. I seem unable to fall asleep easily and, when I do, I wake up multiple times during the night. I don't know if it's the sleeplessness or the drug, but my mental acuity seems to have suffered -- paticularly in remembering proper nouns (names) and accessing precise vocabulary -- very frustrating to an English major! I have had good bones, but am beginning to wonder if osteoporosis could become a problem for me. Anybody else concerned about sleeplessness or memory (of language more than events or reasoning)?
