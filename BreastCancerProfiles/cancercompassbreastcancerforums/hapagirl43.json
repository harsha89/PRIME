    "Content": "My stepmother has been on Femara since April and asked her oncologist for a CT/PET and MRI, and he said it isn't necessary right now.  That it's too early.  She's a stage 4 breast cancer patient, with cancer having metastisized in the bone, and this is a recurrent cancer.  She'd originally had breast cancer in 91 or 92 and beat it.  Her worry is if they're not doing a CT/PET or MRI, how will they know that the cancer isn't spreading and that the Femara is actually working?  Any advice is great appreciated. Thanks so much!",
