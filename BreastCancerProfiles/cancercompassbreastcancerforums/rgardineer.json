    "Content": "My oncologist acted as if I was the only one that had so much dibilitating pain. One thing I DO know is I could NOT take anything with soy or estrogen of any kind!  It's true that we are removing estrogen with chemo.  So don't put it back in our bodies. Just about anything that helps, unfortunately, we cannot take. For me the chemo was OK. Don't get me wrong, I never want it again!  It's the 5 year pills that were destroying me. I stopped after 2 years. My oncologist and a second and third opinion agreed.  My younger of 2 son's had milestones coming up in his life. I had to be there for him. I stopped pills 2 months prior and surprisingly.........Never went back! The quality of life was too important. I also had another IV drip for a year. During chemo and continued for the balance of a year. It was the most important drug for my recovery. Everyone must make their own decisions.",
