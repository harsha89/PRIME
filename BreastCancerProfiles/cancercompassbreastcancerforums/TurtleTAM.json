They will give you a local and if you feel any pain at all, tell them because there is no reason for pain. Take it easy the rest of the day and put ice packs on that side. A sports bra will help. Try to do or plan activities (not too active) that will take your mind off the waiting for the test results. Don't dwell on the possibility of a bad diagnosis. You can deal with that news if it should come. Be sure to take someone with you to the appointment when you find out the results. Another pair of ears never hurts and if there is good news, you can celebrate. We will celebrate with you also. Think positive and let us know how it turns out. We will be here for you if you need us. TT  ",

Unfortunately, I fell into the 20% of something. The calcifications led them to the tumor. It was much better knowing than not knowing although waiting on the results was really hard. As for symptoms, sometimes you can have pain, lumps that grow/change, changes in breast skin and discharge from the nipple. You could have these symptoms without cancer or you could have cancer without any of these symptoms. Have your doctor explain the biopsy method he will be using so you can make an informed decision.

      "Content": "Tiamarie - You are never alone if you come here for support. Do you know what kind of biopsy you will be having? It would be good to find out and then do some research. I had a stereotopic biopsy which took about 45 minutes and was completely out-patient and I drove myself home. There was just a small amount of pain during the procedure but the doctor was able to administer additional medication to numb the area better. I was positioned face down on a table with a whole in the center and my breast was put into a mammogram so they could locate the exact spot to take tissue. After the procedure, my sports bra was a must. I found one that zipped up the front which was easy to put on and held everything tight. Ice packs made out of handiwipes in a snacksize ziploc bag slipped nicely into the bra and helped with pain and swelling. I think the waiting for the results of the biopsy was the worst part of the whole thing. Know that 80% of all biopsies come back negative. Take someone with you when you get the results. If it is negative, you can celebrate together. If it is positive then they can help you remember what the doctor says after those words are spoken. Remember to ask if more than one person read the results to be sure. If it is positive, get all your options but don't make any rash decisions. Make another appointment in a week and do research on each of your options to determine the pros and cons to make the best decision for you, your family and your life. If something doesn't sound right or if you feel there are other options not being presented, get a second opinion. It is always good to get a second opinion. I hope you have good results but if it turns out to be something, then we are here for you. TAM",

There are many ways to keep your memories alive and honor her life by getting together a team of friends and family to walk/run in her name in the relay for life or Susan G Komen race for a cure. The great thing about the relay for life is that while you are sitting and waiting for your turn, you can share great stories about times you had together plus listen to others tell their stories of how your sister impacted their lives.

I don't know about BC/BS but with my insurance, I just paid one co-pay at the initial consulation for the radiation oncologist and then just show up for each of my radiation treatments without additional payments. I see the doctor once a week and then see his visit submitted to insurance without additional co-pay. So far, every doctor, surgeon and service has been very good about working with me on paying the bills. I also paid another co-pay for the medical oncologist but didn't end up getting chemo so I can't attest to that process. On another note, do you have a consumer counselor service available in your area? They can typically talk to your creditors and get them to not only lower their interest rates but can sometimes get them to stop calling you. This will help with your stress level and let you and your husband concentrate on healing. TAM",

Salves made from aloe vera, emu oil or Aquaphor from Eucerin can help with the healing. I understand that it may be uncomfortable wearing a bra but a bra that lifts the breast up without an underwire can be lined with a soft material. If your rash/wounds get too bad, your doctor may want to delay your treatment till your skin is healed. For my treatment, my skin was checked weekly and didn't experience any serious burn issues. My skin has a darker pigment and I was very diligent in applying a natural care gel provided by the cancer center in the mornings after my shower and at night before bed plus towards the end of treatment also put on right after my treatment.

      "Content": "Bonnie - Don't be scared....especially out of your mind. Are you married or have a significant other in your life? Be sure to have someone that you can take to your appointments for another set of ears to hear what they say. A mast will probably be a good choice with reconstruction. I did have the lumpectomy but they took so much tissue, I may actually need some help in the reconstruction area. I look fairly odd right now because I am a C on one side and B on the other. Be sure to get second opinions when things don't sound quite right. Drs also don't expect you to make snap decisions so don't feel like you have to give answers right now if you want to think about it or do some additional research. I think you will feel much better once the surgery is behind you and you can concentrate on healing and getting better. The way that tamoxifen was described to me is that while there are some unpleasant side affects, there are very good side affects that out weigh the bad ones. From some of the other posts, the drugs they give for post menopausal women have worse side affects than tamoxifen. I don't look forward to possible hot flashes. I was given the option of forced menopause so then I would take a different drug if I didn't want tamoxifen? Being HR+, I will need to be on something.

      "Content": "Foreigngirl1 I\u2019m in a very similar situation. I\u2019m 44 with no family history. The abnormal tissue with calcifications was noticed on my mammogram. The weekend between my stereotactic biopsy and the doctor\u2019s appointment on Monday was the longest weekend ever. Your chances of a good outcome are about 80%. Mine wasn\u2019t so good but I tried to keep a positive attitude. When I was given the results, the surgeon was good to let me know several options available. He didn\u2019t expect us to rush into any option and provided all information for a second opinion. I selected a lumpectomy. Now I am healing and preparing for radiation treatment. I don\u2019t know the answer to any of your medical questions but I can tell you that it is important to get options and make an informed decision about your health. I\u2019ve been blessed to have my new husband by my side. If you are not married, I have read a lot about finding someone you trust to be your \u2018buddy\u2019 to attend appointments with you not only for emotional support but another set of ears to listen to what they have to say and take notes. Once the words, \u2018breast cancer\u2019 are spoken, your mind may start to turn and churn in other directions. Best not to freak out. You will live and you will eventually be okay. Just take each procedure individually and make the best decision based on your choices. My biggest issue now is a search for a bra. I have several sports bras which provided good support but they were extremely difficult to put on and take off since I also had a sentinel lymph node removed from under my arm. I found a wonderful sports bra that zips up in the front. This provides support and is easy to get on/off. I\u2019m still looking for something that provides the same support but doesn\u2019t look like a uniboob. I wish you the best news from all your tests. TurtleTAM",

      "Content": "Bonnie - I picked up my first bottle of tamoxifen this evening and will start in the morning. I will have to let you know of my experience. I have a busy week at work and on top of that I have my planning session to be molded, measured and marked for radiation on Monday. I don't have a start date but they want to start right away because it has been a month since my surgery. I suspect you won't need radiation since you chose masectomy, right? Good luck with all your appointments this week. There for a while it seemed that all I was doing was going from one doctor appointment to another. It has gotten a little better but I will need to visit the cancer center every day for the next six weeks. Tammie Tammie",

      "Content": "Tony - It is my understanding that CEA isn't used for screening for cancer...could be wrong. Have you considered getting a biopsy for your lumps? This would give you a definitive answer as to cancer cells or not. Breast cancer alone doesn't cause that kind of weight loss so you may be dealing with a combination of problems. I started dropping weight last year but I was dieting so I didn't think anything of it till I developed other symptoms (tremors in my hands and legs plus joint pain). I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and then a few months later diagnosed with BC (totally unrelated in my case). My hyperthyroidism is due to Graves. I'm not saying that is what you have but you may want to have your thyroid checked; it is a simple blood test. TAM Tammie",

Your breast will become sore a few days before your period starts and it is possible to have lumps appear during this time also. If you don't want to see a doctor right away, watch it for a month or so and see if the lump goes away. When you do go see a doctor, be sure to mention this so they will be aware to watch for this in your exam. TAM",

Lumps often occur in your breasts during puberty so given your age, it may be a natural occurance that will go away. You probably should see a doctor just to make sure and talk to them about the odor and the sore nipples.
