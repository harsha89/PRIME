    "Content": "I just lost my mom 2 weeks ago to inflammatory breast cancer. I am also very heartbroken. She was 64 years old and even though I knew that it was a tough one to beat I eas sure that it would go away for awhile. She was diagnosed Nov25th of last year and she died Sept 11th. One month ago she had finished treatment and things were looking good and then the cancer had spread to her liver and then her brain. The docs told her that there was nothing that they could do and she had less than a week to live. Such a shock. She also has 2 grandkids. I am scared for my future with her not in the picture. I was soo close to her. I understand the heartbreak donelle Â ",
