      "Content": "I started treatment with the anti-cancer drugs in October 2003. I first tried Arimedex and had such pain I could hardly stand it. I was switched to Femora and still problems. So I am now on Aromasin and still have trouble walking. The pain is often deep inside and then seems to \"cramp\" up certain muscles. My chriropractor works wonders, but I need to go weekly to be able to walk somewhat normal. When I sit for long periods, like driving or flying, I have to stand for a minute before trying to walk because I feel like an old woman. I wonder if it could be exasperated by arthritis, but I never had problems before going on these drugs. Anyone else experiencing such trouble walking? Jennys",
