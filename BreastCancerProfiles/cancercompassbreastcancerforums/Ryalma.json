With love Ryalma   Does the doctor think the pain is from the treatment or from the mets? Is the doctor sure the Femara is working? I have the same mets and was on Femara, but had to move on to other drugs because it did not work on all of my mets. I had Taxol and Taxotere, which did not work. I am waiting for a call to start another newer drug. The Zometa seems to be working in me and a few other people that I am in contact with. I know that I was adviced to take Calcium to help the Zometa. Do you take a calcium each day? Doctor says it could be both, treatment and mets.  Had my CT scan last month and the results were encouraging.  The disease is not spreading further and there is slight improvement with my liver. It seems as though the medication is working.  But the pain is on and off, I have some good and some bad days. Cannot live without pain killers. I have been taking Calcium too.",

Also, if anyone has had treatments at Oasis of Hope in Mexico and how effective the treatment has been.  Many thanks It's really hard to get a direct answer from physicians.  I don't think they know.  I was diagnosed last June with Stage IV to liver, bones & skull.  I don't look any different than before, but let me share with you what I've learned from a few patients I met so far.  One lady in particular who was about 65 (I am 68) was on her second round of chemo.......BUT, her first round was 7 years ago!  She told me that her mother had the same thing and lived until 98!  Now I realize this is a very unusual case, but I think it depends on so many different factors even the doctors simply don't know. I have good days and bad days.  My biggest problem is fatigue.  I've heard some remarks about it being 50/50.  A lot of people will probably have something to say about that one too!  Even if I knew the answer........what good would it do.  I just think that I'll probably live as long as I want to unless an Act of God takes me out, like a car crash or something like that. Enjoy and bless every moment and live your life to the fullest of your ability.  What good does it do to wonder how long you're going to live?  Have your life in order, let those close to you know you love them, and enjoy your time on the planet and you may be surprised!! Babs in Denver, CO Many thanks for giving me a very good understanding to my fears for the unknown.  I am 46yrs old with 3 children, my family is very supportive including my husband and I am grateful to God for that. It is when I have bad days that I think my end is closer and I feel very frightened. I have very bad ache in my ribs feels a though I have run a marathon.  I have had 18 treatments of Taxol and have another 6 to go. I pray everyday to God to give me strenght to cope with this illness Mon, London UK",
