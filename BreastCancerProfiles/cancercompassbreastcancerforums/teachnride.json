    "Content": "I can't believe I'm posting on these sites again after 7 years! Reading these are bringing back many feelings and memories. I suffered from post mastectomy pain syndrome for 3 1/2 years post surgery. It was torture. I learned to live with it and then miraculously, the pain disappeared. I've been pain free since (with occasional twinges that I call \"surgery pain\" just to keep me humble). This last week I have been feeling the surgery pain again, primarily on my right side where the majority of the pain was originally. Tonight the pain is debilitating! It scares me and I don't know where to turn. The only thing that ever alleviated my pain was vicodin. Acupuncture was a bit helpful as well.  I do not want to take any narcotics! I'm freaking out a bit I guess. This pain returning is scary. I had accepted my life with pain, then it went away, and my whole life changed for the better.  Does anyone have any experience with this? Thanks sisters.",
