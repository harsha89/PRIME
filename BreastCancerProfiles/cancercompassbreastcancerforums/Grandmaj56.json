I have Stage 4 as well. I had pain in my chest is why I went to the dr. if you will see my post called MY Journey you will see what I went through to find all this out.",

I have had a biopsy and blood tests and waiting for the scans. I am terrified especially as 2 of my children are still young and one has autism. I feel despairing. I really need encouragement to fight. HELP Sweetheart those babies should give you the inscentive to fight. They are the most important thing in your life. I know it is really hard when you find you have cancer I have been diagnosed with stage 4 and I am having surgery to have bilateral breast surgery on Thursday Oct 23rd day after my 56th birthday. I have a grandson on the way that is my motivation to fight this thing and I know that those children of yours should be yours.",

Surgery will come and go and you will not even flinch. It was pretty easy for the surgery and I am not in too much pain either. That is the bright side of it they give you good medication to keep you from pain. So hang in there and you keep on keeping on. Keep me up to date on you too.",

      "Content": "The beginning of my journey of what I know today started on the 27th day of July in Las Palmas Hospital with my hubby having knee surgery to put his knee cap back in place. We were there and he got up to go to the potty and almost fell, and being a mother and a very caring wife I reached to grab him so that he didn't fall. In the process of doing this I thought that I had pulled a muscle cause I started hurting and the 28th of July when we got out of the hospital that was when it started to hurt more. I kept on about not going to the doctor for about a two weeks I think it was and then I decided it was time to go and get it checked. I went to family doctor on the 12th and she did an ekg and some other things and sent me to a cardiologist but this cardiologist is one of those that is more in it for the money and not the patient. They wanted their 20% that medicare doesn't pay up front before I even saw the doctor, so I told them that they would have to cancel the appointment and I would return at a later time. Well I went back to the doctor on the 3rd to get my meds filled and the Nurse practitoner was there this time he scheduled me with a pulmonologist as well as doing some other stuff and the pulmonologist saw me on the 16th and sent me to do a CT of my Chest this was to make sure of not having any blood clots or so on. Well there happen to be a small nodule in my right lung, Dr Hatem the Pulmonologist said it probably has been there since I was a kid. This wasn't a thing he was real concerned about but he sent me for a PET scan on the 19th of September, just the same to make sure it wasn't a cancer nodule. Well it wasn't anything and this is when they discovered my Cancer in my sternum. It showed in my Sternum as a 1 and 1/2 inch lesion and that is why I was hurting so much cause it was growing and that bone isn't supposed to. Dr. Hatem himself, called me on Monday night himself to see how I was doing and to tell that he needed me to come in on the 23rd to see him. I went in and he scheduled me for a CT guided biopsy. I have to be put to sleep to do procedures of this nature cause I am allergic to all of the numbing drugs like marcaine and novacaine and lidocaine. So they did the biopsy and he called me again cause I had an appointment to see him for a follow up on Monday but he told me he had to see me on that Friday it was very important. That is the day he told me that it was Stage 4 breast cancer because it had metastasized to my sternum and the tissue in the sternum was breast cancer tissue. That date was the 3rd of October. He scheduled me to see Dr Maria Aloba on Monday the 6th and she told me then that the test showed that the tissue was breast tissue and that I wouldn't have to have Chemo therapy, I would however have to do anti hormone therapy and Radiation. I saw the Radiation oncologist that day as well her name is Stephanie Han. She told me the same things and that she would get me set up for the radiation. I was supposed to go to see her again but Dr Aloba had scheduled and MRI with contrast that I had to go and do on the 7th of October. After the results of that I was told not to go to Dr Han until I saw the surgeon on the 16th of October. This is the day I was told that I was having a mastectomy to take both my breasts and the lymph nodes on the left side because that is where the Cancer is. They are taking both due to the type of Cancer I have because it doesn't show up on Mammograms or does it have lumps either. It is and andinocarcinoma.",
