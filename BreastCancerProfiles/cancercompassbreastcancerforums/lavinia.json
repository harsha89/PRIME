I have been on Aromasin for 6 months and in that time I have developed pointy knots in both wrists, noticeable and painful to touch, very limited movement of both my thumbs and severe wrist pain (both). I am having a bone scan and bone density in 2 weeks and I just \"feel it in my bones\" if you will pardon the pun, that there will be an extreme difference in my bone density, it will be way down....You are not alone..
