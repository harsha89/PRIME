      "Content": "Thank you for your response. I have made the decision to go ahead with the biopsy. I'm not sure whether the swollen lymph nodes in my neck are something different but maybe I should get a biopsy of them too. You're right, it's better for me to do something now than wait 6 more months. Thank you again!",

      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 47 and she survived, I've been told by doctors not to take contraceptive pills and to get regular check ups. I had a breast examination recently because I had swollen lymth nodes in my neck and my doctor felt a lump, so she organized an ultrasound for me. I had my ultrasound which showed I had a breast lump in my left breast 1cm in size. They advised for me to have another ultrasound in 6 months to see if there are any changes but I have been given the option to have a breast biopsy now but they said it was unlikely to be cancerous because of my age. At the moment I am deciding whether I should have a biopsy or wait out the 6 months for the next ultrasound. The breast lump that I have is the same breast my mum had her breast cancer. I am grateful for your time.",
