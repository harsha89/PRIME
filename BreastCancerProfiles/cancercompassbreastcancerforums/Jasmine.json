    "Content": "I was a breast cancer stage 3 patient, had done all the treatments. I have been taking tamoxifen for a year. It is supposed to be for 5 years. My period had stopped during the chemo but now it come back again, is it common having period while still taking tamoxifen? I was told my period can come back later after finish with tamoxifen, is it true? It is not good to have period because that will activate the estrogen hormone level? On what case 'such period ' might be dangerous? Your opinion and experience is very much appreciated.",
