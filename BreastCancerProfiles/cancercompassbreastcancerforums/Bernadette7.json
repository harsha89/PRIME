    "Content": "My mother died May 9, 2005. She was diagnosed in March with carcinoma menningitis. Approximately one year before she was diagnosed with lung cancer and had part of her lung removed. The doctors told us she was lucky we had caught it early. (stage I). All scans showed that she was cancer free. This past fall she started to complain about not having a sense of taste. In January she got a flu shot, she started to complain about headaches, no taste, she said her head felt cloudy and she wasn't able to hear out of one ear she thought maybe she had gotten the flu. She started to decline further though,she became dizzy, she started to have double vision, our family doctor ordered an MRI nothing showed. He made an appointment with a neurologist, she was put in the hospital for a battery of tests, nothing showed up they didn't know what was wrong thought maybe it was her sugar, or maybe carotid artery disease. They released her and we went back to family doctor by this time her face was beginning to draw on one side and her speech was becoming slurred, she was having trouble swallowing and we had to puree her food. Our family doctor thought maybe it was bell's palsey and we were relieved for awhile but instead of getting better she got worse. We went to another neurologist he examined her and said her face was becoming paralyzed and at this point she could not swallow anything, not even water. This new neurologist did a spinal tap and found cancer in her fluid. We put in a feeding tube and brought her back to our hometown in a nursing home. We tried a couple of intrachal chemotherapy but she did not respond and continued to decline. In the end she could not see, hear, walk or talk. She became nauseated and could no longer keep food down. She aspirated and got pnemonia and died a few days later. I hope this posting will help someone else I heard if caught early the rapid decline can be slowed down. We were told that there is no cure as of yet and this is a very rare cancer.",
