    "Content": "Hi,  My mom had a radical mastectomy on Dec. 10, 2012, and had lymph nodes removed as well. (it was a stage 3a cancer). The surgeon had said to do exerise till she gets full range of motion, which she did after the first 15 days in January. She then did not do the exercises. Her chemo subsequently began in the end of January, and was 8 sessions. In April she started exercising again. About a month ago she started experiencing tightness in the surgical area. The Last couple of weeks it has turned into an excruciating discomfort.  These are the things she is describing:  -The tightness is like an iron bra that is pulling and tightening where the mastectomy happened -The tightness has recently spread to the underarm (armpit) area -It feels like the skin is sticking and pressing against the chest wall, and the ribs. Almost as if its constricting her lungs.  -She also feels like the muscles are contracting in that area, and feels like there is a rock under the skin, and everything is a frozen block.  She is on round the clock pain killers to handle the discomfort (excrutiating discomfort not \"pain\"). She was on Percocet to manage it before, but it stopped being effective. She is now on Dilaudid.  The pain doctors at stanford have felt that it is potentially a nerve issue, and prescribed neurontin and desiprimine. The pain doctors at UCSF feel its more of a muscular issue. So she has also just recently started physical therapy.  We read in a previous post from 2009 on a forum, that some of the symptoms we are describing may be caused by scar tissue adhesions. None of the doctors have talked in depth about this aspect. But it sounds like it can definitely be that, with maybe a combination of muscles issues. We just feel so frustrated and helpless, since we arent getting any clear answers.  Though her tightness and pressure began 4 months after the surgery. Did you guys also have to take pain killers? Also after how many sessions generally should she start feeling some result of the physical therapy? We arent sure if who we have is good/the right one.  The UCSF pain doctor also recommended trigger point injections, and if that works then botox shots, to relax those muscles. Thoughts?  Her radiation just started this week as well, so she cannot undergo any procedures with injections till after it is over. We are worried, because radiation is just suppose to increase the tightness, and she is already starting in such a bad condition!  PLEASE HELP!",
