    "Content": "Hello all. I had noticed the bottom of my left breast was no longer rounded when holding my arms above head when I was doing monthly exams and checking that they still looked the same. The bottom of my breast had flattened, like it was being pulled up. I had also noticed it had gotten slightly larger than the right and that the center of the nipple had lightened up. There was a small lymphnode I could feel close to my armpit. Â Made an appt with GPS, she felt the lump also. Sent me for mammogram and ultrasound and radiologists said he saw nothing of concern. My breast didn't decide to change shape for no reason! I have had some light discomfort deep in that breast. I don't have red skin that tends to show up with IBC but I am concerned about it bc there are just to many changes. Has anyone ever not found a lump and on tests and gotten a cancer diagnosis. I know I have to be my own advocate and I want to make sure IBC isn't missed since it is so aggresive.",
