I went off Aromasin a few weeks ago until I go back end of May to oncologist to see if the symptoms subsided. I just dont feel myself. Am considering going off.....what do others think and have you gone off and had any recurrence?",

      "Content": "Dear Goodattitude & Cindy, I am taking Aromasin and in the same boat.  I am not sure how different Aromasin is from Arimidex and how they decide who gets what.   I have had insomnia, joint ache, pain & stiffness, memory loss, weight gain, eye sight deterioration......and went to check side effects online and there were all these side effects I mantioned and more.  So, I have gone off Aromasin for the next 6 weekes until my check-up with oncologist just to see if there is a difference.  It has been a week now and still no change but I know it will take time.  For the 2-3% recurrence improvement I am debating on whether it is worth it too.   Then again, I will kick myself if I have a recurrence and stopped taking it.  Tough choice. I will ask my oncologist at check-up what he thinks and if I should stop or go back on tamoxifen (which I took for 2 years and did not notice side effects) have ovaries removed, hysterectomy, whatever.  I wonder if you have ovaries removed if you still have to take the estrogen blockers.??? 1 year ago when he put me on Aromasin he did a hormone test and said that I was officially post-menopausal and 0 estrogen showed in my blood. Let me know if either of you have had other side effects too.  I too am tired a lot, just not my perky self.... your sister survivor sleepychel      d ",

      "Content": "Thank you, that makes me feel better. I have decided to go off for a while and see if I notice a difference. So many of the side effects listed on the comparison study were true for me, like insomnia, depression, back pain, visual disturbances (had to get glasses) hot flashes and the back pain--besides the memory issue. I too am in 40's-almost 49. I was on Tamoxifen for 2 yrs and now Aromasin for 1 year. Thanks for responding! michele",
