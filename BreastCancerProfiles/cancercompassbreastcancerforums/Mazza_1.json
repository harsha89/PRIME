However, when the HER2 protein is altered, extra HER2 protein receptors may be produced. This over-expression of HER2 causes increased cell growth and reproduction, often resulting in more aggressive breast cancer cells.  Herceptin blocks these receptors, limiting cell growth.  If Herceptin is stopped then the receptors are not blocked and abnormal cell growth resumes. So are you saying that when Herceptin is stopped, your chance of getting a recurrence of HER2 breast cancer is highly likely?",

      "Content": "Hi Phyllis Get to an breast specialist STRAIGHT AWAY!! I was diagnosed with IBC 17 months ago, but only because I looked on the internet for symptoms and red spots ARE a symptom. So is the breast being warm to touch, becoming much larger, ridges in the skin, p'eau d'orange (orange peel effect), bruises or shooting pains. IBC does not show up on mammograms and only on ultra sound if the person knows what they are looking for. The only way to know for sure is biopsy. Speed is of the essence as IBC is very aggressive. I had chemotherapy first to shrink the breast, it is quite resistant to chemo, but taxols work well. Then I had a mastectomy - removal of all lymph nodes, more chemo (paclitaxol), radiotherapy and now I am on Herceptin. Please Google Inflammatory Breast Cancer and look at the sites. Don't be fobbed off with anti-biotics and being told that it is mastitis. As IBC is only found in 3% of breast cancers, doctors are not familiar with it, be your own advocate. Good luck, get on to this and you will be fine.",
