    "Content": "I was on Tamoxifen for Breast Cancer.  I took it for one year, and I started noticing things like my knees feeling swollen, my hair not growing, hot flashes lasting half hour or more.  my doctor took me off for one month and I am amazed that after only two days people started telling me how well I look and rested.  I was.  Every side effect had gone away. Today I am headed to his office to speak about going on something else.  It just so happens that Arimidex and a shot of Lupron is what he wants me to do now.  After reading your posts, I think I will stick with Tamoxifen.  At least I already know what the side effects are and will try and work with them.  Thanks for posting this.",
