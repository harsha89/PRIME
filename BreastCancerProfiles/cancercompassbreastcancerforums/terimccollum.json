      "Content": "Hi- did you ever get approved? my PT i have been going to said she thinks this is what i have. When i had to file SSDI after my mastectomy it took 6 months in CALI to come back and deny saying it hadnt been long enough to ensure i wouldnt get better. So i have been limping along with my fed retirement disability check and since its on the second year, has gone down to $500, and the pain comes and goes and pretty sure after a year and a half it isnt going to get better. I was a CNA and dont think i will be lifting anymore pts. I would try to find humor in this problem, but unless someone is inside our bodies, they cant begin to feel the pain as we do. I am being encourage to reapply.",

      "Content": "I have been reading about others that sound like they are experiencing the same pain i am having after a year and a half. I was just prescribed hydroconone but when the pain comes i might be out and about or just sitting watching tv and i dont want to even move. Sometimes its intense itching of one breast and the pain from the arm is a burning type, unbearable.I am wondering if my body is rejecting the silicone breast, but at this time i am deciding to try for social security disability at age 61, but dont know if this is a very well known disability. Cant possibly work again with this horrible off and on pain.Help !",
