      "Content": "Thanks for sharing. I truly hope your situation has improved or you have switched Doctors. I believe Drs who subtly insult us are not doing their job!!!! My Dr is recommending this and says its a miracle drug...I am always skeptical of what drugs are pump into my system, and will avoid it where possible. Your message has enlighted me to the cons of this drug. I have also discovered that the more knowledgeable I am of what's being done to me, the more I can ask my Doctor to clarify. Those who become defensive or show displeasure on their faces cause me to question their drug recommendation even more. I chose how I wish to be treated post surgery, and I am not afraid to insist on it. All the very best to you Jodie, whereever you are.",

      "Content": "Being just diagnosed as Stage 2 Grade 3 IDC, ER/PR- HER2+ on March 16, 2015, I have been researching the most optimal treatment for my breast cancer. I feel this site would do ALL breast cancer patients JUSTICE if it publishes the EFFICACY FINDINGS OF PHARMAC THAT 9 WEEKS OF HERCEPTIN (aka trastuzumab) treatment concurrent with taxane chemotherapy (ex docetaxel or paclitaxel) is the OPTIMAL TREATMENT PLAN FOR HER2+ early stage breast cancer patients like myself, and those with metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, the 9 Week Treatment has a lower overall dosage, therefore, it has lesser cardiotoxicity (less toxic to our hearts) for patients. PHARMAC, the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Management Agency did a comparison study of 5 RCTs, which do not support HERA's claims that a 12 months use of Herceptin alone is effective. ROCHE, the SWISS manufacturer of this drug (and Perjeta), would naturally want patients to use Herceptin for as long as they can to maximize profit versus the interest of cancer patients. I, on the other hand, am a cancer patient. I  must not only be proctive but should also be very concerned of whatever drugs are being recommended to me, its duration, dosage,  overall efficacy and safety. After all, I have a teenage daughter and I want to be able to spend more time with her. The sooner I recover, the better the quality our time will be. I believe many other cancer patients with family feel the same way. Therefore, it is in my interests to be in control with these aspects of my treatment. I won't blindly follow what MD says (though many have our interests at heart, they may be so busy they may not have time to keep up with every options out there) and especially what pharmaceutical company says. PHARMAC's comparison study of the outcomes of these Clinical Trials on the efficacy of Herceptin, where 13,609 patients participated: 1) HERA 12Mths Treatment, with Herceptin only 2) HERA 24Mths Treatment, with Herceptin only 3) N9831 arm B, 12Mths, with Herceptin only Above 1,2,3 recommends SEQUENTIAL TREATMENT of HER2+ (i.e. post chemotherapy) BELOW 4,5,6,7,8 recommends CONCURRENT TREATMENT OF HERCEPTIN + CHEMOTHERAPY 4) N9831 arm C, 12 Months 5) B31, 52 Weeks Treatment 6) BCIRG 006, 52 Weeks Treatment 7) FinHer, 9 Weeks Treatment 8) N9128, 10 Weeks Treatment Based on PHARMAC'S finding, the FinHer 9 week treatment is not only the most synergistically optimal treatment plan for patients with HER2+, but also the most cost effective.  In addition, this treatment regimen has shown to improve overall survival. In view of the high cost of Herceptin, this is exceptionally good news for us. Note: 1) The FinHer RCT was done under Finnish International Breast Cancer Specialist, Dr. & Prof. Heikki Joensuu. 2) Based on their findings, PHARMAC has adopted the 9 Week Concurrent Treatment with Herceptin + taxane chemotherapy for ALL New Zealand breast cancer patients who are HER2+ as it was shown to reduce the chances of tumours returning. 3) Previously, ROCHE has approached PHARMAC to fund a 12 months HERCEPTIN only treatment plan. PHARMAC declined as their \"fresh review of the science and other information has failed to convince [them] that 12 months treatment offer any additional benefits over the concurrent 9 week treatment.\"  PHARMAC's conclusion was that \"the ROCHE application failed on three grounds: CLINICAL EFFICACY, COST EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT SAFETY (a greater risk of cardiotoxicity and heart problems from longer exposure to Herceptin). If you go to the links below, you can find all supporting statistics and facts for the above RCT can be found at PHARMAC's website: http://www.pharmac.health.nz/search?search_q=herceptin&s Additional Information from The Women's Health Council, Auckland via this site: http://www.womenshealthcouncil.org.nz/Features/Hot+Topics/Herceptin.html NOTE: Prof. Heikki Joensuu has just completed another RCT called the SOLD study (The Synergism Or Long Duration) of about 3000 women sponsored by the Finnish Breast Cancer Group. The purpose of the study is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) of women treated with concomitant trastuzumab (aka Herceptin)plus docetaxel followed by FEC to that of the women treated with the same regimen followed by single-agent trastuzumab to complete one year of trastuzumab administration as adjuvant treatments of early HER2-positive breast cancer. Please follow up on the details when it is posted at the US government website below: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00593697 REMARKS: Personally, I find that keeping ourselves updated of what's happening in the cancer treatment world benefit everyone of us. It would be wise to always check against the claims of drug companies. May the Recovery Force be with US all. Nat",

      "Content": "Hello again  Yes,  I was told by my Dr yesterday I need to go for both chemo + then radiation even though my margins were clear and the 1 sentinel node taken out was negative.  Though I read that radiation normally follows lumpectomy,  she said the hospital I am in does it the other way around...I am scheduled to see the onc on Apr 13.   Oh I wanted to let you know that before you do any radiation or chemo, preferably two weeks before,  you may wish to consider stocking these up:  1/ biotene mouthwash which you must gargle 4-5 times a day to prevent you from getting mouth sores.  My gf who've had double mastectomy told me so,  and a gentleman who've had cancer said his dentist recommended it and true enuf he did not get sores in his mouth too. 2/ if you're still looking for a comfortable bra,  comsider getting 100% cotton nursing bra with flaps down.  My Dr did a surgical process that cuts out around my areola,  then took The tumor with margins out from there while the reconstructive breast surgeon did a beautiful job on it.  She glued back the areola and then stitch around them with dissolvable stitching.   So nipple hurt when I tried on different bras,  sports bra,  tank  bras and temporarily wore bikini top... because my breast is a 38D, not wearing one hurts.  Eventually my sister suggested I get open flap nursing bra. It arrived 3 days ago,  handwashed and hung to dry before wearing.  Starting wearing it 2 days ago. Wow its the most super super comfortable.  With the flap down my right breast,  my nipple is free and happy.  3/ stock up on either 100% emu oil or. Burt bees mama bee oil.  Apply these two your breast several times day before starting radiation.  Once radiation starts,  apply it liberally after radiation.  Your skin will get burn and dry,  so these oil helps protect it.  It also lessoned the pain,  keep your breast subtle.  4/   for myself,  I've stocked up on OPG 3 anticipated cancer supplement such as grape seed capsules, and calcium rich capsules that were made anti cancer plant extracts.  I heard chemo weakened not only our entire immune system but even our bones.  5/get sobet lots and lots a few days before chemo starts.  After each chemo,  we are to drink tons of water to hydrate our body and discharge the toxics.  But heard water tastes very bad coz chemo changes our tastebuds.  So sucking on popsicles and sorbets help put water in our system and will hydrate us in the event we abhor water... I think I hv covered most .Oh except for sorbets and popsicles,  you can order all items online from Walmart n get it delivered to yr home.  ALL THE BEST TO YOU ON YOUR JOURNEY.. ",

      "Content": "Hey, how's things thus far? Glad you are doing the pre-prep work. Met with my medical onc (MO) yesterday. As always, he's pushing for 12 months chemo followed by 3 months radiation. When he saw how adamant I was, he gave me two further options: 6 months or 3 months. He strongly suggested that I go with 6 months, but when I saw the dosages, I said nothing. Then he said I needed to meet him halfway. So I said I might go with the 3 months. This morning, he emailed me the cumulative dosages and wow, I was instantly bulking. I now decided that I will go with the low dosage shorter duration 9 weeks concurrent taxane chemotherapy + herceptin treatment. That's because I have analyzed my own situation, read enough report to feel comfortable that it's safer overall for me. I think patients are supposed to go for 3 months of Anthracycline which I heard is a very toxic drug by itself. I dont think I will go for this but I haven't told him yet. I will later. I just didnt want so much drugs in my body, weakening me though I realize they kill cancer cells as well. We all have to face the consequences of our decision. Last night, I feel very comfortable with my decision and will not assign blame to my MO should the worse happen down the road, but I believe it won't be.

      "Content": "Hello again: If you could avoid any axillary dissection, you should. If you have to go for radiation to preserve it, go for it. You are correct. Your sister have to exercise her left arm as much as possible so that her muscle will not stiffen. It hurts a lot but she must, those who have ad axillary dissection must. I just surgery this past Wednesday afternoon March 25, 2015. Originally, had signed surgical approval for axillary clearance. But just before surgery, I told my MD that I want to cancel the axillary clearance part of the surgical contract. She did ask why and I said I want to take things one step at a time. Cancelling the axillary clearance part means that my surgeon can only take take out those lymp nodes with blue dyes. The surgery went well. My MD came by after I was rolled into my ward. She said 1 sentinel lymph nodes turned blue. That was taken out. Post surgery reconstruction of right breast at this time seems good. There was a low grade pain in my entire right section, which was bearable. Later the physiotherapist and occupational therapist stopped by to teach me how to slowing do the various arm exercises. So, next Thu I am seeing my wonderful Dr. B.T. again to discuss the findings of that positive sentinel nodes, and probably about my treatment plan. I have decided to go with the PHARAMC recommended 9 weeks combined taxane chemotherapy + herceptin, followed by 4-6 weeks radiation. I wish you every success and good decision in your cancer eradication. Let us fight it till it's gone. We still have much to live for, and we should not let it stop us from living @!@ Know there are others out there praying for you too.",

      "Content": "Hang in there..and BE strong, BE a survivor. I had ultrasound done in late Feb 2015. Found tumor. Did an MRI. Confirmed cancerous. Returned to Singapore for treatment. Had mammogram, then biopsy,thereafter bone scan, Chest X-Ray, ECK, blood test same week. Biopsy showed Stage 2 Grade 3 (most aggressive cancer type), Er/PR- HER2+. My world was shattered, but the did not stop me researching on the best course of treatment for me. While waiting all results, go to the following sites to read more info about your particular cancer, if it is cancer. American Cancer Society website National Cancer Institute website Breast Cancer.org website Pharmac.health.nz womenshealthcouncil.org.nz Google/yahoo and read up as much as you can. The more you educate yourself, the less fearful you will be. That's because if your doctor recommends your certain surgery or treatment, you can decide if you want to go that or an alternative route. For example, My MD recommends I go for 4-6 months chemotherapy before surgery. I decline, prefering to have surgery first before chemo. I might not want chemo, but radiation theraphy. Then I was told I would be put on 1 year Herceptin. My research showed this is one of the most toxic drugs. While it targets my cancer cells, it also kill my normal cells. I also discovered that a 9 weeks treatment of Herceptin + chemo drugs docetoxel is a more effective treatment plan. And that's what I will ask for. Bottomline: DONT BE PASSIVE BUT PROACTIVE. Take charge of your life, your treatmentplan at all times. SO HANG IN THERE. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.",
