      "Content": "Thank you for responding.  I did not have osteoporosis before taking Arimidex.   Three weeks ago I visited my oncologist and told him I had developed heart blockages and during spine surgery the surgeon discovered the osteoporosis in my lumbar spine.  I have been taking Fozamax and Calcium pills the whole 8 years.  I also have had bone density tests every year and the last one ironically indicated my bone density was better than ever! When my oncologist heard about the heart disease and osteoporosis he said I had to stop taking the Arimidex immediately.  He also said the osteo would resolve itself in a year to a year and a half! I contacted Astrazeneca who makes Arimidex and they are not tracking we who have stopped taking it.  It's too expensive I was told. I just feel there should be a study to determine what we can expect after stopping the medication. One site I was referred to the women all had purportedly very weird and bad effects from stopping Arimidex.  So far I have just seemed to have more hot flashes.",
