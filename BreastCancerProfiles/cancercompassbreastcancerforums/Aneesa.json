Hi.   I was diagnosed with breast cancer this July.  I went kicking and screaming for chemo (Taxotere and Avastin ).  It did shrink it quite a bit after 1 treatment (only one so far).  But, I still can't wrap my mind around this chemo.  Am taking suppliments and have changed my diet quite a bit.  Would like to hear, how it's going once in a while if you have time.  Pray it goes well for you.  This is the first contact with someone who is doing something different and I feel close to crying for relief of someone else out there.  Maybe we don't have the same mindset but I'm glad all the same.  Thanks for your message.",

I know a good number of people who have controlled and even cured cancers using diet and supplements and life style changes and I also know others who have had their health conditions worsen using medications. Keep up what you are doing. If you keep your immune system strong you are on the right path to good health.

HI.  If you know of  anyone out there to talk to who is doing alternative therapies with or without regular therapies, could you ask if they could contact me to let me know how it's going?  Diagnosed this past July and need support.  Thanks.  ",

HI Toni, Well, can't do chemo again until I give everything else that's reasonable a good shot, or unless it starts growing again.  Thanks for the info on the juice.  I live in Northwest Ohio, but I lived in Orange county a long time ago when I was a teenager.  I lived in Laguna Niguell (?) just for a short time.  But, I lived in San Diego for 2 years.  Will try to let you know how things are going.  Thanks.  Aneesa  Got your message this morning -- sorry to hear you had to have chemo, but if it takes care of the problem go for it and maybe you will not need the surgery.  I had estrogen positive cancer (probably from taking birth control pills for 12 years - a no no) and the Aramidex is supposed to limit the amount of estrogen in the body so I do not have a recurrance but I just could not take the pain and depression from the pills.  As of now -- it will be 2 years Oct 22, I am still cancer free according to my oncologist so I guess something is working.  I go on line and try everything that sounds semsible -- but I will not do anything I do not understand.  I am now also drinking V 8 Fusion which supposedly gives me my complete daily requirements of fruits and vegetable I am supposed to have.  It is not cheap at the grocery store $4.99 - but only $2.99 at Wal Mart for 46 ounces so that lasts at least a week -- still cheaper than the Aramidex and much more pleasant.  According to everything I have read most fruits and vegetables have great anti toxins against cancer in them so I have gone to eating much more fruit and fresh vegetables, especially broccoli and brussel sprouts.  Due to working it was hard to have the 3 servings of fruits and veggies every day so the V8 fusion works great.  My grandson turned me on to it -- he says he has more energy and sleeps better and feels so much better since he started drinking it.  He works for Google as a program security tech and is on call 24/7 - he prevents hackers from getting into their programs -  so he was really getting tired.  I get my capsules from my vitamin company through the mail from a  company in Utah but I am certain most vitamin companies have them although I have been told this company is the best of all of them.  Keep in touch and let me know how you are doing with the chemo and if it has stopped the progression.  I live in So. Ca. where do you live?  Toni R  ",
