I was in same boat as you! TNBC diagnosed last year, was in one node, before DX I had pain under arm which I chalked up to lifting heavier weights at gym however I had horrible urine smell, and kept getting UTI's - like nine in one year! I def see now where my body was trying to tell me something. I hope you are doing well since its been a while since your post :)",

It started with pain in right breast, pressure, breast taking a different shape, swollen lymph nodes under right arm, moved to under coller bone & choking sensation around neck/throat. Found 7 nodules on thyroid, have biopsied \"one\" & only \"one\" 6 times, blood tests come back normal, now has spread to my right kidney, ovary, cramping in uterus & have burning in abdomen. Every dr says I'm fine & treats me like a mental patient (no offense to anyone). Saw an internist Monday & he told me I had hysteria because of finding nodules. Funny, I've had these syptoms for almost 2 years before finding nodules. I've become more exhausted, now nauseated & burning intense. I have fevers off & on where even my urine is hot, not like a burning irritated feeling, just McD hot coffee hot! How is all of this in my head if I had symptoms before anyone said there could be something wrong, but they can't find it? I'm so frustrated & scared it will be too late when drs finally figure it out. What drs helped you? Not sure I'm much help as mine was caught on my annual mammogram. Spot was too small for me to of even felt at the time. But my body was telling me. Listen to your body and demand tests until someone listens. We are our own best advocates. Everyone thought I just had cyst but I wanted biopsy to be sure - glad I did the biopsy!",
