    "Content": "I had stage 3 breast cancer and finished treatment in 2002. Since that time, my CA 27/29 has risen from 27 to over 2500. CEA and CA 15-3 were also off the charts. All of my scans (PET, Bone, CAT, bone marrow, x-rays) have been clear. My oncologist wanted to start chemo anyway. I got a second opinion, and that oncologist concurred. I just finished my 4th round, and my markers are down to 1200. I was just rescanned with bone and PET, and all were clear. My Dr. now wants to stop and see if the marker starts rising. I want to continue with the original plan, which was chemo until the markers were within normal range. We will discuss it again next week...",
