As I was alone , I feel now I have all the question. No more injections of Faslodex . I feel great. nothing hurts. I am confused, questioning faith and my sister has lung cancer...never a smoker . I have become her caregiver as she goes to radiation each day. I am at a lost. I do not know if I can an handle all of this. She has a son two hours away He has put it all on me and never even calls me to thank me. I am really at a low and questioning my faith plus is it worth living, I think of dying everday. I pray to die. I just needed to tell my story We have no family. Any ideas appreciated. Any thoughts on treatment? Hi, I have stage 4 breast cancer, metastisized to my lymph, vertebrae, liver and abdomen. I went to Mexico to get alternative treatment and they gave me immunotherapy as well as IV drips of vitamins, minerals and ozone and hyperthermia treatment. I felt better when I returned, and when I had a scan, my liver tumor shrank, but the rest stayed the same. I had surgery for a crushed vertebrae due to a tumor, and I am on letrazole. I haven't taken Ibrance or Faslodex. A friend of a friend started me on a natural protocol. He helps out cancer patients for the last 20 years. I have been on his protocol for 3 months. I just  had a blood test, and my liver enyzme markers that were high are now normal. My breast cancer marker is still high but half of what if used to be, and my other cancer marker for metastsis is normal from being high on my last blood test taken before I started this protocol. If you would like, I could pass his number on to you and he can help you  and your sister. I am also eating very clean. All organic food. No red meat, process food, or sugar. I am also staying away from most starches, except sweet potatoes, and beans. It is definitely worth living. Don't give up hope!! If you just follow conventional medicine, yes, your chances are great, but if you combine it with alternative you have a good chance of getting through this and putting it into remission!! ",
