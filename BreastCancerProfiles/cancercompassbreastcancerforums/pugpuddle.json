    "Content": "I was researching a new medication my doctor prescribed...AROMASIN. I was on Femara, then Tamoxifen, then Arimidex, now he wants me to try Aromasin. It looks like Aromasin may have worse side effects than Arimidex. I am having a whole list of side effects and don't know if I should try Aromasin. One major side effect is, how do I say, severe dryness and bone pain. My husband and I have not had relations in over a year. Nothing (lubricant) works. Does anyone else have bad side effects with Arimidex? Did you go on Aromasin?",
