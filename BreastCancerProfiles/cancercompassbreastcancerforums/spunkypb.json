      "Content": "Thank you for replying back. It is amzing how many people blindly do whatever the Dr's tell them, I do have breast cance and my husband died Sept, 29, 2009 of brain cancer, so I do have a vested interest in preventing the disease from  doing any furthter damage to me or my family. I had a lumpectomy for my Stage II invasice, lobular carcinoma, with lymph node involvment. I had radiation but have chosen not to do chemo. I haven't really felt sick until I started taking the Arimidex. I also knew putting chemo drugs in my body is poison and would definately feel like hell. I did change my diet, attitude, exercise and stress levels. None of it is easy, especially since I teach 5th grade full time and have a very challenging class this year. (in addition to son in rehab and dad just put in alzeimer's ward-NO STRESS!!!) We need to be making informed decisions about our health care. Read!!! I will add grapeseed to my extensive list of natural cures (flax seed, tumeric, QO10, fish oil, salmon, oatmeal, soy...)",

      "Content": "I'm with you..I did get some good news. I got results back from Oncotype DX test which gives you a high/med/low risk ranking based on you tumor markers. I'm a 6, which at the low end of low risk. This give me a sense of peace with my decsion not to do chemo, oh yea!!! I've read several things about the test and it would only decrease my recurence rate by 2-3%, just not worth putting all those poisons in my body. Start radiation in 2 weeks nad tehn estrogen blocker...maybe. Don't really like all the side effects of that either.   Take Care,        Patrice",

      "Content": "Just came across your response, I'm just starting on this journey and had a few questions. I have Stage 2 invasive lobular, HER/neg  estrogen receptors but not progesterone. I had lumpectomy Aug 4  2 out of 4 nodes had cancer, and they tok out 5 ml from left breast. I'm trying to make informed decisions about radiation, chemo, estrogen inhibitors. My husband died Sept 29, 09 of brain cancer so I watched him go thru the worst!!! I don't mind doing the radiation but am opposed to chemo and it sounds like the estrogen inhibitors SUCK!!! I've changed my diet-no sugar, fruits/veggies/protein. I would like to do it as naturally as possible I just turned 55 and today is my first day back in the classroom. ot sure how all this is going to play out as I have to face 28 10 year olds all day  HELP!!   Patrice",

      "Content": "I just got results back from Oncotype DX and I'm a 6 (thank God). My husband died of brain cancer 9/29/09 so this was the first bit of good news in a while.I'm stage 2 invasive lobular w/2 postitive lymph nodes. I think my oncologist (same one my husband had) still wants me to do chemo, but I'm refusing it. I'm confident I can change diet, take supplements, stay postive, pray, try to remain stress free. I beliveve the Dr.s have to recommend chemo for most patients to prevent law suits. Do some research, for me to do chemo would only change my by 1-3%  for recurrence. To me those numbers don't warrant putting all those poisons in my body, to feel like crap, be nauseous & bald! Don't know if this helped-hang in there",

I'm just starting my journey-had lumpectomy Aug. 4, then they had to go back in and take out 12 more nodes , found 2 positive with 1st surgery. Just got Oncotype DX results , I'm a 6, low risk so I've decided not to do chemo. Saw what it did to my husband (died 9/29/09 brain cancer) and I didn't want to do that. I realize they are two very different types of cancer-I get it Dr's , but none the less my body, my choice! Will do radiation, but not conviced I want to do estrogen blocker. Would like to see data. The side effects worry me. I teach 5th grade and have no time to be sick-28 kids counting on me. I may try it, but if side effects are too terrible (I read some women can't get out of bed!!) I'll take myself off of it. Also have changed diet-no sugar, lots of fruits, veggies, supplements, blah , blah , blah. I am women hear me roar, I'm not going to give this cancer any porwer over me...kind of like saying FU to cancer!   Patrice",
