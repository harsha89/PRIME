    "Content": "I have been on tomoxifen for 2 years and next month will be switching to an aromatose inhibotor drug. Is anyone NOT having bad side effects from arimidex, aromasin, femara? I'm scared to switch after reading what people are experiencing. Tomoxifen has been a real treat. My hair has thinned so bad it's half of what it was. I have the hot flashes and sweats all night long. And I've gained 25 pounds. BUT I will gladly keep those side effects to be able to move around like normal. Back and hip pain, all the other joint pain sounds awful. Is there anyone out there NOT having uncomfortable side effects?",
