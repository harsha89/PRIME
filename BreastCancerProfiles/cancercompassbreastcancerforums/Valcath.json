    "Content": "Question about my mom. I'll give you her quick background. She is 63 years old and had surgery for a 1 and a half cm. cancerous tumor in her left breast in March of 2005. She had radition therapy. No chemo. because it had not spread to the lymphnodes. Recently she developed Mastitis. She has been on (excuse the spelling) Vanaquin for almost 5 days now. The first antibiotic they put her on was resistant to the strain of infection she had. Has this happened to other women out there? It is still red in the spot on the breast near her scar area? How long does this take to clear?",
