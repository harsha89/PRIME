      "Content": "Dear joeys mom, Try to Relax! We do want the doctors to be thorough with  the diagnosis. Many people are found to have benign spots on the liver. Also it is important that you try to be calm so that you can better discuss this matter with your doctor and ask the right questions. When you can sit somewhere quitely, be STILL completely STILL. This includes vacating your busy mind of thoughts. You need to quiet down your mind. It is racing and delivering scenerios associated with your fears and causing you great anxiety. Once you can quiet down your mind you will be able to better comprehend, understand and deal with what is at hand. Having said that we know you will be fine!!!. Like others have told you this will pass. Take care and know that many will pray for you. We will look forward to reading on your post that you are dealing with all things just fine. Remember we are here for you anytime!!!!",

      "Content": "Hi my name is Maria and I'm seeking not a diagnosis related opinion but an honest opinion from someone who knows about this cancer. This post is regarding my sister but please do not let that influence how much you will share with me. My sister was diagnosed this past April with this cancer. She had both breasts completely removed. In September they found that the cancer had spread to some lymphnodes under her arm. A Pet scan revealed that the cancer had spread to the bones (a rib, a spot on the spine and a spot on a hip). They began a strong regimen of a combination of chemo/radiation treatment which she is still on. Just late last week she had a terrible headache that could not be controlled with regular or off the counter meds. We took her to the emergency room to be evaluated. They did a spinal tap and a CT Scan (Brain). The doctor said that the test results of the spinal tap show that she has cancer cells in the spinal fluid and the CT Scan showed a little swelling of the Brain. They did an MRI of her spine but those results are not yet available. Can someone please tell me with all honestly, does the results of the spinal tap and CT Scan mean that this cancer is now in the brain? How bad is this. Also, I was there while my sister had the tests but I was not there at the time the doctors talked to her and her husband. My brother-in-law just didn't think to ask to many questions as he just wanted to know what to do next.  If you have any experience with this please share with me what you know. Please help me better understand the real situation we are in. Do NOT hold back. Thanks!",
