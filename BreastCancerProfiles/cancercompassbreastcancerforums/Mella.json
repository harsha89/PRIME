      "Content": "hey Velvet and all others Ok... i am really starting to worry about ONJ .... I have been on Zometa for 18 months, as part of a trial, for stg 3 breast cancer patients, with the hope of preventing bone mets.  Last year I did chemo and during chemo i developed an abcess in my gum.  By this time I had already had 5 Zometa infusions.... hmmm.... my onc, suggested I have the tooth removed because I was severly neutopenic and an infection like an abcess could prove fatal during chemo.  I was worried about removing my tooth whilst on zometa, however my onc suggested it, so I trusted his judgement.  Recently I had to have a bone scan done because i was getting pain in my legs.  And the report said I had a hot spot in my jaw..... Could this be the early stage of ONJ?  Why cant I seem to find info on diagnosising ONJ?   Does anyone know whether onj is picked up on bone scans.  I do not have any exposed areas in gum or any of that but I am worried about if my scan is picking up early signs.  Velvet... I am in UK as well.... Brighton.   Hugs to you hun, you really are going thru a bad time... hang in there. Mel  ",
