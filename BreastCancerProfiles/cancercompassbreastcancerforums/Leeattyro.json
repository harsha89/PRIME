    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy 5/3/05, had four treatments of Taxol (clinical trial), 33 radiation treatments, my tumor was Her2 Positive, have had one treatment of Herceptin by itself. The regimen has been set up for once every three weeks for a year. The numbness in my fingers, which i had recovered from after the taxol, has returned. I'm also experiencing some blurred vision. I would like to hear from a early stage, node negative Her2 Positive like me if possible.",
