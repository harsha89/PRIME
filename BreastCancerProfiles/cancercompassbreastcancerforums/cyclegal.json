    "Content": "Hi Partner, My love to you and your family. Cancer is tough, scary, and affects the whole family. I am in treatment for thyroid cancer. The cancer experience in my book is awful. You feel old before your time, worry about dying, worry about living with long term effects from therapy. So this is on your mind, and then one day you read a post, see an article, hear of someone who despite all the treatment still lost their battle and you just lose it. Its the bathtub filling up, it spills over and its tough to stop the flood. Some things that helped me are identifying my good, reliable friends (a girl needs her girlfriends) and calling on them for help. Connect with other survivors. They have wonderful wisdom, and hey, they are out there! There is a powerful sisterhood of survivors! Do you have the livestrong notebook? When it arrived in the mail it made me cry. Then I opened, and read survivor stories. Cried more. But then I found such comfort from reading the stories. I also watched the DVD Crazy Sexy cancer (its available on netflix) that made me laugh and cry at the same time. Be there, love, understand, love some more. Thats what you do. Liz",
