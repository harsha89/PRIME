      "Content": "Hi Tara I think that your mom is depressed and might need an antidepressant from her onco ( oncologist) It is never good to isolate oneself. As far as being in remission and how you can tell. The onco usually does circulating tumer cells test as well as a tumor marker test. For the tumer cell one anything over 5 is not a good sign, and the tumer marker usually is 0 to 35 and anything over 35 results that the cancer is still present in the body.also the tests that are by blood test like thwe CA-125 etc. Tell your Mom to get out and do somethings even if it is for a little while, Tara you can also get people to call her and to have people write cards and letters of encouragement to her to help her not be so isolated. Also you can put cards out every day for her that people have sent to help her be encouraged.I hope this helps....Take care and GBU Sally",
