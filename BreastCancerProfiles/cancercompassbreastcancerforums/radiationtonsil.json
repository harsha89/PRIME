      "Content": "Hi, The Doc's only know what they know. These illness are always changing and evolving. Listen to your body.  I have had good results will Simpson Oil(pot) for pain.  I live in Chicago .. it is illegal unless you get a marijauna card .. But the police look the other way.  Find someone with cancer over 60 years old and chances are they will know how to hook you up.  I had people give it to me for free.  They say the street market cost is $30 US a gram.   A gram lasted me a month.   The Docs do not discuss it much because it is not a part of the \"Standard of Practice\" and they can get in trouble.  Some patients claim it cures cancer.  I do not believe that. I do believe it is effective in pain and stress management. Listen to your body .. do what works for you.   ",
