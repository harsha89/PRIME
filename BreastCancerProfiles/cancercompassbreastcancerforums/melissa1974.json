      "Content": "I feel compelled to write on this topic, my mom skipped her mammogram just once year failed to go in after just 13 months and found a lump that she ignored that whole time. No Heath insurance so she didn't want to burdon my dad on hospital bills. She went in for her first appointment finally, after begging with her, and found she did have breast cancer and it was already stage 3. The Cancer spread quickly, liver lungs bone and brain for the last, after many ups and downs within  9 months and 2 weeks she passed away. It happends so quickly. Every person has thier own situation and their own way the body reacts. But, If I can just tell her story and have at least one person out there that will read this and decide, they need to go in if they feel something odd, or has been a long time since their last mammogram Please, Please go in. The heart ache that Cancer puts the family through and patient through is so hard. I would never wish this upon anyone in a life time. Another part of this story,  I have been having bone pain crippling bone pain, to a point where i was unable to walk or stand for long than 5 mins without tears. I put off going in for as long as i could, just like my mom, after she passed away and thinking about her situation I put my family first thought about my two young kids and my husband of 15 years, I went in and found I had a tumor that caused my body to produce more calcium, with that it made my bones leak and give up their calcium, caused holes inside the bones. The calcium started to leak into the blood vessles and to all major organs, If i wouldn't have gone in thinking of my mother waiting and waiting I would of had a stroke, sezuire or heart and all major organ failure!. Im asking you to be mindful or your health it's just not you out there think of your family!. May God Bless you! If you need to contact me feel free I would love the conversation.

      "Content": "I am so out of the loop with my mom, she is hundreds of miles away and i feel she's not telling me anything i really need to know, She found out she had beast cancer last october, had a three in one Chemo cocktail  ( 30 treatments) , then a masectomy, the skin graph they took from her leg apparently had skin cancer the scale part of the skin, so she had t do radiation, all three of those really gave her a time, so weak lost over 100 pounds. They tested her said the breast cancer was in remission, she lived with that for about 3 weeks, went back in because the place where they removed the lymp nodes was infection with staff, ran some tests and now, say there are small specs in her liver and lung!.....How can this be?.....They did say the tumors she has popping up was from the Chemo treatment. I'm not so sure she can take another bout of Chemo like that again. my question is, Breast cancer caused the cancer in her liver and lung or was it the skin cancer that branched out? What treatment do they ususally do with her situation now?. I'm so worried about her. What's scary, my mom's mother had breast cancern my dad's mother passed from complications of breast cancer, So i have three female close generations that has or had breast cancer, I just feel like i need to brace myself for what may come for me or/and my daughter. :o(  ",

      "Content": "Well I would if she wanted me there. At this point She doesn't want anyone around while she's sick. She had her mammogram every year, but one, skipped one and during that year is when she started noticing the skin difference and arm pain so I think she knew she had medical issues, but just prolonged it, so with her waiting that full 13 months to go in she didn't help her situation due to fear. the same side of her breast she has a mole that was over whelmed with melanoma that she knew didn't look normal either.  She does have my dad with her so she's not alone, It's just the fact she is \"my\" mother and With her being this bad I'm not so sure when/if i will see her again.",

      "Content": "She has had the PET. She told me yesterday that they are going to start Chemo all over again her first treatment will be monday, but just not as much of the dosage she had the first time. I thought if that was an option they would at least giver her body some rest from the previous Chemo and the radiation, it has only been two weeks since her last treatment. She  now has lost a totaly of 168 pounds due to Chemo and Radition!..Will they just keep giving her Chemo If she needs it? Or when is it to a point where the body just say's \" no more\".....She wasn't going to go through chemo again but any with glimmer of hope.....  ",

Her Cancer spread so fast it took us all by surprise took her liver,lungs and bone. A lot of you helped me when i was scared lonely and lost i just wanted to thank you  for everything. I did call the Doctor and asked many question's. Something that sticks in my mind is that if she would of went in when she first found the lump 13 months before her doc's visit. She would still be here today. By the time she went in it had already spread to her lympnodes. Early detection is so Vitally important. Some of you told me to go see her no matter what, i honored my mom's request and at the end wished i didn't!.....My point is here. It is nice to have this site and read about people and their lives or how Cancer has effected you either by personally having Cancer, being a caregiver, or a close relative.
