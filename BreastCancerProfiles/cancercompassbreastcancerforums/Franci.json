      "Content": "The supplement you are referring to is under the brand name \"13C Plus\".  Unfortunately it looks like it may be of more benefit in hormone receptor positive breast cancers.  If you want to read more about it try the Sloane Kettering website - it's an excellent, accurate website.  Anyone can have access - just google \"Sloane Kettering\" - then click on Cancer Information - Integrative Medicine - About Herbs.  Good luck.",
