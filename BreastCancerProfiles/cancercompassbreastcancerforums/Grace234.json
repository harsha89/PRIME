      "Content": "Thank you for the information.I was told D-glucorate,indolplex are good supplements for receptor positive cancers.I still have one more chemo to go through and then I will have to see the oncologyst to discuss the treatment that follows.  I am in Los Angeles .I did not trust the people I saw in the natural field very not commited and not reliable. Maybe,I should combine the therapies for best results and less side effects. Thanks a lot,       ",

      "Content": "Hi I went through double mastectomy and total lmphs removel in the left arn because there was one lymph node affected.The right was OK but they removes some to test.Nothing was there. This was in August 2007 , I had full plastic reconstruction in March 2008.I worked out but never felt anything. I am a fitness instructor and also use the steam room and jacuzzy.I have been feeling a pain in the night I don't know if can be nerves in the arm or the veins are recuperating from the chemo.I have been back to my activity a month ago and sometimes carry heavy bag or food since I do not have any help.   The pain or numbness is in the arm and I have joint pain in the middle of the thumb and index finger more in the right arm and hand than in the left.   Anybody knows something about it.I will not stop my activity and do a lot in the water but never felt anything and my arms are not swelling.   Thanks a lot,",
