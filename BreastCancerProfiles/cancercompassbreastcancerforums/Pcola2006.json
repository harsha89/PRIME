I think it is a wise decision to take both breasts, especially with your history.  It isn't that hard to get over having both removed and I think you wil be happy not to have the stress and worry about finding cancer in the breast that is left if you don't have both removed.  I wish you the best outcome possible and feel free to respond or ask any questions you might have. My name is Janie and I live in Illinois.   Hi Janie, My name is Jackie and I live in Florida.  I am meeting with my doctor in March to discuss the reconstruction.  I can't wait to finish taking Taxol in 3 weeks so that maybe I can get rid of some fluid.  Did you take Herceptin?  I will be taking it every 3 weeks maybe up to a year.  I also elected to remove both.  It really wasn't a hard decision for me.  I knew I couldn't live day to day thinking it would return in the other breast.  I have no regrets.  I am thinking about having Tram Flap.  I don't think I want to have any foreign substances in my body.  Let me know if you have any ideas about this type.  Thanks, Jackie",
