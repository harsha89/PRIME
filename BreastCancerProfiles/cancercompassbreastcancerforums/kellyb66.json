    "Content": "I had the same situation last October.  Within 2.5 weeks, I had my first mammogram at age 41.  They found calcifications and a cyst.  they did a ultrasound on the cyst (it was fine) and another close up mammogram.  They then suggested a biopsy.  I had a stereotactic (misspelled) biopsy and thank God it came back fine.  They removed the calcifications and then I had to have another close-up mammogram after 6 months.  I go again for another 6 month check up in October.  Cancer has not been in my immediate family until this past year.  My birth mother died from lung/liver cancer on March 13, after being told she had it on March 6th.  My aunt has JUST been diagnosed with  triple negative breast cancer. So,  I would suggest a biopsy for peace of mind to a point.  They biopsied my aunts for the last 2 yrs and it came back benign.  Then all of a sudden it went to half the size of a golf ball, a very advanced cancer, and she starts chemo next week.  When I had my last mammogram, there was a poster in the dressing room with a lady saying she had something wrong with her breast.  I think it said they had run test and everything seemed to be ok, but she wanted to be sure, so SHE asked for an MRI.  The MRI showed cancer.    I am not trying to scare you.  It is your body and you are in charge.  You do what you feel you need to do.  Most of the time, Micro-calcifications are benign, but the cancer that my aunt has, only 2% of white women get it and she has got it. Please keep me posted. Kelly    ",
