    "Content": "My breastcancer(1989) had metastazised into my bones  (2005) I was given Zometa to strenghten the bones and  was on it  in 2005 . My Dentist informed me last week because of  the Zometa intake the two teeth that now needto be extracted  can not be   pulled . Would anyone know of a special  or new procedure on how to deal with this problem?",
