      "Content": "hi lisa,    I was just wondering if you had to go on any hormonal therapy.  if not, why?  i've had a double mastectomy with the flap (reconstructed from tummy fat) on aug. 20. 2012 they want to put me on radiation and arimidex. but i don't want to do either.. I had  a very small , less than an inch, not in any lymph nodes.  try not to worry about cancer returning.. turn your fears over to God.. he's the master planner as it is.  that's what I am doing. and of course, there are those that think i'm nuts. i'm 60.. a widow.. nothing can beat me down after going thru that loss..  good luck.. best blessings to you.",

      "Content": "Hi springflowers,   It's Oct. 26, I just saw your reply...I am in agreement with you.  I have always thought that the dr's. in this country were in bed with the drug company's. My husband died 2 years ago of emphazema (i still don't know how it's spelled..lol)... and the treatment he got many times was nuts. but I did have him home with me on a ventilator for 4 years. I was blessed to be able to take care of him at home. It's not for everyone, but I was able to change his trake's etc..... anyway, I agree about the chemo.  I am so glad I read your reply.  My oncologist,  that I just met for the 2nd time the other day, wants me on radiation and arimidix... I am not doing either.  I have no breast tissue left,  and was told my chances of it coming back, before the surgery, were slim..now, all of a sudden they want me to do all this other stuff.  I feel at peace with my decision.   My oncotype was a number 13, in the low percent of it coming back.  Anyway, the dr. I met with the other day, didn't even read my file, or she forgot that i had both breasts removed when she mentioned that I will be followed up with mammo's every 6 months..I told her I didn't have any breasts.. (except reconstructed from my stomach fat).  she apologized..   I am glad you are doing so well, keep up your own research.  I'm sure you can help those that just don't know and listen to every word their dr's. speak.  I have a bad taste for dr's. for the most part when they start pushing meds..   What nutrients are you taking? have a wonderful weekend and keep on keeping on.... patty",

      "Content": "hi,  I was diagnosed thru a mammo on my 60th birthday in june with stage one breast cancer (after my biopsy).  the dr. told me it was very well behaved and would respond to treatment very well.  I am sure she would have thought I would have gone with a lumpectomy, but I wanted to be over and done with it (so I thought) by having a bi-lateral masectomy in Aug. and had reconstruction at the same time using my stomach fat.  I am doing very well and hardly ever think of cancer.  the oncologist who was referred by the breast surgeon has recommended radiation and then Arimidex for 5-10 years.. I am not feeling either recommendation.  she gave me the percentage that it would prob. return if I didn't take the pill... 16%.. on the pill 8 %. I am looking the other way.. 84 % I won't get it back. that is high enough for me.  I am trusting in the only one who knows right now, God, whether I will face another situation. If I do, I will then deal with it..again.  Life for me is too short to be taking all sorts for meds that have horrible side effects.  I am very active and feel as healthy as I always did.  I never felt ill and I'm not on any meds for other things.   Is there anyone out there that has gone against their dr's. wishes and have peace about it?

I had one removed before my mastectomy and one in the opposte side the day of surgery..both were negative. MY oncotype number was 13.   I felt I didn't need the radiation, because I don't have any breast tissue left in me..the guideline they used was .1 where my cyst was and I was a .5.... the cyst or whatever it was was very close to the outside of my breast, so they may not have been able to scrape it completely out.  I will keep my faith and see what happens. I am not expecting to get cancer back..it's that simple.  What was your oncotype number? just curious me asking..   Good luck and God bless you with good health.",

      "Content": "Hi Nanci,   It may have sounded like our treatments were the same with the tummy fat, but my reconstruction was done immediately after the breasts were removed, right then and there.  it was a 10 hour surgery. some of it was mirco surgery connecting  blood vessels from  the flap of skin taken from my stomach. I didn't have lyposuction, it was more a tummy tuck. The leech was put in place because the vessels didn't have a good blood flow at first.  I had them on for 2 days, changing to a new leech every 4 hours.  One actually crawled off after sucking all it wanted and ended up under my chin on my neck...it was too funny. i had 2 sisters there and they freaked out..  I never heard of lyposuction reconstruction, but it sounds similar to the expander with the saline implants,but you are using fat.  a more natural look.  I don't have nipples yet, and I'm not sure if i will get a tattoo or a reconstructed one or just leave it bare.. I'm a widow, so no one sees me anyway, but myself.  I was triple positive,but am on the fence with the hormonal therapy they want me to take for 5 years.  there is so many side effects.. I do trust God so much, that I believe He has me covered.  I just lost my 61 year old sister in law on tuesday to breast cancer.  She fought it for 3 years.  If it hadn't been for my own cancer, we wouldn't have reconnected from a family fued we had years ago. God works in His own ways.   My procedure is called Tram Flap reconstruction.  I feel great and am returning to work this monday.  Good luck and ask me anything you need to, I would be glad to help if I can.. God Bless.",

      "Content": "Hi Nanci, it's me again..I saw this other post you posted and wanted to answer your question about bruising. My surgery was done 8 weeks ago and I had the flap reconstruction i was telling you about.  i do have bruising under the left breast, the one that didn't have the leech on it.  If i press on it, it's sore,but it has gotten way better. I have very little soreness anywhere.  My breasts and stomach are still pretty numb though and was told it will be this way for months. Being I have my stomach on/in my breast pocket, i don't know that I will ever feel them.  after losing your nipples, there really isn't any sensation there.  Don't worry too much about the bruising, i'm sure it will go away sooner or later. just think you are cancer free, a bruise in comparison is nothing..

She is in a lot of pain every night she said. she was too thin to do the tram flap, like I did.  I really didn't have that much pain considering I had 2 major surgeries. I would recommend what I went thru to someone who didn't want to wait months later.  all my surgery and reconstruction is done the same day.  I am hearing a lot about the joint pain that the arimidex causes.  I am glad that you were at peace when you stopped taking it.  my oncotype score was 13, which is low risk for it to return.  and it was a small cancer stage 1.   I wish you well and hope you find someone that has gone thru your method.  I'm in NJ and there is a Cancer center of am. in philly and also a good cancer place called Fox chase-not the bank...lol   I really don't want to take the tomoxifen either.. that has major side affects as well.  my sister is on that , after dealing with ovarian cancer.. she had a hysterectomy, so she doesn't have to worry about uterine cancer.
