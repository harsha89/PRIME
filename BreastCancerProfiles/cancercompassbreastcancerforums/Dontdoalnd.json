    "Content": "Does anyone here have pain that's lasted for a long time after a mastectomy, lumpectomy or lymph node dissection? If so, have you found a resolution to it? I've been in pain for 3 years. I have a stabbing, burning pain in my left axilla, down my arm and in my left chest. I need to find an answer. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.",
