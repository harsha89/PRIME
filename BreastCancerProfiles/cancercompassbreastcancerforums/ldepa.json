    "Content": "Thanks yorkydee for your great side effect list. I see my onc in 4 weeks and have wanted to create one...but you have done it for me! After mastectomy/chemo/Rt.. I failed Tamoxifen,Femara and Arimidex to to body rashes. I have been on Aromasin 15 months now with side effects starting very noticeably after 6 months. I agree totally with your list. I promised myself I would not complain about any aches/pains after living through chemo, but it definitely is slowly effecting my quality of life. Right now the MOST painful side effect for me, are not one but two  thumb trigger fingers.  Had 1 steroid injection to the dominant hand and it only helped for approx 3 months. From reading everyones comments it looks like for me it's putting up with the pains as long as you can or stop it. Has anyone attempted taking the Aromasin every other day or 3 times weekly to see if symptoms improve? That will be my question to my onc in 4 weeks.  ",
