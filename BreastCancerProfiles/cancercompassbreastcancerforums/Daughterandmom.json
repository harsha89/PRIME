    "Content": "Hi Roses8753 and others, If you are having intolerable side effects from Arimidex, remember that you have other options. There is a lot of financial incentive to act as if Arimidex is god's gift to women (especially now that tamoxifen is off patent-- we're talking $9 a day vs. a buck a day), but the fact is, they still haven't shown a clear survival difference for Arimidex vs. tamoxifen. Yes, they have shown SLIGHTLY fewer recurrences, but it is expected that the increased bone fractures will negate some of that benefit. You have to use what works for you, and you are not a \"bad patient\" if you decide to use an older drug. I wrote up some information about this for my mom that you might be interested in: it's at www.breastcancerdecisions.org (a nonprofit site-- not selling anything and no corporate funding, just info I wrote up for my mom). Look under the endocrine section (and the introductory sections, about interpreting statistics, may be interesting too). Good luck.",
