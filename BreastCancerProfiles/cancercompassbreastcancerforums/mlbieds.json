      "Content": "This may be similar:  I had a broken leg in March of 2009, then got a blood clot in same leg in October 2009 (probably caused by Tamoxifen).  After getting out of the hospital, started getting severe pain in my lower back and down both legs, but mostly the left leg.  Back to the hospital where they gave me pain meds and after a couple of days said to go home and be on pain pills!  Returned home in immense pain, and ended up falling at the house.  Called my orthopaedic surgeon, who was bright enough to order an MRI of my lower back (something they DID NOT DO at the hospital), and found a tumor on my spinal cord.  Turned out, they had over-thinned my blood, causing a hemorrhage of the tumor, which in turn put pressure on the nerves that operate my legs (L2).  Get your sister a lower back MRI ASAP!  Then to a good neuro-surgeon...  BTW, the tumor was benign!  so not all tumors are bad...",

      "Content": "Sorry to say, I am 18 months off Femara, and still experiencing hot flashes. I manage fine at home (fans year round), but sometimes I get embarrassed out in public -- like maybe someone might think I'm very sick and shouldn't be out getting everyone else sick. Sometimes I can laugh it off with someone else of a certain age, but sometimes I truly feel sick for the five minutes or so it takes to pass. I'm fairly crafty, so have made a bunch of hankies that I carry everywhere. The good news is that the joint pain is LOTS better.",

      "Content": "I had no history of breast cancer when I was diagnosed at age 51. My only risk factor is that I am overweight and to put it bluntly, fat cells produce estrogen. Mine was caught early thanks to a mammogram, so I had surgery (clean margins and nodes) and radiation. Then the five years of hell. Actually, Tamoxifen was a gimme, in that it didn't seem to have any side effects -- until I got a blood clot to my lungs after a broken leg. They made me switch to Arimidex, then Femara -- and that's when the hell began. Joint pain like I was 90 years old. The day my five years was up, I quit and am happy to report that after about six to eight months my joints got much better. Other than trying to cut most sugars and processed foods, I don't know what the answer is. Seems like every time someone reports something is \"good\" -- it is only a matter of time that it isn't. Good luck to you! Mary Lou",

      "Content": "A little history: diagnosed in late 2007 with stage 1, had lumpectomy and radiation. Started Tamoxifin in spring 2008 with virtually no side effects. Of course with all this I was in instant menopause at age 51, but hot flashes fairly manageable. In 2009 I broke my leg and then got a blood clot to lungs. Survived that, and onco took me off Tamoxifen because they felt it caused the blood clot, and put me on Arimidex. Lots of joint pain with Arimidex, so switched me to Femara after 6-9 months. Still lots of joint pain, but stayed with Femara as onco felt it was a better drug. This spring was 5 years on these drugs (total for all 3 drugs) so I wanted to quit. He tried to talk me into staying on the Femara for a full five years, but I have had enough and decided to stop. My joints are SO much better. But now I've been experiencing terrible hot flashes -- or at least I think that is what happening. I can be in a temperature-controlled space and just start sweating like crazy. I have had to start carrying handkerchiefs, which I never had to do before. I haven't talked to my onco about this yet (next appt in Dec), but it doesn't make sense that going OFF an estrogen blocker would cause hot flashes. Perhaps it is just a coincidence and something else is going on...I see my GP next week for this issue. Anyone with similar experience of MORE/WORSE hot flashes after going off this class of drugs? (As long as it is harmless and not indicative of something else going on, I'll take the hot flashes over joint pain any day!) Mary Lou",

      "Content": "I also had Tamoxifen and then Arimidex. The Tamoxifen was a \"freebie\" for me. No side effects at all, I thought - until I got a blood clot. Then they put me on Arimidex/Femara. Horrible. I begged to be put back on Tamoxifen, but they wouldn't let me. All my side effects were/are extreme lower extremity bone/joint pain. I took myself off after a total of five years for all drugs, although my onco wanted me to go five years with the Arimidex. No way. Glad to say the extreme hip/back pain went away after 6 months or so. As I age I have a host of related problems, but unclear if these drugs made it worse, or it's just old age (and weighing more than I should). I still run \"hot\" and often have a fan on, whether winter or summer. The main thing you mention that I did not experience is the memory loss and cracked teeth. I hope your symptoms ease soon.

      "Content": "I started out on tamoxifen with virtually no side effects. Then I broke my leg and got a blood clot which they attributed to tamoxifen. Switched to arimidex and started having the worst joint pains, including hands. They don't hurt \"at rest\", but hurt to squeeze like if someone goes to shake my hand it is painful. And forget about opening the simplest of things. Even the foil top on yogurt gives me trouble sometimes. Doc switched me to Femara to see if it was any different, but still terrible joint pain. I feel like 90 years old, especially when first getting up after sitting awhile. I am going to try this krill oil. I assume my local health food store will know what it is? Good news is, I only have four more months of this crap, and then my five years is up! I just hope my body returns to somewhat normal, realizing I'm five years older and things just naturally aren't the same. Good luck to all who have to take this stuff. Mary Lou",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in late 2007 with breast cancer, had a lumpectomy followed with radiation (no lymph nodes involved).  Started therapy with Tamoxifen in spring 2008.  Had some hot flashes, but that was about all the side effects that I could feel.  Then, I broke my leg in March 2009 (bad break, both bones, titanium implant from knee to ankle) and after mostly recuperating from that, got a blood clot in same leg in October 2009.  My oncologist thinks the Tamoxifen contributed to the blood clot, so changed me over to Arimidex in December 2009.  About the same time I started heavy doses of Prednisone (nasty stuff) to treat a rare form of anemia.  He has been stepping me down from the Prednisone, and as I got closer to the end, my bones and muscles from the hips down are killing me.  I now think the Prednisone was masking the side effects of Arimidex all this time!  My last appt. he said to give it a few weeks to see if the pain is caused by the Arimidex or a \"rebound\" effect from the Prednisone.  If still experiencing bone/muscle pain he will change me over to one of the other drugs (Femara or Aromasin).  I have two questions:  has ANYONE else experienced blood clots from Tamoxifen?  I would almost rather switch back to Tamoxifen and take the blood thinners than stay on the Arimidex.  My husband says at some point, you have to consider the certain loss of quality of life vs. the possible reoccurence of cancer... And secondly, has anyone switched from Arimidex to one of the other drugs with no or little side effects?  I'm tired of being tired.  (as Madeline Kahn used to say)",
