I have Stage IV lobular breast cancer (no lump) & the 'breast MRI' is one of the few tests that would pick that up.  You just lay face down on a slab that has openings for your breasts to hang thru so as to be isolated from the rest of your body during the scan. Mine was done just to verify my diagnosis which I got in July. Hoping the best for you!",

      "Content": "Hi Becky, I have Stage 4 \"bone only\" lobular breast cancer which means it is not in my breasts or soft tissues but is in almost all of my bones.  Basically, I feel 'fine', am symptom free, have some bone & joint pain but don't know if that's caused by the cancer or arthritis, or just getting older. I wanted to tell you not to get too excited about her PET scan results because it really is not all that accurate.  Last year I had a nuclear bone scan which indicated that my cancer was worse so I had my first (& only) PET scan 3 weeks after the bone scan & the PET said no visable cancer at all!  When I asked how that was possible they said the PET scan does not show the damage to the bones. So personally I don't know why it's considered a good test.  About 6 yrs ago my husband was given a PET scan due to some chest pain & he was told he had wide spread lung cancer & we thought he'd be dead in about 3 months.  However, when he saw his regular doctor a couple of days later he was told that it showed up so much worse in 2 days that it could not possibly be lung cancer.  It turned out to be pneumonia!  He was treated for that & was just fine.  No cancer then or now.  So I feel that if a PET scan can't even tell the difference between severe lung cancer & pneumonia.... it seems like a worthless & expensive test! I'm sure it must be effective for some patients, but for us, we're 2 for 2 on it being completely wrong! On a better note, tell your sister not to panic because the more she reads these sites, the more people she will hear about who have had bone cancer for many years and live a pretty normal life.  I personally have not changed my lifestyle at all, still do all the same things, work hard, play hard, and I'm good.  I get monthly Zometa, daily Femara pill and just started monthly injection of Faslodex.  Have had no side effects from any of it.  I actually feel quite lucky.  Hope she will be too.... hang in there, may not be as bad as it sounds. Hugs, Toni",

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Hi, Have you been given your diagnosis yet?  Your case sounds very similar to mine, depending on what type of cancer you actually have.  You can click on my profile to read about mine, but the bottom line for me is that having Stage IV LOBULAR breast cancer (which was determined by a biopsy to a couple of my vertibrae) is not such a bad thing, so don't panic.  I was diagnosed in July & thought I wouldn't have much time so I gave away a lot of things that I wish I had kept since I really feel just like I did before I knew I had cancer.... some aches & pains, but mostly just fine.  I have no symptoms at all & have been told I can \"live for years\" with this disease & that seems to be the way Stage IV lobular breast cancer works because I've heard from others who are the same. If your diagnosis is the same, I can go into more detail as far as treatment goes.  I'll be hoping for the best for you.  Write me.......

My only treatment is a daily Femara pill & a monthly Zometa infusion & I have never had any side effects from either of them until the Zometa infusion last month.  I had LOTS of pain after that one... cried for 2 days, but I've been told that if the 'drip' is set too fast, that causes the bad side effects, so I'm hoping to get it real slow next week & see if that makes the difference.  My kidneys are bad also, apparently from getting too dehydrated a couple of years ago, so now I have to have a bag or 2 of saline before the Zometa so it will flush out of my system faster.  Have to do the same if I have any tests requiring nuclear 'contrast' or iodine.  But I don't mind... as long as it all keeps working!

I appreciate the info!  Keep up the good 'work\"!  I too have some extra padding around the middle, not sure I can blame it on the meds, may be more likely too much 'comfort food'. I asked my doc if I should still go on a diet, as I had planned, or if it was like on the TV show \"Survivor\" where the chubby ones last longer, LOL  He said I did not need to go on a diet.  I would like to do some weight training as I used to but not sure that's ok with cancer in my back bones.  I am also having all my original tests repeated now, & so far, so good.  Dexascan on my back was 'normal'  (weird, as you said), CT of my head is 'normal', just had another nuclear bone scan yesterday, no results yet.  Thanks for writing & please keep in touch!  Toni",

My treatment is 6 treatments of chemo which I am starting my 3rd on Monday. Then masectomy then radiation then 5 yrs. on some kind of pill I forgot the name.  My tumor has gotten smaller just after 2 treatments so I know the chemo is working. I am thinking I may not need mastectomy if it is smaller maybe I will need a lumpectomy It's all so confusing. How come you aren't getting chemo with stage 4? My prayers are with you all Diane Hi Toni!  Where do you live!!??   I just had all of my tests repeated, including the stomach scope, and all clear.......weird!!!  As usual.  I have weight gain, which I HATE, and extreme fatigue, joint pain.  Wish I had a solution for that, but I am alive three years later!  I am trying to figure out ways to battle the side effects.....not much luck so far!  How are you doing?  what about side effects???   shirley in Ga. Hi Shirley, It looks like I never replied to this note... if so, I'm sorry.  I didn't know I had a message. I don't remember getting any notice of it.... anyway, we live in southern Oregon.  I get my treatment of Zometa at the new (small) cancer center here but I verified that it was the right thing ay both a large teaching medical center in Portland & at City of Hope in LA. Now I'm confused though because in doing the 6 mo repeat of all my scans, the CT radiologist referred to my bone cancer as 'progressive', even though my CEA count has come down to 12, from a high of 183. So then my onc ordered my first PET scan, which was last week.  The resuls of that say \"No convincing evidence of metastatic disease in the volume imaged\"!  What the heck does that mean?  I'm pleased that the PET scan didn't indicate that the cancer is worse, but it couldn't have just disappeared in 3-4 WEEKS! Not sure where to go from here.... my onc is supposed to talk with the radiologists who read the 2 scans & see what THEY think. As for side effects.... I didn't know I had any, LOL because I've been blaiming all my aches & pains on aging, arthritis, cold & damp weather, etc. but maybe some of my pain is from SE's.  I have thinning hair, joint pain, really sore tops of my feet sometimes & I've noticed others have mentioned their feet hurting.  I wear an over-the-counter Wal Mart back brace most of the time because it really does help my back pain.  I take 2 vicoden when I remember to do that but I'm terrible with pills, even tho' I take about 16 per day.  I take so many suppliments, etc. that more pills, even to releive pain, just does not appeal to me.  I get tired too, but I work hard all the time... just a high maintenence house & yard.... and I feel like anyone would be tired with my burn-the-candle-at-both-ends lifestyle.  I need to make time for some actual cardio excercize, but can't seem to get there. I'm glad to hear you are doing so well, YAY!  Strange as it is, I'll take it... if I have to have a stage IV cancer, I guess this is the one to have!  Take care, Toni    ",
