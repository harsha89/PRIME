    "Content": "Does anyone have any experiences with Salicinium?  It's a homeopathic therapy advocated by Dr. Forsythe of Reno, Nevada.  He has several testimonials on his web site, but I've also seen a blog of a patient who tried the treatment and passed away a year later.  A close friend has Stage 4 breast cancer and we are looking far and wide for treatment options.  Any personal stories involving Salicinium - good or bad - would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!  Ken",
