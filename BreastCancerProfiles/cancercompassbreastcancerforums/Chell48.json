    "Content": "Hello all, I hope someone out there can help me. I was diagnosed w/lobular carcinomain my right breast in 08. Surgeon did a lumpectomy (told my family he got it all) then when I came back the next week..no he hadn't. I had a 5 cm tumor very close to my chest wall. 2 days later I had a bilateral mastecomy. 8 months of chemo and 4 monts of radiation. I took arimidex for 6 months and fellt like I was 90 yearsold (I'm 48) so I made the decision not to take it anymore. I have had 4 check ups...all has been good, although they are only doing blood work. This morning I woke up and I could barley walk. The joints in my hip bones is excrutiating. I have hardly been able to walk all day. I tried to walk it off, but couldn't. My left knee has bothered me for a few months but thought it was from damage from chemo/radiation. Has anyone gone through this? I would really love to talk to someone who has had the same symptons. Thanking you in advance. Chelle",
