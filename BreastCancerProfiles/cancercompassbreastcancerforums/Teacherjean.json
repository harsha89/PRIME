    "Content": "I have 3A breast cancer and chose to have have mastectomy.  It has been 13 days since my first chemo treatment and I noticed today that my hair appears to be thinning a little.  Would someone share at what point their hair came out.  I go Thursday for Round 2 of chemo.  Also, I did pretty well after Round 1, only couple of rough days.  Is that what I can expect or will it get worse?",
