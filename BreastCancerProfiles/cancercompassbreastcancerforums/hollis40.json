My back was giving me lots of pain last summer and I was treated with physio and acupuncture before finally getting the stage 4 dx. I have mets to bones, now lungs and liver. I have been on Xeloda and Pamitrogen since January. I am doing quite well and having scans on Tuesday. I will be nervously waiting the results. I just live each day thanking God for the bonus time I get. I have shrunk 3 inches in the past year or so due to spine involvement. I don't know what or I guess when life has in store so best just to make as good memories as I can for my family and friends. None of us asked for this miserable disease but we have to eat as healthy as possible, drink plenty of water and enjoy life even if it is slightly modified. Take care and prayer for all of you. yes i have breast cancer with mets to bones. take one day at a time. vna comes 2 x week to strenght my muscles and bones. on Zometa monthly. 2 year on xeloda 500 mg 5 tabs 2x day. exeercise as much as i can,. i will fight as along as i can, there no date stamped on my foot. each day is important, god bless everyone fighting, and you will win, because god has plans for all of us. god bless. debbie",

Early breast cancer (DCIS on one side, stage 1 tumor on the other) but already metasticised to my proximal femur, triple positive. I've been all over the Internet looking at survival rates for breast cancer metastisis to the bone and found all the scary alarming info (studies showing mean survival rates of 6 months or 1 year or 2 years, awful), but I also found other studies reporting that life spans for this situation are dramatically increasing with Hepterin and other drugs. Also, it matters a lot how metasticised the cancer is ... how many other sites are involved, and where. May I ask your situation? i have stage 4 ca of breast with mets to all  my bones. i am on xeodla 500mg 10 pills a day 21 days a month. i am starting my 3rd year with this diagnosis. it s  hard but i get up each day and make it count. dont give up to cancer.  so tafkira be postive and figtht the fight. debbie, hollis 40",
