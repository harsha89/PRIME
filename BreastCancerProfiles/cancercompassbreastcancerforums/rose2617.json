      "Content": "No, that is the wonderful part after a bilateral mastectomy, never having to have a mammogram again. MRI or the PEM scan is the only tests needed for follow up and some doctors do not even want to do that. I however, will be insisting because if it returns, I want it found early. Simple mastectomies that are done today do not take all breast tissue as past radical mastectomies. Good Luck.",
