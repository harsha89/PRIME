      "Content": "To me, putting it bluntly, it smelled like rotting flesh. I wonder if you'll reply to this; it's been a year since my post. She has just had a hysterectomy. There was a large undifferentiated cancerous mass in her uterous. She may be in real trouble here. We will find out about the staging tomorrow. We are both praying for the best. I wonder if the smell a year ago is part of this same ugly thing?! Was it a psychic premonition?",

      "Content": "My partner (64) is a breast cancer survivor. She had a lumpectomy, radiations and chemo over ten years ago and her annual mammograms have all been negative(she had one two weeks ago). To make a long story short, while we were intimate recently I smelled cancer near her left breast ( my mom had breast cancer, and I will never forget the smell) She is going to get and ultrasound, probably within the month, but other than that is not taking me seriously. I am very upset about this. Am I over-reacting? I care deeply for my partner and don't want to lose her. Does anyone have any input?",
