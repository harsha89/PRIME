    "Content": "Jeff, it is possible unfortunately. My mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in early 2004, tests of the lymph nodes were negative, and she completed what appeared to be successfull treatment (mastectomy and chemo)in January this year. She started feeling pain in her shoulder and neck shortly after and finally it got bad enough that her doctor ordered her to the hospital for tests, which showed a tumor compressing her spine, and it had eaten away ate one vertebrae in the front, and 1 and a half in the back. She just had surgery this week to remove the bad vertebrae and most of the tumor. The doctors said if left untreated this condition would've caused paralysis. So my advice would be to speed things up if you can. If she's not feeling pain yet maybe they can get it before it attacks the bones on her spine (if it is indeed cancerous). By the way, my mothers diagnosis was made after they did an MRI.",
