    "Content": "Dear Candace and all concerned: First of all, let me congratulate you on your willingness to reach out to others. Everyone needs someone everyday in their lives, and staying open to receiving input from others will help you tremendously. I'm finishing up some tests today to see if my non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is still in remission. You and I and anyone who has had cancer are veterans in a war against cancer. None of us volunteered to participate in this war, yet we find ourselves on the front lines. We have been attacked by a terrorist on our homeland, from within and it has affected everyone who knows us. We have seen pain and suffering, and yes sometimes death seems all around us. Yet we live to fight another day. My family doctor warned me of these feelings you are having. The reason I use the analogy of being at war is because you and all of us feel as if we have been to war and no one can really understand unless they have been there. You have every right to feel the way you do, and yes you will get better. Your body will heal long before your emotions and your mind do. Do it at your pace, but just make sure you do it. You are a unique and special person, who has learned how, day by day, to overcome one of the most cowardly, despicable diseases in the world. Imagine the power you now have!! Please feel free to get very mad at this disease for disrupting your life and the life of those you love. You are not lost, you are in charge. None of us can control the quantity, or the length of our lives, so we must focus on the quality of our lives. You must find something to be thankful for every single moment that you can. No matter how small it seems. You are a warrior, who will find what it is in you that others just don't know yet. Your God has blessed you with that chance. Think no other way, and your life will be full, no matter how long you have to fight. This miserable disease may someday take our bodies, but it cannot kill our spirits!! God bless. Rob",
