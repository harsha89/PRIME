      "Content": "Hi, I am 36 years old and was diagnosed with class 3 infilitrating ductile carcinoma on 6/6/06. I was scheduled for a mastectomy this morning (6/22) but the pregnancy test came back positive and the surgery was postponed. I apparently conceived a few days before being informed of the breast cancer. I have no clue what to do? I see the oncologist tomorrow to discuss our options. Has anyone ever experienced this issue or have any information regarding this issue, pregnancy and breast cancer? THANK YOU! LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM SOMEONE!",
