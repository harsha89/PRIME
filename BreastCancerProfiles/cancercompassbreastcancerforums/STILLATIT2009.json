    "Content": "I was originally diagnosed with Breast Cancer January 1998.   Had Chemotherapy - Mastectomy and Radiation Treatments  Was rediagnosed September 2003 - Metastatic Breast Cancer - Stage 4.  I have been basically on Chemotherapy since 2004 now. On an average day I am fine emotionally.  I work full time as I always have.  I have been off work at times for various reasons, i.e. surgery on my back in 2008, but I did find that after 3 months at home I was going nuts.  I originally joined a message board back in 1999, but stopped as I went into remission.  I thought about joining another message board, but it seems that everyone in the groups are either beginning treatment or are just finishing up.  In other words the train is moving with others, but I am standing still.",
