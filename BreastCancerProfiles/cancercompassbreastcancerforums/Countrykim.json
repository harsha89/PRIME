    "Content": "Hi, I read you questions on here and I can only tell you what I went through and what I know. I was only 33 years old at the time when I was told that I was in stage 2 of my breast cancer. I had the same cancer that you do, but I was negetive in the estrogen testing. They told me that if I would have been positive that I would have to take tomoxicin for the following 5 years. I chose to have a mastectomy and also had reconstrutive surgery done. I am pleased with the results. I also did not want to go through with the radiation because of the bad things that I had heard from people who went throug it. I was a mess at first too, and I was alone at the time. That was 6 years ago, and today I am doing very well, and so will you. Just hang in there. I know it is hard, but think positive. Kim",
