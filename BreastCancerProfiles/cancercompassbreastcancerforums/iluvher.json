    "Content": "Hi guys, I just want to start out by saying that i am very sorry for what everyone is going through. I am new to this site i just started reading it today and my mother too has been diagnosed with carcinomatous meningitis. She had been in remission from breast cancer which we thought was all cured in 2004. Then one day out of the blue she started to complain about back pains, headaches, and neckpain. Little by little the got worse but we thought maybe she just wasnt sleeping correctly. But then the pain began to grow to severe and intollerable levels. We took her to her regular doctor and he just gave her some pain meds and just brushed it off. Driving back from the doctor, she just went into a blank stare and became incoherent, so immediatley called the ambulance.... That was the beggining of the worst 3 months of my life. After about a month and a half of my mom suffering SEVERE AND INTOLERABLE pains, and getting sent to this doctor and that doctor, and one emergency room visit to another with all the doctors dumfounded and not coming up with any results, finally after the 5th trip to the ER, they admitted her and decide she needed to be further evaluated. The doctors did a lumbar 2 lumbar punctures before an oncologist analyzed the results and called my home and told me that her cancer had metastisized.  My mother is 49 years old. I am only 20, and i have a younger brother who is only 17, and because my father's enlish isn't good, i have had to be the one to deal with all the doctors and take care of any financial issues such as bills, and its overwhelming. My mother is very weak and has completely lost her vision, i have been searching the web for ways to further help my mom and after reading some of the stories you have all written, i am beggining to feel that her oncologist is holding out on us. I am starting to get choked up as i am writing this because i think i have to really ask the doctor to be upfront with me ,because we really thought that my mom had a better chance, but unfortunately now im not so sure...:'(   PLEASE PRAY FOR US AS I WILL DO FOR YOU....",
