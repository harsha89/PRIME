      "Content": "Hi Cindy, Thank you for your kind words. My mother has consulted with three different oncologists (not associated with her particular case), and it seems that they are encouraging a partial mastectomy. That said, she is still unsure what she will do. It is bitterly funny, I am a neuroscience researcher... so, in both my parents eyes, I am supposed to know everything. But, I certainly don't. Not about this. Not about cancer. Not about what is best for my mother in this case. Yes, the info is mind-numbing. The best I could find after going over article after article was that there is no statistical difference in overall sucess after either surgery. Whatever her decision, I will be right there with her. Thank you again for your encouragement. Thank you for being kind. take care, -Erich",

      "Content": "Hi, I am very new to this discussion group. My mother just called me and explained that she was just diagnosed with Stage 2 infiltrating ductile carcinoma. Her doctor gave her the options of a partial mastectomy (lumpectomy) or a full mastectomy. HE WOULD NOT TELL HER WHICH WAS THE BEST OPTION. She prodded and prodded as to which was the best option but was informed that it was her decision. She called and asked me for advice. I have no idea what to tell her. None. Does anyone here have any advice or suggestions? Please help me. I want to help my mother. Thank you.",
