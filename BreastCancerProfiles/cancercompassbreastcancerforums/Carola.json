    "Content": "My friend has breast cancer that has recurred twice. It's spread to her lungs, liver and eye. This is her 3rd go around with chemo. Her lungs are filling up with fluid that must be drained and she needs o2 to breathe. The doctors say the lungs will get less irritated as the chemo takes effect. Has anyone reading this experienced the same? And can say they are ok today?",
