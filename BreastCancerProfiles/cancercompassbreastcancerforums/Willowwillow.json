      "Content": "Thank you so SO much! Your experience and expertise are invaluable and I appreciate it all. Wow! I am amazed at what your mom has gone through and understand fully that it is what I would do as well. Daughters and mothers, such a strong bond. What an amazing role you've played in her life since the beginning of her cancer journey. God blesses you.  I did have a friend who took notes in the beginning. She was a great listener and note taker but not so good at defending me when I was upset, confused, or othwise frustrated. She doesn't like conflict. Neither do I but I agree that it's MY body and it's MY life so I have learned to deal with conflict just not the science of it all. I'm learning. What I am good at is writing about my experience and drawing - my majors in college. In fact, I did poorly in science but managed to pass. Here's where my learning comes in - I have to! Thank you so much. I really get that they will give you the runaround when they don't know and don't have time or are willing to get honest with me. I understand that knowledge is power and I'm more likely to get an answer if I ask the right questions. I've been doing research on the internet (thank God for this, eh?) and understand more about CEAs and CA counts and other terms. In fact, I asked my nurse on friday to slow down and explain to me everything and though she did and I did write it down...it still remains a mystery about whether or not it's arthritis in my rib and femur or if it's bone cancer that has \"quieted down\"  which is what I think it is. Although I'm so afraid to leave the place (Seattle Cancer Care Alliance) I found to be the best, I am not afraid to switch oncologists. The hospitals who treat around here feel like \"herding\" vessels for so many people going through with all sorts of problems versus a cancer-specific treatment center through the University which I prefer. Now I need to find a good team willing to listen and respond  Are you going to Michael Moore's movie, \"Sicko\" when it opens June 29th? I know I'm going to be enraged with it because it really opens up the facts about the health and insurance industry...something we both know is a mess. To close, thank you again for all your words and the fact you took the time to write. I dont' know where you are but THANK YOU!!! I'll include you and your mother in my prayers and think of you when I get my new doctor.  ",

      "Content": "Hi,  Brief story: I was diagnosed Jan. 2006 with breast-to-bone cancer at 46 y.o.  My doctor TOTALLY missed my symptoms: tired & sweating. Said I was anxious and sent me to a neuro doc. I also missed my first annual breast exam that year due to father's death. Discovered lump in breast and poof: stage IV. Horrible things ensued: biopsy w/o numbing area (extremely PAINFUL!) and complained about it w/ no regard to my feelings; oncologist, surgeon, radiation all lined up for me in ONE day! I was exhausted. I felt \"herderd\" through the entire time. This is how they told me that I had stage IV breast to bone cancer: \"the cow's outta the barn now.\" I didn't even understand what it meant. I had to ask. Of course the next part I'm sure you all understand: disbelief, despair, disassociation. After I came down to earth/spirit, I got 3 other opinions and surrounded myself with faith, family, friends - what a year. I've learned so much but still need help and that's why I'm here to ask you all. To recap my treatment first: mastectomy of 1 breast as the tumor was too big to treat with chemo; chemo next (A/C/Taxol), radiation to very large area of breast, chest, under arm, back, rib area. I now have zometa drips every 3 months along with zolodex shots (hormone blocker) along with a daily femara pill. When I ended up at my current oncologist, she gave me hope and said the cancer that was originally diagnosed in my left femur (through a petscan) was what arthritis but, that the one in my rib was definately cancer.  I just recently got a bone scan and now she's saying there's a \"hot spot\" in my left femur and the rib is probably arthritis.    Here are my questions: 1) I'm starting to see that I'm getting the run around. The diagnosis of cancer to arthritis, arthritis to cancer is constantly being juggled. I asked her, \"Do I have bone mets OR NOT?\" and her reply was, \"we all live with uncertainty.\"  I felt so CONFUSED sitting there but my intuition told me otherwise. I said, \"how can I be sure I have or do NOT have cancer in my bones?\" and she said, \"well, you could have a bone biopsy but I don't recommend it as it's very painful\" We just live with uncertainty. have you had a similar experience. What can anyone share with me that's been there. I suspect that I do have bone mets in my rib and femur based on pet, ct, x'rays, etc. 2) Why aren't they giving me my tumor markers or why is it always a hassle to get them?  I'm told, \"your CAs are great\" ---but when I learned 4 or so months ago that I could ask the oncology nurse for a copy (and a graph which is awesome for me, the visual learner), I found that my CEAs were constantly going up and my doctor and her nurse never told me that! I'm mad! Worse, the U. where I go switched from CEAs to some other test so I have no idea what the #s represent. If I don't ask in the \"EXACT WORDING,\" they ignore me. Then I get depressed, frustrated, and start isolating and giving up. That's why I'm asking you for help in understanding these graphs and/or to give me wording that will help me communicate better. 3) I have been having pain in my left hip area for 6 months or so and have consistently reported this pain to my oncologist and the nurse and the infusion nurses. I'm told, \"it's probably arthritis.\" I've told them I don't respond to anti-inflammatories and I can barely move my leg at night, then it moved up earlier and earlier in the day and I wasn't able to get up off a chair without help or pushing from my arms or other leg. Terrible! Then I went to the ER with the most severe pain in my knee and they did an x'ray, said to go home and ice it as it was a strain. I did that and 4 hours later I get a phone call from the ER doc (a different one) who said that the radiologist found a 'density' that should be followed up with by my oncologist and recommended a bone scan. I was shocked. I asked my oncologist's nurse the next day for a bone scan (which, by the way, would never give me when I asked for one) but now seemed fine with it. She said that the ER report said it was a 'foreign substance floating around' and I about fell over. Then when I told her they never told me that, she started backing away and saying things like \"well, I don't actually have the exact report in front of me. I decided, \"that's it!\" and went to an orthopedic surgeon (outside of this system) and he said, after another x'ray that he was very surprised they'd be giving me vicadin because it's brasitus (sp) and gave me a shot of cortisone. I felt the best I've felt in a LONG time - like 6 months! I did go through with the bone scan and that's when I found out the left femur showed a \"hot spot.\" WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??? Again, anyone have any suggestions on the crazy nightmare I'm going through?  To be sincere: I just want to know what others of you out there have experienced to shed light on what is happening to me. I'd like to know now instead of after the fact. To look back and think, \"why didn't I ask for help.\" will make me worse than I am now. I want honesty and believe in the huge impact of \"strength through experience and sharing.\" So, with that in mind: I welcome your experience, strength and hope and suggestions for terminology that I can understand better, what you think I can expect in the future - honestly! CEA and CA counts - what are they telling me? What should I be concerned about. And finally, what to do with a doctor that I believe is ignoring me.  I have so much more to share and ask but that's enough for now. Thanks so much for this forum and also for the great posts and answers I've read. Very helpful!",
