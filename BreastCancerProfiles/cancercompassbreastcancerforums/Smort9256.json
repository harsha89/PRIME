      "Content": "I'm so sorry you have to face this double whammy.This happened to me last year. My husband returned from the UK (we live in New Zealand) for the operation but then left me again and returned to his lover. It is devastating - especially after 35 years together, but right now your health is the most important thing to concentrate on. you deserve to treat yourself well, be selfish, try not to concern yourself with him. Surround yourself with the most supportive, positive people you can find. Go out and have fun - live life to the full every day. If it's becoming too much of a strain then see your doctor or a counsellor. Whatever happens in the future with your husband, you deserve the best. This is no time to short-change yourself. I wish you all the very best and I hope your husband comes to his senses.",

      "Content": "Hi sorry you've had this pain. I had 'cording' after my op but my surgeon was brilliant. He knew exactly what it was and massaged it away. When I say 'massage' - it was quite brutal and hurt like hell - but boy did it work! I could feel and hear the 'cords' snap. Afterwards I could move my arm easily and I've never had anymore problems. Apparently it's common - that's why it's so important to do the stretching exercises after surgery, no matter how painful they are.",

I have recently started weight lifting as part of my 'fitter me' lifestyle but am worried that it might cause my arm to swell. I have not had any problems with my arm so far - but should I wear a compression sleeve 'just in case' or is this unnecessary?",

Not much on the net about treatment or long-term prognosis so feeling very alone and anxious. Been suggested that I have chemo but I can't find anything that supports that with this type of cancer. Any ideas? sue",

Oh sweetie this is unlikely to be anything really nasty but it's obviously scaring you. For your own peace of mind, go and see a doctor. It could be something as simple as a blocked milk duct or a slight infection, or mum could be right and it's just the breast changing as you grow up. It's very common for young people to get worried when their body starts to change in ways they didn't expect. You have been very sensible in checking with your mum, but if you are still worried - it's worth seeing someone who can set your mind at rest or give you any treatment. Perhaps your school has a clinic? Seeing your school counsellor may also help you as you seem very fearful about your health. I wonder whether someone has been ill in your family? You will feel better when you take control of your 'problem' and talk to someone. I wish you all the best for a long and happy life! sue :)",
