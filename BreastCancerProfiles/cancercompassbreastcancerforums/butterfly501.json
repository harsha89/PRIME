If your daughter is 61 you must be ~80?  You sure have a lot of energy to devote to your daughter's health matters at your own advanced age.  Not to mention; computer saavy. Kudos to you!",

People lie about stuff all the time, especially on any FREE message board. I feel sorry for you if you feel that is insensitive.

      "Content": "LOL, you have received the craziest responses! There are certainly a lot of spam bots out there! Who cares if she's lying.  Like someone else said, don't play into it.  Either you're lying or she's lying....so take it from there.  People DO lie about having cancer all the time.  I'm sure you have read about that woman that faked a 2+ year cancer journey; online. People lie about crazy stuff; even cancer. If you don't feel like you believe her, then don't. As you stated; she looks fine for having gone through 3 rounds of chemo in a few weeks.",
