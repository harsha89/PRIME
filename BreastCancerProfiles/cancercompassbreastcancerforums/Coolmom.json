    "Content": "Beware if ;you have taken Zometa or any bissphonates.  I took Zometa for about 6 months and developed small necrosis of the jaw.  Although the drug was stopped, I cannot have anything done to remove a root canal or anything that would normally require removal of a tooth.  The danger is that the area w/not heal.  I've seen 2 oral surgeons and am told DEFINITELY NOT!  During this time I had the top of a tooth w/a crown and root canal come off.  Now I have a blank spot in my mouth where the crown was.  Periodically, it gets infected which means and antibiotic, but I've tried for over a year to get it taken out w/no luck.  Since the Zometa was stopped, I have developed mets to spine, hip and leg bones.  I had radiation and am now free of pain.  Good Luck!  Doris",
