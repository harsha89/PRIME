    "Content": "Hi ............. I know how you feel from experience.  I received the same phone call and was on edge until I was able to repeat the mammogram.  It turned out to be ok, however, the doctor told me that the new digital mammograms are so new that the Radiologist reading them are still learning and on the side of caution, they are repeating a lot of mammograms.........especially if they are reviewing an old mammo X-Ray to a new digital mammo.  I do hope this helps.",
