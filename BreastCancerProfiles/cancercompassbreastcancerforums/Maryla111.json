      "Content": "I have the same side effects. Are you still on Femara? I am switching ti Aromasin; however, so far I have been off Femara nearly two months and I still have the side effects. I will start Aromasin next week. It is supposed to have fewer side effects, though they may be the same. So far, nothing helps much with the exception of a hot pad on my low back. I take it with me nearly everywhere.Maryla",

I am in touch with a few women who have the same problem - one said the pain started to get better after five months. Median time is a month and a half (not that is is statistically significant...). Let me know if you want to talk. Maryla",
