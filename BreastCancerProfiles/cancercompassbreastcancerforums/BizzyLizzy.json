    "Content": "Hi everyone! I had a portacath put in on August 6. I've been having problems with it ever since it was put in. My question is, has anyone ever have your port flushed & as soon as the normal saline was going in, your chest where the port is burned like CRAZY & you're left with a bruise over the port? As soon as I started pushing the normal saline, it started burning immediately. By the time the syringe-full of normal saline was pushed in, the area over the port started to swell & get puffy & today there's a light colored bruise. Anyone else ever have this happen, seen this before or know how/why this happened? I go Tuesday for a portogram to make sure nothing's wrong & it's still in the right position Thanks!",
