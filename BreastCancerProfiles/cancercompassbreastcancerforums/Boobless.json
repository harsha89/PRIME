    "Content": "I had a double two years and 4 months ago.  They got all the cancer.  I still have burning and pain under the implants and under my arm.  I also have a pain in the joint of my rib cage right under the middle side of my chest that makes me feel bad.  The doctor said its nerves hurting and inflammation in the rib cage.  He said that  I should massage them to keep the scar tissue from building up and they also recommend I have physical therapy for that too.  Does anybody out there have these problems?  I hate these implants. They feel like they are sweating my rib cage and my muscles clamp down on them and you can feel them against the ribs.  One of mine is also moving too far to the left under the arm side and looks flat.  Anyone got any same problems?",
