    "Content": "I had lumpectomy and 21 radiation treatments in 2015. A couple of months ago, I moved suddenly to catch something and felt the cartilage tear near the sternum, right in the radiation area. I was in such intense pain that there were two trips to the hospital, over the next weeks, for a suspected heart attack. It wasn't the heart. I started checking on costochondritis to see what to do for the pain and how to cure it. I was sent for a mammogram and ultrasound. It isn't cancer. I think the rib cartiladge was damaged by the radiation, as the breast tissue was. The breast is just starting to soften up again but there is low blood flow to the rib cartilage. If radiation is the cause, and my oncologist thinks it might be, this will be stiff and easily damaged for a long time. I'm taking calcium orotate to help the rib bones and glucosamine and chondroitin for the cartilage. I'm also eating gelatine. After 7 weeks, the unbearable pain is subsiding. Since everyone was more concerned with ruling out cancer and heart attack, I wasn't sent for an MRI to check on the state of the cartilage. So I'm working on my best guess with the reason and the treatment. I'm concerned this weakness in the cartilage could lead to further damage and inflammation in the future, so I'm trying to build my bones and cartilage in strength, with the supplements I'm taking. If it does happen again, I think we'll skip the heart and cancer tests and go straight to an MRI, steroid injections, etc, as I would have for a sporting injury. I refused chemo. I was intolerant, possibly even allergic to two types of aromatase inhibiters. I plan to try Tamoxifen when the pain goes away. I'm Australian. Australian doctors are not trying to hide side effects. These are different for different bodies. Australian doctors and drug companies are not trying to make money out of following certain treatments. That has been suggested of Americans on this thread. I don't think it's true though. I think they are doing the very best they can to save our lives. In Australia, all the cancer treatments are free and the government paid me $600 in costs for driving my car from a country area, to a city hospital for treatment. They are not trying to make money off us or hide things. It's a case of using the best medical science has at the time.",
