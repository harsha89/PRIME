    "Content": "Don't be scared but make sure you consult a reliable person to guide you through this.  Perhaps, a mother of a close friend if you feel too awkward talking to dad about it.  If that doesn't work, ask your friend to discuss with her mom and contact someone who can relieve you of this worry.  Since breast cancer runs in your family, it's important you stay on top of this.",
