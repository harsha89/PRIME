Thanks. The insertion was done with local medications and also thru IV (I basically slept thru it) and took about 15-20 min. I had no trouble driving but the twice a day trips got old. I felt fine, but didn't like having to wash my hair in the sink for the duration since you CANNOT get the site wet.",
