      "Content": "May 17, 2007,  One of two dates I will never forget--Diagnosis.  Dec. 17, 2007,--Right side Mastectomy.  I was 39 when Cancer stole my breast and forever altered my life.   It's almost been a year and I want to know when I start getting on with my life?   When do I wake and not think about what Cancer has done to me?   How can I not think about it,  I am reminded in the mirror every morning.  To make things worse I have to go in for more surgery.  I elected to have reconstruction done at the time of the Mastectomy.  It was a very, very good reconstruction!  I was satisfied.  Some how I have managed to tear appart my Latisimus muscle from my Pectoral muscle.  This now leaves my implant floating around.  Additionally my under arm is swelling up.  I so want to be happy and move on but I am angry and sad!!!!  I am also scared.  My father is the only person who is alive on his side of the family.  They all died of Cancer.  I know I am destined to have Cancer again.   Any advice on how to move on?",
