    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I am new here too-- I have been on arimidex for 2 1/2 years now and up to now the side effects have been minimal- but I seem to be having more joint and really bad bone pain at times, feeling like I never get enough sleep, some dizziness along with a dry cough- I was researching to see if the side effects of the arimidex are cumulative, like the chemo treaments were-- when I found this site- My MO was going to change me to something else but like another poster I have read that arimidex gets reallyu good results so am detemined to stay with it...so far anyway-",
