    "Content": "Hi,  I am a breast cancer survivor - YEAH!  However, I have trouble with lymph drainage in my arm.  I have tried massage and have worn a compression sleeve which made my arm break out in a rash. My arm is swollen, sometimes very hot, starting to get numbness in my hand and arm - and aches most of the time. Does anyone have any suggestions??  Is there any new treatment for draining the lymph fluid? Thanks everyone!",
