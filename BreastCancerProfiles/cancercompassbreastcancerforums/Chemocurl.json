      "Content": "Oct05 I had a lumpectomy & sentinal node biopsy. I was told they removed 3 nodes for testing with no signs of cancer. I went through chemo & radiation. I haven't had any arm swelling. Under my arm and my breast swell. My doctor told me it was a normal healing process. My breasts were not symetrical before surgery so I thought removal of the tumor area would balance things. With the swelling, my cancer breast is larger. Since my 6 mth checkup, I've had my first mammogram following the diagnosis. And I thought the worst was over after chemo! I finally understand the 'pancake' jokes I used to read about! My mammograms never hurt like that before. My cancer was at my chest wall so I know they had to get a good scan of the tumor area. but back to my original reason for putting a message out...... Has anyone had any experience with swelling of the surgery area and under arm node area? What can I do to stop or reduce the swelling? Chemocurl",

      "Content": "Jonip: I have hormone responsive breast cancer (stage 1). My surgery was Oct05, chemo & radiation. I began arimidex April06. I have to do alot of standing on my job. When I started back to work fulltime, I looked like a 90-yr old moving around. I was fine walking for short periods. After sitting down, getting out of the chair was difficult to say the least. I took some physical theraphy which helped a great deal. There is so much info out there, I'm never sure if what I've decided to do the right wasy to go. I've decided that taking the arimidex is a necessary evil. Hormones are in the foods we eat or own bodies produce hormones. Arimidex is like a 1st defense against oestrogen produced in the breast. If I'm not mistaken, it blocks the development of the hormone in your system. I am also taking Wellbutrin XL for the hot flashes & mood swings. The hot flashes are fewer especially at night. I found huge relief with a product called \"Chillo pillow\". It works between your pillow case & pillow. It provides cool relief at the base of your neck and seems to absorb the heat. I just found this message board and already have it on 'my favorites' list. Thank each and everyone that replies. We are sisters in this daily fight! Chemocurl",
