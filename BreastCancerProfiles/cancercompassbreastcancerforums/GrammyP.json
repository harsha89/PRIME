    "Content": "I took letrozole for the first 1 1/2 years after my double mastectomy.  Side effects had me using a walker for several weeks (stress fracture in left knee & joint aches), then my oncologist changed my meds to aromisin, that worked quite well for almost another 1 1/2 years.  Am now in the same situation so am taking a 3 week break from aromisin...What to do next?  Thinking I'll just stop any of the meds!  Has anyone done so?",
