    "Content": "I had a mastectomy four months ago.  Although I have lots of sore muscles and twinges of pain, I don't have that much discomfort.  My only concern is in my shoulder.  I do have the numbness on the underside of my arm.  I do everything I did before the surgery but there is a locking pain in my shoulder when I am lying down or even reclining in a chair and try to relax that arm over my head.  I am used to sleeping in that position so it is very noticeable to me.  I can mow the yard, move furniture, take care of grandbabies with no pain.  I keep thinking this may just be a shoulder injury since I did have to have spurs removed from the other shoulder eight years ago.  Do others of you find this isolated shoulder situation from the mastectomy?",
