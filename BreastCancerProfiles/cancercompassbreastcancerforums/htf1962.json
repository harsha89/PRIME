    "Content": "I had chemo and radiation for Stage 2b in Dec 2010- june 2011. I have been struggling with pain issues, which I have seen here can be from taking Arimidex. I have also had total chemo brain ever since treatment. I think sometimes the pain make me feel fatigued, and then it seems harder to think! I was even sent by my doctor for testing to see if the memory issues were related to alzheimers. The results showed Adult ADD, but when I told my breast surgeon she said that was a bunch of s***, that my body has been through so much that it is due to that. My oncologist acts like I shouldn't be having any trouble at all. I even stopped working for a time, because I felt embarrassed by all my memory issues/forgetfulness. It didn't help that one or two coworkers  loved pointing out my mistakes. I am now working again, and feel a little bit 'spacey' but on this new job the people I work with are nicer in general. I feel like I am a little bit better because my anxiety level is lower.",
