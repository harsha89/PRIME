    "Content": "I am 30 days away from being a 9 year survivor. I was stage 1, had a tram flap procedure done as well 6 months of precaution chemo, was on tamoxfin for 5 years, never had any side effects.  I have been on femara for a year and a half and have the hair loss, never even had hair loss with my chemo, with the femara is has thinned tremedously and I have a terrible time trying to keep it healthy.  Also and the body aches, exclusively in my legs, incredible aching during the night, mainly in my calves, not all the time.  I would like to know how long I need to stay on the femara, I am 48 years old post menapausal. Has anyone else just stopped taking it or had a doctor say it would be ok to discontinue?                            thanks, jl",
