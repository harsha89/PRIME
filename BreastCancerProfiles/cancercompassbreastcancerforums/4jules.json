The vaginal dryness/atrophy is a big one but fatigue and arthritis like symptoms in my hands is very troubling too.

No applicator needed,  Just useclean hands, put a small amount on your fingertips, and apply thisointment around the urethra and in the vagina. Do this at least oncedaily for the first 7 - 10 days, then thereafter as needed. Mydr approves of this self-treatment, and my research has revealed nocontra-indications.  Not nearly enough phytoestrogen in this little bitof flax oil to cause problems with cancer, and many naturopathicspecialists are recommending flax oil even in the treatment ofestrogen-positive breast cancer.   And the best part - it really works well, and is very inexpensive.Iuse Barleans flax oil -  organic and highquality - I get it at the local health food store.  It needs to berefrigerated or it will go rancid - don't buy it from a seller who doesn't refrigerate it.  Make sure to shake it up wellbefore measuring your 1/2 tsp out.  You DO NOT need to refrigerate theointment after you make it, as long as you keep it in a clean, tightly sealed containeraway from heat and light.  (I recommend you don't refrigerate - I tried that - it just got very runny and didn't work as well.)  Make sure toalways use clean hands when mixing and applying, so that you don't contaminate theremaining ointment. If you still have any of your batch left after 10 -12 days,  discard it, clean the container with hot soapy water andrinse well, and make a new batch.(Always clean the container well before making a new batch.) I recommend that you stilluse a lubricant for intimacy - menopausal tissue (chemically induced ornot) - just doesn't lubricate as well as it used to, regardless of how well replenished it is.Also, if youare using prophylactics for birth control , probably best to allow timefor the ointment to fully absorb before intimacy, because vaseline canweaken latex.  If you are interested in complementary therapy to lessen the other side effects of the femara, let me know, and I'll send you some references.Sincerely, Tre -----end quote------",
