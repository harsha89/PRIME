    "Content": "Sweetheart, re-read these wonderful messages from people who care about you. The wisdom they are sharing will help you so much. There is not much I can add to these loving gifts of caring shared here, except that God is there for you, and will walk you through all of your fears and challanges. I too lost my mom  to cancer, but I was much older than you are. I remember how precious our time was together in those last months. So be as brave as you can, be with her, talk, cry, love and laugh. You will be happy you did. Remember love (God) is with you always and guiding you every moment. I will keep you in my prayers dear one.  ",
