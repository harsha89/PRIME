    "Content": "I am a one year breast cancer survivor.  I had NO symptoms.  I had NO family history.  I was a year and a half overdue for my mammongram.  I had a chest injury resulting in a large cyst in my right breast.  Getting a mammogram to be sure, they found the cancer in my left breast. I was 41. Luckily it was caught early and I had a lumpectomy and radiation. Today I'm doing well.  I go for my check ups when I'm supposed to.  I would recommend seeing a breast surgeon for a second opinion even if it's just for your own peace of mind.  My doctor recently told me, it never hurts to ask.  Bravo on being conscious of your health and not ignoring things.  ",
