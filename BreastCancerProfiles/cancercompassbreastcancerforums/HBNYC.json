    "Content": "Hello Everyone! I had a bilateral mastectomy in 2006 followed by immediate reconstruction with silicone implants. While I have not experienced the degree of pain you seem to be describing, I have had some pain and I can just say that for myself and probably for most people, the implants feel more and more comfortable as time goes by and the pain pretty much goes away in time. Everyone once in a blue moon I get some strange twinge, but nothing to complain about. I have another issue. I have found it very difficult to find pretty fashion bras that fit with my new body. I am a clothing designer and i have decided to design a new line of bras and lingerie that address reconstruction issues. I want to identify and address the top five issues most women have if I can so I developed an on-line Post-Reconstruction Bra Survey. If anyone else is looking for better bra options, I encourage you to take the survey and let me know what your issues and requirements are so I can design with you in mind as well. Here's the link: http://tinyurl.com/bra-survey Be well everyone! I hope all the pains goes away soon!",
