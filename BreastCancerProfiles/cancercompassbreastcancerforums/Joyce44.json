      "Content": "I had a mastectomy in May, 2003. 2005 found another lump in front of armpit, same side. Cancer, but only could be detected by the sonagram. Mammogram didn't show anything at all. Now have in other side & in lymph nodes. I would ask for a PET-CT scan, two in one scan. This shows ALL hot spots they consider cancer. This is just to be sure. Luck & good wishes, Joyce",
