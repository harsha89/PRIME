    "Content": "I just went in yesterday for another mammogram and sonogram. I feel a very painful lump about the size of a half of a Ping pong ball and another smaller lump near it. The techs said they could feel it but not see anything. If we can all feel something, then I'm not crazy and there's something there that doesn't belong! 2 years ago I went through the same thing. I went in with a surgeon for a third opinion and he said it was normal breast tissue. Am I crazy in thinking normal breast tissue should not feel like a large and now a small lump and hurt? I feel like I'm a hypochondriac, but it hurts and it's not normal whatever it is. My doctor should be calling me on Monday with the results after the images are read by a radiologist. I'm not sure what to do if the come back negative, knowing that there's something there. :(",
