      "Content": "Thank you for sharing your story.  My mom is having a double mastectomy in two weeks.  she was diagnosed with cancer in the milk ducts and was told and has read that that type of breast cancer is agressive and often returns in 5-10 years so she made the choice to live breastless.  She really rather not do the reconstruction either.  She's still a young woman as well only 60 and was confirmed a month after my wedding.  I think she knew before the wedding and in her mind she didnt want to \"ruin\" anything.  I wish she had gone then and not waited a month.  Her health will always be more important than anything and my husband feels the same way.  We both have a very strong spiritual connection with God and eachother. My grandmother left us about 4 years ago djue to mestasis of the liver from breast cancer thatshe survived 30 years before.  My mom has been having dreams of my grandmother telling her shes been waiting for her.  So that is making her more on edge.  She is a so spiritual that what she said after finding out was shocking and calming all at the same time \"Well either way I win, whether its being here on earth with my family or going to be with God and my mom\"  On the flip side I know shes scared as I am.  I remember the sound of her voice when she called me on that friday.  She's like I cant believe this is happening.  It doesnt feel like ts happening to me.  I feel so out of body.  Is there any advice you can give from your experience of what things helped you so i can maybe share with her?  Anything that you would suggest for caregivers also?",
