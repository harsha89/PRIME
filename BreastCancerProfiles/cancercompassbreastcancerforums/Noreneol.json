      "Content": "...I have been having pain,tenderness,and soreness in my breast since last year. I went to the doctor and they wrote on the report it is \"a palpable abnormality.\" In other words,there is something growing there. They thought it was a cyst,as I have had fibrocystic disease a few years back. So they send me for a mammo & said there was nothing there! Fine. But now,this year,the pain is still there,in and around the breast,outside quadrant and near the nipple. Also it hurts when I lie on it,pain in my underarm too that was horrible a couple times. A few days before my period,I saw some stuff coming out of that breast,clear fluid,then it turned white. I can squeeze it out & it also comes out by itself. As a matter of fact,for a long time I've had sudden spotting from that breast,very briefly,but this came out more this time. I have NEVER had any kind of nipple discharge in my life,only when I had milk in the breasts for the kids. I'm hoping it was cyclical,but,as I said,this is the 1st time I EVER had anything like this. Nipple also looks kinda strange,and breast feels kinda rough,like the pores in it are enlarged. What do you guys make of this? Thank you, N.Y.",

And I never had pain like this before.I am going to see a gynecologist...Also,a couple years ago when this started,that breast was itching & was kinda red.The doctor offered to give me Tamoxifen.I said,\"For what? I don't have IBC,do I?\" He didn't answer,yet refused to do a biopsy. There's a 1st time for everything,I suppose. HUGZ N.",
