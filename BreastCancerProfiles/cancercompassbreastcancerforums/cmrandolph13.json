      "Content": "Nicole, I'm sorry to hear about your mother. I know it's difficult to go through something like this.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and went to Cancer Treatment Centers of America for treatment. They are AMAZING. If anyone can help your mom, they can. Please call them. The commericals don't even begin to show how wonderful they are. My fiancee and I drive 7 hours from Roanoke to Philadelphia for every appointment. I refuse to be treated by my local medical system because they diagnosed me with the wrong kind of cancer at the beginning and I just don't trust them anymore. CTCA is my refuge. I had my surgery there, and did six rounds of chemo, and continue to go back for my check-ups every three months. It is well worth the time and effort to go there. Not only do they offer top-notch care, but the other patients there serve as a huge support group. We are all in this together. It is a bond that cannot be explained. I wish you and your mother well. My prayers will be with you both!",

      "Content": "Wow! Your story sounds very much like mine! I am 44. Was dx with breast cancer a year ago. Had bilateral mastectomy and chemo (taxotere and cytoxan). My last treatment was November 26th and by January instead of feeling better I felt like I had been hit by a truck. I went back to work January 2nd, but have struggled to get through the days. In March was dx with fibromyalgia. I too used to bike 15 -30 miles a week, and went to the gym regularly but now I can barely get home at the end of the day. I have gained 30 pounds in the past year and have just joined Weight Watchers to try to lose it. The chemo put me into menopause immediately and I feel like some of my discomfort is from that, but the joint/muscle pains and bone grinding exhaustion must be the fibromyalgia. I try to power through it, but it it SO hard. I feel helpless, useless, and frustrated. If nothing else, I hope you know that you have a sister out here suffering with you! Best of luck to you, I hope you find relief soon.",

      "Content": "Kathy48 - you might just be surprised at how you feel when you lose your hair. I wasn't scared to lose my hair, but it sure wasn't something i looked forward to either. However, once it was all gone it was such a LIBERATING feeling. I never felt so strong or powerful or confident. It was pretty incredible. I even got a pink ribbon tattoo on the side of my head! And like someone else posted, it sure was nice to not have to worry about washing/drying/styling/coloring/cutting my hair during chemo. I hardly had energy to go to the bathroom, let alone do my hair! Embrace yourself girl, you're going through something really difficult. It will transform you in ways you never imagined. I wouldn't wish cancer on my worst enemy, but it has been the most amazing blessing in my life. If you go into it with the right attitude it will be a blessing for you too. You will meet some amazing people, you will have your priorities aligned for you, you will learn the depth and breadth of your own strength, you will receive love and compassion from people you never expected, and you will find a sisterhood, and unspoken, unbreakable bond with women you would never have imagined. Good luck sister... you'll be just fine!",
