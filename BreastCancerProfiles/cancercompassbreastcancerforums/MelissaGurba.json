    "Content": "Have you tried Claritin? I do not know if this will help with the rash but the Neulasta shot is a histamine and claritin is a histamine blocker. They give this to me right before they give me the Neulasta shot and they advised me to take one a day over a 4 to 5 day period but it is mainly for bone pain the claritin oddly enough relieves 90% of the bone pain. I would give it a shot if I were you to see if this might help. I would definitely tell your oncologist about the rash because it could be an allergic reaction from either the chemo or the Neulasta shot.",
