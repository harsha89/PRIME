    "Content": "I found out I have breast cancer a few months ago.  I had a mastectomy and my surgeon only used one plastic surgeon, so I went with her.  My consultation with her was spent talking about implant and size.   I woke up after surgery to find that I had 5 positive nodes, and she had put in a tissue expander.  The name had come up, but we didn't really discuss much about the expander.  Her nurse even said to me the day before surgery \"be thankful you're getting an implant and not an expander, those really hurt\".    Well, she was right they do indeed hurt.  She filled it with 300 cc the day of implantation, which I liked because of the illusion it gave with a v-neck shirt.     Two weeks after my surgery my oncologist ordered a petscan and an MRI of my brain.   I start to go into the tunnel and feel a sharp pain, and scream.  The tech was very nice and suddenly asked if I had a tissue expander.  As soon as she said it I said yes and got off of the table.  She said \"you can't have an MRI with a tissue expander\".  OMG, NO ONE told me there was a rare earth magnet in the tissue expander!   My husband is a doctor and he had no idea.   The oncologist didn't know, the surgeon didn't know, and the imaging facility didn't have it listed on the very long questionare where they list a page full of things like: shrapnel, implants, or anything metal.  I've heard from others that you are supposed to be given a card telling you about the device and the magnet and to avoid having an MRI.    When my husband approached her afterwards, he told her what had happened and her first response was \"it was in the consent\".  Meanwhile she NEVER mentioned it to either of us at all.   The oncologist who ordered the MRI showed concern and was upset by the whole thing, so I'm still seeing him.  The imaging facility was the only one in town who didn't have tissue expander on their pre-MRI list.  Of course they do now, so I'm fine with them too.  It's her attitude and lack of any responsibility that makes me so mad.   The MRI caused a HUGE hematoma and lots of pain.  The swelling is finally gone (I'm 6 weeks out of surgery), but there is obviously a leak because the fullness that was there before is gone and it's flat.  The incision is terrible and the top ends way too high, I'm so disappointed.   I've just started chemo so there is no resoloution for who knows how long??  I have radiation after the chemo and should be done by Christmas I think.   I'm now going to have to have another surgery to replace this tissue expander, and that makes me so angry.  I can't even sleep, suddenly I'm filled with rage.   I'm receiving bills from her and there is no way in hell I'm paying them.  I'm going to write her a letter and let her know how upset I am with her and she better eat the fees.  I'm going to another plastic surgeon next week, but obviously you can't add saline if there's a puncture in it.  Did anyone else have anything like this happen?  If you have a tissue expander did your plastic surgeon tell you there was a metal inside?  Did you get a card to carry in your wallet that says what kind and all of the specifics?   I'm just beside myself and I know I need to be in a better mental place while going through chemo.  UGHHHHH.   Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks,",
