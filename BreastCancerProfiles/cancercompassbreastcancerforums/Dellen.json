    "Content": "Hi NeeNee,   I, too, have just been diagnosed with metastases to 2 vertebra and a rib.  9 years ago I had DCIS, a mastectomy, and no chemo or radiation.  The surgeon said it was \"stage 0\"  I was on tamoxifen for 5 months, then had a TIA, (mini stroke) so was taken off it.  I also have a family I love, and would love to keep up with your experiences.   Dellen",
