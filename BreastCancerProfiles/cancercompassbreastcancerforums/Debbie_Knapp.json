      "Content": "Thanks Bonnie, what type chemo medication did you have? My doctor will be giving me Doxil, and my understanding is the side affects are blistering and peeling of the skin on the hands and feet. Also can cause heart promblems, so I am not sure if I want to use the Doxil.  When I had my lympectomy the doctor took 13 lymp nodes also all with cancer. I have been having physical therapy twice a week, Paige my therapist wraps my right arm and hand in bandages. I can wear them for about 6 hours not much longer because of the pain and nausa,  then I take them off. I can handle just about almost any pain, but being sick to my stomach and not enjoying my life with my husband and daughter. Thanks for listing. Debbie",

      "Content": "I was just diagnoised with Stage 4 breast cancer (11/21/2008).  I am a 56 year old female, I did not have any symptoms of any type. I had my first mommograham in August of 08. I never felt a lump, so I did not see any use in having a mommograham. It has been a whirlwind sence 10/07/08 that is when I had my biopsy, and it seems that it has been down hill for me. I had to leave my job because I could not concentrate, or focus. I love my work.  Anyone that has been treated with DOXIL please e-mail me. I am not sure if I really want to use this chemical. I have read about all the side affects. Any information would be helpful. I have a wonderful husband and a beautiful daughter and wonderful family like everyone else to live for.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, As I told said from the beginning I have Stage 4 breast cancer, was told I have 2-3 years to live with Chemotherapy and months to live without Chemotherapy.  I do not know what my feelings are, I do not beleive that their is any hope for me. I do not know why I am feeling this way. I do not believe that I have cancer.  Everyone tells me that their is Hope, I do not feel sick, Maybe it is because it has not dawned on me that I do have cancer. I really have not cryed, or put much into this. I wish I knew why I feel this way. When my husband starts to talk about this cancer, I want to just go away and not put him or my daughter (13 yrs old) through all this.Part of me feels that the doctors made all this up just to get my insurance money and take the money I do not have to pay for all of this treatment. On 12/30/08 I had my first chemotherapy with Doxil, the nurse gave me what the doctor ordered; Dicadron 20 mg, Doxil 77mg, then I had a severe reaction, my tongue swelled, my neck,face,ears turned red, it felt like my face was on fire! Severe pain down my spine,into my neck,arms, fingers and hands,toes,feet,all this only took 7 minutes to affect my body. Then she stop the Doxil for 30 mins.then  she gave me 10 mg  more of dicadron and 50 mg of Benadryl.It took 3 hours for my body to go through Hell, I have decided to not to have anymore chemo. I have been so sick from the chemotherapy that I do not want to go through it again. I missed the New Years with my husband and daughter. So  I am going to try alternative therapy. My husband and I have done extensive research on a  herb called Paw Paw and other herbs. Has anyone else felt like I do, I know that I will wake up and I was just having a bad dream. Thanks for listing, it is very hard to understand why I feel like I do. Debbie Golightly    ",
