      "Content": "Don't worry too much but go back and get retested.  I had my mammogram in April and then was called back.  Went back and they did a CT on my right breast and then I was told it was nothing to be concerned about.  I got a second opinion from a breast doctor and was told it was nothing to worry about.  Apparently I had had the same problem in the past but this year they decided to do a CT scan.  The breast doctor did one in the office and said everything was fine just continue to get my yearly mammograms.  My younger sister is a 9 year breast cancer survivor so naturally I was worried.",

      "Content": "Personally I find that when someone says that an oncologist doesn't know and needs to do research offensive.  As far as herbs when my husband was undergoing chemo, he was told what to stop taking and he followed the doctor's advice.  No one knows what causes cancer regardless of the research done.  Cancer was never in my family at all until my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer then the flood gates opened.  Now I have lost an aunt (mother's sister) to cancer, our son has had a kidney removed and diagnosed with RCC cancer and now my husband with laryngeal cancer.  Up until then on both sides there were no cancers reported going generations back.  If herbs and natural remedies are so great, then why do people with cancer still die just like they do with chemo, radiation and surgery.  No one knows and no one knows the cure.  Something is always going to kill people regardless of the matter in which they die.",

      "Content": "Yes men can get breast cancer and it is on the rise.  Sorry you are tired of pink ribbons.  Guess we should just push it under the rug like they did before.  Maybe you should ask the women who have breast cancer or those that lost family members to breast cancer.  Cancer is a terrible disease and anything to draw awareness to any type of cancer is important.  Who cares if is pink ribbons, red ribbons, purple ribbons, etc.  Awareness is most important and for all those that think it can't happen to them or their loved ones are sadly mistaken.",
