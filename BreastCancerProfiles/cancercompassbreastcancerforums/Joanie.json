      "Content": "Hi Judy. Thanks for writing. I guess I wanted to know if there was anyone out there with my dx and what they did and how they are doing. I have heard from several different people tonight. We went to the onc today. The markers were elevated on 14 points 142 to 156. He felt that was not enough to jump to chemo now. The markers had been jumping 30 points every 30 days since Nov. So now I go back in April to see what is going on. If the level stabilizes or starts to decrease we will stay with what we are doing for awhile. I know eventually chemo will be in my future again but the longer we can put it off the better it is! I would like to hear about your CTCA visit if you have time and want to share your experience. I feel more uplifted today than I was earlier this week. It is nice to hear from courageous people like you. Good luck to you and God bless you.",

      "Content": "Hi Betty! I go to Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes. Michael Naughton is my oncologist. He is about 36 and a very kind, compassionite MD. My previous oncologist left St. Louis. He is in her group. I loved her - Joann Mortimer - she recommended him. Our markers are running neck and neck - I am 152 as of March. I am on femera. What is Arimidex? Where do you live? I live in Alton, Il. right across the river from St. Louis. I am 59 yrs old. I feel good - no real symptoms. I get tired but that could just be old age! Do you have an appointment yet? I go back to Dr. Naughton 4/3 at 3:30 pm. Please lets keep in touch. My husband has been wanting me to go to CTCA but I am satisfied with Barnes. I have not sought a second opinion. I was pleased with the care I received the last go round so I thought I would just stay with it. Thanks for the prayers and I will keep you in mine as well. Let me know how you are feeling. Take care.",
