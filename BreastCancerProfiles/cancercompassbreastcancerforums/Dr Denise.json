    "Content": "This is your life. You are in charge of your future. NEVER be afraid of offending your surgeon. If he is confident in his diagnosis, he will welcome a 2nd opinion and comfort for his patient. I am not feeling good about what you have written and how you have been intimidated into treatments without answers. Take charge of your health and see the NEW oncologist on the block!! Only good thoughts for you.",
