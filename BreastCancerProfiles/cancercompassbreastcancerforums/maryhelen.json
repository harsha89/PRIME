    "Content": "Hi Linda I cannot believe what I have read reguarding pain. I am a breast cancer survivor.  Diagnosed in September of 03.  I just finished my 5th year of Tamoxifin and was put on Aromasin.(I had stage 1 and no nodes were affected) I have had pain in my fingers especially when I first wake up and getting out of bed my feet dont want to bend at the ankles I am so stiff. And retaining water.  I went from a 5ft9in very thin person weighing aproximately 146-150 to very thick around the middle and topping out at 190lbs.  I have joined health clubs dieted and exercised. And nothing boy talk about frustrating Oh I forgot to mention I had a hysterectomy in 03 so I was thrown into menopause.I am on effexor to level out my emotions which seems to help but I got fet-up and stopped the Aromasin to see if I can loose the weight.  My Doc dont know yet I have to see him next month, but it is so hard to live with these changes I am only 43 years old and this new body of mine is driving me crazy I hate the way I look.  I know its much better than having the cancer but its still hard to live with.I am so glad I found this web site because i know you can relate. I do have fantastic emotional support.  But it does not compare to having someone who knows exactly what each other is going through. If anyone out there  can relate to my story or has any words of advise please write me back. I would love to here from you.  God Bless us All Maryhelen                          ",
