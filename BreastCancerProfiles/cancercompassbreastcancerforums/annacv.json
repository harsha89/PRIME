    "Content": "My mom was referred to MD Anderson for post-mastectomy treatment after her doctor found and removed a (rare) malignant Phyllodes tumor. She can have an appointment with either of two doctors who are supposed to be experienced with this kind of tumor but we have no idea how to find more information on the doctors in order to make a decision. There is nothing on MD Anderson's website that mentions either doctors experience with this kind of tumor. Do you know how to find reliable information on what doctors specialize in or patient reviews of doctors? We trust that she will be in good hands with either doctor but would love to find a little more about the doctors. Even patient reviews could make a difference. We can't find any in Angie's List. Any ideas you can offer would be appreciated.",
