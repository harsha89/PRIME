I am definitely going and just RSVP'd.  I am currently on Aromasin and need to continue for another 3 years but I can't imagine being in this much pain for another 3 years.  I'm checking out alternative methods of treatment and have read about Avemar recently on this message board so when I found this out, I thought I would send it out to anyone that might be interested.      Hi..I have been on Aromasin for 2 months and it makes me feel tired and sore in my back and knees all of the time and too hard to function sometimes.  I now have carpal syndrome now.  But I would love for you t post any info about AVAMAR.  Any news is appreciated and congrats for being a SURVIVOR. ",

      "Content": "Hi...I  also was on Arimidex and after 3 months, I seen my Doctor twice and called him endlessly.  I was having mental problems and couldnt focus at work, memory gone.  He put me on Aromasin, and the only thing so far is my knees and back still ache horribly and hard to move at all. But I think my hands are starting to go numb.  Time will tell.  I  dont think they tell us all the side effects, because they know we wouldnt take it. Some of us have different side effects on different medications.  So we have to keep trying to get the one for us.  I have decided that if the medicatons make me feel worse and I cant function, then I will take my chances and hope for the best.  Good luck and God Bess.....portfolio",
