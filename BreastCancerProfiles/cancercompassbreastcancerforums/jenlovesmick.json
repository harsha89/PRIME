    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy just under a fortnight ago and I am now waiting for radiotherapy.  No problems at all just a little underarm discomfort and I use a small cushion underarm at night.  I always wear back closing underwire bras as I have large breasts and I was advised to get sports bras which are pull-over-the head fitting or to take the wire out of a bra.  I took the wire out of several old tee shirt bras which turned out to be unnecessary as my lump was taken from the top of my breast.  The surgeon advised me to wear my usual bra for support as the underwire was not near the incisions.  I was jolly glad I hadn't spent a lot of money on sports bras as they don't have enough support for me and I wouldn't have worn them again.  Hope this advice helps and good luck with your surgery.",
