    "Content": "I finished chemotherepy last January (2005) for stage III breast cancer, involving one lymph node. Estrogen receptors were all positive. I have been on Tamoxofen for the last year and the only side effect I've had has been bloating and weight gain. During the summer months I needed to take a water pill as I swelled so bad i was in pain, during the winter I am doing okay. I have gained 30 lbs in the last year due in part to the tamoxofen and in part because after chemo I let myself enjoy some extra things in life. Am working on that myself now. My biggest concern about tamoxifen was that it was to be taken for 5 years and you don't dare get pregnant while on it. I am 37 and chose to have an IUD implanted. If you are estrogen receptor positive you need a blocker if there is any chance that the cancer has spread. As to tofu I avoid it. Susan",
