Deb Hi Deb, Don't hesitate to closely question your dr. about this current condition.  Sometimes something they see as routine does not appear that way to the patient.  I had a mastectomy so cannot speak directly to your first question but can tell you that I just started Arimidex about 1 1/2 wks ago.  I am more tired and a bit achey---typical side effects.  I will continue to take it because the statistics show that for me and my kind of cancer (invasive lobular, stage 3A with 16 nodes involved), it gives me a greater chance of being alive in 10 yrs.  From all I've read, it seems Arimidex affects different women in different ways.  Check out bcaction.org and their report on aromatase inhibitor side effects.  They've arranged the data according to the age of the respondents,the reported side effects, the perceived severity of the side effect, and noted other side effects that were reported by less than 1% of the women who responded to the study.  Kinda lets you know what to expect. Also there are 3 different kinds of aromatase inhibitors so if one gives you severe side effects you can try another.  My dr. said if side effects are severe for me I could stop for a month and then restart because usually the side effects are less severe after restarting. Keep in touch here.  There's tremendous support from everyone.  I hope everything goes well for you.    ",

Femara is an aromatase inhibitor drug (as are Arimidex and Aromasin), which basically means it prevents your body from producing estrogen.  Side effects seem to vary according to age and health status.  Some of the most common are weight gain, arthritis-like symptoms, joint and bone pain, and hot flashes.  Breast Cancer Action did a survey of women on aromatase inhibitors and listed their side effects and the severity of them according to the drug and age of the patient.  Check out their website to see the whole thing:  www.bcaction.org Hope this helps. ",

If cancer is found in the sentinel node biopsy they will then proceed to do the axillary dissection right then.  Radiation would come after pathology. I had chemo lst, then radiation. If she wants to know if it has spread to other organs, it's better to have a thermogram done. This picks up changes sooner than CT scans.  Generally you can find a chiropractor or a naturopathic doc who offers thermography.

Now I have developed some edema in the same breast. My doc also says we'll watch it. It's not uncomfortable yet, but will a sports bra keep it from getting worse? Does activity (raking, working out) make it better or worse? Thanks for being there. Hi Earthstar, Having lymphedema in my left arm & hand and somewhat in the shoulder, chest and left side after a left mastectomy and axillary dissection (24 nodes removed), I have a couple of suggestions.  My lymphedema started during chemo and wasn't properly taken care of initially (partly because the first therapist I saw wasn't good and partly because I was in denial so didn't go when I should have) which meant it progressed to stage 2.  I went through CDT (complete decongestive therapy) twice, both during and after radiation (radiation makes you swell).  I now wear a custom one piece sleeve/glove every day except to sleep and perform MLD (manual lymphatic drainage) every night.  My lymphedema is under control but took many months to get there.  All this is to serve as a heads up to you and anyone else with swelling. Suggestion 1:  Don't just \"watch\" it and don't assume your doctor knows everything about lymphedema.  Insist your dr. refer you to a lymphedema therapist----that would be a physical therapist trained in lymphedema therapy (preferably Vodder trained--that's the gold standard).  You can suggest to your dr. that it's for preventive therapy. That therapist will assess your edema, perform MLD on you, instruct you how to do it, and make any needed recommendations on proper garments for control.  If you treat lymphedema early (stage 1) it goes away and you then are informed about precautions to prevent recurrence. Suggestion 2:  If you prefer to \"watch\" it, then I'd say a sports bra (well-fitted, NOT tight!!!  Too tight will make it worse by cutting off drainage) could be helpful. Better you should be fitted by someone trained in fitting lymphedema garments----they can give you good recommendations about what works. Suggestion 3:  Activity does help control swelling.  The trick is not to overdo it because that can make it worse.  If you were an active person before cancer don't think you can immediately go back and do what you did at the same level---start at a low level for a short amount of time and see how you feel and what the effects are.  I would not resume playing tennis, paint a room, or do strenuous weight training until the swelling is resolved---particularly if the affected side is your dominant side. Suggestion 4:  Check out the National Lymphedema Network website---there is LOTS of helpful info there and a list of precautions. Good luck! ",

Actually it would also be good to write down all your questions ahead of time---that way you won't forget any.  The more info you can give to the dr. about what you're experiencing, the better able the dr. will be to respond.  Yes, it could all be connected to the pregnancy, meaning it's hormonal, but it'd be nice to hear it confirmed, right?  Good luck and God bless.",

I had infection and have a indentation in the side of my left breast along with the nipple pulled to the side. Has anyone ever had flap surgery (from the back muscle), and what were your results. How did the recovery go? Is there a wait period after radiation? Also I am having pain under my arm and along the bra line under the breat, has anyone ever had that before? Thanks in advance for you help. You might want to also look into DIEP and related microsurgeries.  Check out www.diepflap.com.  This type of surgery does not involve taking a muscle, just uses your own body tissue.  Remember that radiation keeps on affecting your body for quite a while.  If I were you I'd wait 6-12 months before another surgery to give yourself a chance to recupe.  Your body's just been through an awful lot of stress. IF you have some swelling where you're having pain you should be checked for lymphedema.  Swelling after radiation is normal but having radiation also increases your chances of lymphedema (as does the surgery).  The pain could also be caused by the muscles and fascia tightening up from radiation so be sure to stretch EVERY day at least once (I usually do it after my shower & before bed).  You will need to do this for the rest of your life to stay limber.  The radiation (I'm told by my lymphedema therapist) will keep on affecting you for up to 2-3 years.  There is now laser therapy connected to lymphedema treatment that also helps with a lot of the pains associated w/treatment.  I've had laser treatment to my mastectomy scar in addition to my lymphedema and it does help.  I also see a massage therapist every week and that has helped tremendously with the pain and restricted movement. Hope this helps.  Congratulations, you've made it through the hardest part! Give yourself time to rejuvenate---every day you will feel a little better and you'll be amazed what a difference a year, and then another will make when you look back.",

Thanks in advance for any info/advice.   It's good you are so diligent in your self-exams.  You mention you have dense breasts and I wonder, given your mention of family history, if you have ultrasounds in addition to mammograms.  Mammograms do not pick up all cancers, particularly in dense breasts!  I am proof of that.  I had invasive lobular carcinoma.  That kind of cancer grows along the lobules, in the shape of the lobule.  So before you freak yourself out, go see your doc and get it checked out.  If you haven't been having ultrasounds insist on it!  I wish you all the best. ",

I'm curious to know how it was determined that you aren't even perimenopausal, esp. since you've had night sweats.  I was diagnosed at age 52--stage 3 w/ 16 of 24 positive nodes, still had periods, and was told that chemo would almost definitely stop my periods, which it did by the 3rd session.  Remember that the chemo is wiping out the cancer--that'll help you get through it.  The term \"hormone therapy\" really should be \"anti-hormone therapy\" since the goal is to stop your body's production of estrogen.  So you will either be on Tamoxifen or one of the aromatase inhibitors for 5 years.  Do your homework and read up on these.  Start with Susan Love's Breast Book (latest edition)---she has lots of helpful info.  Also pepper your oncologist with these questions and see what she has to say.  Unless you are positive for BRCA I doubt your dr. would recommend a hysterectomy---why ask for more surgery if you really don't need it?  Good luck on your journey.  You can make it through the intense treatment, give yourself LOTS of time to heal (more than you think you'll need) and you'll be amazed at how much better you'll feel a year from now.",

She is a little frail so the doctors recommend Herceptin, no chemo and they say they will moniter her heart because of previous strokes (2) and previous irregular heartbeat. The pill proposed is a Hormonal Therapy medication. She says with her age (74) and condition she doesn`t want any more medication to make her feel more tired. She is kind of giving up and I am so depressed about it. I recently fought a stage 4 tonsil/lymphnode cancer and I want her to fight as I did. Ron (her son) Ah, this must be so hard for you, especially after fighting cancer yourself. I would say the Herceptin is the most important.  The hormonal therapy drugs are a class called aromatase inhibitors--there are 3 of them--Arimidex, Aromisin and Femara.  They can have some severe side effects---it seems to depend on the person.  Check out Breast Cancer Action's website for a study done on the side effects as reported by women taking them.  The study is easy to read as it's broken down by each drug, age of the women, and side effects.  Some ages report higher percentages of certain side effects than others.  The website is bca.org. Your Mom's doctors should have given her/you a print-out indicating the survival rates for someone her age and health if she does or does not do the various therapies.  Make sure they explain it in plain English and listen carefully.  They are careful to make the distinction between over-all survival and recurrence.  There is an 88 yr. old lady in my support group who has decided not to take Arimidex (she's now survived both ovarian and breast cancer) because the graphs show she's likely to die of something else before she'd die of cancer.  She talked to her doctors over many weeks and kept asking questions before she finally came to that choice.  Ultimately that's what it comes down to---the patient's choice.  The thing is to make sure the patient is fully informed and actually hearing/processing the information.  If you feel she is giving up already consider talking to her oncologist about antidepressants and/or some sessions with a therapist.  Many people still hear the word \"cancer\" and believe it's a death sentence when that isn't necessarily so.  It's not unusual to be depressed with what she's facing.  But depression can also keep her from fully hearing/understanding her options.  Be as encouraging as you can with her.  I'm sure you must be an inspiration having survived stage 4. Please consider taking her to a nutritionist/dietician who specializes in cancer patients (this will not likely be covered by insurance).  Nutrition and supplements are going to be very important for her as will even the smallest amount of exercise (a walk around the block).  That all makes tolerating treatment easier.  If she's able to attend a support group that will also help.  My group has a wide variety of ages---30's to 90+ and we all learn so much from each other. If you haven't subscribed, do look up Cure online (I think it's www.cure.com ).  That's the magazine associated with the Lance Armstrong Foundation and it's free to cancer patients.  New subscribers also get a reference booklet.  Go to their archives and look at the Survivor's Issue of Summer 2006 (if they still have them available order one!), which is chock-full of lots of helpful info.  I read this during my chemo last year and it was inspiring and brought me hope. I wish you and your Mom the best.  Keep up your spirits, do nice little things for yourselves, rent funny movies, and don't give up because, as you discovered with your cancer, a bad prognosis doesn't always mean the cancer can't be beat or managed.",

The only information they had for me is that is takes up to ten days for the medication to leave your system. I suggested that maybe a clinical study on this part of discontinuing the medication would be a smart thing to do. They acted as if I was the only person to ever ask this question. Maybe if more of us called, they world do a study that would answer a lot of the unanswered questions we all seem to have. Although I wholeheartedly agree with your idea of a study on how long Arimidex's side effects last after discontinuing use, I seriously doubt AstraZeneca would ever fund such a study.  What monetary gain would there be in it for them?  It certainly wouldn't sell more pills (unless maybe they went head-to-head against the other 2 aromatase inhibitors and came out with better results, i.e., less long-lasting side effects.)  ",

She is so afraid and has so many questions, but she was so overwhelmed by this news that she didn't ask any questions while she was in the office and isn't scheduled to go back until Monday. She had a needle biospy done yesterday. I'm not sure of all the logistics of this (I have zero knowledge of cancer, we have no family members who have been touched by the disease thus far) so forgive my ignorance. In front of her, they put the specimen in some kind of solution and told her that if it floated, it meant that it was \"fatty deposits/cysts.\" Well it sunk.  My question is how likely is it that it can still be a cyst? The oncologist did not give her a good vibe when he said, \"Prepare for a cancer diagnosis.\" Words of knowledge or advice from anyone with experience with this would be greatly appreciated. My sister is just so petrified. She has a 10 month old baby girl. Thank you for listening. Dear CelerySis, Ah she's so young!  I pray the diagnosis isn't cancer but the oncologist's words seem to indicate otherwise.  So I will give some advice.  If the diagnosis is cancer, then first, make sure your sister gets a second opinion and has a different lab look at the slides of her biopsy.  Some women get more than 2 opinions.  She should ALWAYS have someone go to appts with her.  Two heads remember more than one and the other person should be an advocate for her if she's not feeling up to questioning the drs. Interview at least 2 oncologists and get their recommendatins for treatment.  Go with the one she feels most comfortable with and whose treatment recommendations she agrees with.  Vitally important to remember that she gets to choose her treatment.  If it's possible where she is, going to a cancer center is a good idea--having a team of drs. (oncologist, radiation oncologist, gynocologist, dietician, surgeons) working together helps.  If not, it's up to her to coordinate information btw drs.  Don't assume they talk to each other!!!!  VERY IMPORTANT:  Have her get copies of every dr and lab report, bills, insurance explanation of benefits, etc.  Keep them organized in a 3-ring binder.  I did this and it's extremely helpful. Get Dr. Susan Love's The Breast Book (most current edition) which is a wealth of information about types of cancer, treatments, reconstruction (except it's missing the latest reconstruction--microsurgery with DIEP flap).  If your sister's diagnosis is inflammatory BC, she will want to move quickly with treatment.  If not, then she has a bit more time to decide how she wants to proceed.  Dr. Love's book doesn't really address complementary treatment so do some research on that.  Diet is important--she should be eating an alkaline diet (again research on Web).  Although insurance probably doesn't cover it, a visit with a dietician familiar with cancer patients is incredibly helpful (remember drs. typically get about 1 course in nutrition in med school so a nutritionist is much more knowledgable). She will need someone to organize a group of family, friends, neighbors, etc. to help her during treatment.  They can do laundry, dishes, grocery shopping, baby sitting, bring meals, whatever.  Your sister will need to focus on herself (something very hard for a young mother to do but very very necessary!!) and put her energy into getting well. I believe that cancer affects not just the body, but also involves the mind and spirit.  Certainly there are studies out there that confirm there is a mind/body connection.  An important book for me was Jean Shinoda-Bolen's Close to the Bone, Life threatening illness and the search for meaning.  I read the updated 10th anniversary edition and found it so helpful even 2 years after my diagnosis. As a sister you could also set up a CaringBridge website (free) for her so her friends & far-flung family can keep in touch.  My husband did that for me and I wrote on the website (it became like a journal) so everyone would know what was going on. Reading the encouraging messages everyone send me was very uplifting.  I printed out the messages and took them to the hospital with me (my \"support group\".)  A support group for young breast cancer patients would be very helpful for her if that's available in her community.  She will also find support on this website.  There are also several magazines I'd recommend: MAMM, Cure and Heal.  MAMM is specifically about breast & gynecological cancers, Cure covers all cancers and Heal is for those past initial treatment.   If I can help with any more info please feel free to send me a private reply and I will get back to you quickly.  My prayers and best wishes are with you both.    ",

Another thing that helped me was my husband set up a CaringBridge website about me so friends from all over could keep in touch.  We printed out their messages and I took my \"support group\" with me to the hospital!  Was very comforting to read.  I regularly update my \"journal\" on the website to let folks know how I'm doing.  CaringBridge is free but your friends and family will have to be told a password in order to access your website, if you should set one up. One last recommendation:  There's a magazine called Mamm, which focuses on women and breast & gynecologic cancers.  They are also online at www.mamm.com and you can read some of the articles.  They charge for a subscription but it's not much (sorry can't remember right now!)  I just received the May/June 07 issue--good article on radiotherapy, choosing a doctor and an interview w/Dr. Susan Love (author of Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book). Blessings to you Holly.  Keep in touch.  ",

D about 400 to 600 but there are other drugs used that do not adversely affect the bone such as Tamoxifen or the new drug Avista.  If you don't already I would take a good multivitamin with mineral supplement, eat a good diet and your body will tell you when you need to rest which is important because the body needs energy to effectively use the radiation.  For skin redness etc. I started using Biafine radiation cream at the onset of my radiation therapy.  This is a prescription cream which worked wonders.  Don't be afraid to address any of these questions with your medical oncologist as well.  I agree with Lee about the supplements, though check with your radiation oncologist about taking anything during radiation. Something I did (not covered by my insurance but well worth $100) was see a nutritionist who specialized in cancer patients---she had lots of helpful suggestions, including which supplements to take.  After active treatment ended and I started Arimidex, my gynecologist upped my vitamin D dose to 2000 IU/day.  Make sure to get a vitamin D3 level test---mine was at the low end of normal (in the 20's) and she wanted me in the upper end (now it's in the 40's).  They are finding that D3 is a very important vitamin, not only for bone health but also possibly for inflammation.",

      "Content": "Dear Sam, So sorry to hear your Mom has breast cancer. I had stage 3, with 24 nodes removed and 16 involved. I just passed my 1 yr. since the end of chemo annniversary. Hang in there, you and your Mom will make it through this. There are drugs to help get her through chemo and the nausea & vomiting, however Taxotere is not one of them. Taxotere is one of the drugs used to fight cancer (I had this during my cancer treatment). You can search on the Web to find out what the side effects are of the drugs your mother is on. Remember she isn't likely to have every side effect. If she has had lots of vomiting her doctor should be informed and asked for something to stop it--she shouldn't have to just tough it out and the dr. won't want her to get dehydrated. Make her tea with a little ginger or mint in it and give it to her when it's tepid--not hot. Plain crackers or bread (no butter or anything greasy) may help also. Her sense of taste and smell may change which will make eating difficult but protein is especially important during treatment. Save her favorite foods for when she's done with chemo. Make her plain, small, frequent meals---not a lot of salt or seasonings. She may find something plain like applesauce will agree with her. As the treatments progress she will find she has additional side effects and will feel very very tired. Resting is important! One other thing I would advise you to watch for and that is swelling of her arm and/or hand. The chemo can cause swelling but swelling can also be an indication of lymphedema which she is at risk for since so many lymph nodes were removed. If her rings or clothes feel tight she should see a therapist trained in manual lymphatic drainage for an evaluation. I know, one more thing to deal with, but VERY important to deal with early rather than later. Please look at www.lymphnet.org as one place to learn about it. Blessings.",

I just finished chemotherapy and am starting radiation.  About a week ago I started having pain under my arm, on my side, and in my breast (which feels swollen, like just before one's period--but I'm post menopause)--it started soon after the simulation for the radiation, so I assumed it was due to the long period of time I had to lie with my arm in an uncomfortable position, but it isn't going away.   I called my surgeon who agreed that was probably the issue, as it wouldn't be post-surgical pain at this point.... but as I say, it's been over a week since the simulation... and it's not getting any better...  I don't know who to ask about this--the medical oncologist, the radiation oncologist or??? Or, am I just being dumb and it will go away on its own?  Any ideas?   Thanks so much. No, you are certainly NOT being dumb!  I would ask BOTH the oncos your question.  I would also HIGHLY recommend you get a referral to a lymphedema therapist to be checked for lymphedema.  Chemo can make you swell and radiation definitely makes you swell but if you have lyphedema and don't treat while you wait to see IF the swelling goes down after treatment is over, you will waste precious time and the lyphedema just gets worse.  Continue (or start) to get some exercise and stretch your affected arm up a wall at least 2X/day.  The radiation will tighten up all the muscles and you must stretch if you want to retain mobility.  Exercise is a huge help in controlling lymphedema (and also helps with the fatigue that sometimes comes with radiation treatment!) Hope this helps!  Blessings to you for your complete healing.",

Good luck on your treatment.  Make sure you've got a good support system, be gentle to yourself, and remember you will be recovering for a year after your treatment ends.  Please do not expect to be back to normal right after your last session.  Mentally and physically you will have been through a lot---allow yourself time to heal and deal with everything.

Hang in there.  It's wonderful you are taking care of your Mom.  Make sure she's eating properly and getting quality sleep--both important components of healing.  You'll both see the gradual improvement in strength and energy as time progresses.  If she can take little walks or a gentle exercise class that will also help her energy and healing.  Best to you both.",

I also am part of a lymphedema support group, which is helpful and I attend a Lebed exercise class, which was developed for lymphedema patients.  I still see one of my therapists for MLD once a week---something I decided to do for myself since I feel she does a better job than I do (2 hands are better than 1, and it's relaxing!). Wow, now I've given you an earful!  I truly hope you do not get lymphedema.  There is ongoing research into the causes and possible different treatments.  They still don't know why some women who've had the same cancer, same treatments, get it and some don't and some will develop it 10-20 years later.  All you can do is pay attention to your body so you can be aware and catch it early.   ",

I now know why The Donald has a comb-over!!  My oncologist confirmed it's the drug (although some women do experience hair thinning with menopause). I've done some Web research on female hair loss.  Read that some dermatologists recommend Vitamin B12, Biotin, and MSM.  I would see a dermatologist before taking anything, just to be sure it doesn't conflict with your current meds.  My onco also said there's a pill named Propecia for helping hair loss (I think that's right) but the side effect is lowered libido (no thanks!!)  There's also Rogaine.  One website I found was a guy who writes about trying just about everything and what worked for him.   Check out baldingtony.com and save yourself some research.  At least we'll know what not to try!  Also if hair replacement surgery has crossed your mind (it did mine!)--forget it, not really applicable for women due to the patterns of hair loss.  Plus some of those operations are really just a scam cause they do not work the way they're advertised---you just end up looking worse.

There are meds they can prescribe.  I've heard Eucerin Calming Creme can help too.  The vitamin B should be a B complex.  Check with a cancer nutritionist too.  Another gal I know went to the acupuncturist for help.  Make SURE you are wearing roomy shoes w/extra room in the toe box.  You may find you need a larger size than your usual size, also they should be flat or nearly flat so no extra pressure is put on your toes and the ball of your foot.

If you've talked to another doctor or nurse, read something in a magazine or on the Internet, or spoken with a survivor, it doesn't matter. The truth of the matter is that YOUR doctor is going to tell you that a)  you can't trust what you've heard or b) it's true, but it doesn't apply to your case. I'd love to believe that that self educating I've done about breast cancer has helped me in some way. The truth is that all it does is tick off my doctors. Then maybe it's time to look for different docs.  You are entitled to be treated with respect and listened to.  I brought up an article about a neurosurgeon who's doing brain MRIs to find BC metasteses early (before symptoms show up and quality of life is diminished).  My oncologist agreed that a brain MRI was a good idea.  I also brought up the recommendation about breast MRIs for at-risk women and asked my surgeon if that applied to me.  She said it certainly did and now I have an appt. for a breast MRI, in addition to the mammogram on my remaining breast. I do believe that educating ourselves about this disease and treatments is very important.  Doctors know lots, but let's face it, they're busy busy busy----they may not see the latest news as quickly as a patient who spends a LOT of time researching.  When I bring in something I try to ask questions about it and I expect a considered answer (which I usually get).  Sometimes I return with more questions (chemobrain doesn't always allow me to remember everything or even remember to write it all down!)  I've given copies of things I've found to my surgeon (new technique to help avoid lymphedema---she hadn't heard of it yet) and to the PET scan people.  I give them in the spirit of \"oh, have you heard about this yet?  I found it in this mag or this website\"--then it's up to them to use the knowledge.  And why wouldn't the provider want new info to help them do their job better?? Just my two cents!",

Speaking of exercise, check out the book The Breast Cancer Survivor's Fitness Plan by Dr. Carolyn Kaelin, Francesca Coltrera, et al.  I found this at the book store.  Copyright is 2007 so it is full of current data, good info and written by survivors who just happen to be dr. and exercise experts.  The exercises start out very gently, with alterative ways to do them also given.  Exercises are also organized based on whether you had a mastectomy, lumpectomy, various reconstruction surgeries (except the microsurgeries) and advice for those with lymphedema.  An excellent book!

Good luck!  BTW, did you see the earlier message about DIEP from someone who had it done?  I thought she was from the south.... and her dr. is well known (has a good website too).  Sorry, chemobrain can't remember the details but if you \"search\" on this site under \"breast cancer\" for that subject you might find it.",

Hi Hanagirl, I wasn't clear enough in my message about the laser treatment.  You do not have to have lymphedema for the laser to help with the condition you're experiencing from radiation treatment.  To find a therapist with the laser you will need to be looking for a lymphedema therapist.  It could help, as could myofascial release.  For that kind of massage therapy try to find a body worker who's worked with cancer patients--that's what I did.  My range of motion has improved a lot and I no longer have the pain in the chest area that I did (I can hug easier and wear a seatbelt much more comfortably.)  Hope I've been a bit clearer for you.  ",
