    "Content": "Hello, my mother has stage 4 breast cancer. She is using frankincense oil on her skin but she complains that it tingles a lot, to the point where it feels uncomfortable. Has anyone ever had this experience? I'm tryng to figure out if this means that the oil is doing its work or if she may be having an allergic reaction to it. Thanks in advance.Â ",
