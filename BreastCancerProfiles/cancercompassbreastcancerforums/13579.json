    "Content": "You don't have to do a routine mammogram. Without necessarily considering you as an individual, they automatically herd people to the mammograms if there is any potential problem. I had to deal with argumentative, rude mammogram technicians before I could even see the doctor who is a breast specialist. The technician ended up saying that all they do in the office is mammograms and I can't see the doctor and they can't help me. But when I said that's all I needed to know and began to walk away, then she stopped me and said she'll talk to someone. The doctor did make time for me and she was great. She did an ultrasound on me and found no abnormal lumps or cysts, and said that the doctor who thought she felt a cyst actually felt normal breast tissue. Just fight for what you think is right, and keep yourself informed because no one else will. I am only 34, but in the future, I will probably seek a doctor who will do Thermography, even if my insurance will not pay for it. Research that and also the NMP66 test. Be careful of biopsies because the needle can rupture the membrane surrounding the cancer and allow it to spread faster. Mammograms are highly inaccurate, heighten your chance of getting breast cancer (even more so if you have the maternal gene for it and you are pre-menopausal), and they can cause a tumor to leak and spread cancer by squishing it too hard.",
