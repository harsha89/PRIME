      "Content": "Thank you for the encouragement CMK. I have blood work scheduled for tomorrow. I see my oncologist Wednesday and start treatment. I am in a study group for stage III breat cancer. It randomizes three different treatments but all are standard except one that adds a treatment used in early stage cancer to the treatments used in adavanced cancer. I suppose the only good part is that maybe it will help someone else in the future survive longer. It could kill me but I am not afraid of death and I don't want to live if I can't live with some dignity about my life quality. I am ready to fight but I will not allow by quility of life to become so small that it destroys everyone around me.",

It is highly recommended by some oncologists. It is like eating vegetables and fruits. You can learn about it by going to JuicePlus.com. I juice and eat healthy but I only started taking large doses of Juice Plus this past year when I didn't know why I was so tired all the time. They helped but then I found out I had breat cancer. Well God Bless and I hope you Know the Lord Jesus as your pesonal Savior cause he is the Great Physician and the one with the final say about all of us.",

      "Content": "I am glad to hear a positive response to supplements during treatment. I am about to start very intense treatment for stage 3 breast cancer with all nodes involved. I have been using a supplement called Juice Plus. It can be researched on internet --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, url removed. Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html ---- Many oncologist recommend them so my Dr. did not tell me I could not take them only that she needed to know what I was taking. Natural alternatives are very slowly finding their way here to Delaware. Mostly conventional treatment is all you can get and the treatment of Body Soul and Spirit is at best, your own choice. Its a battle just to get one Dr. to communicate pofessionally with another about your information. It amazes me the amount of misstakes and frustration you have to go through during you cancer journey. Some of it could be completley ommitted if they used treatment like Cancer Treatment Centers of America. I only with my insurance would have allowed me to go to them. There is plenty of alternative material in the Book market place but try to find a Dr on the east coast that will do anything but conventional treatment. Its all about the drug industry and kickbacks to Dr.s. It only changes when Doctors become cancer patients themselves and have to see what a patient goes through. when your the victem then looking for a cure is a whole other story. I am glad there are some medical places concerned about the patients whole being and not just a dollar sign or approval of an insuance industry.",
