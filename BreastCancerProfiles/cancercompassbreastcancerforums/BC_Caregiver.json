      "Content": "Thanks for taking the time to pass along those great tips.  I ended up investing in a soft post surgery camisole designed specifically with the breast drains in mind.  It is 90% cotton with ony a hint of slight stretch, just enough to keep in from sliding around.  It is something that can be stepped into like a bathing suit and has little pockets attached under the surgical site where the bags from the drains can be placed.  Once the drains are out, the pockets can be removed (they attach/detach with a soft Velcro strip).  It came with a set of breast forms that also have an opening on the back side that enables her to remove the foam padding if she finds that uncomfortable and replace it with a more light-weight natural fiber stuffing that she can use to adjust the size of the form....up to a D size cup, if desired.  I am hoping that the cami will help minimize the restrictions the drains may impose on other types of sleepwear she may want to  use.  It was a bit pricey ($65) but can be filed on the insurance, so I will pass along the receipt to her for that purpose and that way, she can keep 80% of the cost once the insurance reimburses....a sneaky way to pass a little money along to her at the same time.  She would otherwise have a pretty hard time trying to accept the $$ directly to her hand.  Hopefully during the course of hospitalization, they will provide her with another one, since it is covered by the insurance (along with a few other items such as breast forms and mastectomy bras) and that way she will have 2 of them.  The day I was shopping, I found myself in a specialty BC boutique run by 2 senior  26-year survivors who told me they still find their camisoles useful.  I ended up with 2 pairs of open-front PJs and a long open-front light-weight terry cloth robe.  I thought the \"modal\" fiber was softer and lighter weight, but I avoided it just the same because I was not sure about the skin irrigation factor, reactions to medications, etcetera.  I hope those 4 pairs will be enough to get through the need for open-front PJ so that the other sleepwear can be a bit more feminine beyond the initial super-sore stage.  One of the survivors told me that many of her customers experience a permanent spreading of the rib cage that alters the circumference of the original bra size and that swelling can also bump up a person's size a level or two for the sake of comfort.  In any case, I think we are ready for the next stage of preop fun...saying goodbye to the hair....a final family portrait with the long locks, followed by an extreme makeover, starting with a pixie crop hairdo.  I cut my own hair in that style and tried a little color majic and put on some makeup for that excursion in an attempt to show her that super-short and even bald can still be feminine.  It took 10 years off my face immediately (whoopee!), so now were are both pretty excited about the upcoming trip to the salon.           ",

      "Content": "Thanks you, Susan.  Surgery is just around the corner (01/02/08).  We have done all we can so far in the planning stages.  Don't know how long the hospital stay will be, but they act as though the sooner she goes home, the better, supposedly because of in-hospital infection that she would not otherwise have exposure to at home.  Anyway, I anticipate that the reality of the situation will be setting in by the following Friday.  I am hoping to draw on her strength (she has more courage that I ever could imaging) for myself in that first week so we both can try to keep a positive attitude.  The rest of it will be left up to the power of prayer....never can have too much of that!   ",

      "Content": "My friend is scheduled for bilateral mastectomy 01/02/2008.  I will be doing caretaking in her home.  I am shopping for sleepwear for her to use while in the hospital and for convalescence and chemotherapy.  I intend to purchase natural fiber but beyond that, I am wondering about the pros and cons of gowns versus PJs versus front-open robes, maximizing comfort and the like.  Any advice from survivors, family and/or caregivers? ",
