    "Content": "Hi, I was just wondering if anyone experienced the same issue that I am currently dealing with at the moment. I am 45, I have had a routine mammo done every year like clockwork since 39. Never experienced any issues. Only called back once in the past 5 years for one additional view (no ultrasound mentioned or needed) on the left which turned out to be nothing. Last week, I had my yearly routine mammo done and a couple of days later they called me saying that I had some new findings on my mammo that were not present on previous films and could I come in the next day for more views and an ultrasound. I was surprised not only by the fact they already wanted to do 3D images and an ultrasound right away, but also that she said it was my right side. I went in the next day as requested and they showed me the images. I never expected to have 2 different problems within the same breast and both new issues. They showed me multiple small calcifications and also an asymmetrical area that look \"different\" than the rest of my breast on either side. The tech was very nice and told me how a lot of times just doing the 3D images and other compression views can actually \"fix\" the issues (she explained in more detail, just condensing) and if so, nothing to worry about. Either way, I was getting an ultrasound following the images. Well, the issues didn't \"fix\" with the compressions and off to ultrasound I went. During the ultrasound, the tech said that the mass is located behind my nipple and could be tricky the image. Luckily, she was able to pull up some images. After looking at it for a bit, she started to scan down towards my lymph nodes, paused, immediately stopped and said she needed to go talk to the doc and would be back in a few minutes. Tech and Doc returned to talk to me about the findings. Making my long story a little shorter (thanks to those who have hung in there and are still reading :) ), the Doc was extremely nice, almost too nice. I say this because she politely took my hand and basically held it the entire time while telling me that I need to have 2 different biopsies done a week apart (one on each \"issue\" with time to heal in between). The only time I have witnessed a Doc holding someone's hand that much was when a Doc had to tell my mom she she had terminal cancer (not breast), so of course my brain begins to have flashbacks. I am having an Ultrasound guided biopsy in a week and a stereotactic biopsy a week later. Granted, I am a very rational and not an over reactive type of person. If anything, I am pretty laid back, downplay everything and do not worry until there is a reason to be. I am not convinced it is going to be cancer and the Doc did not say that it is, but cannot help to have my imagination run a little rampant with this situation. She did say that she was not overwhelmingly alarmed, but was suspicious and concerned (she is more worried about calcifications vs what she hopes is just a cyst, but ultrasound did not convince her of it being just a cyst, so biopsy is needed). She also did say that she felt there was a higher chance it will not be cancer than is cancer, but her statistics were for each situation individually. Since I have 2 different new issues on same side, I would think that makes a couple of alarms go off or ruin my odds a bit, but I do not know that for sure. My questions are this: anyone else have a similar situation with 2 new different issues show up at same time within a year of last mammo and if so, what were your results? Thanks for reading and in advance for any responses! Best wishes to all of you, JPetra",
