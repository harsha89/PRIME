      "Content": "Yes, I have the same problem with my feet, and it is getting worse all the time. I find that the more walking I do, the worse it gets when I stop. I don't have any magic bullet for this pain, but will keep looking. I like the other posting from the person who recommended a good stiff drink-I had a few last night, and it did seem to help (at least I slept?!!) I keep the faith. I am still around to watch my beautiful, talented children grow into adulthood, and I plan to be here to be a grandmother someday. Hang in there, have a margarida, and God bless.",
