    "Content": "It first started with yellow discharge coming out of both nipples on my boobs. So i went in october last year when i was 17 and My doctor checked for lumps and said there was nothing to worry about but he sent me for a breast scan mammogram i think it is and gave me some cream. The cream worked the first week and i was pain free and the discharge stopped it was great but then i got a rash and it came back a little, not much but it was still there. I went for a mammogram but the other doctor said that i should go see a skin specialist. He didnt even check me and give me a mammogram which i was disappointed in. What if i have cancer?   I dont really want to go back to the doctor because to be fair i did go twice and they only gave me cream. Usually if it was just a thing to come and go then i wouldnt be bothered but because ive had it for 5 months im very worried.   Its strange the discharge starts to happen and the rash appears when i'm not wearing a bra and my boobs feel heavy and aching, espesh my nipples and i have to wear a bra all the time. My boobs are a D and i hate them!    Please help.  ",
