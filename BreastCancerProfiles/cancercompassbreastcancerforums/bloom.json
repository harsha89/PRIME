      "Content": "im so sorry to hear about your situation.  i can only imagine what it's like.  i have recently been diagnosed with breast CA.  after the initial shock and grief.. one of my main concerns was how are my loved ones taking it.  it took me a while before i got to ask them how they felt.  my mom was very positive about it.  although im not sure if she was being completely honest with me.  i think she feels the need to be strong for me.  but sometimes i worry about her.  that there are a lot of emotions that she is suppressing. my boyfriend was very supportive but just like my mom i know he is also suppressing a lot of emotions.  my father passed away from cancer and i know the feeling of being the relative of a cancer patient.  i know that you feel the need to be strong but im sure that even without you saying it, your mom and your girlfriend worries about you.   i agree that you need to have someone to talk to... this forum could be a good outlet for you.   i hope your situation gets better..  hang in there..  ",

      "Content": "oh i know what you are talking about.  that was terrible pain!  i just had mine about a week ago (had surgery last week).  i agree that there should be someone there to at least hold your hand.  and doctors should be a LOT more compassionate.   the anxiety is tough enough.  and being pricked by needles again and again makes it worse.   maybe you could bring in someone with you for your procedure?..  im sorry you have to do this again.  just push thru the pain.  i know it's difficult.  but we have to do whatever we have to do to beat this.  and unfortunately for us, sentinel node biopsy is one of them.    hope your procedure goes well.  ",
