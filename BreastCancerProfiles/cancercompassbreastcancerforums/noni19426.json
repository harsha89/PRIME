      "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy and immediate DIEP on January 21, 2008.   It was a 12 hour surgery and I woke up in incredible pain.  Honestly, it was the worst pain I've experienced.  I developed an infection in my breasts and required a second surgery a week later.   The first three days were hell.  I spent two weeks in the hospital and when I left my body looked and felt beat up.   My arms were sore but I could stand up straight and get around easily.  I slept in a recliner because it was far too difficult to get in and out of bed.   I had drains for six weeks and while they were an annoyance they weren't as terrible as I had feared. My surgery was an extreme case.  My pain was worst than most and I was slow to heal.  With all that said, I would do it again in a heart beat.   Two months post-surgery I felt better than new.   It's a hard procedure but totally worth it. Just be prepared that you will be a mess the first week in the hospital. Feel free to ask questions. ",

      "Content": "I also want to note than many plastic surgeons are reluctant to perform a DIEP on a woman scheduled for radiation.   The radiation can cause the flap to fail and it's not an easy fix.  My PS suggested that if my doctor felt I needed radiation that I get it done and have the DIEP after I had completely healed.   Fortunately I did not need radiation. ",

      "Content": "I am scheduled for a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction in just over a week.   My doctor said I should be in the hospital 3-5 days.   I'm wondering if there's anything special or specific that I should include in my hospital bag. For those who have been there, was there anything that you wished you had that you didn't? ",
