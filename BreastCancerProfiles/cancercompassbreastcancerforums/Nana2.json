Now I am on Aromasin. It has only been 1 month but the side effects are greatly reduced. I still have stiffness and occasional moderate joint pain but nothing like the other two drugs. My doctor explained that Arimidex and Femara's chemical makeup are very similar. Their chemical symbols form a long line. With Aromasin, the symbols form more of a circular cluster. I guess my body likes circle more than line. I do find an occasional Aleve relieves the discomfort. I just hope this continues because I was ready to stop all the drugs. Quality of life is as important as length of life. You may not still be checking your messages since yours was written almost 2 years ago. How are you doing now. I've only been on Arimidex about 6 months and the doctor wants to change me to Aromasin because of the bad joint pain. You said your pain got better after a month of taking Aromison, but still it stay better? Also did you experience any hair thinning on either drug? I am just beginning to experience hair thinning on the Arimidex and wondering what happens with the Aromasin. Thanks for the update. Really helps to know from other women what the real side effects are. Thanks agains",
