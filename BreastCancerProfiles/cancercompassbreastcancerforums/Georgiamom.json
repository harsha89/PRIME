      "Content": "My mom will be 80 this month and has a mastectomy last week.  Her lymph nodes were positive and were removed.  She is doing extremely well.  Her doctor says that she will start chemo in 3-4 weeks.  At this point, we do not know how aggressive her cancer is, etc, but it looks like it is a high stage cancer from what the doctor says.  I am just worried that the chemo will make her so sick. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.",
