    "Content": "My name is Linda. I had a lumpectomy in Jan '03 for breast cancer. Small tumor caught early with no nodal involvement. 37 radiation treatments and no chemo quickly followed. But now I have a recurrence as follows. The original breast cancer was this rare type of cancer. Due to the occurence of a single small mass in the left lower lobe of the lung which was caught on a routine lung xray in March '05 and no other known tumors, my doctors thought I had a primary lung tumor. They proceeded to surgery to remove it and take the left lower lobe out and be done with it. However, when the removed wedge was sent over to pathology, while I was still under, they could not confirm it was lung cancer so they proceeded to sew me up and not take the lobe. I have since recovered beautifully from the surgery and the tumor is gone. I find this good news. Several doctors think it may have been better left so if I had chemo they could watch it for changes. At this point, no more tumors exist as far as is known. The pathology is the same as for the original breast cancer tumor as in the subject line above ie metastatic metaplastic heterologous carcinoma of the breast ... possible squamous cell. I am searching for oncologist(s)who have had experience with this rare form. Does anyone out there have knowledge of such a doctor??? I am an otherwise very healthy 62 year with no major health problems on no medications with a very good functioning body that recuperates quickly. I need to consult with an oncolgist in the know. Thanks for reading and hopefully responding.",
