    "Content": "We have not been on the Cancer Compass message  board for some time.  My husband, Woz Too, as he called himself use to go on here alot.  Our trip with this horrible brain cancer began in December of 07.  He had his 1st surgery January 2, 2008.  We really never had a clear MRI and the GBM IV was only the size of a quarter the first time.  He had radiation and all the rest and was doing pretty good.  The tumor did regrow but it was in remission for 2 months then on the day we were to go for a follow up MRI on the 15th of Dec., he had 5 seizures on the way to the VA Hospital.  His seizures are in his hand and this time up the right arm.  We went to the emergency room and yes, the tumor is out of remission and so we had a second surgery on the 24th of December.  This time the tumor was the size of a large olive.  Well, Ed did not come out of surgery as well this time.  He has lost complete control of his right arm and right leg and it seems problem after problem keeps happening and none get fixed.  He had a blood clot in his right arm and blew a vein on the back of his right hand and ended up with a blood infection.  The infection cleared but he will need a skin graft on the back of his hand which they and Ed have decided is to risky.  He cannot urinate or have a bowel movement on his own.  His urine is dark.  He has been have back problems for a couple of months which we thought were from not alot of movment.  It seems now he has a spot on his kidney that could be causing the pain and blood in his urine.  There will be no more cancer treatment but I have to fight for answers when I think they should be coming to me with them.  It's our second marriage - almost 36 years and we have 4 grown children between the two of us that want answers about their Dad too.  I made some calls today - more firmly - and the family will be having a meeting before Ed is transferred to the VA Nursing Home near us where he will spend the rest of his time.  We live in a single wide mobile home so there is no way I can take care of him here and it takes more that one person to move him and he needs a lift to be transferred to the bathroom and our home isn't big enough for the lift.  The nursing home is near us and at least we can all go and spend quality time with him instead of having to use all our strength caring for him.  We just want what is best for him and this is a brand new nursing home, Ed has seen it and it is all ok with him.  I can't begin to imagine what is ahead of us even tho I know.  My faith in God and His plan is the only thing that has gotten me this far and I know that it will continue to carry me until my day.  That doesn't mean I don't cry and hurt and will miss the love of my life being next to me on a daily basis.  We have been so blessed over the years and to have found each other and God letting us be together has been a piece of Heaven on earth for me - I do believe we will always be together - a part of Ed stays with me and a part of me goes with him.  Then of course, we have eternity together - it's just he will be changing his address soon.  Mrs. Woz",
