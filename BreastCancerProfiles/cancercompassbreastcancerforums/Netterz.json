I am constantly dripping wet with sweat, I feel sick from my body core temp being so high, I can not sleep, because I wake up 15 min later drenched. I have to cover my matress with platic sheeting, then layers of bedding and then towels. I rarely even can stand to have a sheet over me. 2 fans full blown and central air. Ice water. Popsickles by the truck load. Have tried the Dong Qui, Natrols hot flash, New Phase, Zhihabi blends, the list is long, but total open to what others are trying too. I just ordered Chillows as well.  am triple neg, totally non hormonal related. Onc says no hormone replacement. Says Vit E and Folic Acid. 4 months later still no relief. Before I lose my mind, its going to drain out thru my pores pretty soon, off my bald head I am thinking! This goes on all day, and all night. Am post lumpectomy, and lymph nodes removed, back on chemo, Taxol this time. Hope to hear from you all with your possible help. Thanks in advance! ",

      "Content": "Hello, I have a 17 yr old daughter, andI hope that she never gets breast cancer like I have. Tho it may seem akward, please remember that our dad, well, he went thru your moms cancer with her, and knows all to well what happens. Any hole in your body anywhere that does not heal, indicates a problem. The skin around your nipple is called the 'areola' , and since there is some reason it isnt healing it needs to be checked out. If you call someplace, such as the health dept, you can go into the womens center there, where they do check those types of things, give pap smears, teach you how to do self breast exams, alot of young women go there to get birth control pills, so there parents dont know. Here in Michigan, they can go to these places, at the age of 16 without there parents, and you don need any money to be checked. If you dont have anyone like an aunt, grandmother, even one of your best friends moms, ANY adult female, I suggest you get in to have it checked out RIGHT AWAY. Your body is trying to tell you that something is wrong. Its just like when you have a zit, or a deep sliver, it will get infected, form pus, get really sore so you wont want to touch it, so you leave it alone and let it do its job, till eventually,it pops out what ever is in there that is bothering it, and gets rid of it. But that usually happens within a few days. 4 Months, is a bit long for something to remain open, draining,and oozing. Please come back and let us know what you find out about it, since your so young, its very rare that a young woman of your age would get breast cancer I would like to know, if you dont mind sharing",

      "Content": "I found the Chillows on ebay. I got 2 with the auction I purchased, and they have been an absolute night time wonder. I put one in my pillow, and the othe I wrapped in just a pillow case, I leave laying  on the bed beside me. Everytime I wake up in the throws of another horrid flash, I take the extra one, and lay it on my body, I am a side sleeper, so usually it ends up on my side, and its instant relief, cools me down within seconds. I have also found that by switching off my over the counter hot flash remedies, every night, I am getting a good variety of many different kinds, instead of just trying to rely on one kind, and waiting to see if it will have results within a few days, or even weeks in some cases. Most all contain the same things, but one may add something another does not, so I am getting the benefits of all. I also recently read about a trial underway regarding everyday household mint. I started drinking mint green tea, and that is helping a lot during the day time hours. Its very good as an iced tea, as well as a hot tea. I had a terrible experience with the Effexor XR, I was already on Cymbalta..and I asked my Oncologist if they would interact, since both are an SSRI. Within 2 days, I almost died. I started passing out, I hit my head repeatedly an unknown number of times, my blood pressure dropped to dangerously low levels, and I ended up having something called Seretonin Seizures. My face was covered with rug burns from falling face first to the floor, bruised everywhere, probably had a concussion, a couple pulled muscles, maybe more, I don't know, because I did not come out of this for almost 3 days.... since I live alone, I didn't even know what was going on. I intend on posting this info for others to be wary of as well. Its a VERY dangerous situation, and can be fatal within a couple days. I was one of the lucky ones, since the worst part seemed to be while using the bathroom, the blood pressure drops and sitting on the toilet causes pressure on the Vagues nerve, that is where most of the damage happened. I have a large bathroom, and was no tub or sink to hit my head or face on, and it sits in a cubby, so I just flopped over onto the side walls, instead of hitting any sharp corners. Others might not be so lucky. Thanks so much for your answers and best wishes for all and family facing this horrid non discriminatory disease.",

      "Content": "I ama grade 3 post op lumpecomy with all axillary nodes removed, 7 still positive for cancer, after 8 wks of chemo(AC),and 2 post op(Taxol) since Aug 2007. Since my surgery, I have continued to have a red breast, hot to the touch, some days not too bad, but the last few days, is the WORST its ever been. I have large breasts, am a 40G. I have seen the oncologist,the surgeon, a dermotolgist, my family practicion, had more blood draws than I have ever had in my life, and the only conclusion they can come to, based on all the testing, including a biopsy to r/o inflammatory breast cancer, is that because I lost my lymph nodes, the breast isnt abl to drain properly, and he hystocytes and mast cells are pooling, and cant get out, which is causing it. The dermo put me on Clarinex 10mg, x 2 day. Have been on them about a week,it has expanded the redness, my skin is horribly sensitive to the touch, feels like fire, inside and out. They first thought of it as a mild lymphodema, I cant start radiation therapy, till this is cleared up, the radiologist said he ont feel comfortable with it till a reason is found. I really dont want to start it either, because the problem began shortly after my operation on August. But all the sudden, over night, it went comepletey out of control, I want nothing touchig my skin, its th worst near the area where the scarring is from the surgery and biospy, and my npple fels like some one is holding a blow torch on it. my Rad Oncologist, sai I needed to get into the ER right away, get cultures and sveral other tests, thinking that its been an underlyng infection, but they came back clear. But even with that, the only solution the ER had, was to give me a crap load of antibiotics, even tho 4 of the test showed perfect score on white cells,and 4 syringes full of liquid benadryl, and send me on my way, telling me to come back every 8 hours, for another dose of antibiotics,which I dont beleive I need, other than to line the pockets more of the ER. Oh,I also wont go back there, it was over 7 hours next to alot of ppl who were horridly sick, where laying on the floor in several places, because they had no where to sit,before I was called back, an made to feel lke a complete idiot, as if I have no clue about every thing that ha already been tryed and failed. Thier answer? \"well, WE have never done it, so we are going to try.\"  Nothing has changed this. And now that it is worse than it ever has been, and the nodes in my neck and collar bone are getting huge, it is starting the bother me, that no one seems to know what this is. Has ANYONE ever had this happen, or know some one who has, I am begging for some to help me.",

      "Content": "I am as well, and was told from the start I was 'rare' but had options and a good chance. I was diagnosed this May, I found my lump 2 weeks after losing my dad to Colon Cancer. From what I have gathered, this type is very possibly a direct genetic DNA link to a father. My breast lump was 8x5 mm. Within a week after seeing my family doc for the lump, before I even got to the surgeon, I had a lump grown to the size of a deck of cards and kidney beaned shaped under my arm, lymph nodes. Instead of immediate removal, I did 8 weeks of Chemo. Then lumpectomy, removing the breast tumor, as well as the entire sac of lymph nodes. 7 of the 25 in the sac, remained active with cancer. So, at this point, have no idea if, or where it may have spread while surfing my system. Back to another 8 weeks of chemo, then more testing to check to see if it has spread. Taxol for post surgical chemo. I have had HORRID non stop hot flashes from day one. My face turns purple as soon as they hook into me, and I stay that way a couple days. But the hot flashes still keep on coming. So far, and 100 boxes of popsickles later, seems my only relief, since my onc wont use any hormone replacment at this time. I dont see why they consider this rare either, when I am finding more and more of us with it, the more I roam around the internet, searching for answers it seems no one has. I look forward to reading what others are learning and finding. At times, I feel like shes running me on some kind of insurance raid, because she has mad numeous potentially serious errors in my teatment. I had a near fatal med interaction, an impacted infected sinus cavity, severe thrush, all of which she never treated or checked on me for. Word to the wise...if your taking Cymbalta, DO NOT take Effexor XR, (often given for hot flashes I was told) or any other SSRI med at the same time. I almost killed me. I had a seizure, and fell, got a concussion, black eyes and rug burns all over my head and face, my blood pressure dropped so low, I continued to pass out everytime I tried to get off the floor. My onc apparently wasnt concerned, just said she had never seen that happen before, even tho it lists it as a serious no-no, that it causes what it called a seretonin syndrome, that can be fatal. Question this right away, and demand that they check for that interaction.",

      "Content": "  I too suffer horrible hot flashes, and I have found a wonderful way of battling them, especially at night and during naps. I went on ebay, and found these things called \u201cChillows\u201d. You put then in between your pillow and pillow case. I have spent hundreds of $$$ on crap that didn't work, pills, herbs, and other gimmick solutions, but I swear by the chillows. And for when it gets really hot, and even my central air isn't good enough, in the pet care section, they sell much larger versions of the same as Chillows, called Cool Pet beds. I bought one for myself, and one for my dog!!! Its 36x42, and I put it between my sheets and mattress pad, and it keeps me nice and cool, all night long. Might sound crazy to some, but for those of us who have tried anything to find relief, this is my solution. It works in a thermo-genic manner, draws the heat out away from your head and body, disperses it thru the water, and out the other side. I get them so bad, I am drenched, and have even passed out a couple times while standing up, because I feel so yucky and nauseated, and if I cant sit or lie down right away, I will pass out. There horrible, and Chillows have been the best so far. During the day, I lay them on my chest while I am relaxing. It might seem a bit pricey, but was cheap compared to all the money I have spent on other things that didn't work at all, and went in the garbage. Good luck, and if you do decide to give them a try, let me knw what you think of them. I bought the chillows first, since your head is where you lose the most amount of heat the fastest, and when I saw how well they worked, I decided to get the larger pet pad. Take care, Net",

      "Content": "After my surgery, the best thing  found was front opening mens shirts a couple sizes too big, in the TALL. I know it sounds odd, but you want something that provides easy access, as well as comfort. Cotton worked best for me, due to the fact that I had horrible hot flashes, and mine was a summer surgery. It gave me the coolness,yet comfort and some warmness. My temp was a wild range of never to be known from moment to moment. I could open it up to cool off, close it up when I was chilled. It was also long enough to provide me with adaquate coverage, so I didnt need pants, because trying to get shorts or pants down to use the bathroom is hard and painful for a while right after surgery. I sat in my recliner, (slept alot too), and kept a throw blanket or a twin sheet cut in half on me or near,incase some one came over. Button down gave my family the ease of being able to get to the wounds and drains easily, check frequently, without me having to move all over to get the clothing open.  didnt even have to move, which for the first few days.... I surely didnt want to be wrestled around at all. You may want to cut a couple shirts straight up the middle of the back,to the shoulders, to make it easiest to get to the sides of your patient, till most of the major soreness fades.. it makes it so she wont have to roll side to side so you can check the sides and around the back..then whe she gets to feeling better, and you get more accustomed with what works for you both, you havent ruined a pretty set of PJ's. Comfort is the most important thing, and ther are some pink shirts avail,incase your lady friend is worried about being seen in mens shirts. Go to a store, buy a couple iron on flowers or such, an make them lady like, but this worked the best for me. Then you dont have to worry or feel bad when you toss them out, once she feels better.",
