      "Content": "Very little information seems to be available about what to expect with radiation to the breast with RSD.  Physicians are mentioning brachytherapy 5 day and also traditional 30 treatment type, but state they don't know what will happen to the RSD. First RSD ini 2005 R. wrist after fall; then 2012 R. breast after overcompression before surgery; then again June 2014 during another surgery. Severe allodynia and pain has me bound to home for 33 days; meanwhile, I need to start some type of radiation.",

My prospects for coming through radiation well with the RSD are not very good.  I feel like even with all of my research and asking questions, I don't get the whole story from any of my doctors.  They skirt over the side effects and possible complications and I need to know everything to weigh my risks.  I will live with the RSD forever, but added damage from radiation is another load I cannot bear right now.  I have to leave the house this week to talk to the radiation specialist and it is a very painful experience to wear my sheet cape and try to hold the sheet, as well as my damaged arm/underarm away, as well as hold the seatbelt away from me while someone drives me to the doctor.  Just needed to share.  Thanks.",
