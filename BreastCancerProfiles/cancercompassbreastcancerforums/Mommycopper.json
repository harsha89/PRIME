    "Content": "I am a 51 year old woman who was just diagnosed with stage 4 clear cell uterine cancer.  It is a very rare cancer.  I knew I was *special* but this is ridiculous!  We have got to keep our sense of humor :)  I had a radical hysterectomy and am now going to Sloan-Kettering next week for a second opinion.  My doctor said my oncologists only see 2-3 cases of this in a year.  I am also trying to get into MD Anderson in Houston.  Above all, I would urge all of you out there to trust the Lord Jesus Christ with your life here and in the hereafter.  And remember, nothing is too hard for God. ",
