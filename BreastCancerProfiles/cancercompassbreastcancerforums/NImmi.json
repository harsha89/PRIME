We are basically taking our bodies and turning them into 80 year old bodies with no estrogen. Unfortunately doing that we get the pain of an 80 year old along with it. I don't think it is possible to suppress estrogen with any kind of medication real or dreamed about that would not cause this pain. I dont think we should jump to conclusions. After all, before puberty we did not have estrogen in our system and managed fine.  I prefer Letrazole, as the effects are reversible and there is no interaction with receptors. It just lowers available estrogen. We can have phytoestrogens in diets to make up for it, which have a weaker effect. In addition, to ensure we discourage metastasis from any residual cells, there are things we can do. I have come across the following in respectable sources (ncbi, pubmed etc) that would help this end: - Low dose aspirin. Apparently this helps stop circulating cancer cells establishing themselves and setting up a blood supply and support system - nigella seeds, also known as black onion seeds, or black cummin. Apparently, the best way to take them is crushed in a smoothie. You see them on naan breads :) - broccoli sprouts (strong effect) and broccoli, cauliflower (brassica family) vegetables. These have a strong anti cancer effect. - Turmeric in the diet - Keep vit D levels high - above 80. You may need to take 7-10000IU to get it there. I was extremely low for a long time, and I suspect that is where my cancer came in. - Beetroots. I have been told by someone from Canada that a doctor friend (now dead) used to treat cancer with beetroot extract as one of the main tools. - Exercise. This also keeps your cholesterol down. There is this theory that cholesterol is actually trying to protect you. There is some interesting research in this area. keep moving. I find that though I do have joint pain and muscle weakness on Letrazole (since April now) I feel much better if I keep moving, and I take on various DIY projects that involve me so much, I forget the pain until I am done. I do get overfocused, and am so thankful for that now.  Good luck with everything, all. We are going to get through this. I am 65 this year - invasive lobular breast cancer (mastectomy)  and diverticulitis this year, thyroid lump (benighn scar) and hernia repair in 2016. Dont get hung up on any one thing and get into a focus loop on it. Learnt that early in my life. Break the loop if you are in one.    ",
