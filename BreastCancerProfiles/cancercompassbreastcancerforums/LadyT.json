    "Content": "Does anyone know if there are side affect after stopping Aromasin? I stopped at 4 years. dr said ok not to finish the 5th year. Lately having back pain, mid upper spine area. Trying not to think the worst, then wondered if stopping the med could be causing that? or is the Osteo setting in because I had a bone scan about a year ago and was already pre Osteo. I am 49 and feel 69.",
