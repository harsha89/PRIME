    "Content": "The BEST place to post your question for an immediate and well-researched response on the Facebook group page: \"AngioSarcoma Cancer.\" There are over 1,000 patients, families, and friends who post there and share not only experiences, but recommendations on the best treatment centers, treatment protocols that have been helpful etc. The non-profit that is associated with the Facebook group is dedicated to raising funds and spreading awareness for this cancer: Â www.cureasc.org This is a very rare and a very aggressive cancer. It is VERY important that you be under the care of an experienced sarcoma team; oncologists and surgeons who specialize and know a lot about this rare cancer and have access to the latest data on treatment, etc. Most doctors and even most oncologists have NEVER seen a case of this cancer (and never will again) and really don't know what the latest \"standard of care\" should be. Dr. Vinod Ravi at MD Anderson in Houston is one of the very best and most knowledgeable, but there are others in Boston, New York City, and other major cities who have this experience. Please do NOT take the advice of a doctor who is not an expert in angiosarcoma. Wishing you the best with dealing with this cancer!",
