      "Content": "I am so very sorry I missed seeing your post earlier.  What a really scary spot you were in having the history you did. I am praying your results were good and if not, that you are now recovering from surgery that removed everything bad.  I am a 14 year survivor of ER- breast cancer.  Like you, I had breast calcifications and a diagnosis of non-invasive DCIS.   My treatment was a  modified radical mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction and breast reduction surgery on the other side, all at the same time as I knew I would be too chicken to go back for reconstruction later.   Like you, I had no chemo or radiation.  I go for blood tests and followup checks every six months and once a year mammograms.  I have experienced no other problems with it so far but remain ever vigilant.  I will keep you in my prayers and hope to see an update on your situation soon.

      "Content": "I had ER- breast cancer over 14 years ago with no previous radiation history other than the minimal amounts in dental or a very few chest x-rays over the years. I've not heard of previous radiation treatments causing it although I had an uncle who died from complications of damage to his heart following radiation for lung cancer.  That was over 40 years ago and the place where he got his radiation treatments made errors in the dosage.  That does not happen anymore with the current equipment and training from what I undeestand.. I will be interested in seeing if others have been told what you have.  This is an intriguing question. In the meantime, I want to wish you the best in your treatment and recovery.  I'll keep you in my prayers. Karie  ",
