      "Content": "For all of you out there who have hot flashes because of the meds you are taking, let me recommend trying some Black Cohosh.  Someone finally recommended it to me and it has helped immensely.  I don't need to take the pills they gave me to help me sleep and the hot flashes aren't so frequent. I've only been taking it for a week and already am feeling better. Let me know if it helps anyone else. Barb",

      "Content": "I wanted to give you all an update on my hot flashes and what I am doing for them in the hopes that it will help someone else.  Have been on Arimidex for 10 months. The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G",

I am wondering if it is worth all this pain-there is no guarantee that in 5 years the breast cancer will not return!!! I too have been on this med for about 5 months. Joint and muscle pains are worse when I've been sitting for any period of time. I thought it was just me, but after reading all the messages it does make me feel a little better knowing I'm not alone. Not sleeping at night is awful to say nothing of the hot flashes. Am not sure if I can handle this for 4 1/2 more  years. Will talk to my oncologist when I see him next. Thanks for writing.  ",
