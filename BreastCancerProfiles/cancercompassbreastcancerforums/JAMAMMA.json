      "Content": "Hi,  I don't want to scare you,but I want to tell what as happened with my mom. She has had her yearly and for the past 3 years,they come back abnormal,but the ultrasound would come back ok. She would then go again 3-6 months later and it would be normal.Well this year,she had it in Aug. and come back abnormal again. Then, had biopsy with a clip placed. By Oct. her breast got swollen and red and the flag was raised. She was sent for another biopsy and sure enough she has cancer. Nov 14th is had a mastocomy and lymph nodes removed. I just found out today that the cancer has spread. I just wanted to tell you to have your doctor to do all possible to make sure you are cancer free. I don't want you to go through what we are!! Good Luck and God Bless",

      "Content": "Hi! Sorry to hear that you've gone through all that too. I realize that doctors are only human,but wonder where did all those years of schooling go.  Or are they too concerned about money, that they don't about their patients anymore?? With all of todays techology,this shouldn't be happening. Thanks,well.so far she's has 2 treatments. She goes once a week. So far,she hasn't had to bad of symthons except some nausea,stomach ache and always cold. Today, we went to for a consulation for the tumor in her brain. Doctor says it's cancer that spread from her breast. He wants another MRI to see if it's growing or spreading. Then he will decide want treatment to do. Only,it's by her Optic Nerve and she may lose her sight with treatment. I'ts going to be a hard call,so far her vision is OK. So yes, wish her luck!! I'll also keep you in my prayers. Take Care, God Bless.",

      "Content": "Hi! My mother has always had her yearly mammograms but this oct. Was diagnosed with cancer. For the past 3 years,every time her yearly would come back abnormal. But the ultrasound would come back ok. So then she would have it again in 3-6 months and they would come back normal till the next yearly. Well, when her breast got red and swollen the red flag finally raised. Now i just found out that she has stage 4 breast cancer ,and that it has spread i'm very angry that after many doctors and tests it didn't get found till now!!! She has not been feeling well for a year, now i know why! Has anyone else had the same experience??     But, this oct. Was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer  ",

      "Content": "Hi! Wow,sorry to hear what you've gone through. I just  don't know why it takes them so long to find it. I would think with todays techology, there should'nt even be anymore cancer. I've come to the conclusion that doctors today only think about the money and not the patient. Your right,your doctor probably didn't look at your scan.Cause about an month  ago,we took MRI disks to her family doctor and a specialist and they both said \"we don't read the disks\". Then,what the hell (excuse my french) are they for???? Finally,we found a specialist who read the disk,and also wanted the old one to compare. She also took them before the board to find the best trearment. I know that there's lots for cancer these days,but it doesn't make it any easier! Good Luck with everything. God Bless",
