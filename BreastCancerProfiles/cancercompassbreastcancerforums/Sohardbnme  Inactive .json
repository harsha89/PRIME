      "Content": "What to do Uuuggghhh.  When does it end?  I need support.  HELP, HELP, HELP. I had a lumpectomy on Wednesday June 30 Th and cancerous lymph nodes removed (auxiliary lymph nodes removal).  I have a Jackson Pratt drain.  My cc\u2019s is still over 100 in a 24-hour period (as of today). My pathology report states that my margins are not clear.  I do not want numerous surgeries (another lumpectomy).  I seen where people had to have the surgery twice after the first lumpectomy and ultimately had to get mastectomy anyway.  I am 37 this is turning my world upside down.  I am thinking about having a nipple saving masomectomy, if I qualify. Will I need another drain after the surgery?  I have an appointment on Wednesday to discuss my options, and to go over the pathology report with a fine toothcomb.  ",
