It sounds kind of crazy but it helped because i was going to beet it. take care! Hi Katrina! Thank you very much for your reply..I appreciate your encouragement and advice..It's just so scared of what to expect..What are the procedures that you have done after finding that you had the cancer tissue..Did you have the mastectomy or surgery to remove the lump..And how painfull was that..Sorry if i ask so much question, i just want to get this out of my chest because it's killing mentally and physically..I hope i can overcome this and praying for all of us here who are in the same predicament..May God protect us and keep us under his care..       ",

But everyone scenario is different. My mother was diagnosed two years prior to me and her cancer was the kind that don't spread so she had a lumpectomy. She had to have radiation a  small amount of chemo, i did not have to have radiation because their was nother to radiate because i had it all removed, breast, breast tissue and nipples, so i had reconstruction, with implants. And my mother and i are both survivor's and you will too, so don't be scared, and please ask any question at anytime. god bless you! Hi, Thank you very much for your info, it gives me some encouragement and not to be afraid..I don't know yet what my surgeon would say..The oncologist told me that i need to have a lumpectomy and radiation..But she said it depends what the surgeon would see inside..I hope and pray that he wouldn't find any more in other areas..How long is the lumpectomy and the radiation procedures done?..Was it painful?..How  long have you been a survivor?..Thanks again and God bless you!",

GOD BLESS! Hi again, rlinda - I had no lump before the biopsy. What happened was, a week after my annual mammogram, my gyn. asked me to return so they could get another image of my left breast. This confirmed the presence of microcalcifications. I had the stereotactic biopsy a few days later. Afterwards, I was black and blue, and the lump (hematoma) developed. I was scared this would interfere with the surgery, but my doctor reassured me it wouldn't. (P.S. My breast is swollen from the lumpectomy, but this is not unusual and the doctor said it would recede within a few weeks.) I'm truly sorry you're still in so much pain, and hope your doctor can help. Again, you are in my prayers. Please let me know how you are doing. Hi chitown, Your situation is just like mine..so maybe we will have the same journey from here on..Its just you, dont have the pain..So what's next for you..Are you going to have radiation?..Does your swollen from lumpectomy hurts or have pain?..I am praying for you!...Am calling now my dr's office for the lumpectomy schedule..I want this over so bad, its killing me mentally, emotinally and physically..I cant consentrate on anything..I'm sorry i am just a very weak person when it comes to this..Please understand!..I hope and pray that everything will go well with you..Please keep us inform about your development..Hugs and prayers..",
