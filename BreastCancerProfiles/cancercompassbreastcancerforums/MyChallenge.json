Please don't loose hope. There are a lot of help out there, especially for Alternative Medicine. One important thing about having cancer is to make your body strong,inorder for it to be ready to fight the cancer cells, as well as the treatment you have to go through. If you can manage to visit a Naturopathic Dr.Â  they can give you a lot of supplements that can help your body cope, and make your quality of life better and bearable. If you want more information, please let me know, I'm here to help. I am a breast cancer patient too.",
