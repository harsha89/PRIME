My surgeon said that with metaplastic carcinoma the recurrence rate is perhaps about 2% higher with a lumpectomy, but not a significant difference. I think it all comes down to personal choice and what you feel most comfortable with.  I am choosing to have the mastectomy because I feel (and my husband does, too) that my breasts and my looks are less important than my life and I will feel more comfortable knowing that the cancerous breast is totally gone. I am having the healthy breast removed also because I am large breasted and it throws you off balance and can cause back pain if left there.  Also, it will be easier to match breasts during reconstruction if I choose to reconstruct later on. As far as your needing chemo after surgery, I don't know what to tell you.  Every case is different and you really need to listen to what the oncologist tells you, but question him/her as to why he/she is recommending this path for you.  If you are uncomfortable with his/her recommendation then by all means seek a 2nd opinion.  I never got a 2nd opinion because what my doctors were telling me went right along with what I read in the books I have.  I first purchased Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and that provided me lots of useful information about every topic imaginable regarding breast cancer.  There are many other good resources out there also.  My doctor also had a couple of woman in the area call and talk to me about their experiences. It is my understanding that chemotherapy is not used to treat the local cancer in the breast - but rather to kill any cancer cells that may have spread to the rest of your body to keep it from metastasizing elsewhere. Chemo may seem scary, but they have so many drugs to counteract the side effects that it is a whole lot better than it used to be.   Please keep in touch and let me know how you're doing.  Again, I wish you the best! Chris       I had my surgery on the 7th of august as scheduled. God what an ordeal, had I known I was going to be so darn sore, I might of decided on the lumpectumy. I am black and blue all over my right shoulder and the top part of my arm.After the surgery I was bound up with an ace bandage, and 2 tubes with 2 plastic bulbs, to drain the blood were connected to my chest where the surgery took place. Yesterday was my followup appointment, and I had hoped to have the lab results back, and the blood drains removed. But unfortunately the lab results will not be back until this tuesday. And she will not remove the blood drains until it stops draining. I am a little bit concerned of the inconsisitent information my doctor is giving me. On the first meeting, I asked her if I had cancer through out my body. She informed me that she had taken out the cancer when she did the biopsy. I was very dissapointed that I did not get the lab results yesterday. So upon being a bit apprehensive, I again asked her if I \"could already have cancer spread through other parts of my body?\" she said \"well we won't know that until we get the lab results back?\"  She also informed me that when she took out my lympnodes, she discovored that they were all blue, and I had lymphnodeatosis. (I am not not sure if I spelled that right)? She thinks that perhaps lymphnodeatosis developed when she performed the biopsy. Then my daughter asked her why I was all black and blue on my left shoulder and upper arm? She said \"oh yes that just crossed right over, must of been from the blue dye I injected\" So many questions, yet so many avasive answers? Now I'm depressed, in pain, frusterated, and miserably sore?      ",

Are you black and blue as in bruising?  When my skin turned blue after the dye injection for my sentinel node surgery, it looked totally different than a bruising type of blue - it looked like medium blue tinted skin.  (My urine was that color for a couple of times, also!)   I am having my bilateral mastectomy on Friday (Aug. 22), so I'll be able to identify more with the pain you're experiencing after that.  My doctor said that it would be over a week before the drains could be removed - they could be removed once the drainage was less than 30 mL for two 24-hour periods.  Every case is different, so there is no telling how long that will take.  I'm sorry that it is taking so long to get back your test results.  It is my understanding that biopsying the lymph nodes helps to determine if the cancer has spread, but it isn't full-proof.  So your doctor is correct, he/she can't tell you if it has metatacized until the test results are back.  From my research, I gather that in most cases, with metaplastic carcinoma, the lymph nodes are negative.  Mine were, but we still did chemo to treat the rest of the body in case the cells had spread to other parts of my body.  This was because my lump was so large (5 cm).    I do hope that every day you are feeling better.  I've been trying my best to keep optimistic and positive about my upcoming surgery.  I know it will be tough, but I'll just take it one day at a time.  I can't question the choices I made to have the surgery and chemo because there's no turning back.  I just have to keep moving forward and work on healing.  I hope that you can do the same. Let me know how your test results turn out - I'm hoping for the best for you! Chris           I may of spelled lymphnodeatosis wrong. My daughter said she found it, and it was an infection of the lymphnodes. Yes I would say that the black & blue is from bruising. After the surgery, I was so dizzy and weak, I could barely standup or walk to the bathroom. I assumed that it was perhaps from loseing to much blood during the surgery. However my doctor informed me that I did not lose an unusual amount of blood during surgery. After having my blood tested, they discovered that I was anemic. Because I take thyroid and colesteral medicine I generally get my blood tested every 3 months. Unfortunately the clinic that was doing my ongoing blood tests missed that. I am sure that the surgeon would of wanted my blood built up, before performing this surgery. She told me to buy a tube of Arnicare to rub on the bruising & soreness. She said it would help with the soreness and the discoloration. My daughter finally found the Arnicare in the natural foods (harvest) department in Shaws.  I hope all goes well for you Chris, and I wish you luck with your surgery.

THis form of breast cancer is rare. I was not willing to take a chance that it had spread . The treatment is not bad. I had Chemo 20 years ago for Hodgkins disease and this is nothing like that.  It takes a while for the final diagnoses. There is really not much info out there. You need to talk with your Onc and Make a decision as to what you are able to handle. The treatment is only 4 times. For me, I needed the insurance thta I would be here to see my kids graduate. I was also node negative. 1.1cm and triple negative. Good luck.   I had my mastactomy on the 7th, and it was an ordeal of discomfort and pain. However I am pleased to say that all the lab tests came back negative. I am happy to hear that yours were negative as well. Good luck Barbara",

I will still need radiation because of the original size of the lump.   Like you, I had a very hard time finding information specific to metaplastic carcinoma.  None of the multitude of books I read had anything about it.  The only place I found information was through the Internet and that was lacking, too.  Some of the things I read were very discouraging and then other items I read resulted in good survival rates.  After getting totally frustrated I finally had to tell myself that each case is different and I really didn't know all of the facts so I couldn't compare myself to them.  I'm just me and I plan to beat this and be a long-term survivor!  This discussion board has been the most interesting to me because at least I know there are a few people out there with the same type of cancer who were just as confused and lacking information as I was. I had to put all my faith and trust in my team of doctors, who have been wonderful. Personally, I have responded very well to chemo and was not too bothered by the side effects.  Being 48 years old and in pretty good shape, along with a positive outlook has helped me get through these past 4 months without too much trouble.   It sounds like your tumor is pretty small and you caught it early, which is great!  I hope that can find the answers you are looking for and that all goes well with your treatment.  Please feel free to keep in touch with me, ask questions, or just vent your feelings if you need to through this discussion board. I've been there, am still in the process of being there, and am willing to help you in any way I can! I wish you the best. Chris   Thank you so much for responding Chris, Every little bit of information helps. As for me I am going to be 68 next month. It is also in my right breast, and I decided to go for the full masectomy. My daughter thinks having the a complete masectomy is a bit radical. However I am hopeing that if I do that I will not need to ever have any radiation. She did tell me that if she does the masectomy, it will never come back in that breast. But she said I might have to have some chemo after the surgery?",
