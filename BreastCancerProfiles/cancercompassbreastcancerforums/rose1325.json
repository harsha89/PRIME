      "Content": " Hi Tre,   Thank you so much for the information It is just what I needed.  I am Trying to get a second opinion .  Arimidex was poison and it didn't work I have so many side effects.  I am being offered Tamoxifin, Fulvestrant, and a clinical trial.  My oncologist does not talk about symptoms.  I get a sheet of paper and must selection the drug.  I need a new oncologist but Dana Farber is the best hospital around here.  Don't know where to go.   Sorry to whine.  You made me feel good and gave me some hope and for that I thank you.   Rose1325 On 2/4/2009 trehouse60 wrote: Hi Rose, I'm sorry to hear that the cancer had gotten into the peritoneal cavity.  I'm sure you've had much frustration trying to get diagnosed and treated. You can try using natural estrogen blockers and aromatase inhibitors - foods, herbs/botanicals, and over-the-counter supplements to treat your cancer.  They do the same things as the Tamoxifen and Arimidex, but are much gentler on the body, and have the benefit of providing other cancer-fighting components as well (antioxidants, proanthocyanidins, etc.)  I was able to lower my estradiol level from above 30 to below 5 with such a regimen, a combination of things such as grape seed extract, green tea, an aspirin a day, garlic, etc. You are welcome to take a look at what I did - I have posted my regimen on my blog.  The article is not intended as a prescription for others - everyone's body chemistry is different, and what works very well for one person may not be as effective for another.  But I am happy to provide information on the kinds of things women can use to block and inhibit estrogen from feeding cancer while providing nutrients that will work to attack and destroy cancer. I've also posted my story on my blog - why I took this route instead of aromasin, etc - if you want to take a look at that also my story http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor my regimen http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers There are six supplements that a lot of leading advocates of natural therapy recommend.  All six in combination are a powerful cancer-fighting too.  For someone who might choose to take only one or two of these, selenium is the most important: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  Drinking plenty of pure, fresh water is also of vital importance.  We need really good hydration to carry cancer-fighting compounds to the cells, and we need that same hydration to carry toxins and by-products of cancer cell death away.  Green tea is also an excellent detoxifier, as is bentonite clay. Essiac tea is also an excellent detox and anti-cancer choice.  Not as simple as using green tea.  You won't find it in my regimen, but if you do a search on CC for essiac tea, and look at the messages Shemay has posted, you will find the recipe and some great web links for essiac tea. Sincerely, Tre  ",

      "Content": " Hi Scrunch,   You are the only one I found with this cancer.  I am going to bring this message to my oncologist.  I was treated with taxol during my chemo.  It left me with numb hands and feet.  I don't know if she will do it again.  Aside from some fluid in the abdomen and pelvis the only see masses on the omentum of the piritoneal sac.  Like you afraid it will effect liver or kidneys.  Thank you for writing.  I am comforted just speaking with you and trehouse60.  I just got the news Thursday and feel sad and confused as to what to do.  My oncologist is abrupt and very busy.  It hard to ask a lot of questions.  I will do my research on line some more.  Once again thank you.  Rose On 2/4/2009 Scrunch wrote:   On 2/3/2009 rose1325 wrote: I need to select a treat ment for breast cancer stage 4 that spread to the omentum of the peritoneal lining.  My liver and other organs are all right but there is fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.  My doctor stopped arimidex and wants to put me on tamoxafin.  I wondered if there are any other options.   Tahnk you Hello Rose, I had breast cancer in 2001 and last July was diagnosed with Stage IV Peritoneal Carcinomatosis, which was traced to the breast cancer.  So far, it hasn't penetrated any internal organs, but it did crowd many of them.  My kidneys were swollen and the ureters were crimped, so they put stents in both ureters.  But to get to the point, I was first put on Arimidex, which didn't work.  Now they have me on Taxol infusions, which are working.  My tumor markers (last time they checked) have come down to 39, which is nearly normal.  I have 3 more infusions, and then they are going to do scans to see what is going on.  I so seldom hear about anybody else who has this that I had to contact you and commiserate about the situation.  I keep worrying about when it might penetrate any of the internal organs, especially the colon, because I don't want peritonitis.  Feel free to contact me any time to discuss our common condition.  Best wishes, Carolyn              ",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the info.  I had a pet scan and there are a lot of masses.  My doctor doesn't want to do a biopsy.  She \"sure\" its br er+.  I am going for a second opinion because cancer can change from positive to negative when it mets.  I want a biopsy.    There is an operation called HIPEC done for pertineal cancer but not for breast cancer peritoneal spread.  The results are fairly good. I know radio wave therapy is being used in Germany.  I am trying to avoid chemo because it didn't work very well and the side effects were horrific.  But I am afraid it will end up as my choice. Thank you for writing.  I learn a little more every day.  People are so kind to share their experiences.  It does help.   Hope you wife is doing well.  Rose  ",
