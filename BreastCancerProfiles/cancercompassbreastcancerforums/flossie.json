I currently have a lower back fravture which brought along other tests to see why this happened. My mamagram came out ok but my CAT scan showed suspicion in my breast along with 6-8 places in my spine, ribs, pelvic, etc. I have been reading a lot I want to start on treatment. I have been suffering with my broken bone in my back for 5 months and feel a lot of pain in the places the CAT scan showed disease. Should I start taking Immunopower, Ultramet, Polymvul or is there soething better. I think the doctors will give me a gloomy outlook but I want to start fighting back right now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Hi, Have you been given your diagnosis yet?  Your case sounds very similar to mine, depending on what type of cancer you actually have.  You can click on my profile to read about mine, but the bottom line for me is that having Stage IV LOBULAR breast cancer (which was determined by a biopsy to a couple of my vertibrae) is not such a bad thing, so don't panic.  I was diagnosed in July & thought I wouldn't have much time so I gave away a lot of things that I wish I had kept since I really feel just like I did before I knew I had cancer.... some aches & pains, but mostly just fine.  I have no symptoms at all & have been told I can \"live for years\" with this disease & that seems to be the way Stage IV lobular breast cancer works because I've heard from others who are the same. If your diagnosis is the same, I can go into more detail as far as treatment goes.  I'll be hoping for the best for you.  Write me....... Toni I also have breast cancer that spread to my liver and bone. I have not started treatment yet I have a vist with the Oncologist onThursday of this week. They are looking into hormone therapy. The crazy thing is I feel fine. Your case sounds similar to me, what treatment have you had? i was diagnoised with lobular cancer 2008 told by local hospital it hade spred all most every wear hade 2nd opinion after 2 mri scans  wear inconclusive i hade a pet ct scan witch came back clear i started on femara  and tumer shrank from 5 cm to 1cm i hade a lumpectamy but margins wear not clear so 1 month latter hade mastectmy 9 out of 16 lymph nodes wear affected hade 6 rounds of cemo and felt very ill hade to have dose lowerd and after thate 6 weeks of radiotherapy started felling mutch better just after xmas 2009 went on hol when i got back started having pain in right arm went to see onc sergested mri was told some cancer in neck but told to have another pet ct witch all so came back clear now 7 months on got bad back pain onc sugested bone scan all showed hot spots told to have another pet ct  again came back clear but told i hade 2 collapesed veterba wet last week for talk with onc to be told thay hade been told lobular cancer does not show very well on pet ct i wish thay wood have told me thate befour just hade spine mri told that can see some cancer going to see onc tomoro i am very disalogend and witch scan do you belive has eny one els hade simular situation sory about long post  flossie",

Dx 2/11, had laser surgery partial mastectomy.  No way I could do the slice and dice and mutilation.  Got fantastic results, clear 2 in margins, no pain, no cutting, no disfigurement.  Scans showed ribs, pelvis and spine tumor, plus nodes in chest, and liver.   I started Zometa and Femara.  Of course told the 2 yr survival, maybe more w/trmt. Well, just had CT scan 6/6/11 - my doc shocked!  No involvment, all tumors disappeared, only one left on my spine and it is reduced 60%.  I've only been on Zometa & Femara 90 days prior to this last scan....but, I take lots of supplements that I feel help...especially the Curcumin/Tumeric and Indole3 with Carbinol, plus lots more....Also, don't give a figs seed what doc's or medical say, I do the Asparagus religiously....Green Giant or Organic canned, bring to boil, puree in blender, cool in ref, take 2 -3 tsps twice day, been doing this 5 mo's., Also take Bicarbonate Soda w/Honey or Maple Syrup (Maple Syrup usage needs cooking, so I use Honey), 1 part Bicarb to 3 parts Honey, 1 Tblsp twice daily.  Who knows, it won't kill me, and something sure worked.   I cannot believe, and neither could my oncologist, but i'm sitting pretty.  Will continue w/regimine and go for scan again in Jan or Feb.  Don't give up, but Don't be too quick with the chemo....once your immune system is destroyed with chemo, there is no going back, from all i've researched,  chemo doesn't really help breast cancer...do some research, only 2% chance, you'll do better with naturopathic, but must be your research and your choice.   Do read Suzanne Somers Book..Knockout.   Keep positive.  hi my mum has bc stage 4  hade lumpectamy and mastectomy in sep 08 followed by chemo and radiotherapy started geting bone pain and pet /ct showed no cancer but bone scan showed bone involvment took famera for 17 monthes and then hade mri showed it hade grown started on tamox scan 3 months later showed it hade grown a little so changed meds to aromosin last mri in may 2011 showed meds are working due 3 scans later this month sorry for long post as i have never done this befoure mum is 70 her cancer is er pos pr neg her2neg on reading your post you seid about bicsrb and maple syrup i am very intersted as i have been told to give my mum bicsrd and molasses toil cancer can not live in oxagen told to test ph levels and to try and get them to 8only thing i was worried about is can it harm the cancer drugs your taking does eny one know more about this many thanks",
