I am lost about diffrent oppinions.. any one that is just taking meds and no chemo or surgery .. I am getting very frustarated here..  sabine Sabine,      Have you tried any alternative treatment? Have you checked your vitamin D Level?  I have read chemo really doesn't work for breast cancer in the long run, may shrink the tumor but there is a price to pay down the road. Chemo may awaken the hypernating stem cells of the cancer years later. Have your tried this combination, pomegranate extract, 5000 IU of D and wheat germ extract? The same faulty gene(BRAC 2) causes breast and prostate cancer. Hope this helps Dan",

Also stay away from all soda pops. As far as meat and diary products I eat and drink only organic products. I do eat lean meat but it must be organic, I want to get away from growth hormones and diseases like ecoli. As far as vegtebles and fruits organic is a must. I also want to stay away from pesticides and genetically altered food. My water must filtered from flouride and other chemicls. Hope this helps Dan",

Personally I started with a holistic MD, that get me on the right track. What I discovered and added was luck, a higher power who knows. The basics are the essiac tea, vitamin C, D, pomegranate extract. Diet is very important. If you would like more information please visit my web site www.alternativeprostatecancer.com Dan",

Some where between 70 to 90 percent of senior citizens are deficent in Vitamin D. In fact most cancer patients are deficent in D. I take anywhere from 5000 to 10,000 IU of D daily. I can't see where it would interfere with tamoifen, but ask your doctor or better yet research it yourself. As far as where you get it, most health stores carry it or you could buy it online. Be sure it contains D 3. You should have your vitamin D level checked with a simple blood test. Dan",
