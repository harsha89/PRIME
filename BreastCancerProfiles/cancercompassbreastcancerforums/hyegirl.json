    "Content": "Gator, et al, How did it turn out? Are you still clean after 4 years. I have a similar situation and am starting this coctail next week. My Oncotype DX was only 14 but I had one lymph node involved, the tumor was only grade 1 and 1.5 cm but with DCIS. My oncologist first said he didn't think I needed chemo, but, there's a trial going on to determine if chemo actually helps when the Oncotype is low and there is only 1 lymph node involved. The test is only currently used when there is no lymph node involvement. So, I decided to join the trial and my 50/50 chance means I get the chemo. My intuition says to not do it and improve my health instead but the thought of matastisis makes me okay with doing the chemo. Any opinions on this?",
