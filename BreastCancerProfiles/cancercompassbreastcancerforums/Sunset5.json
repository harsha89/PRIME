    "Content": "No, you are not nuts.  I have read quite a bit about this, and talked to a few people about it.  It's actually more common than you think.  In most cases, the nurses and chemo staff are so very nice, they understand what you are going through and they are loving, caring, and supportive.  Those of us who have cancer, often feel cut off because no one understands what we are going through.  When you are receiving chemo treatments, you feel like you have a team, a cheering section so to speak and when it is over, you can feel very lonely and isolated.   Find another cheering section.  It is so important to stay feeling connected.  Join a group of survivors.  Connect with people who understand you and with people you can cheer on as well.  It's so nice to surround yourself with caring people who understand.  Ask your nurses and the staff where you get your chemo if they know of any groups that you could join for support.  You can also send thank you cards to the staff and try to stay connected by sending them little updates.  I'm sure it makes their day when a patient cares enough to send a card now and then.   You are not nuts.  You are right on track.  Take care of yourself and do find another place where you can connect.  It's good for you and you will be good for the group you connect with.  When we reach for a hand to pull ourselves up, we are also pulling up the person who extended the hand. Best wishes in your treatment and recovery.  You sound like a very special person with a lot to offer to other survivors.   Sunset5",
