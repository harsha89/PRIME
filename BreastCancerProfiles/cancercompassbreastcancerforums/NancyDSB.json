      "Content": "Thank you for the wonderful input. My Onc loves natural supplements too. I did 5 years of Tamoxifin for my first round of BC.. I am no longer Er/Pr positive now. So hormonal therapy is not an option. My markers are nearly clear and free. last Pet/CT show stable on all areas of Bone Mets, which are innumerable. My arm is the worst for discomfort. I just do not like taking higher levels of Percocet. With a family of 4 , and very active in after school , I need to be clear headed during late afternoon/eveing. Luckily the 2 oldest drive, but attend college nearby. Thankfully. My 3rd started Ohio State in Sept ( thank goodness for her athletic ablity and Scholarship. She is a Lacrosse Goalie. My yougest a junior in HS only has permit. Sorry for the long winded response. I am grateful you took the time to respond so quickly and with great information. Original BC 11/2004  ACT Radiation Herception 1yr. Tamoxifin 5 Yrs. 2nd Diagignosis 11/2011  presented as a massive Plueral Effusion, Surgery to remedy that. Chemo Abraxane 3 months, Herception 1/3 weeks , Zometa monthly. I just wasnt sure what other chemo could be used to replace Tykerb. The Tykerb rep even said he had never heard of such severity to medication. Oh well, I am a fighter and will much thru the fields of war to overcoe this too. With a loving supoort from family and friends is a tremendous help to me.",
