It continues, in an abated, come and go way, ever since. I have done acupuncture and massage, but it still hangs on. Stretching and advil help. Drs say it is muscle pain, not a sign of cancer. Has anyone else had this lingering pain? I finished chemo in April. took chemo in 1991 didn't have back pain until 10 years later and it has just gotten worse, I can only sleep 2 hours at a time and the back pain wakes me no pills so far have helped much. The chemo will be out of my system this May thank God",
