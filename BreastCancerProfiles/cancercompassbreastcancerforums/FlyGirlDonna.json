      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about you sister. I too have stage IV BC. for 8 years. Have you looked into Cancer Treatment Centers of America? I went to the one in Chicago. ( they paid for the flight for me and my friend) I did some research and the Chicago branch has the best BC Dr.s. They treat the whole person not just with drugs but with nutrition, counseling, and much more. I did go for the consult but decided to try a study drug here in Florida. Leaving them for my ace in the whole. Your sister still has many options and if anyone gives her a time line left for her life then she needs to see someone else.",

      "Content": "Hi Partner, I am stage IV BC survivor and have been on the roller coaster for 11 years. Your wife is morning many things. Not only the loss of her woman hood but the thought of maybe not being around to see your children grow and have lives of their own. It takes time and when she is ready you both should join a support group. It was a relief for me to see a room full of bald women just like me when I was going through my Chemo. You learn to cope from people who have been there and are still here. It does get better. It just takes time and she has plenty of it. Hope this helps. Also my husband felt better when he was helping new partners cope.",

      "Content": "CAC, Sorry to hear about your pain. Doesn't this just suck! I'm on a study drug called Sutent (antiangeogenisis drug). In the last month I have been out of bed maybe 7 times because of the pain. Now they have lowered the dosage and given me pain pills. Swell. Hey, if it works.....what can you do. I haven't had my scans yet but I had a lump on my rib the size of a golf ball and now it is the size of a pea. That is in just 1 month. Hopefully with the lower dose the pain will subside. I was on Famera for 5 years and it kept everything in check so I know it works but if the pain is too great for you there are many alternatives. Good luck, D",
