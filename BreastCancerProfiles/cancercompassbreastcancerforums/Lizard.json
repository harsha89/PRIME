    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with Amyloidosis 12-07, and started treatment in Jan. 08. I've been taking Dex. 4mg, 10 tabs four days on every four weeks with chemo Melphan. Hopefully June will be my last round for a while. It does cause high anxiety, and increases appetite. I take anti-anxiety pill as needed mostly to sleep. I've already been taking something for nausea as needed. I also have Amy in my soft tissue causing rapid reduction in the cartilage, and developingÂ severe Arthritis in most of my joints. I already had to have my right hip replaced. The Dex. definitely helps with the pain and inflammation. Hope this information helps, Take Care, Liz Reddy aka:Lizard",
