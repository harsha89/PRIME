    "Content": "I finished chemo in oct of last year.My hair is coming back curly and not manageble. It feels like it is synthetic hair andÂ  cannot do anything with it. Heat does not do anything for it. i have patches where i feel 100 hair came out of a single hair follicle. It is just a mess and I am very depressed as the result. I really dont know what people do after chemo.I have no friends who had chemo before and so I am desperate for more info. How long will I suffer and will it go backto waht it used to be?",
