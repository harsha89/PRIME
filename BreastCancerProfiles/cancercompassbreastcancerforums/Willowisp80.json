    "Content": "I am also new to this site. I just started taking this drug in June. At fist I was fine but recently I've been having pains. I wake up several times a night with pains in my arms and fingers. If I get up and move around it seems to get better, even now just typing this I'm feeling pain. I didn't know what it was but now I'm wondering if it is this. I have an appointment with my surgeon on Tuesday and will discuss this with him at that time.",
