      "Content": "Dear Gregory, I found this information very powerful. Can I ask exactly where you found this? I would like to show this to my oncologist, but he will want to know exactly where this was posted, and who wrote it. There seems to be so many woman at my doctor's office who are constantly recurring, and this would explain it. But he won't listen unless he knows that I got it from a reliable source. Any webpage that you could list, or the actual study that this came from would be very helpful. Also, I am currently on a taxane, but it is not shrinking my tumor. After reading this, I don't want to continue to on it, especially if it is not working. This article sure makes sense as to why so many women are recurring. They are all on Taxotere or Taxol! Thanks for posting this! MITZI",

      "Content": "Hi Rett,   I agree, I think you need to see another doctor. I have been through breast cancer, so has my sister, and now she is suffering from a recurrence. She thought she had a rash on her chest, but when her surgeon took a couple of nodules, they were positive for cancer. She is going to start chemo soon. But she had to see another doctor before she felt OK about doing it. It's ALWAYS best to get a second opinion. No harm in it, and most insurances cover it. The best thing that could happen would be that you will find a better doctor. The worst thing that could happen is that you will find out that your doctor is the same as many of them. But if I were you and you have access to other doctors, I would see as many as possible (get recommendations from other patients, surgeons, oncologists, etc. that you like) and pick the one you feel best with. I LOVE my oncologist and surgeon, and I am doing great. Good luck and my prayers are with you. It will all work out as it should. God Bless,   mitzi ",
