    "Content": "Last year within a few weeks after getting my annual mammogram, tiny stretch marks appeared all over my breasts and have not gone away.  This was not surprising in view of the extremely tight painful compression that was used on my small breasts.    I am to the point where I do not want to have another mammogram and am looking for alternatives.   The whole process is barbaric and for someone as small as myself who has fibrocystic disease, it seems as if taking already stressed tissue and traumatically \"squashing\" and radiating it is not the best screening tool to be used.  Has anyone else had stretch marks appear after a mammogram and also what alternatives are out there for us small breasted women?",
