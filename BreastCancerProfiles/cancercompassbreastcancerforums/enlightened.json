      "Content": "Have been on Femara for about 3 years followng 18 mos on Tamoxifin.  Have  just beome stiff and have some joint pain-bearable but uncomfortable.  What do you know about the dangers  to joints etc. of continuing with this.  am 73 and have osteopenia.very mild.  Dr. has suggested i discontinue for a month  to see if pain goes away -- possibly pain is some form of arthritis,osteoporis  and aging.  Concerned about not taking the drug for fear of recurrence.  After 1 month  and  outcome might change me to arimodex or return to femara.  Comments????thanks",
