But in the last 2 months I have been suffering from swollen feet and ankles. I can't even wear heels anymore. I see my oncologist this week. Something I will discuss with her. I mean is better than having my cancer return. But still, not sure how iwill fare with 4 more years of this. ",

Thanks for any input. Robin I've been on arimidex now for 7 months. The first few months no bad side effects.  Now my joints and bones hurt. My feet, knees and hands hurt all the time.  Mainly when I'm in one position for more than 30 minutes. This includes sleeping. Will discuse with my onco tomorrow. Ughh. Hang in there..I hope u don't have any more than what u have now. Good luck. ",
