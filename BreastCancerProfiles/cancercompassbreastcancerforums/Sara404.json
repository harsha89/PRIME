    "Content": "I recently found a website that has many testimonials from forum members who overcame advanced cancers with a plan that has helped people with many health conditions. It has a strong track record of success. It's a matter of eating the healthiest foods for the cells of our bodies and eliminating the unhealthy foods. Unfortunately, the typical American diet is full of unhealthy processed food products. This healing plan was created by a brilliant bio-chemist & health practitioner who worked with thousands of cancer patients over a 50 year period. The site is at http://www.budwigvideos.com   Click on 'Testimonials' in the Menu. There are several messages from people who had agressive breast cancer with mets to the bones, etc.  They got well with this program.  ",
