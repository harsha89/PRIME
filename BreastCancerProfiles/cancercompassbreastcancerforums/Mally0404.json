I know some of these side effects could happen but what I find weird is that everything began after my chemo, hair did not begin to grow until end February, numbness in fingers and toes in January, and nails in February also... any response would be greatly appreciated.  Regards    Mal",

      "Content": "My mother who is 92 has had breast cancer for the last 9 years, she has had no treatment except for taking tamoxifin for the first 5 years, (this was her decision). Her cancer is in both breasts and she has not been uncomfortable due to the cancers since the beginning. Unfortunately 3 weeks ago her doctor called to tell me that the tumor has surfaced and that they are thinking of a mastectomy. I checked the site of the tumor and the skin opening is smaller than a pin head and very little discharge from it. I am the one who has to make the decision of what to do due to the fact that my Mom was diagnosed 5 years ago with Alzeimer's and I am the one who will be making the final decision of what to do. It is not an easy decision and her doctor is pressuring me to meet with a surgeon to have the breast removed. I am worried that she may have more complications from the surgery, if she survives the surgery, than without. Can someone please give me some kind of information? Thank you very much.",

      "Content": "Dear Joanne: Thank you so much for your kind words of encouragement. In no way have you offended me, on the contrary you have encouraged me and you being in the same situation as I dealing with decision making for someone else is not an easy task. I too have a daughter who is intellectually challenged, what a coincidence, and I also think on a daily basis of what to do in her case also. I am very sorry to hear of your sister having this terrible disease as such a young age, but I agree with you 100% that her comfort is what is most important. I have made my decision as to go with quality and not quantity of life and I would like my mother's remaining time with us to be as happy and memorable as possible. I too feel as you do that the surgery to remove the breasts would cause more harm than good and what is to say she would actually be able to tolerate the operation. Once again Thank you so much for your kind words and may God bless you and your family in dealing with your sister's situation. Mary",

      "Content": "Dear Lou: Sorry to read your story and I only wish you the best. From reading your message I found that you had answered your own questions. You have many questions regarding the oncologist, the hospital, and especially being told 2 years ago you had cancer 'somewhere in your sytem' but never found????? I would strongly suggest a second opinion and find an oncologist and a hospital that you are confortable with and who can answer all and any questions you may have. My daughter was diagnosed just before Christmas with Lymphoma and we have a hospital 15 minutes from our home but once we met with the oncologist and his team we did not feel comfortable with that hospital so we now travel over two hours every other week to another hospital and we do not regret our decision at all. We know that all the questions we ask are answered and we have wonderful support from the oncology nursing staff. Go where your heart leads you and as they say the 1st decision is always the best. Best of luck and hope to hear back from you. God Bless and I have added you to my prayer list. Mally",
