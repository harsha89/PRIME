Maybe I should just quit reading so much, huh? ha ha Thank you for any info k I have been diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 in December 2007.  I am also her2 positive.  I had about a third of my left breast removed and had a second surgery to remove the rest of the lymph nodes  in that area and under my arm as they found a small tumor on one of the lymph nodes under my arm after the first surgery.  I have been treated very agressively since January 2008 with 7 chemo treatments ( sceduled for 8, but could not tolerate the last one) and 34 radiation treatments.  I was given herceptin in smaller amounts during my regular chemo treatments.  Now, I go every three weeks for a two hour drip of herceptin along with a Femora chemo tablet daily.  However, I was told this herceptin can only be used by individuals that have a certain type of cancer and they have to be her2 positive.  I understand the herceptin actually targets and kills any of these tumor cancer cells in your body.   I have regular blood tests that will tell if I have this type of cancer cells in my body.  You might ask your doctor about that.  If you need it, I will find out the name of the test.  So far, so good!  I hear unbelievable survival stories at the cancer center I go to, even with stage four cancer.  I do know trying to keep a positve attitude is healing, but sometimes it is a struggle to keep positive.  Ten years ago, you and I might not have survived with this diagnosis.  Great strides have been made concerning breast cancer, and I am greatful and thankful to God.  I know I am going through this for a reason.  Hopefully, a really good reason.  Good luck to you and I hope this helps.

After three tries I found a surgeon who agrees that it was my choice to have the risky (to me) surgery and he agreed to make an appointment with an oncologist for further consultation. Good luck for me as this oncologist put me on Arimidex.  It has been four years with absolutely no side effects and best of all all according to a recent MRI there is no sign of the cancer I had previously.  I have seen a cardiologist and my blood pressure was determined to be part of a heart problem - and the blood pressure and the heart problems are now controlled by medication and I have been saved from a possibly deadly heart attack.  And both breasts are still intact. Why is this treatment not offered to all women hormone sensitive cancer? My experience leads me to believe the surgeons have more control of breast cancer treatment than they should.  All options should be available to patients along with the physicians personal opinions.  If a women is willing to pay for a consultation with an oncoligist she should be able to - before surgery.  I think patients should be given hard cold facts as well as options for treatment.   Dear Zanney, I would guess most people are in a state of shock when they are told they have breast cancer or any cancer for that matter.  It was a rush thing with me as I had a fast growing tumor and time was important.  I was told I did not have any other options.  Was your cancer invasive? I tried to get as much information as possible before my surgeries were done, but like you I was not getting answers to the questions I was asking.  My surgeries were done by \"the best\" in the area, but the majority of her answers  to my questions were, \"It is what it is.\"  I was puzzled at this answer.  I found that many people experience different after effects during and after chemo that the doctors will tell you minimal until you call and complain about joint pains, sickness, fatigue and other problems.  I finally told my doctor I wanted to know everything when my body began to shut down during the original agressive chemo treatments.  The doctors do a great service to most of us, and I know that.  I would most certainly not be sending this if they had not rushed treatment for me.  ",

There is more information right here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0F__IfeUXg God Bless Thank you, I will be sure to watch.   CAC",

I went through most of what you went through and I have been taking the Femara for almost a year.  Th pain in my right hand is really bad at times, and I have it in my other hand, knees, shoulders and ankles.  I constantly drop things, have a hard time opening bottles and lifting things.  Sweeping, lifting a pot, trying to support a coffee cup can become a real chore.  I can't peel things anymore without lots of pain. I hate being this way, but I just have a good cry and push on.  I make myself get up and get moving.  I work at home, a lot, but I do go into the office on a regular basis.  I am sure your feelings are normal, but be sure you keep your doctor informed.  Best of luck to you!  Ann",

Thanks Leeanne Hi Leeanne, I had back to back surgeries, also.  I had a lump and the regular node removal as standard, I think five nodes.  After lump and nodes were sent off for evaluation, one of the nodes had a small tumor.  I had surgery to remove the rest of the nodes under that arm.  I was diagnosed with invasive BC, stage two.  I went through all the chemo and radiation treatments. I am not sure if you are asking about pain or distortion on the mamo's or both or if what they are saying is correct.  I have  tenderness and pain in the breast where I had surgery .  The doctors say it is from the radiation as I had 34 treatments.   I don't know about the distortion on the mamo.  I have never heard of that type of an explanation, but it could most certainly be correct.  However, I would definitely seek a second opinion as to what is going on.  Good luck, Ann",

Your iron supplement probably isn't doing you much good.  The human body can only really absorb about 18 mg of supplemental iron a day.  Much better to try eating foods that are rich in iron PLUS a lot of other elements, such as antioxidants, the B vitamins, vitamins C, D and E.  Lots of calcium and other trace minerals.  The closer you can get to a vegetarian diet, the more likely you are to be eating foods that will provide the essential nutrients that have been bleached out of your body by all the treatments. Also important to make sure you're drinking plenty of fresh  pure water.  Hydration is key to rebuilding the blood stream and immune system, as well as detoxification of all the by-products of chemo and cancer cell death. Unless you are on a blood thinner, green and black tea are excellent choices for detoxification - get decaf, so that you aren't peeing out all the fluids when you drink. Eat plenty of fruit - an apple a day, any kind of berries (avoid pomegranate if you had hormone positive cancer,) citrus fruits and tomatoes.  Avoid bananas - they have way too much sugar in them.  Green leafy veggies, cruciferous veggies, and legumes (whole grains and beans) are vital.  Eat as much organic raw fresh foods as you can. Also make sure you are getting enough essential fatty acids.  Many people recommend flax seed oil or fish oil, but I think those need to be used with caution.  Flax seed oil is very high in phytoestrogens - if you had a hormone positive cancer, this might not be a good choice.  I'm also concerned about fish oil because of the extreme pollution in all of earth's bodies of water.  Roasted pumpking seeds are a delicious, nutritious alternative - a handful a day will provide ALL the omega fatty acids an adult needs per day, plus 14 gm plant protein.  I have a recipe for roasting green pumpkin seeds on my blog:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/search?q=pumpkin+seeds There are also articles on the B vitamins, vitamin c, supplements, etc, etc, etc.  Please feel to read anything that interests you.  Take a look at the recipe for lemon volcano drink (enter that in the blog search box to get that article.)  It is really nutricious and an EXCELLENT detoxifier. Sincerely, Tre Thank you for your advise.  I will print it out and try some of the things you suggested.  Some of them I am already doing.  I am interested in the Lemon Volcano drink. I am hormone positive.  That is why I was able to take the herceptin drip for a year. I wonder why my occologist would tell me to take that much iron if it was not going to do any good? Thank you again for responding. Ann ",

Ann It took me about 5 months to start regaining my energy and strength back.  So hang in there. Also, Femara isn't a chemo drug - it's a hormone suppressor.   It has been known to have a lot of severe effects including fatigue for over 32% of the women taking it.  II have been on it for a month now, and so far I have no side effects.  Side effects can start up months after you start on it.  For some women the side effects are so severe that they stop taking it even though they know it's prolonging their life. Talk to your doctor about the fatigue because it's hard to know whether it's the chemo or the Femara.  Carolyn Carolyn, Thank you for responding.  I did not know Femara was a hormone suppressor.   Now, I understand a little more of what is going on.  I was sure the doctor called it chemo tablets.  No other doctor has ever corrected me when I told them what I was taking.  I did see my regular doctor this week.  He said my blood count is still a little low, and I have some thyroid issues, now.  This explains the extreme fatigue.

Thanks Donna Hi Donna, I am currently experiencing bone pain in several of my joints and expecially in my hands.  I am on Femara and an every three week herceptin drip.  My doctor seems to think it might be the herceptin drip as it is a stong dose.  He wants me to start having a weekly dose of this drug.  However, I went to a web site called www.askapatient.com and put in the Femara drug (chemo tablets)  and found all kinds of individuals experiencing the same joint pains I am having.  I believe it is the Femara, but will try the weekly dose of herceptin and see if it helps. If this does not work, alternatives are changing my chemo meds to a less effective drug or going on joint medication.  All I need is one more drug!  I also had terrible joint pain with my initial drip chemo treatments, but the pain went away when I finished the chemo cycles and started the radiation treatments. One of the things I am doing to help the pain is water arobics.  It has really helped my knee pain. Good Luck! CAC  ",
