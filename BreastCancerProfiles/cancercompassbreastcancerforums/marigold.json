Had the lumpectomy and setinal lobe disection last week and now have to wait until next week and meet with the oncologist to find out what the next step is going to be. My husband has been very supportive through all this but i feel guilty putting him through this. We have been married just over a year and now all this. I don't know that I want to go any farther with treament. I have been cut open 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I am feeling very sick when i look at my scares, I know they are new and they will fade but right now I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to scream.  Intamacy has become a thing if the oast since all this has started and I think that is the hardest part of all this, I need to feel close to my husband, i need hito touch me and love me the way he used to before I got sick. How so I relay this to him without pushing him. It is going to happen sooner then later that I will not physically be able to love him and feel close to him but now while I can he is scared. Does anyone have any advice for me or encouraging words of wisdom. I need something to hold on to right now.  Thanks for listening. Hi, Tomslady, I am sorry to hear of your recent diagnosis. I had only been remarried a few years when I too was diagnosed. I just finished chemo, after having a left lumpectomy. Next, radiation. In addition I am receiving an IV adjuvant medication every three weeks until next March. Please, do not lose hope. Your treatment time is only a little investment to insure the rest of your life will be long and healthy. Good attitude goes a long way...You maust come to peace with your scars if you want your husband to. We are both very lucky to have supportive husbands. Don't get bogged down in the GUILT...he sounds like a blessing. Give him a kiss and a big hug! He is being a good husband and partner. Marigold  ",
