      "Content": "Hi, Rett, Look up information on inflammatory breast cancer.  It doesn't usually show up on mamograms because it grows in \"sheets\", not lumps.  Symptoms include redness, rash, \"orange peel\" thickening, tiching, swelling and pain.  It progresses quickly.  If you have this, contact me for more information based on my friend's recent experience. I hope for the best outcome for you.",
