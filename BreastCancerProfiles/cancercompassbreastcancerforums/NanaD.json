      "Content": "I've been on it for about 18 months. My biggest complaint is the joint pain in knees and hips and the fact that I feel like I'm 90 years old. I was post menopausal when I started. My BC was invasive lobular carcinoma, Stage 1, Grade 1, 1 cm in size, no lymph node involvement. I did not have to have chemo or radiation. I feel very blessed. I've been reading What Your Doctor May Not Have Told You About Breast Cancer by Dr. John R. Lee. I'm just not convinced the Letrozole is really necessary or going to make that much of a differnece in recurrance possibility. I'm just trying to weigh all my options.",
