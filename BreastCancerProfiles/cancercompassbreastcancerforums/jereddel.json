      "Content": "I think my cancer was caused by a multitude of wrong choices that I did not realize (at the time) were wrong.  Shortly after I was diagnosed I had a visit from the ACS.  During the visit this representitive named numerous reasons that this could have happened.  At least 75% of what she said, I had experienced.  Right down to birth control pills for a short time, experimental drugs (legal) from the 70's, diet, lifestyle, and the fact that I had \"female\" problems since early 30's.  I am now 62.  I have NO history of BC in family.  But lots of history of cancer of various kinds.  The strongest being Prostrate Cancer.  At least 3 generations of men in my family have died or been treated for it.  There is some research out there that link it to BC and OVC.  My diet has always been \"better than most\" but high in (clean) foods, veggies and fruits, little dairy, little processed, little surgar.  Not a lot of fast food. I have always been within normal weight.  I started my period at a normal 14 yrs of age.  In my early 30's I started having probs w/period, heavy flow, clots, had hystorectomy,  at that time I had a low estrogen patch and B12 shots.  Not long after I discontinued all with no probs.  Still had overies.  Several years later had overies removed during a neccessary other female surgery.  It was then that I went on Premarin.  That was 15 years ago.  In Oct, 2015 I was diagnosed with BC.  It was found during a mamo, I nor Drs had ever felt anything!  It was stage IIa, 2.1 cm, no lymph involvment, ER PR positive, aggressive.  But it was contained.  Treatment was surgery, no chemo, no rad.  Just hormone therapy which was Arimrdex.  I am happy to say no side effects.  I started having hot flashes and night sweats when I went off Premarin, did not get worse.  No more bone pain that I had before. I have had some neck pain but I attribute that to more time on computer talking to all you guys!  Yes Chiro can help that!  Wish you all well!",

I came across this site and a particular thread to do with diseases and smell when I was googleing what the hell is going on with me... I was hoping maybe you guys might be able to help... I don't have cancer - that I am aware of but I am in pretty bad shape health wise I have an underactive thyroid for which I take thyroxine and a lot of bladder issues since my pregnancy with my now 2 and a half year old - constant infections (or infection type symptoms) for which I take antibiotics daily to control. I also have fibomyalgia and endrometriosis. I have had a total of 10 pregnancys with 5 live births, history of miscarrage, seveer pre-ecclamsia and still birth. I am 99% certain I don't have diabetes. So I'm a pretty run down and battered old bird now lol. Anyway, to cut to the chase - lately, I blinking stink and it is getting me down, I am clean and shower everyday, sometimes twice a day, but this doesn't seem to keep the smells at bay completly. The WORST time is in the mornings, EVERY morning :( and my husband being very tactful loves to walk in and wake me by telling me how bad the room smells whilst flinging open the windows! (We sleep in seperate rooms)  I can't even describe the smell, It's like a mix of onions, fish and urine but it's also quite sweet if that makes sense... it seems to permiate from my every orafis (please excuse the bad spelling - no spell check...) from my armpits, dowwn below and my breath - the smell is so bad I can never completly rid my bedroom of it. This morning I was thinking it's starting to have a hint of a smell like a really old person smell, if you know what I mean... I'm sorry it's vauge, I can't really describe it any better... I am starting to feel, smelling like this, that something somewhere is very, very wrong. It's not like I sweat excessivly through the night, I sleep with my ceiling fan on even through winter and a thin quilt, if I am any warmer than that I get dreadful night sweats where I wake up completly drenched. This sounds silly but they say dogs smell things... I have been completly avoiding dogs for a long time because whenever they greet me they stick there nose right in my down below region (which i assumed is linked to my infection problems) but now because of my smelliness... well I'm worried... Does anyone have a clue what might be going on? I'm sorry if I am posting in completly the wrong place or if i offended anyone... and that its so long but I am starting to worry about Cancer, the only reason I'm not totally freaking out about it is because I can't seem to stop gaining weight - as opposed to loosing it.... thanks in advance xx You might benifit from reading the thread on \"Cancer smells\".  I, as well as some others noticed changes in \"our\" smell prior to our diagnosis.  You did not mention your age but referred to yourself as an \"Old Bird\" and also \"an old person smell\".  I worked with seniors for over 15 years, many different ailments, never noticed an \"old person\" smell.  However specific ailments do have specific smells.  Your chronic infections could be some of the problem.  If you take fish oil that can sometimes cause an odor.  When you say lately, what is your timeframe?  Several of us noticed \"the smell\"  Several months before.  We all understand your frustration, no amount of showering gets rid of it.  I could taste the smell when I breathed through my mouth.  I believe it is true what they say about dogs.  I am making arrangements to visit the homes of some friends with dogs to see their reaction.  If you are gaining weight that could be your thyroid.  How long has it been since you were seen by a Dr.?",

Perhaps a month or 2 before the diagnosis I smelled a \"sweet cream corn\" scent when I took off my underpants. Since it wasn't unpleasant I didn't pay much attention. But, it hasn't recurred since the lumpectomy. I never mentioned it to anyone. MsTabbyKats  I have the same diognosis as you, same timeline as you and as you I noticed a change in my body odor a couple of months before my diagnosis.  Most with underarm odor.  I am 62 years old and hadn't had to wear deodorant for many years.  Just before I retired I noticed the change so I started wearing deodorant again.  The day after my retirement We left for a 3 wk trip to Az, to where we plan to retire.  The smell continued.  Didn't get worse until Nov when I had my surgery.  After it was so strong I couldn't stand it.  Even if I breathed thru my mouth I could taste it.  It was more the sickly sweet as some describe here.  Def not the rotting smell of decaying flesh.  I did mention it to my surgeon and he said he had never heard of it before.  It got better as I healed but never really went away.  Now it seems to be getting stronger again and doesn't matter if I need to bathe or not.  Haven't had chemo or rad yet.  It does concern me.  I see my onco next week.  I will be asking him about it.  He has been in the business since late 70's.  I also plan to visit all of my friends that have dogs to see what their reaction is.",
