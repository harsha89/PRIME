    "Content": "Hi Teri My sister is fighting cancer and has been for 5 yrs. She is not doing so well these last couple of days. It really looks like she is pregnant and is miserable. WE thought it was was fluid building up in her stomach but it might be her liver that is enlarged. she has an appointment with her doctor 11/28/06 after 3 wks treatment on her chemo, not sure the name of it is. Are you experiencing similar effects with the pain? I just have so many questions and concerns but I dont know what she is going thru. I hope I dont bother you with my questions. I know its hard for you and no other family there but your husband. You will be in my thoughts and prayers.",
