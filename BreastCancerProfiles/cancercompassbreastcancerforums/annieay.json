      "Content": "Hi there, I've been on Femara for 8 years, and before that was on Tamoxifin for 5 years. Hopped onto this site while googling how long people stay on Femara for. Am shocked at the stories of these debilitating side effects. I am so lucky to report I have had none of these bone and muscular aches and pains. In 2003, at age 39, mother of 2 boys aged 3 and 4, was diagnosed with a nasty breast cancer with massive lymph node involvement (24 nodes. Yes, 24). Don't think I'd be here now if it weren't for these drugs, along with the chemo and radio. Extremely grateful to the women who have gone before, and taken part in clinical trials etc etc. I love the Internet, and dr Google, but I just wanted to post my little story to show its not all bad. We're all different and whatever you decide for you will be the right decision. All the very best x",

      "Content": "Hello, was just reading this site as I've been on Femara for 8 years, following 5 years on Tamoxifin. My GP asked me the other day when I would stop Femara and I am waiting to speak with Oncologist. I have to say I'm shocked at how many women are reporting such severe side effects. I have literally had none, in terms of body aches and pains. Don't think I'd be here if it weren't for these drugs. In 2003, at age 39, I was diagnosed with a really nasty breast cancer that had infiltrated my lymph nodes (there were 24 nodes extensively involved, yes 24). So far so good, touch wood. In 2003 my boys were 3 and 4 and I really thought I wouldn't see them grow up. Not sure if I'd have stayed on meds if I was unable to function, as some of you have described. Both of my boys are on autism spectrum, younger with adhd as well, so I probably would not have coped. Just wanted to say not everyone has these debilitating side effects. So I hope my little story gives another perspective. We're all different and I wish nothing but the best for all of you, no matter what your decision x",
