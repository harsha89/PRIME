    "Content": "I just saw my Onc this week .. after finishing Chemo in Nov, and starting the Arimidex in Dec and like everything I have read here... I too had the \"crippling\" effects from it... and mood swings .... .... so, he has taken me of the Arimidex for 2 weeks ...  only to try one of the other 2 choices.. none which I care to try... I am truly beside myself with this, and it is so hard to explain to someone that you just cant move with out being in pain almost 90% of the time... and the depression is just awful, so is the insomnia. My onco is telling me at least 5 yrs on one of these drugs, and maybe longer....  I am not so sure I can do this...  Cancer interrupted my life, and I fought it and I dealt with it.. now I want my life back without pain!  I didn't have pain before I was dx'd. Being in pain doesnt help ones mindset either. So its like a double whammy with the emotional mud puddles... good grief..and I know my onc doesnt want me on pain killers for the rest of my life... what kinda Merry Go Round is this???",
