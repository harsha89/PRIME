    "Content": "I have tried to go through alot of the posts to help with info but I am so wanting needing answers comfort anything right about now. So I figure I will reask questions resked several times. I had right mastectomy with 13 nodes removed in 2012. I recently started to have pain in my right side.of chest. Itching burning sharp dull pain shock type pain in my chest and is worse at night. it is now effectingy back of shoulder blade. When I walk or stretch at times seems to worsen.  The paim is now going down my arm to my wrist. I live in Thailand and the dr here says I have small nerve damage.May be PMPS. I have done chest xray and blood test and they were normal . I just would like to know if the sharp shooting dull  cramp type pain that worsens at night is like what you all have neen going through. . I am here for another year then will return to states. thank you all for taking the time to read my post. I guess I meed more understanding instead of me sitting here and crying.",
