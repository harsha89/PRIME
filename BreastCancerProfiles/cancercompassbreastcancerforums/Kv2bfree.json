I have not seen my onco doctor since stopping the drug but I do intend to have a discussion with him about this at my next appointment in December.Hello, I read your post here about getting off arimidex and was wondering how you are and what your oncologist said ... Or if they switched you to something else? My sister has BC mets to bone, she is just starting lupron to push her to early menopause and will be starting Femara, a drug similar to Arimidex. I am really worried about all the side effects. She was on Tamoxifen but since it has spread to her bones, they are changing meds and pushing her into early menopause. Any information would be helpful. I hope you are well. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi I am new to this site. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer less than 2 years ago. She had chemo, double mastectomy, and radiation, they said it had not spread to any other sites ... And now she has it in her right hip bone. She goes in for a biopsy Friday. After the shock, pain and hurt of her diagnosis, we held each other through all her treatments and I thought she would be in remission for a little longer... But now... I love her so much. I cry literally everyday and can barely sleep. Everything I read says it's a grim prognosis and I want to hope but reality hits and I feel I can't be so naive. She is all I have. What am I going to do without her? Any help on treatments or options? I want her to go through another round of chemo and radiation again for the bone but some articles say too much chemo is not good. She did great through the first round and radiation too. She did no reconstruction of her breasts. Any info or advice would be so appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your replies. We do live in the US ... care is available to her but I fear conventional medicine will just make her a statistic. After the biopsy... Oncologists wants to start femara, lupron, and xgeva. Also start iv treatment with herceptin every 3 weeks.  Anyone on this treatment? I do not know what to do anymore. So scared not to do as doctors say but alternately scared to do what they say too.  Any help or advice or experience please.",
