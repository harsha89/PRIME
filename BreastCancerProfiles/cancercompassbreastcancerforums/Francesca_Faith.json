      "Content": "Hello - a while back we discussed the new packaging of Arimidex.  Someone made the excellent suggestion to ask my pharmacy to refill with the loose pills in a bottle.  Yesterday I called in my refill and made that request.  I was told that I didn't have a choice and that's how they were shipped from manufacturer.  My 'pharmacy' (not of choice) is Caremark CVS; you may not have this dilemna.  Actually, Caremark is a very efficient, professional organization.  I don't know why I resisted so long having them manage and distribute my prescriptions. Guess I'll have to put my husband to work.  When three months' worth of Arimidex arrive, he will have to sit here and punch each pill out one-by-one for me and put them in a bottle.  Thought I'd give you the heads-up.  Hope everyone is staying healthy!  P.S. Are you aware of \"Army of Women\" (Dr. Love and Avon)           Check it out!",

I thank God for my prescription plan and will appreciate my Arimidex no matter what packaging  :-)  ",
