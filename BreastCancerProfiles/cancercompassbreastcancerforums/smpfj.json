      "Content": "I too had lumpectomy and 36 radiation treatments 18 months ago.  I was told that the radiation would affect my ribs--they would be more brittle.  However I wasn't told my ribs would be painful and prevent me from doing day to day things.  I cannot bend over (to put shoes on, pick up something off the floor, pick up my grandsons, etc.) without an excruciating pain shooting up my side.  It usually, but not always, goes away in a few minutes when I change positions, but is severe enough to make me think I'm having a heart attack.  I did have a bone scan and it showed nothing.  My oncologists both said it was a side-effect of the radiation and my ribs would \"never be normal\".  If I had it to do over again, I'm not sure I would've had the radiation.  My cancer was stage 1 with no lymph node involvement.  The radiation was done as a preventive/precautionary measure and I'm now thinking maybe it was \"overkill\" --I'm still not sure.  I know I'm grateful that the cancer hasn't spread, but am having a tough time dealing with the day-to-day pain and limiting movements.  Sometimes the pains come when I've done absolutely nothing, so I'm reluctant to pick up my youngest grandson.  I've ditched the underwire bras, but it hasn't really helped.  I'm having an especially bad day and came to this site to see if there were any solutions.  I do think that the decision to have radiation is a personal one and should be made with all available information.  We each have to do what is best for us individually, and I'm not sure what I would decide should I develop cancer in the other breast.",

      "Content": "cashleys - ...and my heart goes out to you.  Luckily I do not have any trouble with the swelling but I have friends who do and so I understand what you're going through.  I had the sentinel node biopsy (I think it wound up being 3) but others have had it done differently and I'm not sure how much difference it makes.  Sometimes I wonder if they don't throw whatever they have at you \"just to be sure\".  That's fine on the surface but quality of life is pretty important too.  As I said, mine was only stage 1 and that's why I'm wondering if the radiation was really necessary.  My regular oncologist pretty much dismissed my complaint, but when I went to the radiation oncologist he was a little more understanding and recommended the bone scan.  The issue though was that he never (prior to treatment) explained exactly what the brittleness meant so I had no idea.  I thought it would only be a problem if I fell, etc.  Guess I should've asked more questions.  I hope you get some relief soon.",

      "Content": "terryjean-- my radiation oncologist did admit that the pain was from the radiation (although I wasn't told that before the radiation started).   I'm now 2-1/2 years out and can FINALLY say it has greatly lessened; so there is a light at the end of the tunnel.  Not sure it will ever go completely away, but at least it's getting better and more bearable.  I would never tell anyone not to have it, however I do wish this side-effect would have been addressed when all of my options were discussed.  Not sure I would have said no, but at least the decision would have been made knowing all of the facts.  I think the important thing to remember when reading all of these threads (including mine) is that every situation is different, and every individual has their own comfort level.  What's right for one may not be right for another--there are no absolutes.  I would suggest though that if you are not happy with the way any doctor is treating you, you should find another.  Hang in there--it does get better!",

      "Content": "cashleys,  i agree too about the Arimidex.  I've been taking it for about a year and my arthritis is so much worse, I'm losing hair (and gaining it where I don't want it) and am always tired.  My quality of life is definitely affected and I'm trying to determine whether or not I want to stay on it.  It's hard to say whether it's the medicine or just the effects of getting older!  I understand about being alone--although I have lots of family/friends, most of them are out of state. I try to stay positive and appreciate what I have, but sometimes I just give in and have a very brief \"pity party\" :)  Hang in there--you have lots of company and online support available.",
