Gigi56, YES, Go see another Dr. Look up BC Dr's in your area and GO SEE ONE! she is at a very high risk for BC and it DOES KILL. Unless you want to bury her get it done. I had a base line Mammo at 27 just after my hysterectomy due to my Family history. My Dr then thought it should be done so there would be something to compair it to. Bottom line, If you have ANY questions no matter what they are. GO SEE ANOTHER DR. If your Dr has his head up his ass, fire him. It's not his daughter so why should he care. You care, so find another Dr.",

      "Content": "My Mother had BC 3 times before it killed her. I have been vigilent about doing SBE and every 2 years getting my Mammo's. I had a clear Mammo last fall and everything was fine, but this summer I felt a lump about the size of a dime. I had a Diagnostic Mammo done and nothing was found. My Dr said if it doesn't go away after a Month to let him know. It's still there. He refered me to a Breast specialest and surgeon who did an Ultrasound and nothing showed up. But he clearly felt the lump and we agreed that it had to come out. I had the surgery a week ago and am awaiting the results from the lab. But I am curious if anyone had this happen and cancer was found. Can you give any info on it if so? Please and Thank you. Quasy.",

Just fibrous tissue.  I am very diligent because of my Mother and am doing all I can to Eat and stay Healthy. I hope and pray that those with BC are healed and not sickened in the process of getting healed. Thanks for this resource. Even to I am blessed to not have BC I found this site interesting and informative. Good Luck.",

The drs office has moved my new ultrasound up to this week but refuses to move my follow up appt from the end of the month. Does this mean that even if the ultrasound shows cancer that they will make me wait until 9/30 (from 9/11) to find out if I have cancer or not??? Does this sound right?   Valarie FIRE YOUR DR AND GET A NEW ONE! If your Dr is not willing to listen to you, or you feel you are not getting the best care GET A NEW DR. Cancer kills and time is important. I too am waiting for lab results but my Dr and Surgeon are acting on this aggressivly. Which is what you need not only to catch it if it is cancer. But for your own peace of mind. Quasy... <3",
