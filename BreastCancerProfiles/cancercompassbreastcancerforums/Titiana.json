Hi Judy, Had my second Mastectomy 6 weeks ago, best desicion i ever made, as when i got my results back they found cancer in a different area to the original finding. As it is now the 26th February i gather you will already have had your op, hope you are feeling OK.  Had i not had a full Mastectomy this time it would have been quite some time before the second cancer was discovered, at which time i would have required Chemotherapy for a second time.  By having the Mastectomy i have been spared that this time.
