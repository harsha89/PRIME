      "Content": "I'm a 34 yo female that has thyroid cancer.  I found out 1 year ago and it's been up and down since.  About 2 weeks ago I noticed that I had discharge from my left nipple.  I have to squeeze my breast for it to come out.  It's not like milk it's more on the clear side.  I have no pain. my youngest child is 13 and no i'm not pregnant.  I've seen my doctor and we set up a mamo for next week.  The more I read up on this the more I get that this is not a sign of breast cancer.  Was this a sign for anyone?  I guess once you deal with any type of cancer, every little lump or bump has me freaked out.  I have no lumps by the way.  Thank you !!! =) Tracy ",

      "Content": "Claudia, Thank you for that info.  Ive read up on it and learned alot.  I was always under the impression that breast cancer = lump.  I am going through thyroid cancer treatment now till 10/13 and I have an appointment on 10/14 with a gen surgen to check out this thing.  I did a mamo than an ultrasound and they found a small 6-7mm blob.  So I guess one thing at a time.  Thanks again for your help!!!
