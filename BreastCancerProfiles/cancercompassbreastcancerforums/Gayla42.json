Nipple also looks kinda strange,and breast feels kinda rough,like the pores in it are enlarged. What do you guys make of this? Thank you, N.Y. You need to ask your doctor to \"rule out\" inflammatory breast cancer.  A punch biopsy can be done of the area around your nipple that appears affected.  (IBC) does not usually show up on mammograms.  The symptoms mimic those of mastitis.  I remember prior to my own diagnosis with ibc in 2000 that the pores of one of my breasts looked larger than those of the other.  Something is going on in that breast and you need to be certain that the cause of your symptoms is not ibc.  For more information go to http://www.ibcresearch.org/ Gayla  ",

I discovered a lump about a month ago and had my mammo & ultra last week. The lump is (was) 3x4 cm. I will be seeing a sergeon this week for a biopsy. My breast feels far worse than last week, hurts, and the lump feels much larger. Today I noticed a pink, sort of marble-like color, to the underside of my breast. I am very frightened. I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in 2000.  IBC can develop overnight.  It only shows up on mammograms or ultrasounds about 20% of the time.  A surgical biopsy is not recommended with ibc, rather, a needle biopsy is recommended when there is a discernable lump or a \"skin punch biopsy\" of the area of reddened skin if there is no lump.  Hopefully, you do not have ibc; but, if you do, there are a couple of very good online support groups.  One is ibcsupport.org and the other is at http://www.ibcresearch.org/  Please let us know what you find out from your biopsy.  Gayla Little, Board of Directors, ibc Research Foundation",

(50 years old, non-nursing)  I have had a normal mammogram, but I am still very concerned.  Has anyone else had this before a diagnosis of breast cancer? Hi Veronica,      I am not a medical professional and nothing in this email should be understood as medical advice.  My question is, how far apart were the episodes of mastitis?\"   Inflammatory Breast Cancer is often mistaken for mastitis.  Usually, antibiotics are prescribed and the symptoms do not go away; however, there have been cases where the symptoms resolved but returned within a few weeks.  Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) does not normally show up on mammograms.  The only way to diagnose it is with a biopsy of the affected area.  A skin punch biopsy can be performed.  Normally, when it is ibc, the symptoms show up and get progressively worse over a short period of time.  There is a webpage that I think has some good information on following patients with inflammatory symptoms of the breast.  It is http://www.breastcare.com/bcc/research/inflammatory.asp  You can also find more information about inflammatory breast cancer at: http://www.ibcresearch.org/ Hopefully, something other than ibc is causing your symptoms.  I hope this has been helpful.  Gayla Little  ",
