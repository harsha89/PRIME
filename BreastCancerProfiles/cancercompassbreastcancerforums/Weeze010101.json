      "Content": "Hi atcbsc, My Mom is beginning her battle.  I'm lost and so scared.  She's been healthy her whole life and literally out of the blue (yesterday) we get breast cancer with mets to liver and spine. So scared, so lost.  Just hearing that your Mom has been fighting for 2 years now, gives me hope.  We are completely new at this.  From what I've read, they give stage IV patients 18 months.  Is this a true number from what you know?  I'm losing my mind with worry.  I just hate the idea of watching her suffer.

The radiation did help the back pain, reduced some compression on my spinal cord. have to take arimedex for 5 years & will start zometa next month, once a month for at least a year. My diagnosis is not good, however they come out with new treatments every day. So keep the faith. Dont know what the side effects are for zometa yet, the radiation caused nausea & fatigue. I notice a small amount of hair loss, but not significant right now. My son had a glioblastoma brain tumor 3 years ago, the dr. said he had 9 monthe to live, but we never gave up & he is 2 & a half years cancer free. Never let them tell you how long you have. they dont really know. Good luck. I too have stage IV lobular breast cancer which also is in most of my bones.  I've been getting monthly infusions of Zometa since Aug. & have never had any side effects. I'm curious about your back bone compression... that is my biggest fear. How did you know you had it? I guess you did not require surgery for that. (?)  I really have no symptoms other than back ache and pain in the tips of my shoulder bones. I too have mets to my back, ribs, shoulders, neck, feet, and wrist.  But basically, I feel fine. I was diagnosed in July of last year.  When were you diagnosed?    It seems so odd to me that I feel fine and yet have a stage IV cancer! I've had no radiation, chemo or surgery, other than 2 biopsies... not that I'm complaining! I feel very thankful to have this particular type of cancer. I'd appreciate any info you feel like sharing.... Hi Rivergal, Your case sounds quite similar to my Mother's.  She's in the process of being offically diagnosed, but according to our meeting with the oncologist today she has a 4cm tumor behind her left breast, mets to liver and spine, and lymph nodes by her stomach.  How are you feeling?  Do you have any suggestions on meds we should maybe request or stay away from?  My mother is getting some night sweats and is tired.  Otherwise, she's fine.  I think that's part of why it's so hard to believe that this is actually happening. Any feedback, info you could give would be so much appreciated. Thank you and God bless! Louise",
