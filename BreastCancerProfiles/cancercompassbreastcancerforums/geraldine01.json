    "Content": "Hi, I saw your post and was wondering how you were doing so far.  Yesterday was eight years since I was said to have had triple negative breast cancer and went throught the same thing you did.  Today I am well but have develop a lot of issues such as high blood preasure.  The hot flashes are off the chart.  It has been a long eight years but i give God thanks everyday because my cancer was in stage 3b and the lump has triple after 3 weeks before I had started my chemo.   After being 8 years cancer free my hair has not grown back yet and it is kind of sad.  I have paches and its very thin.  I guss I cant have it all, so I am very thankful.",
