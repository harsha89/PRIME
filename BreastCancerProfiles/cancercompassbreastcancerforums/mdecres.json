      "Content": "I was diagnosed in 3/07 with Stage 2A Herp2- and ER/PR- Breast Cancer. I had 32 lymphnodes removed and 2 were cancerous. My cancer was a stage 3 aggressive cancer. I got into a trial with dose densing chemo and an additional round of large doses of Gemzar. I was wondering if anyone out there has also received Gemzar? I am having severe adominal bloating and worried about the cancer returning. I think I have diagnosed myself with IBD and have an appt. in a week with my oncologist. He states that the Gemzar and chemo is what caused my bloating and they are finding this a year and a half out of last chemo. I also have constant joint pain. Anyone out there with the same symptoms?  Thanks for any reply!  If I have to live with this and the cancer doesn't return that's what I will do!  Everyday is a gift!    ",

      "Content": "Sue:  I hear that the Tykerb is doing great things as well as Herceptin. Since I was HR/PR- I can't have those drugs.  I will keep you in my prayers. I have been taking Aleve and my joint pain is much better. Eating lots of chicken noodle soup so no bloating and have given up coffee. My favorite!  But like you said, everyday is a good day. Keep the faith!  Mary",
