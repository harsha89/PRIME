Nobody warned me about this. Does it go away in a few months? What have you found that helps? GP suggesting low dose of Tricyclic antidepressant. Does that work? Panadeine etc doesn't. Thanks for your ideas and thoughts - love to hear from people who have overcome this problem!! I am two weeks post lumpectomy and they also took out 16 nodes also. I've got about 24 cm of scars.  I was covered with tape burns also. I also had no forewarning by surgeon of numbness or that damn  drainage tube.  I use both gentle massage on my arm and shoulders and a cold poultice of aloe vera. I buy 100% pure aloe vera from the health food store and put in the fridge - 3 times a day or more and put it directly on my surgical incisions and on my upper arm and areas that are numb and cover with a clean tissue. this feels so wonderful cooling and soothing.  I'm also using 100% natural vitamin E on all incisions (now that tape has dropped off) and numb areas. My goal is to heal the skin with the best natural healing agents - and that is vitamin E and aloe vera - which they use in burn units.  I massage my neck, shoulders that knottted up in the surgery by using a tennis ball ( lean against a wall and put the tennis ball in the right spot) Or get a friend to help. there is no reason for you to put up with muscle pain (even in the upper arm) which can be easily relieved with careful, gentle massage. hope that helps",

They gave me 4 injections just outside the nipple area...for a fraction of second the needles were painful going in like getting an injection with a larger needle - but once in, the needle didn't hurt but the dye stung a bit but i wouldn't call it painful -- and it was over quickly. you are instructed to massage the area to help the dye disperse.",
