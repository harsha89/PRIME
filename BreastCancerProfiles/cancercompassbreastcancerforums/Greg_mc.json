    "Content": "Dear Leslie, I'm so sorry to hear that your mother died from breast cancer. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 14 and then she went into remission. When I was 17 it came back again and killed her. It spread through her whole body from her breats to her brain, heart, lungs to her kidneys. Each persons grief is different, but I think I can safely say that I know what your are going through, even though I don't know exactly how you feel. Today, I am 37 I am still tramatized by watching my mother die from cancer in my own home at 17. It has gotten better, but know the past two months have made me cry more and more. I am very sorry that you had to go through this as I did, but at least you had your mother for many years longer than I did. Please at least be happy that you had her until you were 31. I too feel robbed of of my mother because I was only 17 and she was 51. If things had turned out like they should have, she would have died at 81 and I would be 48 and would have had her in my late adult years. Over ninety percent of the kids and adults I have known in my 37 years have not been through the loss of their mother or father. It is very alienating I find and I tell everyone never to take their parents for granted. It sounds to me that your mother was very close to you. Mine was too although the last five years were very hard and I regret that I didn't hug and kiss my mom during those years until the day she died. I forgive my mother for smothering me in being over-protective, but what I have a hard time doing is forgiving myself for the way I treated her. I can honestly tell you that this is going to last a very long time. The pain and trauma will probably take many years to recover from. I had to see a psycholgist for 10 years between age 22-32. I don't want to scare you or make you feel hopeless, but you will always feel some pain during your life from losing your mother at a young age. Don't be afraid to get professional help from a psychologist if you must. But, don't suffer alone like I did for nearly five years after my mother died. I wish you the best in your time of grieving and I hope you will soon feel better and begin to smile again. If you need you can e-mail me anytime. Good luck to you!
