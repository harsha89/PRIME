    "Content": "My wife has been fighting reaccurance of breast cancer 2 years now. We have just learned that she has developed a 3\" tumor on her liver which is causing pain and she has been vomitting all the time. My wife stopped taking chemo 3 months ago and began a Micro Biatic diet through the Kushi institute. I do not have the faith in this but have supported her decision because of the hard time she had on chemo. With this onset of the tumors on her liver should I try to force her back into the chemo treatments or respect her decision on the quality. The quality seems to be going away sue to the tumors on her liver and her lungs and are causing pain. It is hard to stand by and see this happening. We are going to the radialogist today to see about zapping the tumor to give some relief but she is dead set not to start the chemo again. What are myself and my family infore now. My wife is 52 and all of our children are grown and away and I am the only one at home at this time. Thanks",
