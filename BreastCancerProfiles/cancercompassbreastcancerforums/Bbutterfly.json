Go to a bookstore and get \"A Cancer Battle Plan\" by Anne Frahm or \"Beating Cancer With Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin. You can beat this cancer by changing your diet and taking supplements of antioxidants that build up your immunity. You have a very positive attitude, which is half of the battle, but you also have to do something to reverse the disease and nutrition can do it. Stop all sugar immediately (sugar feeds cancer). Cancer hates oxygen so I suggest taking Coral Calcium. My husband has stage 4 esophageal cancer and we found the coral calcium at Walgreens for $20 a bottle of 90 gel caps. Make sure it has magnesium and Vitamin D in it so your body can absorb it. Write to me if you need more information on antioxidants that my husband is taking. You do not need to die but you do need to change whatever caused the cancer and since experts estimate that 60 - 90% of cancers are related to our lifestyles (and diet), you will have a much better chance if you change that. And PRAY! Good luck sweetie! Judy T. Hi I cannot believe what i just read - this is a sign !!!! My son has been diagnosised with ewings sarcoma and the story is  a long one but if you'd like to read it please do and I would be happy to hear more from you.You have really uplifted my spirits...Brenda",
