    "Content": "I found out in April of this year and I'm still in shock.  Not sure if it ever goes away.  There is so much to learn about and make important decisions about.  I've always been in perfect health and now I have a life or death illness.  If I've learned anything it's get a second opionion.  Make sure all of your questions are answered.  There are to many quacks out there treating breast cancer with little experience.  I live in Oregon and I have chose to get my Cancer treatment out of state.  I fly into Tulsa, OK to a Cancer Treatment Center because they have real answers to my questions.  I just finished Chemo and will begin Radiation this next week.  I'm scared and I just want my life back.  But the biggest thing I want is someone to tell me it will never come back.  But there are no guarantees with Cancer.  I have 7 children and 7 grandchildren.  I never thought that I might not be there to see them grow up.  It still scares me.  I think about it everyday.  This is a cruel illness.  Why can't there be a cure found by now?  With all the research why do we still have to fear?",
