    "Content": "I had a Mastectomy 12 years ago.  I had some pain in my arm when ever it brushed against clothes etc.for 4-5 years, however that is much better now.  But, this week I have developed searing pain at the surgery site.  It seems to be nerve pain.  Could a nerve taken this long to regenerate following surgery and is now causing this pain.  If so, what can I do about it?",
