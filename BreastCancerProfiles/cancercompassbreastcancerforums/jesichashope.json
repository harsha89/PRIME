      "Content": "I am very sorry to hear of your burns. I cannot understand how the radiation went to your back but do know the radiation does penetrate the soft tissue and your problem may stem from where and how the radiation treatments were set up. The radiolgist should be able to give you some salve that is for severe burns.  My daughter used this and also used Vitamin E on the burns as well. Because the burns are not topical only but go deep, it is difficult to get complete relief. You may also want to consider some detoxing for the radiation within the rest of your body. The radiation can cause future long term side effects; good to try to clear your good cells. There is a some good information on a recent blog I did that addressed radiation, the short link is:  http://wp.me/p28FKS-20  It gives you details on how to fight the radiation effects.  You need it for treatment but the side effects need addressing too. I wish you much success.",

We have to be careful or we will be overwhelmed with engineered foods and products.  Many nutriionists tell you it is not necessary to eat products that are organic, only certain ones but it is not just the pesticides that we worry about but much of what is in the earth that the plants absorb and becomes part of the plant or fruit thereof, we have to carefully watch and buy only organic non GMO products, or we will be just fooling ourselves.  Also many tell you low fat, although fats are actually not bad as they have been telling us; we need certain fats. It is far better to eat organic butter than to eat some manufactured spread, our bodies know what butter is. And eggs are no doubt one of the most complete foods but somewhere someone made a study and told people not to eat them. Again a good organic egg is complete and our brains love them.  A few good chickens will supply you with wholesome eggs and they happy little personalities will keep you stress free as you tend your little girls. ",

When the skin was stretched enough, they put the gel implant behind the mucsle to give it a more natural look and when you move the muscle gives it a more natural response. It was the process that she had the most pain and discomfort from. When they found more cancer and it was behind the impant, they removed it and had to do it over again. The second time around it was less uncomfortable. She did during the process had problems or discomfort when she raised her arms, but that was not as bad as other pains she had to endure.",

If she had to do it over again, I think she would have still done it, she was young and her surgeon was excellent. She never had a problem afterwards but we have to remember she lived with the reconstuction only a couple of years. One thing she found was the implant heats up unlike normal tissue so she found when she underwent whole body hyperthermia, she had to put something cold over the breast area first to cool down the implant, then go into the chamber.",

Many people have late effects of the chemo months and years later, if left to do damage that is not good. She will do well is you add green juice to her diet. This helps to detoxify as well as rebuild. Broccoli is important. There are many different options to use. Several support clients are using super food that contains the nutrients you need. Energy, good sense of feeling better and good immune system seems to result. If you contact me [google Jesicha's Hope] I can get you the link to get it and a good green juice recipe.  Also, make sure she remains in an alkaline state as well as be sure to take refined sugars out of the diet and replace only with natural occuring sugars so the body will treat them as food. I also advocate eliminating chemical products out of your lifestyle, cleaning supplies, soaps, etc, even sunscreen, lotions... there are natural replacements. It is amazing to read biopsy reports of chemicals found in these products in tumors, they love chemicals, so lets not give them any chemicals. Hope this helps you out.",

So the article is biased to the degree it did not go into truthful details about breast cancer. You can have sore breasts for a number of normal reasons, you can have a lump that is not cancer [always have all lumps check out], breast tenderness can occur normally as well [pregnancy, periods etc are normal reasons]. Most breast cancers are not genetically occuring; by far most are most likely due to environmental circumstances.  If you eat well, don't consume or come in contact with chemical laden products; exercise and get checked regularly by your GYN, you will be doing the most proactive thing possible. It is not a guarantee and your doctor through exams and a thermography or ultrasound rather than mammogram, will find early signs of cancer if it occurs. Don't be scared by an article that does not have full or correct information.",

Oh thank you Diana. I had this conversation yesterday with someone, how is it that doctors can, [knowing the truth] administer chemo and radiation or cut and slice someone up; with the full knowledge they will be spreading it, not curing it and dumping into the body what will most likely kill them; with of course the truth and real cures right at their finger tips? I know regulations prevent them from publicly administering alternatives but they KNOW and they don't TELL. I said there is no excuse in my moral mind, they are doing wrong. My friend said ---- bannility of evil. So today my blog will be on that subject. Anyone that agrees with this thinking, as you do Diana and other posters here, please we need to not just do this alone, I spend 18 hours a day talking and helping, and there are so many more out there seeking and cannot find. There are not one or two options, there are many options that cure cancer. IPT, hyperthermia, BX Antitoxin, DCA and others, most used in combination; all are curing, not treating but curing.  If any would like to help get the word out and help others find solutions please contact me.

When we went to get the final records before heading off to MX, the cancer center head nurse tried to me Jesicha looked too frail to leave the hospital. We were only there to pick up records. We told the nurse she was nervous and had a glass of wine at lunch - she bought the story - and out the door we went before someone else showed up. And yes, they did give her that 'talking to' about denial and all that crap. It is indeed a war - against true healing - all for that profit gain.  I have been well aware of most doctors and clinics that are offering hope and healing. Glad you found yours with Dr. Forysthe, he is excellent. And yes, if you want to find out what is really wrong, the Greek blood test is excellent.  I know of a few that are using other means as well. The fact is there are many roads to wellness, but chem and radiation is no one of them. If you did not hit the blog button on the site read the blog posted last night - I have gotten a lot of good inquires from some very compassionate doctors - it is often good to take a stand so long as you are willing to remain on your pinnacle to be viewed.  www.jesichashope.wordpress.com  ",

She used western medicine until it did nothing, she switched to alternatives and it was amazing to see the tumors melt away.  She started Jesicha's Hope to give out info and options that are hard to find. When your sick you are overwhelmed and nice to have a lot of info already researched.  Just google it and there is a lot there.  The number one thing that seems to work is SPDT. Cancer does not get resistant to it and no side effects.  I have also seen Rigvir work and hyperthermia, both local and whole body; ozone is good also, and there are IV's that work well. Point is there are many options to look through and many if combined will bring agressive cancers under control.  Those with aggressively progressing cancers are more difficult and they need a lot hitting the cancer from several angles, cutting off blood supply, stopping proliferation, starving cells, and weakening the cells; all are needed in order to gain ground ahead of the proliferation. The immune system is most important as it is your only defense against pathogens; you can kill them but then the body must protect itself.  This is a big reason why chemo patients get so many secondary infections, often what kills them.  Changing lifestyle is a great move, it is when you eliminate the cause or causes that you will no longer have the environment that will produce cancer or keep feeding it. ",

If you want to do the best for yourself, look into treatments used that rid cancer in clinic settings. We have an organization that just lists options with explanations.

It is a story worthy of being shared.  You are right, do nice things for your body, it will heal if you feed and take care of it nicely.  It wants to serve you and today we seem hell bent to destroy our dear castle - like we can go get another.  Laser is one of the best methods to remove certain tumors however some are not able to be dealt with using laser but there are still wonderful treatments that will do no harm to your body but will indeed kill the cancer.  And at the end of the day - treat the body with kindness - feed it with organics - not synthetic foods - and clean it and around it with no chemicals. It will serve you for a long time. ",

It would then seem to be that RSD is resulting from damage to the neurological system within the traumatized area.  If then you receive radiation that may further traumatize the given area, there is a likelihood you will have increased suffering from your RSD.  I would like to see evidence that it will not occur before I took that risk as RSD is most painful and I would not wish you in more agony if you need not be. I would look for a solution that will not harm your tissue further.  I will ask about my circles to see if I can arrive at more specific data.

Remember the majority some five hundred years ago believed the earth be flat - a minority believed it round; stand upon your beliefs though it may be of the minority, you are not alone. Jesicha was raised believing in natural medicine yet when faced with cancer and on her own, she would admit today, influence played a huge role; yet when her eyes opened wide to see the truth her determination overcame her. She abandoned the chem and radiation; beat the cancer. Jesicha's Hope was begun to spread the truth and word of options; and it continues.  Her story and my story of keeping that promise has led me to meet some fantastic researchers; my research mind has been filled with revolutionary concepts.  Many old ideas from researchers decades ago are rediscovered and revisited; herein lies some fantastic research. Cancer does not have to be a death sentence nor is it a chronic condition to be treated with chemo and radition until the treatment finally gets you. The more you did into conventional the more you realize what the public is not told. The more you did into alternative the more you realize what is being hidden from the public. Don't let your Mum roast her innards as you say; chemo and radiation does not work for pancreatic cancer, she is in a perfect postion to kill it and lead a wonderfully happy decade or two more.",

Mammograms do not show everything; thermography or ultrasound shows more and sooner. Insurance does not like to pay for it; but if you insist the doctor can make the insurance company pay it.  If he said there was a bulge in the chest wall, it could be any number of other things, something as simple as a cyst that is benign and he would watch it.  Also there are many things to do once you have knowledge of what is going on.  Worry will not make it better or go away. Instead do what you are doing, be positive and seek much information so when a decision needs to be made you have the right options in front of you.  We deal with these things everyday; if you need some support google Jesicha's Hope and ask for support, it is not good to feel alone or scared.

Your doctor can determine this easily. The fact your breast is also tender may signify an infection that is ongoing or some other problem and that could be cancer but until it is looked at you will not know.

Even one of our President's secretly went to a clinic for his cancer and lived years NED.  You are right we are not being told everything but with the internet today our eyes are open.

Our Jesicha had both hormone sensitive and negative; the TN cancer was aggressive and was not effected by the chemo and radiation so she had to choose something different. We studied many modalities and she was using many things at home, hundreds of dollars and still it marched onward spreading. The whole body hyperthermia was of great interest to get all the cancer. Unable to go to Germany and that was near 40 thousand, a German doctor told us about a doctor in Mexico. There are some clinics down there that give it all a bad name, but there are ones that have been there for years and have a good reputation. Some have America doctors. We went there and in three weeks we got rid of the cancer no one could do in the states for three years. Her doctor has become a dear friend and he helps out with Jesicha's Hope because he believes in our mission or Jesicha's dream.  There are tons of things out there that is for sure. I see from our clients that we support what they use and get results and what does they don't respond to. I can give you a list of what is working. Also there is a resource list on the jesichashope site under cancer treatments; google it and read the list. You can get me through there too and can help you further if you need a consult or something and its free.

It is not for everyone as if you don't follow certain protocols you can get into trouble, heart palpations etc.  But it has good results from many.  I will look for the book, thank you. Jesicha used whole body hyperthermia as well as Sono photo dynamic therapy, and numerous cancer vaccines and add ons from her doctor in Mexico. We were amazed. When home we set everything up so she could continue.  It did kill the cancer. She had thirteen tumors on her skull alone that you could see - in three weeks all but three were there and they were shrinking too. It really woke us up. I see that you did not read her story - you will have to so you understand the importance of why I am out here telling the story - chemo is too damaging and you have to listen to your heart, not your peers. She learned that the hard way; but it was not in vain as long as others can learn from it and not repeat the same mistakes. This is sharing at its best.  Her story is worth reading and learning from it.  jesichashope dot org - click on about. There are many good proven by peers treatments; and if doctors knew and most do, they cannot by law tell you- the FDA and state governments hold an iron fist over doctors; they cannot tell you anything that is out of the box and that box is controlled by lobbyists from pharmas who control the FDA. If people only knew this they would understand why their doctors do not tell them alternatives that could save them. The old saying - if there was a cure my doctor would tell me - not so. They cannot. We listed a breakthough treatment called BX Antitoxin - so far those I know that have used it have markers down in eight weeks and good scans at six months out; two women ready for hospice, with no hope have passed their dates for pushing up daisies and back out in the world. Gives you a good feeling that hope is alive out there. You can reach me on that site - so keep up and let me know what you find and will do the same.",

Many are so swept up on the moment they do not realize until it is too late that the chemo and radiation is destroying their bodies.

Keep down on the wheat - use wheat berry products and cook with wheat berry flour; fresh fruits and vegetables and go easy on the meats. Lots of juicing, especially wheat grass.  Keep detoxified, support the immune system. I like a couple of supplements that are very supportive for cancer Hypoxsis and Crocetin. When you are shopping watch the products, Jesicha's Hope has a downloadable shopping list so you know what to buy organic and what you just have to scrub or peel.  You correctly pointed out the importance of YOU making the decision because it is YOUR life; others may not agree but it is important that you do what is right for you.  This is one of our biggest jobs at Jesicha's Hope, advocating for others. She knew the pressure put on her by her peers but she did overcome that; that is when she got the treatments she wanted, not what others wanted. If you do not have your heart into your treatment, you are working with half effort. I firmly believe in complete alignment with your body, mind and spirit, without it healing is difficult. Your decision on treatments should come from seeking all answers and then deciding; that is where we list our resources and let people cruise through to get educated; then with your eyes wide open listen to your heart - the message will be there.",

There are truly a lot of remedies out there.  From experience both personally and through the organization site my daughter started - Jesicha's Hope - google it, I won't post the link; we see that many remedies work but not all have good results. With cancer you have to not fool around but go after the treatments with clinical knowledge and experience behind them. We list only treatments that work and do not harm the body.  Above all, the treatments are essential in your quest to cure your wife; these are important to kill the cancer but the cancer is a symptom of a cause. The cause needs to be considered as a most important intregal part of the quest for cure. We advocate balance and harmony as a whole. ALL foods, and products used daily needs be organic - NO chemical laden products. All food need be organic and NON GMO. We also help with doing a life regression to try to help discover where the body began its contamination; this helps in determining the amount of detoxing needed. If you need assistance please don't hesitate, there is no charge.  There is no magic bullet. Persistence and focus is essential. Hit or miss remedies often bring some relief but we find it far more prudent to develop a treatment protocol that focuses on the whole. Blessings to you. ",

The end results from my observations is not good.  It is your choice, do some research before you take a step you cannot go back on. ",

There in is the crux of the matter.  Something good to see so long as you don't take it all for fact.  ",

The US is not the authority on what works. Their approval system is generally political and today has no bearing on what is good or works or not.  You would need equipment to do the SPDT as it needs a sensitizer and a light and/or sound source to activate the sensitizer.  As for cost you would have to contact a hospital or clinic that does it and there some in Europe, a good one in Singapore and one in Mexico. all could give you costs. Since I only used it from one place I could not tell you the cost elsewhere. And like all hospital treatments our bill was based on other treatments and medical needs my daughter needed like a blood transfusion.  Please don't throw out insensitive comments unless you know what you say is truth; my daughter had TNBC and became a statistic of chemo side effects to the heart. I know the pain. I was only trying to help another stop their mets. ",

Somehow you are unable to catch anything else, only the cancer is in control of your body. This makes it hard to convince a doctor it is not cancer progression but maybe something else that needs a look at.  Or do doctor do talk overs - that is they will talk to whoever comes with you like you are not in the room; like the cancer has someone take the abilty to think from us? I recall the doctor telling me that maybe my daughter was falling and was not remembering things - because she was complaining of bumps on her head. My daughter was standing right next to me - what an insult.  Thing was the bumps on her head was progression and the doctor did not want to face she had not a clue what more to do.  It was time to move on. We have to take hold of our lives and not hand them over to just anyone. Our lives are all we got. Lets make good use of them and enjoy them. ",

Cancer in itself is not exactly rottening the flesh but it in itself does not die off and replicate but the old cancer cells just keep on replicating and existing. The blood supply is awkward and not sophisticated, very primitive so it makes exterior tumors pretty nasty and they leak. Certainly makes an odor. I have been around others and cared for them; others did not have that smell. I think it might be determined by how long the person had the cancer, the type of cell growth, etc. that might determine the odor.",

Forcing her into any type of treatment she does not want will take time to get the court to order it and the treatment at this point, with her being so weak will more than likely just kill her. Also, forcing into something like that will cause her will to live to cease and she will no doubt just give up.  My thought would be at this point is to make her comfortable. Go along with her and tell her to keep the wound clean. You could ask for visiting nurses or hospice but she might just reject that also. If you can talk to a doctor that is willing perhaps to give her something for her breathing or pain it might help. You have to be careful with any antidepressants or anxiety medications that are often given for late stage cancers. this will further swing her moods and you don't want that. Make sure any doctor you talk to knows up front she has a personality disorder.  I take it your Dad is not in the picture. If she has a friend or relative that she trusts it might be time to call upon this person to intervene and see what she will accept. If it is only someone holistic, then there are alternative practioners that are able to handle things as this and may provide you with some thing. You might also ask them to prescribe some solution to put on the open lesion.  These lesions are not uncommon in some breast cancers but chances are if it is large the area of the tumor under the skin is larger and is more than likely only one of many. She may also have mets to other areas and depending on how long she has hidden this from others it could be in her spine or brain. It is all speculation at this point but one you and your brother must come to terms with. ",
