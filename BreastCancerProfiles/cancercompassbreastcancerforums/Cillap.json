It just got worse and worse!  In Nov. my Dr. put me back on Tamoxifen and I stopped the Forteo and went back to ACTONEL for bone density.  It really took about a month, but all joint pain and achey everywhere disappeared.  I have worried, however, that NOT taking the aromasin make me \"susceptible.\"  My Dr. says it's not that important to change to aromasin--tamoxifen is just fine.  Some of the reading I have done makes me wonder.  Also, ALL mammograms and blood test since 04 have been totally clear.  Just want to know if some of you have encountered going BACK to tamoxifen and how you feel about it.   After a long time away, I returned to the boards to find that we are still discussing Tamoxifen, and I am very glad. I was dx'ed in 1995 with  a stage 3b, 8cm br ca, 11 pos. nodes. I began tamox in March 1996 and STILL take it today.I believe this drug is not for everyone but like all other treatments, it needs to be tailored to you. I am an 11 year survivor who  has been treated aggressively and it has worked. I have no fear of any test, treatment or form of cancer. I have a large family of healthcare professionals, research specialists, personal friends and  loved ones. I use every tool they put before me and I have absolute faith  that together WE have all kept me alive and healthy. Please do not be afraid, cancer is a beginning not an end and ultimately you will  find it more benefit than burden.",
