      "Content": "Estrogen Receptor positive. Double Mastectom May 2011.  Started Arimidex July 2011, it was a horrible experience for me. Side effects were life altering, horrible. Elavil relieved the symptoms a little. After one year on Arimidex I was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I told my onco I was done.   She talked me into starting Tamoxifen.  The Arimidex symptoms dissipated in about 6 weeks. Now only side effect from chemo drugs is lower intense back pain.  BE CAREFUL WITH AROMATOSE INHIBITORS...DO SOME RESEARCH on it, I THINK IT IS POISON IN OUR BODIES!  Cancer does lead to hard decisions, NOT taking an aromatose inhibitor is one I wish I had made.",
