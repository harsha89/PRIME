    "Content": "Hi,  My grandmother is 96 - will be 97 in December. She takes no medicine for anything and can walk well (for someone her age), wash the dishes, run the sweeper, and play the piano.  Her biggest downfall is that she doesn't drive a car anymore!  Oh her cholesterol is a bit elevated but nothing major.  A recent mammogram showed something fishy so they checked it out. It is a small stage one breast tumor. This was told to them on July, 16 - yesterday. My mother told me that my grandmother is scheduled to go to the HOSPITAL to have a lumpectomy.   Here are my concerns and questions: If I were 96, I would not want to have a mamagram. At that age, why would I want to know if anything was amiss. I would try to enjoy myself as much as I could. I'm really upset that my mother even took my grandmother for a mamagram. I think it was a really stupid move.  it's like why LOOK for something wrong at age 96? Is it worth it to put my grandmother through a sugerical operation? I'm worried about all of the bacteria and so forth that are running rampant in hospitals such as Staph, Psuedonomas, etc..When my Grandfather had to be rushed to the hospital at age 84, he got a staph infection and he died.  2. Can  96 year old take being put under anesthesia? 3. Also, do you think the pain involved after surgery is something that a 96 year old should have to go through? IF my grandmother goes to that hospital and gets an infection that screws her up or kills her I will GO BALLISTIC!!!!!  I'm thinking she's not 25 so keep her out of the hospital. But my perspective is a bit uniformed which is why I am asking about this. Please offer any thoughts. Thank you so much for answering, Hermione",
