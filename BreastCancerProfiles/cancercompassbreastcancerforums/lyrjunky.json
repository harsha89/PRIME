      "Content": "I have had two treatments and I'm on Taxotere and Cytoxin.  I am losing my hair, it's thinning out pretty good on top but the bottom isn't.  I have my treatments on Wednesday and that Friday late evening is when I started to feel weak.  Saturday and Sunday was a bear, I could barely get out of bed and had to have my husband help me up.  I felt very weak, wornout, tired and slept alot.  I felt like my body was 100 years old.  It's very hard to explain until you go through it.  I have four more treatments to go and everyone is differerent on how their body reacts to the chemo.  Get informed, ask a lot of questions and what helped me is to expect the worst so if it did happen I wasn't disappointed.  But if it didn't happen I was happy.  You will know what to do and you will get through it.  It's scary and tough but I look at it as if all these other women and men can do it so can I.  Good luck.

      "Content": "With my third round of chemo I came home from the clinic and that night my breast was engorged with fluid.  The following week I had shooting pains and then finally saw the onc.  He said they couldn't tell me if the needle came out of the port or not and gave me 2000 mg of antibiotics.  The pain did subside but now my breast is numb.  On Christmas Eve Day I had my fourth round of chemo and now I have a little redness and just a smidge of pain.  I felt like when I went to the onc that he couldn't do anything for me.  I'm debating on whether or not to call the doc again.  What will they do this time?  How long will this numbing sensation last?  They tell me I won't have any tissue damange with the chemo I'm taking which is Taxotere and Cytoxin.  I don't want anything to happen but feel like my onc didn't know what to do.  Any suggestions out there?  I'm just hoping that my breast returns to normal...at this point I dont feel confident in the doc.  =(  Laurie",

Thus I learned that I could count on 2 days when I was useless, and the next 2 or 3 weren't great. Fortunately I have a great partner, and she was there for me every step of the way, cooking, cleaning, making sure I had what I needed. I started on prednisone with my first treatment, but had SEVERE hallucinations, so said no more.  The next round we tried dexamethasone - same result, so I did my last two treatments without any steroids at all.  I just made sure to take some tylenol before treatment, and keep it up afterward - that really helped.  I had a lot of nausea - found that purple grape juice helps, ginger ale helps, but the best is cola syrup - there are still some old time drug stores and grocery stores that sell that. I realized after the third treatment that the Neupogen was contributing heavily to the nausea, so I stopped taking it - fortunately I only had one more treatment so wasn't that much at risk white cell wise.  Food also tasted really bad, and I didn't have much appetite.  Again, the purple grape juice helped, and I learned to avoid spices, as they just made the food taste worse. I started losing my hair right after the second treatment.  I had known this would happen, and had a plan.  Soon as the hair started coming out, we had an after hours party at my hair stylists salon - I had her give me mohawk before she totally buzzed my head, and we did goofy things with the mohawk, took pictures, ate some pizza, and then bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - my bald head was just as soft and smooth as a baby's bottom.  Stayed that way for another 4 months! I only went through 4 months of chemo, but I know that I could have done another 2 months, or even another 6 months, if that was what they thought was needed.  Yes, being sick was hard (and having worked for 16 years as a nurse, sometimes taking care of patients getting chemo - I know that you probably WILL be sicker than I was) - but in my book, the alternative - metastatic cancer, and possible loss of life - is even harder.  My cancer was a little more involved than yours - I had about half my lymph nodes removed in a 2nd surgery because there were cells in the margins of the lumpectomy. I had whopping big doses of both drugs - the max they could give me, but my oncologist is conservative, and he chose to only give me 4 treatments, followed by radiation.  I completed slightly more than half of the radiation, then quit because I was developing lymphedema and I knew if it got worse it would interfere with my ability to work, and I couldn't afford that.  I remained \"cancer free\" for almost the magic 5 years - 2 months shy of 5 years we discovered nodules in my lungs, and it took another 3 months and surgical biopsy of my lung to get a definitive diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. I have used alternative treatment and am now in remission, but realistically I know that I can now NEVER stop fighting cancer; while I may have the cell growth stopped, and perhaps even reversing, I must always consider the possibility that there are still cells spread thruout my body, just waiting for my internal enviroment to once again become condusive to growth.  So, I have wondered if it might not have been better to have chemo for longer, and for me to have finished radiation.  I don't dwell on it, as I will never have that answer.  But it does lead me to encourage others to persevere through the difficulties of treatment. It is much more possible to eradicate cancer at stage I, or II, or even III, than it is to treat stage IV.  If a person gets to stage IV, there can be remission, but for the great majority of people, there is no eradication, and there is no going back. So my advice to you is to persevere. You've started the chemo, so stay with it if you can - to quit early would not be to your advantage unless you are willing to immediately step into an alternative treatment.  (Natural treatments do not have the nasty side effects, but they take longer to be effective, and take the same discipline to continue as do conventional treatments.)   Try to find a local cancer support group. They  can give you advise on how to cope with being sick, and might even be able to send people to help with stuff when you are sickest. The other thing to do is mark a calendar with a treatment countdown, including not only your last treatment date, but another 3 weeks for recovery.  At the end of each day, or the next morning, mark the past day off - and do a little happy dance to celebrate one more day that you do not ever have to repeat again, but also to celebrate one day closer to being cancer free!!  If you do decide you can't do this chemo, talk to your dr about the possibility of doing a chemo regimen that won't make you so sick. And if you decide you just can't finish the chemo at all, PLEASE check into alternative therapies. www.cancertutor.com www.lefcancer.org www.alkalizeforhealth.net THere are herbs and supplements that can help you get through chemo by relieving the side effects.  I am not immediately familiar with what helps with taxotere and cytoxin - I am hoping some others will reply with those answers.  If not, try doing an online search for herbs/naturals that counter side effects of chemo.  Just make sure to check with your oncologist before you start taking anything, as some naturals can counteract or interfere with the chemo. Be sure to drink plenty of pure fresh water.  Steam distilled or reverse osmosis filtered is best.  You not only need hydration, but you need to be able to detoxify your body from the chemo. Drinking lots of water is absolutley essential for both. I wish you the very best. Tre  Thank you for your reply and all of the information you have provided.  I will definitely do some more reserch on the side effects adn what can help relieve them.  My biggest thiing is how to deal with the fatigue the weekend following treatment.  I can barely get my head off the pillow however today is not that bad.  I am a little weak but not like I was the first time around which I'm so thankful for.    I won't give up treatment, I'm sure it will be hard at times but won't give it up.  Thanks a lot for all your help and good luck with yours to stay in remission.  Laurie  ",
