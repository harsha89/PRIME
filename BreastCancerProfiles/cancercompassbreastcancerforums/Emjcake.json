    "Content": "I am not taking arimidex. I have stage 1 bc and osteopenia. Since arimidex is known to cause bone loss in years 1 and 2 ( this info is on the prescribing information sheet ) I didn't feel I wanted to live with osteoporosis with whatever years I have to live. Fosomax and other bisphosphonates are proven to be dangerous as well. There is no cure for cancer yet, any honest oncologist will tell you that.Arimidex and other treatments are to buy time so quality of life issues must be taken into consideration. I would be interested to hear from anyone else making these kind of decisions.",
