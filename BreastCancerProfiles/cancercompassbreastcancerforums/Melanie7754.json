      "Content": "I had a radical mastectomy in May 2004. I was on tamox for 2 years and put on arimdex. I have been in such terrible pain, my feet, shoulders, back, all my bones. I just went back on tamox after being on arimdex for 6 months. I told the doctor I just couldn't stand the pain at all. ~Melanie",

      "Content": "Thank you. I felt better reading your note knowing I am not alone. I actually was begining to feeling tingling in my hands. I assume it is all related to that darn arimodex. That is just awful.I am hopeful that I will begin to feel less pain in a couple of weeks. Thanks for the encouragment, ~Melanie",

It just got worse and worse!  In Nov. my Dr. put me back on Tamoxifen and I stopped the Forteo and went back to ACTONEL for bone density.  It really took about a month, but all joint pain and achey everywhere disappeared.  I have worried, however, that NOT taking the aromasin make me \"susceptible.\"  My Dr. says it's not that important to change to aromasin--tamoxifen is just fine.  Some of the reading I have done makes me wonder.  Also, ALL mammograms and blood test since 04 have been totally clear.  Just want to know if some of you have encountered going BACK to tamoxifen and how you feel about it.  3.20.07 I had a radical mastectomy in May 2004 and was put on tamoxifen. After being on tamoxifen for 2 years I was put on arimodex as a new substitute. My bones felt almost brittle. The pain was just awful. After 6 months, I was at my doctor today and told him I had to stop taking it. I will gladly take the tamoxifen for another 2 and 1/2 years.",
