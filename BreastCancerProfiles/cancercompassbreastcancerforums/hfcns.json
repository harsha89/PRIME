I have just completed my first year of daily anastrozole (arimidex) and am having a lot of problem with trigger thumb. I started on Femara mid 09, then tried Arimidex whilst developing screaming pain in my hands. It was uncertain how much might have been peripheral neuropathy from the one dose of Taxol I had. I then went on to Tamoxifen and although I still don't have 100% range of movement in my left thumb, the pain subsided. Now if only my ankles would stop collapsing!! Any clues on that one folks?",
