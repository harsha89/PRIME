      "Content": "Dear All,  I have been recently diagnosed w the same breast cancer that metastasized to the omentum (peritoneal). My first occurance was in 1998 (17 years ago).  As I am ER+, my doctor has put me on a combination hormone therapy of Arimidex and Faslodex based on a 2013 NEJM report that stated that combination was much better. I have been on this combination for 6 months and I feel OK, but am worried constantly about the eventuality that they cease to work.  Can I know how everyone (Rose, Carolyn, Tre, Linda, BJ123's wife) is doing since your last posts?  Hoping all great health,  PG",
