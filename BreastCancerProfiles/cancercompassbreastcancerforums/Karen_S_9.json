    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer that had spread to my spine as well as throughout the rest of my ribs in Dec. 2002. I had just had my yearly mammograms, breast ultrasound, etc., but the cancer was never found until it was \"raging\" through my skeletal system and my family was told nothing could be done to save me, but one round of intense chemo was tried and that itself almost killed me, I couldn't tolerate it. My pain was excruciating, particulary in my spine which was found to have multiple compression fractures. I also had 4 broken ribs and a cracked elvic bone, all because of calcium leaching out of my bones, making them look like they were moth eaten. Eventually, after many monthsof being still alive but in a morphine haze, I had radiation to the spine. In addition. I was given and still take a fairly new drug called Arimidex which is an estrogen blocker. I also receive a once a month home infusion of Aredia (similar to Zometa) to keep my bones stable. Well, here I am, very much alive, thriving, working, and with my cancer, as my doctor says, is \"asleep.\" It will come back at some point since it is not curable, but hopefully that will not be for a long, long time!! The only evidence I have is that I now am bent over, my vertabrae is pretty much destroyed, and I look as if I'm suffering from a young case of osteoporosis, a small price to pay considering the outcome the doctors expected. Keep my mom thinking positivly, be sure she's getting the newest drugs and keep you and her smiling and laughing, it really will make a difference! Karen S.",
