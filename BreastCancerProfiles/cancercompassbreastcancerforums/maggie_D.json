    "Content": "Hi, I had breast cancer in 2000, had a mastectomy and tamoxifen. Just under 5 years I had a recurrence on the same side. Had a lumpectomy ( not that there was much tissue to take) and radiotherapy. I am on arimidex now. I will be stopping it in november of this year. I know I have been very lucky. I just wondered if anyone knew what my risk of it coming back a third time was. I am also BRACA 1 or 2 positive. ( i cannot remember which one). Thanks Maggie  ",
