    "Content": "Hi there, I have recently been diagnosed with Breast Cancer, with mets to my lungs and liver from day one. The shock has been huge but this hasn't been helped by my surgeons attitude which was literally 'it is too late to do anything for you. You need to just accept it is over for you. I won't give you false hope.' I am devastated and am hoping there are people out there who have some uplifting stories of either beating or at least living with liver and lung mets. My son has just started University and I want to see him graduate in 3 years but my surgeons attitude has made me doubt I can be around for then. I've already had FEC-T chemo (6 sessions ) and am having radiotherapy but no surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy) as per surgeons 'advice'. I feel like the medical profession has completely given up on me and wanted to hear of others who may then have had further treatment that has held these mets at bay. Also what diet are people on as that seems to make a difference? I would love to hear from anyone who can help. Thanks, Katherine",
