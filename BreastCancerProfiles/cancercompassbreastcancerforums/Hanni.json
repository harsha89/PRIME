      "Content": "I go for mammographs every year. I am 79 years old but I am told by doctors that I am not 79. I have been healthy up to this point. I was diagnosed via mammogram  which showed a spot. Several repeats done. Radiologist comes in and shows me an enlarged version and says it looks suspicious and need to schedule biopsy. Done. Had biopsy. results are pos for invasive ductal carcinoma. He says I need to see the Breast cancer team  of 3 doctors. Radiation, MD, Surgeon MD and Oncology MD to discuss. Done. Surgery first. Done. Lumpectomy with partial mastectomy, lymph nodes removed and checked. Pathology report Stage 1 0/3. Clean margins. Oh, I had a MRI done as well prior to surgery. That was all clean. Healing from surgery. Had a little issue with the suture line under arm as it was rubbing against bra seam. I bought sterile 4x4 and padded the area. I also used sterile normal saline to rinse the ares.  That worked well. Minimal pain. More discomfort of itching and shooting pains. Surgeon says that is when the nerves regenerate. I am 3 weeks post op. No pain and very little discomfort.  Saw oncologist. PA went over pathology detailed report and said tumor size is 1.1cm. All other items are in my favor. She suggested to do DNA test. No idea what she is talking about. She did say it would show either aggressive or non aggressive. Have to wait 2 weeks for result. Oncologist comes in and I get no treatment. I asked him if it is safe to wait longer before startying any treatments and he nodded and said yes.  Oh well, doctor knows best???? I maybe 79 but I feel young and can work some younger folks into the ground.. I do not excersize and I am overweight. 185lb. I love to eat. I am a coffeeholic and I love cake.  I do yardwork, cut grass, trim bushes, rake and keep a clean house every day. I stay very busy. I have a dog, I walk and groom. My salvation is keeping busy. My problem is learing all these terms and these initials. I have no idea what they mean. I have learned a few.  I just found out about Oncotype DX testing. It was not suggested to me and I had no idea until I started reading online. I know they are looking at my age and I asked the radiation doctor to give me 5, he laughed and said he'll give me 10. Yeah lol. Since my tumor is 1.1 in size which they said was just a tad bid over the cut off mark for chemo, they are doing this DNA test. I read that chemo does not help very much. He did say I need medication by mouth and gave me some literature on what he will give me. The question now is  do I need chemo or just radiation and pill. ? I wanted a mastectomy but she would not do it. How can I make an educated decision when I know so little. I like to hear from any of you sisters with BC.",

      "Content": "Hi, I just signed up and also I just had a lumpectomy. I had sharp shooting pin like pains in the operated breast. The surgeon says the nerves are trying to reconnect and it will get better. I does get better. I still have some shooting pains but less. I am 3 weeks post op. I also experienced lots of itching all over the breast but that has subsided.For me, the hardest part was keeping the bra seem off the suture site under the arm. I had to pad the area with sterile 4x4 gauze so not to irritate the suture line. Hope this helps. I am new to all this and trying to learn as much as possible.",
