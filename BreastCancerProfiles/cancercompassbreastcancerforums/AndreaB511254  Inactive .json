    "Content": "There was a really good article in the St. Petersburg Times that you may want to take a look at. It's regarding men who developed breast cancer after being exposed to highly toxic water at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina from 1957 through 1987. The article can be found at http://www.tampabay.com/news/military/veterans/article101367 Anyone looking for additional information on the Camp Lejeune water contamination or who wishes to get in contact with Mike Partain, please ask them to visit www.tftptf.com.
