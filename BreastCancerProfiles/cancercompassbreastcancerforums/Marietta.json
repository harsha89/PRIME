      "Content": "Hi: I had a lumpectomy to my left breast for stage II breast cancer last May, sentinel lymphs biopsy - clear of cancer, followed by chemo and radiation. My breast has been swallen, red, and heavy (size 36 DDD normal, so heavy is really \"heavy\"). I have been fine, felt good, all tests/scans clear. But for the past 2-3 weeks I had this pain when I touch the ribs area under my left breast. Also, for a week now I can feel and even see an alongated, painful when stretched (if I lift my breast) gland(?) or vain(?) toward the left side of the ribs running from the bottom of my breast down to close to the end of my rib cage. Has anyone had a similar symptoms? Obviously, I am petrified waiting to see my doctor, doubtful she will know what it is without some new perhaps invasive tests. Would appreciate any related comments. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks to both, Sharon and Pavielle. I had a follow-up MRI of abdomen (for those hypodensities on my liver and my kidney), and it confirmed no signs of metastasis, only several small cysts, one of them \"possibly complex or hemoriging\". The doctor's nurse (doctors don't have time to call us any more, unless something is serious...) told me, everything is fine. I said I feel a minor but persistent dull pain for weeks in the area around left kidney. She consulted with my Primary Care doctor and he prescribed strong dose of Aleve to reduce pain... I don't want to temove symptom (it is not even that severe), I want to make sure the underlying reason for pain is not serious. But if I call my oncologist, she make direct me for \"more X-rays\"..Not sure what to do (?) Good luck, Pavielle, with your problem. Hope they will come up with a clear diagnosis, if not - head for another opinion (I did not have any such sensations right after the surgery). All the best, Violetta",
