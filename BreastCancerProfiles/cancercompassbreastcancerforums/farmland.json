      "Content": "You might want to look into Rexin-G. Go to their web sight. Epeius Biotechnologies. I have been on rexin-g since 12/2008 and have been kept stable.  I have breast cancer with mets to bones. There are no side effects for me, maybe a little tired. The only catch is you can only receive this in the Philippines right now. But, don't let that stop you from enquiring.",

      "Content": "Rexin-G is gene therapy, cutting edge science it is not genetic material from a rat virus. The virus is a dead herpes  simplex virus.  But it is also not alternative as you thinking. This is an alternative therapy from mainstream therapies, my fault for bringing up rexin-g as alternative. As I said I have been stable for over 2 years stage 4 on this gene therapy. \"Technically, Rexin-G is a matrix-targeted nanoparticle that seeks out the biochemical hallmarks of pathology (pathotropic targeting), accumulates to high levels in tumors, and delivers a cytocidal (lethal) gene construct: a dominant-negative construct of the human Cyclin-G1 gene, a pivotal cell cycle control element. The capsule containing the therapeutic dnG1 gene is based on a murine retroviral core, which is devoid of viral genes and has been rendered certifiably replication incompetent\u2014that is, it capable of delivering a therapeutic gene once, and only once. The integral tumor-targeting function is indeed profound, in that it is capable of penetrating primary and metastatic cancers, as well as cancers within the lymphatic system, with high efficiency, within a matter of hours, which represents the half-life of the active anti-cancer agent.\"",
