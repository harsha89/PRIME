Only side effect is night sweats and hot flushes. Oncologist wants to put me on monthly zometa infusions. Having had a look at the side effects am not happy about bisphosforates in general. Have found out by googling that natural strontium citrate plus calcium and vit d can do the bone building just as well without side effects ( not strontium range late). Am fairly sure onc will try to put me off this route as its not a 'pharmaceutical' and I am now of the opinion that pharma companies do not create cures they create customers! Not once since my diagnosis has diet and nutrition been mentioned except to say eat what you like ! Is there anyone on cancer compass who can advise me. Do not want to sign up for monthly infusions if there's a more natural way.... Look forward to your comments IP-6 is known to shrink tumors. It also works with animals. (www.IP-6.net) Can be purchased on Amazon.com . For bones, it is necessary to have the right combination of minerals: Vitamin D, Calcium, Phosphorous, Magnesium. Without Magnesium, Calcium is not fully appreciated. The diet must be heavy on the vegetable consumption. Also, you can find more information about killing cancers of various types onwww.naturalnews.com . Drugs need to be offset with the right diet. Eating carbos will \"grow\" the cancer, and it may return even after removal, or healing of the original cancer site. If you research your type of cancer on the internet, there are a plethora of successful treatments that your doctor may not be aware of. The Cancer Centers of America have a high success rate of treating cancers conventionally. Look at alternative medicine, Chinese medicine, to supplement whatever conventional routes you take. The research into food chemistry continues to show promise. Oil of Oregano and cinnamon also kill cancer cells. There are chemical compounds in the normal foods we eat that kill cancers. Certain mushrooms also have medicinal properties. There are so many ways to treat cancer of all types. Healing requires more than conventional wisdom has to offer. Drugs deplete the immune system, which needs to be built up to fight the disease. Â ",
