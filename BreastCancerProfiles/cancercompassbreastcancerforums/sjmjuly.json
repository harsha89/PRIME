      "Content": "Thanks Tre! I will take the advice. I have already given up the caffine because it makes me jittery anyway. I had my ultra sound yesterday and received great news. I have two very small benign cysts that will not require any additional treatment unless they start to bother me.  Now I just need to do the right things to try and minimize the cysts. If I could only come up with a solution to the PAIN I feel every month after I ovulate and the few days before my period starts. My breasts hurt so much that if someone just breathes on them I want to scream!",

      "Content": "Thank you for your kind words. I am very sorry for your loss. I pray you are safe & sound. The radiologist called me this morning and explained that my mammogram revealed 2 small nodules in my right breast. She indicated they were small, round and have smooth edges which she stated was a good thing. She even said not to worry because it looked promising. She said that women my age are subject to cysts and that my breasts are fibrocystic and dense - Perfect place for cysts to grow. I pray she is correct. We will see Weds when I have my ultra sound & mammogram.",

      "Content": "Please forgive me if this is long, but I think it helps me \"to get it all out\". :) I am 45 yrs old almost 46 and have healthy all my life. I have no history of cancer in my family and have been getting mammograms since I was 39. All were normal until July of 2006. I had my annual routine screening performed and was called back for additional testing. They did a diagnostic test and found I had one small microcalcification on my left breast. It was determined that I would return in 6 months for a follow up to check for any changes. I returned in 6 months and was told it looked fine, no changes, but they wanted another picture in 6 months. I again returned in 6 months and was told it had not changed, appeared benign and could go back to my regular annual screenings. A year has passed and I have moved from the east coast to the west coast and have changed doctors. I had all my films and reports from the previous facility and gave them to the new facility where I had my mammogram done last Monday. I received a call Friday morning stating they wanted me to return for an ultra sound and another mammogram. Needless to say, I am scared. When I received an e-mail from my doctor, he said all the radioligist report stated was \"Screening complete and abnormal. Additional imaging needed\" There was no reference to reviews of my last films or report, or, if they even looked at them! I was told by the appointment scheduler that it's very common for women coming from outsite the facility with prior records and concerns, they are usually asked to return for additional imaging. Almost like they don't even look at prior results if they came from outside. I don't know. I am just very worried.  My sister in law is battling stage 4 breast cancer so I have seen what she has gone through. I have never been asked to have an ultra sound. I am very scared and worried.",
