I chose a double mastectomy because my left breast had suspicious areas that needed to be watched.  Anyway, all during my chemo and now 3 years later I have consistently had a high CEA level.  Just last month it came down to 9, but will probably jump up again.  I have just finished with CT/Scan, Bone Scan, and in 2 days will have another PET Scan.  My oncologist is somewhat puzzled.  Everything so far shows no cancer.  I also am diagnosed with R/A, Osteoarthritis,Sjogren's Syndrome and now Discoid Lupus.  I am just wondering if any of these other conditions could affect my CEA level.  My Oncologist hasn't really seemed too interested in these other conditions.  He lives and breathes cancer!  Does anyone know if this is possible?   These listed below conditions can cause elevated CEA level: ?? Gastritis ?? Peptic ulcer disease ?? Diverticulitis ?? Liver diseases ?? Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ?? Diabetes ?? Any acute or chronic inflammatory state - which in your case could be the Lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis.",

Choices are: Lumpectomy with 6 weeks of radiation. She was told 10 to 15% chance of returning cancer with this treatment. OR Mastectomy of the one breast. No treatment. Which would you all do? Thank you all tons.   Ron (her son) Stage 5-year Relative Survival Rate 0 100% I 100% IIA 92% IIB 81% IIIA 67% IIIB 54% IV 20% Source: American Cancer Society The stage 0 has very good prognosis as you can see from above table.Was this non-invasive cancer or invasive? In any case it is very early stage breast cancer with super good prognosis.It would be very rare that nodes would be involved (only rarely in invasive stage 0 and never in non-invasive stage 0). The statement you have posted that she was told that the stage was 0 would implicate that they knew that nodes were negative.Otherwise it would not be accurate.The stage is determined by cancer size ,nodes involvement or not and spread to other organs. Lumpectomy or mastectomy is a personal decision for woman to take based on her personal choice.Final cosmetic effect may depend on the breast size and the area which has to be removed and location of the lump. The surgeon should be able to discuss it with you mom and help her to make the final decision.The survival with lumpectomy plus radiation versus mastectomy alone is the same. For stage 0 breast cancer ,which implies very small tumor ,lumpectomy should  be the preferable type of breast cancer surgery in the 21 Century.  ",
