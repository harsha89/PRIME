During chemo she had lost her hair and went through some depression. Also she has had some problems with her heart. B/C of her heart problems she had to stop chemo on and off. My biggest worry though is her Dr. thinks she might have another lump in her breast and if so what does that mean? I know it means the cancer has come back, but does she have to go through chemo again or does it mean she is going to DIE fro m this now? It worries me so much that im scared to find out the answer to this:( I cant sleep, eat or concentrate on anything. I cry evernite when im alone. My mom is the only parent I have, and i dont know what i would do w/ out her. Please, if anyone has anything to share with me i would be so grateful. Thank you Hi...my name is Michelle.  My mom also has breaste cancer.  She had just found out about it in November.  She had a mastectomy on Dec. 22nd.  She just found out last weekend that the cancer was already in her lymph nodes.  The Dr. says that she can not have chemo...she also has a bad heart.  I totally understand how you feel about losing your mother.  My mom is my best friend.  She has always been there when others haven't.  If you just want to talk ley me know.  It's always nice to talk to someone who is going thru similar situations.  I hope the best for your mom!!!  Michelle",

Barbara Hi Barbara.  My mother also had a mastectomy on the same day as you.  She has had a lot of drainage.  Her drain tubes stayed in until this past thursday. (1/4/07)  Did you have any reconstruction?",
