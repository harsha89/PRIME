      "Content": "Yes, I have been on Femara since May of 2012 and I also experience joint pain. I do have some Osteo-arthritis to begin with due to an injury to my knee years ago, but I had never had problems with my hands, wrists, ankles, legs aching horribly and it even hurts to sit for very long. I can't take too much Tylenol due to it raises my liver levels, aspirin is hard on our stomachs and I can't take strong pain medications. So, I just have to live with the pain mostly. I do take Tylenol at times when pain is really bad or I have a migraine. I can hardly touch my wrists due to the soreness and pain. My worst side affect is fatigue, it is debilitating, does anyone else experience horrible fatigue? God bless you in your journey. My prayers are with you dear sister.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 2010, it was very aggressive but was caught in stage 1, so that was a blessing. I went through eight months of grueling chemo and then a year of Herceptin infusions and in Dec. of 2012, I was placed on Femara. I didn't have any side affects until about six months in and the fatigue began. It has worsened to the point that I have hardly any energy and I have to reserve what I do have for things I really need to do. My Oncologist has me in a study and the bloodwork and study results affirm that if I go off of the Femara in two more years which would be my five yr. program, my cancer will return somehwere in my body with a vengance as it was so agressive. So my oncologists are keeping me on the Femara for the rest of my life. I told them I can handle the side affects as long as the medication keeps my body safe from cancer. I also have more depression/anxiety at times, but mostly during the winter months which could be attributed to seasonal depression. But the fatigue is horrible to deal with. I can do a little at a time, love to garden in my flower beds but working for a short time and have to go inside and rest. I also have a-fibrillation and will have to go on Coumadin in a short time. But the fatigue is the greatest problem and the soreness in my joints so far. God bless all of you who are suffering from this dreaded illness, but we are strong and we will not let it beat us. We have to keep a good outlook, be strong, rely upon your faith and stay optimistic. I am a suicide/crisis hotline counselor and I love that work, it has changed my life. Find something to enhance your life. I also love to read and journal. I am so thankful I found this site. Again, blessings to all of you on Femara, it is a good drug but it does have some debilitating side affects. Thank you for listening and God bless you all.",
