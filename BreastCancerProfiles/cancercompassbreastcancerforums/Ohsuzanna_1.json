      "Content": "Robyn, Thanks for the info. Do you still eat the Tempeh and Miso? I had a particial masectomy in Dec 2005. I was eating soy and have stopped. I am vegan. I eat mostly raw organic vegetables and walk 3-4 miles aday. Are you in Houston? i am. going to do the race for the Cure today. Hope you will be out there. If not hope you get your exercise today. We need to keep up the walking. It has made me feel soo much better. Are you on any hormonal therapy? I was on Arimidex for 4 months and got off of it. It caused me so much foot pain and joint pain. I am still having pain from it. I am going to try to keep healthy with my raw veggies and fruits, nut, seeds and grains and exercise. best to you and your health. Suzan",

      "Content": "yes i do have pain in my feet, knees and most of my joints. I got off the arimidex after 6 months taking it and now one month off of it i am still in pain. I walk 3-4,5 miles a day 1-2 hours and do pilates 20-45min. a day. Maybe i am exercising too much but i am afraid to stop moving for fear of being stiff and unable to move. I have not lost any weight and gain some when i started. I am vegan 95 % of the time. it is depressing trying to figure out what to do. i am her2 positive and was stage 1 no nodes. I'd like to not take any drugs but i just don't know what to do. My oncologist wants me to take arimidex or something. these side effects stink.",
