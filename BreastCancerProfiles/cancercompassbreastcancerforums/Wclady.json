      "Content": "Anna, thank you for responding.  I spoke to a Dr at church yesterday who works in a research environment.  He told me that because I had radiation, my lymph ducts were scared and they don't work properly any more.  Did anyone ever explain why you had so much drainage?  Another Dr said I can get some help from physical therapy as long as I see a therapist that specializes in lymphodema.  There are excerizes that help eliminate the fluid.  Have you heard anything about this?

      "Content": "Michelle, I didn't have reconstruction.  I had spent the last year healing from an infected seroma.  The wound never healed and that's why I had a mastectomy.  The plastic surgeon said he would do any reconstruction on me for a least 6 months and would not put an implant in.  I'd have to have a TRAM flap done.  Seeing the drainage problem I'm having now, I'm not positive I want reconstruction.  So many decisions and unanswered questions.  I wish Dr's would be more specific and give you more information.  It's seems you have to go online or ask other people questions to get any answers.",

      "Content": "I had a simple mastectomy on 12-22-06 and had a drain inserted during surgery.  My surgeon removed the drain on 12-28-06, 6 days after surgery.  I had 15 cc's of fluid recorded for that day.  Over New Year's weekend I got very swollen and uncomfortable.  Saw the surgeon on 1-2-07 and he drained 60 cc's from my breast area.  I returned to surgeon 1-5-07 and had 110 cc's removed!  I have to return to surgeon on 1-8-07.  Does anyone know why I am having so much drainage?  It doesn't seem normal to me.
