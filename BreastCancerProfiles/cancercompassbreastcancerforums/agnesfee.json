    "Content": "I am concerned about inflammatory breast cancer, as I have a number of very troubling symptoms.  I'm having an MRI next week, after having a mammogram and an ultrasound. The mammogram and ultrasound did not reveal anything. Can anyone tell me if IBC shows up on MRIs? My doctor said the next step would be a biopsy, but she's not sure where to biopsy (I have no skin rash at this time). Any info would be very appreciated. ",
