      "Content": "Please tell your relative that he is eating the cancer death diet. Fried foods, white: bread, sugar, flour, processed meat: cold cuts, microwave dinners are all VERY BAD for you if you are fighting cancer. I know because I had to cut out all of these things. There is a book called \"Beating Cancer With Nutrition\" by Dr. Quillin. The book comes with a CD that your relative can listen to if he is unable to sit up and read. The CD covers all key information in the book in terms of dietary changes to be made to achieve improved health. I also suggest looking into juicing and possibly a colonic (colon-cleansing tonic). You can get information at your local health food store. My prayers and best wishes are with you and your family. Fran",
