      "Content": "Hi Jessica, I too have breast cancer and am going through chemo. I have been juicing throughout and feel that it has helped to keep me strong. They tell you to eat plenty of veggies and fruits and juicing is a good way of getting more. From all that I have read and researched it is best to juice your veggies and eat your fruits. Since we are trying to get a lot of nutrients, this seems to be a way to do that. With juicing you keep all of the original nutrients including enzymes which get killed with very little heat. Is your mom going through chemo now? If so ,there are supplements that she can take to help keep her stronger and feeling better through this tough time as well. If I can be of any more help please let me know. Deb",

      "Content": "Hi Beck, I want you to know first off that you are in my thoughts and prayers! I believe that your surgery is coming up this week and that you don't really want it but are following you gut. Please know that gut feelings are very important. I followed mine and had a double mastectomy at the end of May this year. Only my right breast had cancer along with 4 lymph nodes on that side. They did , however find precancerous cells on the left side. (Gut feelings told me to have both breasts removed!) I now feel like the cancer is gone. You will too! It will be a relief and that in itself will contribute greatly to the positive outcome of treatment. You will be just fine! Please let me know when your surgery is...I would love to say a prayer as I am sure others in this chat group will want to, on your day of surgery. If I can be of any help...please let me know. I can give you my phone number if you'd like. Just e-mail me at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
