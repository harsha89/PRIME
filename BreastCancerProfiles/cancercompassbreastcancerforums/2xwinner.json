    "Content": "Is anyone being treated with Avastin as a maintainence drug after chemo? I am also taking Femora. My Petscan from 12/27 shows no tumors and I am thankful that it worked along with the Abraxane, especially since this is my second time with estrogen based breast cancer.But I just read how bad this can be on your heart.I haven't heard of anyone taking it as a follow up to chemo.         ",
