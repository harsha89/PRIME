      "Content": "i had an enlarged lymph node under my arm while doing chemotheraphy for breast cancer. I was told that if it was cancer under the armpit, the chemo would take care of it. It did go down a bit. But 3 years later it's back again with pain. I did a biopsy today. Surgeon said that it looked like a benign tumor but I don't believe him. Why wouldn't it be cancer. Unless it is benign since the chemo Is still keeping it in remission and that will make it look benign. Pathology report next week.",
