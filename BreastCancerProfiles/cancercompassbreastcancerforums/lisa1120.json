    "Content": "Approximately 6 years ago, I noticed a lump on my breast.  It's located almost under my arm and is more an elongated oval than a round lump.  I called the doctor, who just felt around my breast and told me that it was nothing to worry about.  Last year, since this mass (whatever it is) has not disappeared, I went to a different doctor (I moved to a different state about 3 years ago).  This doctor told me that most likely it was a fatty mass and that I should take Vitamin E, but that if I was concerned, she would order a mammogram.  Well, I was and she did and bottom line is, after 2 mammograms and 1 ultrasound, I still have no answers as to what this is.  It deforms my breast visually, although I don't think there is any \"orange peel\" effect that is common with IBC ( I just learned of this cancer today and did some research).  Over the years, I have experienced discomfort and some minor pain.  There is no history of cancer in my family, either side, that I am aware of and I have asked my parents repeatedly.    I have 3 children and I want to be around for them for the rest of their lives.  I just want to be absolutely sure that I have nothing to worry about.  If I do, I need to know who to turn to who is going to take my concerns seriously.",
