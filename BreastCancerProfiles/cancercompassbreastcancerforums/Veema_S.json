      "Content": "I've been reading all your notes about MGN-3 and wonder how effective it might be for tongue cancer? My father (66 yrs, an ex-smoker) has been diagnosed with terminal tongue cancer and while the doctors are recommending surgery for the fourth time (the removal of the whole tongue this time), this only gives him a 30% survival rate. The other option is the non-surgical route by which they give him a year to live. I want to explore all credible options and avoid surgery. Any advice much appreciated. Veema, London, UK",
