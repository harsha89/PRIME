I am currently on Navelbine, Herceptin, Arimidex, Lupron shots, and Aredia. What was your experience at the Cancer Center of America that was different from the treatent you received at home? How long did you have to stay there. It seems I am already getting what you are getting (I had taxol last year, didn't work well...two tumors in spine disappeared along with my rib tumor; yet 2 new ones on my vertebra and liver came, I also developed sever nueropathy and the nerve damage was so bad the onc HAD to take me off of it.) I recently have a swollen lymph node in my neck and a spot n my hips that hurts. Saw a commercial last nite for this Center, as I have 100 times in the wee hours of the morning, so I figured that I would investigate on it. Just curious how the facilities are, do they push you on your interview, did you stay inpatient, or in a local hotel. I do have a customer service rep looking into insurance coverage for me and I am concerned about the length of stay because I am widowed as well adn need someone to look after my children. I know a little while away; providing I get a better outcome, will be worth the stay away. I just want to know what I am getting myself into. denise d in MA",
