Now I am having problems with my incisions not healing up. I have always been unable to wear earrings, I would break out because of the medal, and last year, way before my diagnosis, I was breaking out by my belly button when I wore this certain pain of jeans. and even in my back by my bra area at times would just break out and be itchy., I think I am allergic to certian kinds of metals. I just realized that these tissue expanders have a medal in them. Could this be the problem as to why i am not healing properly? Has anyone else experienced this problem? I am tryin hard to quit smoking. that may be the cause of the healing issues but, I just had that thought about the medal in the expander I also had a problem with the metal in the tissue expander.  After my mastectomy, I was shown the actual expander and at the time never thought to ask what was inside because it was very heavy.  My plastic surgeon confirmed metal was inside.  I have an ultra sensitivity to metal and had real problems with the expander.  Ultimately, the expander was removed and now I am not sure what, if any, options I have for reconstruction. With the expander I got a styph infection and was in the doctor's office every week for 6 weeks because my breast was getting worse each week.  On the sixth visit, I insisted the expander be removed.  Really scary situation.  ",

It says the expanders contain a metallic component. I asked my plastic surgeron about it, he said that would not be causing my problems. I had to go to outpatient surgery tuesday and he cut out all the dead tissue on both sides (pretty much my whole incision scars) and redid them both. He also removed the expanders. We are going to wait six weeks and start again. Put the expanders in, and start my pump ups over. And I was just getting breasts again and now I am flat as a board again! But It will be well worth it. I do have drain tubes in again and that is a pain. They seem to hurt more this time than last. I also AM A NON SMOKER, as of Aug 29th. I know that had alot to do with my healing. I said lots of prayers and did get the chantix. It really helps.I hardly ever think about smoking. When I do I just imagine my boob and the hole I saw in it. My mom died from breast cancer and she smoked. The same thing happened to her. She had a hole in her neck where the incision split. I will never smoke again!!!!!!  good luck to you!. My plastic surgeon said the same thing about the metal not being the problem.  I had outpatient surgery as well and now waiting to start my radiation treatment and will then go back for options on reconstruction.  It is really strange not having a breast...but its a blessing having life!",
