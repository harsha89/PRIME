Partner left me because he hated looking at my scars. Dr. does not acknowledge post-mastectomy pain syndrome or chemo-brain. Lost my health insurance. Nobody around me understands that I freeze a lot after chemo and I found a new lump that i hope is just a fat glob.  I am crying daily and cannot find any support. I feel alone. Hi Tommy Sorry to hear you have no support. My son also has a lump in his breast and his nipple is itching. Dr said just wait and check in a couple of months.  I am also sorry your partner hates looking at scars - hope he's spared every having any himself.  Being a BC stage IV myself I know how tough just getting thru every day can be. Most don't realize men also get breast cancer and must endure the same treatments and uncertaintys as women. Check your local hospital and see if they might have a local support group for men and you can always try for medicaid, I got it thur the state by group that covers womens issues, but check around their might be something for men too.  Since my son seems to be having a problem would you mind  giving me some insight into your symtoms.  Take care and hang in there, better days are coming.",

      "Content": "Sorry about the delay in my response. I have ducual Sage IV, diag was at time of mri for back pain - I should really say I was way past pain and into no pain - could not walk, would not stand could not move legs - many tumors spinal cord compression mets to many bones in spine and one rib. surgery.   No fusion doc did not want to cover anything up - rods and pins T7 to L5. Yes I can walk - had movement and feeling right after surgery, but needed a walker at first due to being weak. I walk pretty normal, but at a slower pace. Do not use walker or cane , got rid of that about 3 month after surgery. cannot rotate, have trouble shaving legs won't turn as they used to, stooping is sometimes a problem if I drop something must get on knees to pick anything up, flexability will most likely never be the same but then that also depends on how much of your back was fused - once in awhile I do get a tad of numbness in one foot depending if I lift to much or turn a certain and if I get stressed my back muscles tense up and when doing chores I normaly bind myself or wear a support - it helps.  It's all a pain in the butt as I was very active before , but it sure beats spending your life in a wheelchair - so I complain some days but most days I say THANK YOU GOD. If you are getting zometa or arimidex and have aches, pains or cramps it could be from the medication, I personally have never had a problem with either.  All in all the surgery was a fantastic sucess . I'm sure things will improve for you too, it just takes time.  Take care and MAY THE BLESSING BE!!!!!!!!!!!",
