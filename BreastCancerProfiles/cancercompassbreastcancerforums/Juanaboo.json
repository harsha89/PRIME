Worst part was emptying drains and walking bent over for the fist 10 days. After that it got a lot better. Hurts like He** to cough or sneeze but its all good. ",

But my need for control is what contributes too that. No real history of BC. I did have Norplant implanted in my arm for 3 years. till they made me take it out due to the side effects. Plus 1 year to the date that my dad had surgery to remove a tumor on his esophagus, which wasn't successful, is when I was diagnosed. He passed in February. So maybe all those factors helped to contribute. Who knows. But this was a really good way to vent on what did i do wrong to deserve BC. Thanks",

(2) they want to take my breast and (3) want me to consider having my ovaries removed. I have researched so much online that I am overflowing with info so now I need some survivors to tell me its not so bad losing your breast. That the reconstruction immediatly is going to help. So how bad is the pain of the R.S. and how bad is Chemo.",

Sometimes when people are so close to you they forget to say what you really need to hear instead of what they want to hear themselves say. People have been stumbling over the word Cance or just not saying the word at all or making you feel like every little thing you do was probably how you got cancer.  So again thanks for the kind words and the prayer. Keep on Surviving.",

I am having a double Mast. I really can't imagine myself with out breast be it my own tissue or implants. but I don't understand the nipple thing. Is that because of radiation. Are you cancer free now. I hope so",

Even my OBGYN told me it was probably a cyst but gave me a prescription for a mammogram. I was told 2 weeks ago I have Breast Cancer. Please go see a doctor. I don't know what you do if you don't have insurance. I would call your local cancer center and tell them you have found a lump and explain to them that you don't have insurance. By the way I am 36 with no history in my family of Breast Cancer. God Bless",

      "Content": "I lost my father in Feb to Esophagus Cancer he was 56. This was his 3rd battle with cancer. Our family watched him suffer for 7 months. Going from a strong thought to be healthy man with 3 grands. To a frail old looking man who couldn't even walk. I am the oldest of his 3 and It was devistating to watch him just waist away. My son who was 13 at the time was the closest to my dad. I have a 3 year old that I am trying like Hell to make sure she doesn't forget him but my sisters son is only 18mths and he won't remember him. So in July I was diagnosed with breast cancer which threw a monkey wrench in our grieving and focus has now shifted. My son was very upset. He just associated cancer with death and I had to explain to him that I have a fighting chance and I need him praying and helping out after my surgery(Mastectomy r. breast.) Chemo is next. I am only 36. So As I still grieve for my (so very much missed) dad. I am now fighting for my life. I wanted my dad to visit me in the hospital (he didn't) I wanted my dad to visit me at my house and tell me Girl you are gonna be okay. (He didn't) I had so many people call and visit me. Everyone except my Dad. I miss him so much but I know he watch over me during my surgery and he is a felt spirit among my family in a time of need. So you have to hold on to the good memories and keep plenty of pictures of your mom and talk about her as much as possible (without freaking other family out). God Bless",
