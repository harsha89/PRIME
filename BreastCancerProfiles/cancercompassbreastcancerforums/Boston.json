      "Content": "I saw an article in a woman's type magazine at the nail salon about a woman who is in fashion who had a single masectomy .  She wrote about getting the expanders and how hard it is to get dressed with only one . It was an October issue - I want to get it and give it to my husband who never saw the \"issues\" I had trying to look normal with one \"boob\". I am happy now - with two but I always wished I had expressed better how difficult the time was and this article said it well. My body is all healed but I am still upset at the lack of emotional support I received and want him to read the article. If you know the name of the person or the magazine please post it. Thanks Jo - healthy and reconstructed.  ",

Has anyone had a problem, with the bras riding up, and settling on the incision?  I have an open wound ( Yes, after 1 1/2 years) But anyway, that's a story in it's self.   I am looking for a way, or a garment, that won't ride up on the incision.  I have tried the cammy's and that is ok.. But for something more formal, does anyone have any ideas? I have the sylicone(?) forms, and the softies as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Regards,  Deb Been there - I put extra elastic on the bras either a piece that attaches to your pants - like a garter belt - I also sewed a piece accross the back between the straps - I was always afraid my bra would fall down not up from the weight  of the forms .  After 9 years I finally realized how hard it was and had the reconstruction. . Other thing I did was wear bathing suit tops - lands end made a two piece tankini - the top is long and you can tuck it in and it has pockets for the forms.  ",
