      "Content": "Hi This supplement works in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer cells and keeps it from growing (54-61%) and provokes the cells to self destruct (apoptosis). It inhibits MCF7 human breast cancer cells better than tamoxifen under laboratory conditions. This is a nonprofit foundation and I have been taking their supplements for the past four years and so far my breast cancer has not come back (knock on wood). This is an alternative medicine that I am using which was recommended to me to use when I first started going to the cancer treatment center. Just do some reseach on their web page and you will get some insight on alternative methods for breast cancer. Hope this helps Nancy H.",

      "Content": "To: Jeannine S. I was diagnosed 4 yrs ago this April with stage one breast cancer. I received a lumpectomy and bachytherapy on my left breast. As of right now I am not receiving any treatment, but I have changed my eating habits and I am taking vitamins and drinking carrot juice. One supplement I am taking that is supposed to be good for hormone receptor negative is indole 3-carbinol 200 mg caps twice a day. Nancy H,",
