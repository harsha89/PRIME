      "Content": "Have my 1.5 year old restling with my lap top here so will have to be short.  I had chemo for oesophageal cancer (it has a really low survival rate) 6 years ago. I was nervous of getting the treatment but I could not swallow so I needed it and I instantly saw results. I had 4 consecutive days of chemo a month for 3 months which included taxotere.  I used to joke taxotere loose your hair.  I was suprisingly upset when the hair went, my then fiance (we married 2 weeks after chemo) was trying to hide it from me but it was a shock but at least I knew that the chemo was working and I was stronger than the cancer. I had one good week where I did things (such as plan my wedding).  I remember a lot of things but I do not remember the chemo. You will be fine, it is scary but you need it to have a long life. Better get back to my 18 month and 31 month old who are running riot! Aoife",
