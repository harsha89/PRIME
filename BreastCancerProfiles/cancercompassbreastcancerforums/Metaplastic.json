    "Content": "Hi Carol, I hope you're doing well. My mom was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer in November. The tumour was 3.5 cm. She had a lumpectomy and has just finished chemotherapy. I've been trying very hard to find out information about this type of cancer - the experience of those that have had metaplastic cancer. Can you let me know how your experience has been. Thanks very much Carol! Mariette Matos",
