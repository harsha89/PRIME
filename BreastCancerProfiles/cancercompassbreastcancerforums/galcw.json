      "Content": "i was first diagnose with bc in 2002.  i went thru chemo and radiation but no surgery as the primary tumor could not be found.  i took tamoxifen for about three years and then switched to arimidex? in jan of 2006 i was once again diagnosed with bc.  had a mastectomy.  the pathologist found the tumor we knew about but also found the first tumor that did not show up on mammo, mri or pet scan.  i had a prophylactic mastectomy on the other side. i too have the same concerns as you abokut recurrence  every little ache or pain means the cancer has spread.  i'm so glad to find a place where i can talk about this with others in the same boat. acutually,   the second diagnosis may have saved my life.  the hidden tumor was 5cm and would have only continued the grow had i not had a second tumor",

      "Content": "please bare with me as this is my first time doing this.  i was diagnised with breast cancer in 2002.  went through chemo and radiation.  no surgery as the primary tumor could not be found. in 2006 i was diagnosed with breast cancer again.  this time i had a mastectomy and a course of chemo.  the pathology report came back so bad (5cm tumor that did not show up on mammo, mri or pet scan)  i chose to have a propholactic mastectomy on the other side. this may be more than you need to know but because of this i have been on many of the drugs y'allhave been discussing. fortunatly i have had very few of the side effects   right now i hsve been taking aromasin for about 14 months. the only problem i have is earlly in the morning the soles of my feet hurt and i have pain in my ankles. i'm not trying to make those who suffer feel bad but i wanted anyone whose dr has suggested aromasin and is researching it to know that not everyone has sure severe problems ",
