      "Content": "I was diagnosed 13 months ago with stage IV liver cancer.  Previously in 97 I was treated for breast cancer.  I've been getting chemotherapy for the last 9 months.  I'm now on the fourth kind of chemo.  This last one seems to be working.  It's getting rid of the \"freckles\" in my liver and making the remaining \"freckles\" smaller.  I have two more treatments of Adryamicin, then another Cat Scan.  If the \"freckles\" are all gone, I may be put on a \"sister\" chemo or hormone  pill (Femora), as I have had a blood clot.  My questions is if all the freckles are gone and I'm on hormonal pills, what is the life expectancy?  I've heard 15% chance of living for 5 years!!!!!!  IS THAT TRUE?????  If anybody has any answers or input, please respond! PS: it's really hard to keep the weight off with all the pre-meds!!!!",

This recurrence happened least than a year after my orginal treatment ended. I am on my second rcycle of Xeloda/Avastin. I feel really good but am scared that it is a false feeling of security. I've been reading about others in my position, How much pain are you in? And are you able to continue your regular routine? Hi Lori in Florida!,  I'm Karen in Florida!  I was diagnosed 13 months ago with Stage IV Liver Cancer.  Speaking of pain?  I take pain killers...but not everyday.  And NO I do not work and haven't worked all last year.  I've been on 4 different chemos: Taxol, Taxaterra, Gemzar (the expensive ones) and am now on Adryamicin (the cheap one!).  It seems to be taking all the \"freckles\" out of my liver.  I've been lucky that I didn't have to work ,(I get chemo 3 weeks out of the month) as I have a family that subsidizes me. So far all the PET Scans and CAT Scans show that the cancer has not spread to any other part of my body, although, the docs are keeping an eye on some suspicious spots on both sides of my thyrax. Please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing!!!!!!",
