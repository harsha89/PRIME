      "Content": "Judith, I pray you are doing well.  I guess my side effect from xeloda are minimal compared to yours.  My tumor count has dropped from 350 to 66  My gripe is that the doctor says I will need to stay on this medicine even after my tumor count is normal.  I'm not sure I want to spend the rest of my life with these side effects.  Silly doctors, they just don't seem to understand that they are supposed to make you all well and send you home.  I know this is a childish analogy, but it is how I often feel.  Had you han infusion therapy before?  I had it in 1996 and was told I may not be able to again.  Maybe the lenght of time matters?  Thanks and take care,  Kathy",
