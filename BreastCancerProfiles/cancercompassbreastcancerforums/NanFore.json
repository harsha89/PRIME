I'm still getting stiff. Especially if I've sat for a while then get up, My neck & knees especially are stiff. My question is has anyone noticed being lathargic, depressed or overwhelmed? I cover 4 counties in my job and receive a lot of emails. I'm starting to feel \"scattered\" in my thinking. I already take a generic synthroid and an anti-anxiety & depressing pills..altho all are low mg's. Appreciate everyone's thoughts..  After 2 1'2 years of being on Aromasin, I have weight gain, joint pain, depression, mood swings and often feel emotionally overwhelmed. I was never a \"crier\" but now cry for almost no reason at all.  i find it hard to focus and feel \"scattered\" most of the time.  In the last 3 weeks, I've developed tendonitis and now in the last 4 days - pins and needles in my left hand and lower arm - especially my thumb.  Will I go off Aromasin?  Nope.  I had tried Arimidex and it was the same.  I can get through this and will.  I lost 10% bone density my first year - so oncologist put me on Boniva and I eat tons of calcium and Vit D all day long.  I can live with this and I have.  I just explain to everyone that my anti-cancer med makes me cry, fat and walk like an old lady cause of joint pain.  But other than that --- it's great. I'm Catholic and I believe in offering my suffering up to God for Him to use for others. I unite my suffering to Jesus' suffering.  Hang in there.  We can all make it with God's help and Grace.  We can do this.  Side effects of Aromasin are nothing compared to the side effects of cancer.  God bless all of us.",
