      "Content": "I would recommend her mentioning it to her gyno.  It could be simply from her being pregnant or it could be something a little more serious.  At this point her hormones will be all over the charts and her doctor would be the best one to advise on this.  You never mentioned if this is her first, in which case there would be no previous one to compare it with.  Each woman's body is different and reacts differently to different situations.  Why not go with her on her next doctor's visit and that way you can hear for yourself.  Just a thought.",

      "Content": "I had my lumpectomy on April 23, 2014.  They provided me with a front closing soft bra.  They took 16 sentinenal lymph nodes and I was off work for 1 month due to some of the things I do at work.  They should advise you at your surgical follow up appointment which should be about 1 week after surgery.  As for bras, soft sport bras with no underwire will be the best.  A lot will depend on where your incision is and where the bras catch you, same goes for seatbelts.  A thin pillow or folded up towel works great to cushion incisions from the seatbelt.  My incision starts at my breast bone and goes in towards the nipple.  I also have an incision under my arm where they took the lymph nodes.  I highly recommend doing google searches on any treatments they prescribe afterward to prepare yourself for any decisions you may need to make.  The better informed you are the better decisions you can make for yourself.  Good luck and God bless. ",
