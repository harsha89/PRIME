      "Content": "Strong family history of Brest cancer. Recently had severe itching discoloration tenderness of breast and under arm. I have had a mammo, ultrasound, and MRI which all were reported negative. Said I have dense breast, did note tissue changes though. Recommended genetic counseling due to the strong family history. With that being said you know that sixth sense you feel like your body just isn't right, well yea that's there lingering in the back of my mind. I'm tired all of the time, I did have a complete hysterectomy in April removed ovaries too, they all seem to think it is related to that. I DO NOT TAKE HORMONES. Should I trust what the primary care and radiologist say or push forward , this itching etc has been going on for about a month now. They also recommended maybe seeing a dermatologist. Any suggestions?? Sometimes I wonder if the sixth sense thing is just fear as my mom died at the young age of 40 with breast cancer. Any and all advice help would be appreciated. Thank you",
