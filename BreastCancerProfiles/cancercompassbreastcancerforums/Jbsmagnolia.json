    "Content": "Take him to Dr asap.  Hard to describe the smell but a kind've sweet foul smell if that makes sense - not bo and not bad breath but distinct odor of its own.  Some cancers do not smell but a lot do and I fully agree with getting medical profession on board with diagnosis based on this smell so tell doc whether they want to believe it or not!",
