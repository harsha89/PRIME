    "Content": "Hello, my name is Kim and my mother has advanced Breast Cancer stage IV. I got the flu about 2 weeks ago and lasted about 15 days. I tried my best in staying away from her so she doesn't pick it up. Unfortunately, she got the flu on Sunday. She also has sinusitis so it makes the effects even worse. We are all extremely worried about her getting a Pneumonia. She is undergoing Chemotherapy called Abraxane every 2 weeks. I would like to know if someone knows any information or has expierence with this kind of situation and if she has any risks of getting anything as serious or worst. I am very worried and am keeping an eye on her. I would also like to know if there is anything my mom can take daily to lower the chances of her getting sick again. She is very allergic to multiple medications and some are very bad for her stomach. She has ulcerative colitis which makes makes things more difficult. I would greatly appreciate any responses or even opinions. I am waiting for any replies. Thank you very much",
