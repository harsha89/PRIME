    "Content": "I had a 1.5 centimeter malignant tumor removed from my left breast 7 weeks ago.  The lymph nodes were clear.  The doctors are recommending radiation and then hormone therapy.  The radiologist is giving me a choice of a partial radiation treatment whereby I would be radiated twice a day for 1 week instead of once a day for 5 weeks.  The other option I may have is called \"mamosite,\" where seeds are implanted once a week. My concern is that I have developed a enlarged heart recently and don't want the heart damaged more by the radiation. Has anyone undergone this 1 week treatment or mamoisite treatments. Thanks, Candyse",
