    "Content": "10 years ago my wife had a lumpectomy (sp) on the left breast and they found that two of eight lymph nodes were involved.  She received chemo as well as i think 36 radiation treatments.  She has been clear till last year when the cancer returned as well as angiosarcoma of the left breast.  She had a mastectomy of the left breast as well as chemo.  that was in February and the wound sill has not healed.  the surgeon has been treating it but now yesterday he did another biopsy of near the wound that he said looked new.  My question is if by chance this is the angiosarcoma what type of treatments can she have if any.  I do know that she can recieve no further radiation due to the fact that her oncoligest said that they think the wound is not healing due to the radiation he recieved 10 years ago.  She is about ready to give up.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
