Is it fear?If you climb with a friend,you can go hand in hand,and the feeling of comradship really is grand.When you,ve conquerd the heights you  might both have a weep,But the path going down does,nt seem quite so steep,So when you are given a mountain to climb,Take some courage, a friend, and one step at a time.   ",
