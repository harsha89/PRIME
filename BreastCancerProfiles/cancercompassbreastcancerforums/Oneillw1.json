    "Content": "I have been dealing with cancer for almost 18 years now. I had a mastectomy in 1988 and then my reoccurance was diagnosed in 1994. I've had a autologous bone marrow transplant, which was in 1/95 and several regimens of chemo and hormonal therapy. I'm presently on Xeloda, but after that runs its course I will be without something else to go to other than Taxol. I would like to know if anyone knows of any other treatments or clinical trials out there that I can participate in. Thank, Wendy O.",
