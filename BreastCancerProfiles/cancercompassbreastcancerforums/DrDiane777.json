      "Content": "Thank you so much for you message the fact tht you have been doing this for 11 years gives me hope, I was first dx in 2009 and in the last year the cancer has been on the move in a pretty big way previous to that I was not doing chemo or any western medication, I had become vegan and was taking many many supplements and with radiation we were putting out little fires for a couple of years, mostly in my hip and pelvis, the cancer just din't want to go away from those spots until in July we found it had gone to my brain but whole brain radiation and gamma knife were successful in managing that but a PET scan yesterday told me that the cancer in the rest of my body was spreading to my L1 and T1 in my spine and perhaps to my liver, sounds like chemo time I was just worried about quality of life and your message reassured me that I can have both.  Thank you so much you gave me hope and as we both know without that we might as well give up.  Blessing Diane",
