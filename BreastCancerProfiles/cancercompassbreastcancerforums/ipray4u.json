    "Content": "My 46 years old sis was diagnose with stage 4 breast cancer. She went through Chemo and she was told that the cancer has shrunk in her lymph nodes. A few month later, she started complaining about severe headache and vomiting. CAT scan did not show any cancer cell in the brain. However, they did a biopsy on the spine to test the fluid for any cancer cell and she was tested positive for CM. She underwent Chemo straight in her spine which was so painful. She is pain free now BUT she started to lose her leg muscles as well as her hands both are weak. She underwent a surgery to implant ommaya reservoir and she just got the stitches removed. She will start chemo again but according to the doc if she does not improve, he is going to stop the chemo. She has been very strong in her fight  but on my last call with her she sounded scared and complained about weakness and dizziness. She was given 3 months to live. We are very devastated and our life has changed around but our belief in God is very strong and I hope our prayers will be heard. ",
