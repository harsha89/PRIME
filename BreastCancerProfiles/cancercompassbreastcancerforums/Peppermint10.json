      "Content": "Hi Terry Please, update me more on iv vit c.  and supplements.  My friend has NSCLC, IV, had chemotherapy, 8 treatments, finishing in May.  Since that time he was taking supplements but  2 days ago we got the results from the ex-ray that it started to met. The doctor want to put him on  Tarceva (Clinical Study in Canada) but I really would like him to try Vit C iv  plus supplements.  What kind of supplements are you taking? How are you feeling and are you on any special diet.  I'm so happy that you have such wonderful doc. Peppermint 10     ",
