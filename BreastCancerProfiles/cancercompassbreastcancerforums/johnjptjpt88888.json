High pH water will bring supplements into cells more efficiently. I found a great post here in CC that speaks to your inquiry: RE: I said no to rad&chemo by SpringFlowers on Mon Nov 25, 2013 03:40 PM Quote | Reply ''Good for you!!!  Sadly,very few will do their own investigations in to alternative methods.  I was dx'd at stage 4 - thanks to a misread mammogram.  I should have been dead long ago, I did my own research, had laser surger to get the tumor out, it is necessary to always get the tumor out to stop the cancer cells from spewing into the body.  Not traditional surgery, LASER!  No pain, no cutting, no chance of cancer cells escaping into the body.  Guess we know, no one really wants a cure for cancer, it is the BIG money industry.  Stats show chemo/rad is little effective in treating cancer as opposed to ph therapy.  But, no cost there.  I had been given dire news, now, cancer free due to diet/ph/ and cesiumchloride. Lets hope more people will be willing to use their head rather than their ears to fight this scourge.  I'll never forget the one line I read that convinced me above all else: Doctors polled asked if they would take chemo if they were dx'd with cancer - 87% said NO.   Enough reason for me.'' There is usually no one single, silver bullet, a combination of alternatives and standard treatment can combine to create a successful hybrid approach, like in my case. Ask CC about diet regimes, homeopathic and standard treatment strategies on the breast cancer message board. Let me know what you find, as I will pass your hybrid success story on to others! Love and God Bless! ++Drs. Banerji address homeopathic breast cancer strategies. In this link http://www.pbhrfindia.org/index.php/case-studies-at-pbhrf/br I have done beside pray my heart out and seek more and more alternatives.",
