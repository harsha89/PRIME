      "Content": "started to lose my head hair 14 days after FIRST chemo. It two days had only downy head hair, but no difference in eye brows, eye lashes or body hair. Is this still to come? Feel most comfortable without anything on my head, but I live in Cyprus where the sun is not kind to fair  skinned folk like me. So I have a collection of hats and scarfs, and if antone has any other ideas, please  let me have them. The treatment and recovery for breast cancer here in Cyprus is excellent, so we are very hopeful for a full recovery.",

I started chemo last Wednesday and am deliberately not looking at my brush or comb. I have had really long hair all my life, I am now 61, but because we now live in cyprus - hot and humid, I have had it short for a couple of years. BUT, short is not none and I too am dreading losing mine. Please keep in touch and let me know how you do. Marilyn",

      "Content": "I  just had an operation to remove another lump in my breast and the lymph nodes under my left arm. All went well, scars are fantastic compared to what i imagined BUT I have the most horrendous pain down my left arm. Many of my fellow patients complained of 'something' in the arm, but none said it was bad. There is a language problem with the doctors, and they tell me this is normal. Has any one else experienced this?. I have no pain or discomfort in the breast, but my arm --- I could cut it off. Any info or advice would be appreciated",

Will try a sleeve and see if it works for me. Don't pills of any sort but having been popping pain killers like smarties - and I don't like smarties. Please keep in touch and let me know how you do.
