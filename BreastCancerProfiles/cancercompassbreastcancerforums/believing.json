    "Content": "Please let me encourage you a bit. I know you may sometimes feel scared or even defeated.  But it takes so much to fight this desase and many others.  It takes a lot of courage and a lot of support. Much of this has to come from you.And much from those around you.  I by no means want to shove my way of thinking onto you, yet I want you to do all you can to keep on going.  I am a Christian, now if you do not agree with that, please keep on reading and at least give this a chance by continuing to read.  I believe everyone needs a foundation to live life on.  As I fought breast cancer....now 14 years ago,  I did about everything that was suggested from other survivors.  I began to look at life with different eyes. I began to stop racing through life.  Running her and there and allowing this world to be in charge of me and my family.  Each and every day I feel thankful for the many changes I took during that time.  I first began to find strength in reading the Bible.  I started by looking in the back of the Bible and used the NIV version,   as it is a bit easier to understand. I looked up scripture that would help me. I first wanted to begin having peace in my heart.  I found. so many words to hold in my heart.  Then I found that God has made us so many promises and I began to believe in those.   One of my favorites was  \"he promises us grandchildren\" I began to remind myself of that over and over.\"  I then looked up many, many verses about healings. I would write them down and place them in different places throughout my house.  This way everyone in the house could see them. Jeremiah 17:14 tell us. \"I am saved because you saved me, I am healed because you healed me\" and again I just starting believing those words. I decided, by choice, that each day could be a great day, Now please know that I had my down times.  But again I chose to not let it last long.  (now if you do not believe the same as me, you may be asking if God is so good, why do you have cancer?)  and you know I can not answer that.  but I know God did not give it to us.  We live in a world that is full of sicknesses...we all  eat wrong.....we all have the family backgrounds but what I can tell you is God wants us to have faith, hope, peace, joy. And we have to find that within ourselves and not with in this world. Happiness is a decision.  And we have the choice to do all we can to live that until the end or we can choose to be unhappy, have no faith, no peace and no joy.    Because of having 4 children I wanted what ever time I had left, be it 40 years or 40 days.  to be days that were as positive as possible.  I did not want them to remember me as a negative mom or one that had no faith. There were times that i could only muster up enough to go outon my porch and look around to find something that made me feel wonderful, if even for a moment.  Sometimes it was the kids playing, sometimes a beautiful flower or sometimes a bird singing.  But with that moment come more moments and with that I could handle the next one. I know you might be saying,  this is not for you.  But if you have not found some inner strength, I want to suggest that you try it.   I believe that having all that,  faith, joy, hope, peace and God in my life has help me become a stronger person, a better person and one who has much to live for.   Please do not give up......if my way is not for you.  Then try another. But remember you are a special creation and you have much to survive for. And scars are not that big of deal when you look at them in the right way and it sounds like you are loved, unconditionally. Some of us have had our breast removed and  we still consider ourselves beautiful people.  Why because we are.    ",
