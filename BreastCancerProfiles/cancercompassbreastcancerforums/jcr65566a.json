Lymph nodes probably not infected but will know for sure after my lumpectomy 8/6/14. I have changed my diet and lifestyle since the morning of the Dx. I used to eat everything in sight, though tho I'm naturally skinny so never thought anything of it. I've been completely vegan since that morning and have been adhering to a strict alkaline diet and exercising everyday and feeling great! However, I just want to be fully prepared for the possibility that I may need chemo if indeed it has spread. My research has been so mixed, deciding between chemo or alternative treatments involving B17, eating only fruits/veg... vs. chemo.  Does anyone have any personal experience with either success or failure after refusing chemo? I have heard many success stories myself, either friends' moms or aunts but I haven't heard any failures (except Steve Jobs but even his wasn't so much a failure as pancreatic cancer is very deadly and he survived another 8 years post his initial Dx when only 4% survives past 5 years)... I have stage 4 prostate cancer I have been on B17 in the form of aprecots pits for many years now it I read that it can realy help with stoping the tumors with Breast Cancer, Have a look at the you tube video the lady treatd here cancer with the comerial form of B17 but I have spoken to her you can to on you tube and it seem to work for her All the best Ray   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyvSmhrlJwE",
