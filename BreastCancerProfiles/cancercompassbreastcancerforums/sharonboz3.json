      "Content": "I know it's hugely emoptional facing surgery, but in your case, they did the right thing--imagine how you would be feeling if there were terrible complications with the anaesthesia and your breathing. You would be beyond mad--your life might be in danger. So, try and meditate and deal with your anger. Mastectomies are no big deal--it's just a boob. And when you're feeling better everything will work out for the best. What's the good in being so mad about it? At least the care team carred enough not to put your health at risk. Enjoy the day and feel better.",
