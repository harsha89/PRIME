    "Content": "After a mastectomy for breast cancer in 2003 I reacted badly to Tamoxifen and after a year was moved to Anastrazole. Very rapidly I had a very acute reaction to it in my bones - ALL of my bones, except my left jaw bone. After 8 months of severe pain this was diagnosed as Polyarthralgia and I was treated with high dose I/M Depomedrone.  The beneficial effect only lasted eight months and then the injection would be repeated. Having a flu injection would start it all off again. Eventually I was seen by someone researching the adverse effects of Anastazole and he asked me if I skied. I said I used to but had had to give up because I could no longer hold my curves.  He said this muscle weakness was a direct result of taking Anastrazole and it would continue.  NOW, thirteen years on the muscle weakness is considerable, particularly in my legs.  Has anyone else experienced considerable muscle weakness? I can barely get to my feet again if I bend down. After a rare fall, I really struggled to find the strengtht to get up! It is a very unexpected long term inconvenience.",
