      "Content": "If I have dcis and I remove my breast won't I be removing all the dcis hence lessening the chances. See what I have been struggling with is I just have been notified that I need a re excision due to poor margins I have necrosis cells I have solid pattern with high grade on my first biopsy and intermediate grade on the lymphectomy biopsy. I have no great attachment to my breast and my spouse wants me to have it removed to lesson worry of reoocurrance. with reconstructive surgery as an option I guess the thought of removing my breast w/reconstruction and not having to go through more reexcisions (Possibly) and also not having to go through Radiation as well I am not a gambler and from what I have researched so far a masectomy seems the savest route to take. I have yet to read or hear that lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen has a better cure rate than masectomy. I have heard that its about the same I guess I am just a littel confused.  Thanks for your answers they are greatly appreciated.  God Bless,  Spiritsquad",

      "Content": "I will need to go on the treatment of Tamoxifin to lessen the reoccurance of breat cancer.  I have had many rx of dysplasia over the years. I am now 47 and got back a clear pap smear on my last reading.  Is tomoxifen a risk to take if you have had many instances of dysplasia ? I may opt to have masectomy and be done and not have to worry about such things.  Seems like the smater route to ensure health if you don't mind loosing your breast.  any and all thoughts appreciated Thanks Spiritsquad",
