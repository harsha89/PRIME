    "Content": "1st off breath. You've now got time so slow down. You've got kids so make it one step at a time. You might want to start with exercize to help manage the stress and then choose one thing and just start. In treatment everything seems so rushed, now you are at a new stage. You can take control and do things at a more reasoned pace. I'm in remission 8 years now and I have dropped 30 pounds, totally changed my eating habits, started taking supplements, gotten out of a destructive relationship and just finished a training hike for mountain climbers! Wild. It seems like so much change but it was just take a step. Get used to it. Start feeling better. Get really used to it. And then make another change.",
