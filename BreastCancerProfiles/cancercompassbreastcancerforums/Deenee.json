      "Content": "I am not familiar with this type of breast cancer. I had DCIS in my left breast. What I do suggest is that before your lumpectomy you go to another specialist. This is what I did. In addition to that read as much as you can. Dr. Loves book is one of the things I read in addition to alot of material on the web. My first Dr. wanted to do a lumpectomy, the second Dr. recommended several choices. From everything I read I chose a skin saving Masectomy, (Tram-Flap surgery). I am the message on the board either above or below you. I know this is not for everyone and everyone has different circumstances. What I do know is arm yourself with as much knowledge as you can, if you can not do this enlist family or friends to help you and please get a second opinion soon.",

      "Content": "I am wondering if anyone experienced this and how they had it corrected. I had this surgery 5 years ago. The incision inside under my breast has opened. I look about 7 months pregnant. My internist says they can cut me down the middle to repair it. The plastic surgeon says she would go through the same bikini cut scar line. I have lived with this 3 years doing nothing but I am begining to have severe back problems. I do not want to go through the same incision because I know the more scar tissue that forms the greater the chance it might wrap around organs. Does anyone know of a microscopic repair? If you are considering this surgery don't let this scare you off. I would do it again if I had to.",

      "Content": "Hi Jomar, I had DCIS in what was thought to be only one area. I had the choice of either surgery or radiation and chemo. After doing alot of research I opted for a skin saving mastectomy - tram-flap surgery. They cut around my orelea. scooped me out like a melon,made a bikini incision and took my tummy fat pulled from the inside and filled my breast from the back. I had no arm swelling, did not have chemo or radiation after, did not take tamoxophen or any other type of medication. I had no pain with recovery because the nerves were cut. The first year I only had maybe 10% feeling through the middle of my tummy, abdomen and brest. The nerves take a long time to grow back. I was 44 yrs old when I had this surgery. I am now 49. I know have 50% of my feeling back. None in the nipple though. I could have had my left breast lifted up also but it was not saggy enough at the time to warrant the Dr, doing this. I did end up with a minor hernia in my midriff but this was due to a nurse who had me pull myself up in the hospital bed with my arm. I have not yet had this corrected. I am ready now to have my orelea tatooed again. To tell you the truth my beast looks better than it did before. They are now almost symetrical. I had a mesh put in my tummy when the surgery was done. The lower part of my stomach is totally flat from this. This would be my choice if I had to do it over again. I read about the diep flap from someone who responed to you. This sound pretty good also. You do not have to do any drugs after though if your lymph nodes are clear. They took three of mine and I was clear. After my surgery when they sent my tissue off the Dr. told me I had made the right choice because my milk ducts were packed full of DCIS but I guess they couldn't see it. This is the chance you take with a lumpectomey, your milk ducts are a finely integrated web. What they take they are not sure if it has crossed over into another section or not. It's a gamble which is why I decided to do what I did. They are web sites where women have photos of their before and after. When I get a mamogram the technician alway asks me which breast I had done. Good Luck to you whatever you choice. Write back if you need more info. Nadine",
