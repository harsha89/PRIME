I had scans done in May and something showed up on the liver but, was told it was nothing. Now here I am stage IV and scared to death. I see doctor tomorrow to find out I guess what can be done if anything. Any one else with breast cancer that has metastasis to the liver? Would love to have someone to talk to about this. I hope this email finds you well. My mother has the same thing. I'm hoping that you can give me some insight on treatments that may have worked and those that did not.    ",

      "Content": "Glad to hear back from someone.   I think the best thing one can do in this situation is to try to get some abalation done. You have to get rid of the cells somehow in order to have any real hope of a cure. Attempt to have your mom see someone about RF therapies or resection. The liver regenerates itself so they can remove a lot of it and someone can still function. I wish you and yours the best.   Kenneth    ",
