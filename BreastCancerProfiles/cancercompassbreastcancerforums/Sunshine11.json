      "Content": "Hi - lung mets and brain mets can be nasty too. Have you found bcmets.org which is a forum for those with mets? If not, do have a look and try a posting there too. Chemo is nasty, but I always tell myself that it isn't for ever, and that each time it has put things into hold. It's the tiredness that wears me out.",

      "Content": "Hello, there seems massive disagreement on this one. Depends on whether the interpretation is taking antioxidants possibly will interfere or probably will interfere with the action of chemotherapy. My own research leans to the \"possibly\" side and so I take what I feel I need. However, it's worth remembering that we get Vit C from fruits and vegetables (and meat as well), so I would tend to take a smaller supplement than you seem to be thinking of. What treatment are you on? best wishes Phoebe",

Don't know where you are, but results should be through within at most 10 days. If the system is efficient could be much quicker. No harm in asking the unit when the results will be available. Good luck - try not to worry. most lumps are benign.",

If you can provide details of what kind of cancer, whether hse has had a mastectomy or lumpectomy, whether er/pr neg or positive, whether HER or not , which treatments she has already had, then some indication can be made as to what is happening.",
