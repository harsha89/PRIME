    "Content": "I initially had a lump under my arm(painful, soft) but it went away by the time I went to the dr...but she still ordered a mammogram and ultrasound. Both came back as normal...have some cysts in both breasts...which I am used to. But I always had pain/discomfort with my breasts...(sometimes very itchy too). This weekend I noticed milk like discharge as I was showering... Ive never seen that before...my youngest is 10 yrs old...so was just curious...if I should be concern with any of this... Â  Thank you for your help! Victoria",
