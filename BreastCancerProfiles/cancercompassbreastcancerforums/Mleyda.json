      "Content": "Yes, I have had the oncogene test after diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer, had lumpectomy and Contura radiation.  My oncogene test came back just 2 points over into the 'high' risk area.  I also decided the odds were in my favor since I had no lymph involvement and would also take Arimidex.  Now, 16 months later I have metastatic spinal bone cancer and am off Arimidex and on Xeloda (chemo) and Zometa (bone-builder).  Good luck to you!",

Not a muscle, doesn't hurt when I move.  wondering if it is a bone(rib) maybe caused by radiation.  The site where I had my nodes out is always tender. I was dx breast cancer in June 2011 and had lumpectomy (no lymph node involvement) and radiation and given Arimidex oral pills.  All went well til Oct 2012 when I experienced lateral back/flank pain and after going to my chiropractor, personal MD, ER, and again personal MD was told to see my oncologist.  I did - had a CT scan done that showed my breast cancer had metastasized to my spine and bones.  If you have not had a CT/PET scan, please tell your Oncologist so they can schedule one for you.  Good luck.  I hope your results are good.  I am now diagnosed with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer to bones, and using oral chemo along with immune-building natural enzymes, vitamins, and minerals.",
