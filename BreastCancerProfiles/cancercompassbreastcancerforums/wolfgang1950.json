      "Content": "So helpful and informative to read all the posts.  Was first introduced to the site in July 15, when my wonderful partner Wolfgang was given the horrendous diognosis of oesphageal cancer stage 3 N1. It was inoperable and we started the whole roller coaster ride! Wolf commenced strong cocktail  of daily 2300mg chemo drogs and the IV EOX. From initially been given a death sentence the treatment seems to be working andca PET scan revealed after chemo no 3 Was that tumour shrunk and LN too, we were of course over the moon!  he is now on no 5 and final no 6 9th Dec and another scan, please god with more reduction. Then in October I was diognosed after routine scan breast tumour right breast. Had a lumpectomy 9th Nov and was told grade 3 and Her2 +. I have had lumpectomy and sentinile biopsy. Off work almost 2 weeks, swelling appeared on scars near lymph node, which was lymph fkuid and wash drained!  Met surgeon yesterday  and was told tumour removed and grade 2 but had gone tolymph nodes 3 of. Would need chemo, herceptin, radiotherapy and more surgery to remove LN.  they couldnt believe how well I initially took news, but found with worrying about wolf a busy office job which involved project managing a large office move , finally sunk in that I have cancer too.  I now can read situations from being with wolf so not all news a shock!  Cried last night that realisation a hard journey ahead!! Sure I will cope but worried about losing energy etc and not keeping controll of my life too. Wolf has been amazing onnhis journey acrwal tough cookie and the support of fantastic nfriends and family really helps  does anyone know what side effects with my treatments and from removing the lobes?? Look forward to hearing from you, living with cancer NOT dying with it!! Love Sue and Wolfe xxxxxxx .  ",

Yeah...the positive & positive people, energy & events. Agree w you there. We carry on! Best.  HI Sue here, I start my first Chemo on 18TH December for BC and Herceptin after 3rd cycle.  Been supporting my partner Wolf, since July with Oesphageal cancer EOX treatment, so procedures etc not alien to me.  Hope I am as strong as him as been lucky most my life not being 'ill' Had the lumpectomy and sentinle biopsy, okay first couple of weeks then site near biopsy swelled and had to be drained, so painful! Or am I soft?! Maybe I should have done the exercised first!!  Keeping strong, living with it not dying with it!! Sue and Wolf xx",
