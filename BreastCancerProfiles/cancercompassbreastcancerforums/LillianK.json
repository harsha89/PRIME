    "Content": "I dont know how the allergy medication such as claritin would help with the back pain unless the pain itself occured from the allergy to that particular medication during chemo. I have back ache cause of the chemo as well and since I also have a heart disease, I am not able to take just any pain reliever to ease the pain and the pain itself wont let me be on my feet for more than 5 minutes. I wish someone would find a solution for it rather than just telling me to deal with it.",
