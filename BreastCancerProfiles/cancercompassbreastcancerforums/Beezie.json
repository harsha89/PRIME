    "Content": "Mary Pat: I am telling you, after two bouts with two different types of cancer, you get them to give you any CT, body scan, MRI that gives you enough mental security to survive. I actually had a woman call me, diagnosed with breast cancer a year ago, done with chemo, and ask if her oncologist should have done a bone scan. I told her to ask for one and to her surprise he said \"Oh, have we not done a bone scan?\" -even doctors are not infallible and since it is us who have the darn disease - ask your doctor for anything you think needs to be done and if doesn't want to, find one who will. In fairness to the medical field, we have a survival rate unheard of anywhere in the world. But you are concerned about you, and he is probably concerned about healing multiple persons with cancer. I respect my doctors and my oncologist but I will decide what is necessary for me to mentally get up and win against cancer. Good luck to you. Beezie",
