    "Content": "Check breastcancer.org for information about how Celebrex is helpful in preventing reoccurance - while helping with joint pain caused by Aromasin, it is also helping with prevention.  I had the same type of breast cancer and treatment.  I am balancing the question of the risk of reoccurance with what has become debilitating pain and a significant decrease in quality of life.  I plan to talk to my oncologist  ASAP.  Today was especially bad since I twisted my ankle & fell down while moving, caused in part by my unreliable knees.  From what I've read, Arimidex seems to have the same side effects, and women are reporting significant brain disfunction from taking Femera. What's a gal 3 years out to do?",
