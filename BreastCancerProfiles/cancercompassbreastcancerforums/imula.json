    "Content": "I have been diagnosed 4 weeks ago with a 6 cm tumour Invasive Lobular Cancer. Aspiration biopsy in one lymph node was negative, but that may or may not be too indicative. Due to the size of the tumour I will most likely need radiation therapy as well as chemo and hormonal therapy.   I saw the surgeon yesterday and she suggested a unilateral mastectomy. I opted for a bilateral mastectomy. I just could not cope with having one breast!!! I find it easier to have none.   We also talked about reconstruction and she was fairly negative about it. She advised that the chances of success are not that high because of the radiation therapy which may be detrimental to the reconstruction. Also surgery may have to be delayed because plastic surgeons are very busy. Potential complications may also delay chemotherapy. But she said that it is my decision and that it does not matter much if the procedures are delayed by several weeks. I find this hard to believe...   I just don't know what to do. Have you had this dilemma? Have you had reconstruction followed by radiation? Or delayed reconstruction or none at all?   Also I am ER+ and PR+ and I will definitely need hormonal therapy. That really scares me as I heard that there are difficult adverse effects. Have you had ny experience, good or bad, with Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors? It is still unclear to me after having read a lot on the internet what the benefits of these hormonal drugs are after double mastectomy. Do you know? I would be grateful for any advice/experience, positive or negative.",
