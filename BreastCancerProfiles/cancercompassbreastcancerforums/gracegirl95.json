    "Content": "Hello All, I was hoping, if anyone feels comfortable sharing, to learn some more about the different options for preventative genetic testing. More specifically, what companies have people worked with (Myriad, InVitae, Color Genomics, Ambry, etc...), why you or your physician chose that company, and whether your insurance covered the costs or you had to pay out of pocket. Vague or detailed information is appreciated! Thanks!",
