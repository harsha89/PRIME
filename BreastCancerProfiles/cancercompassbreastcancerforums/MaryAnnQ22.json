My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily I'M so sorry Emily that you are going through this. You're totally right - this sucks, big time. and you have every right to be angry about it. so let it out. It may be something your friend is feeling too. I'm sorry I can't answer your question about spinal tap needs. But I can offer you some virtual heart feelings...sending energy your way. sincerely, Mary",
