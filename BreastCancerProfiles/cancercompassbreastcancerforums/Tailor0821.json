She went through Chemo and she was told that the cancer has shrunk in her lymph nodes. A few month later, she started complaining about severe headache and vomiting. CAT scan did not show any cancer cell in the brain. However, they did a biopsy on the spine to test the fluid for any cancer cell and she was tested positive for CM. She underwent Chemo straight in her spine which was so painful. She is pain free now BUT she started to lose her leg muscles as well as her hands both are weak. She underwent a surgery to implant ommaya reservoir and she just got the stitches removed. She will start chemo again but according to the doc if she does not improve, he is going to stop the chemo. She has been very strong in her fight  but on my last call with her she sounded scared and complained about weakness and dizziness. She was given 3 months to live. We are very devastated and our life has changed around but our belief in God is very strong and I hope our prayers will be heard. Hi I hope and pray that your sister is ok. My mother inlaw has just been diagnosed with cm after finding a lump on her breast. She seems to have the exact symptoms as your sister and I wondered whether you could advise us of anything that helped your sister feel better? She is beng sick all of the time, has bad headaches weekness of her hands and legs. The doctors don't seem to be able to give her anything to help. We are devasted and desperately want to know what will happen if she does get worse and how we will know when it is the end :0(",

      "Content": "My mother inlaw has been really well for 5 months now even though she has carcinomatous meningitis. After taking the hormone pill letrozole most of the symptoms subsided and she gained energy slowly and w even able to drive and get out and about again. Unfortunately 3 wks ago all of the symptoms started to return and currently she is suffering from really bad headaches, weakness and sickness. She has now been put on a driver to administer the anti sickness as she has tried a number of different ones and they are not working. I will keep you updated if it works or helps. If anyone has a relative or friend suffering from this illness it would be great to hear from more people to fine out more about this illness and what to expect as thing progress. I will keep you updated.",
