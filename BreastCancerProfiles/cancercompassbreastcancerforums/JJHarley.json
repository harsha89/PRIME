Everone is different that i can tell you and hard times are ahead for you but God, love and kindness will get you through and it will take every ounce or all you have doing the best you have god bless and your loved ones. Mom was 72 and did not do chemo or radiation and the breast cancer i hope this gives you something to go by oh you will see some changes.",
