I research cancer cures (that allow the body to heal itself) and took her home with me to work on getting her well. Her main tumor disappeared in 3 weeks and from that point on it just got better. She went from bed ridden in horrible pain to out walking her little dog all around the neighborhood within 3 months. There are others who have had stage IV metastisized breast cancer who are now well and leading healthy full lives in Orange County and all over this country. If you want to talk with someone who has been there done that then let me know ASAP as time is of the essence big time. Karen",

There are people walking around today who are glad to share how they assisted their  body to heal from stage IV cancer when the Dr. had nothing more to do or say. The Key is juicing so you get tons of organic enzymes, eat as much raw as you can, use the alkaline diet/cancer diet and starve the cancer with only 27 carbs per meal. Drink alkaline water (you can get the little cartiridges on line from millinium they're cheap and they work. Then talk with people who have been there done that. Don't know where you are but there are those people all over the US and elsewhere. Blessings, Karen",
