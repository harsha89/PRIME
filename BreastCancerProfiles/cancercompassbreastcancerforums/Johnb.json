    "Content": "Congratulations on finding a chemo that is helping.  You may also want to ask your dr about \"Erbutux\" it's harsh but has been very beneficial for solid mass tumor reduction.  Unfortunatley as I've learned in my 26 month fight with metastasized Colo-Rectal cancer (to my liver) liver cancer has a 4-15% chance of reaching a five-year survival rate and a less then 3% chance of 'remission' since they claim it can't be cured as such. If you still have only a few tumors in your liver PLEASE look into either RFA or targeted radiation therapy.  My dr's discouraged me back when I was a good candidate and now it's spread so much the centers won't accept me - I'm trying herbal and the Breuss diet (very hard to stay on it though, as I had a gastric bypass years ago) and am still somewhat mobile and healthy but every chemo I've tried was ineffective. Quality of life should be your biggest concern - don't be TOO miserable now just to get a few more months of being sick at the end of your life too - take time and enjoy life, see your family, LIVE!  And if you can beat the dam* tumor while you're at it then more power to you. I need to update it now but I have some details of my fight up on my website at goldwing-world.com in the 'personal' section, including a lot of the research I'd done on various treatments.  Every tumor and patient is different unfortunately, so you may respond when others won't but the most important thing of all is to make up your mind what you want to do AND DO IT.  We all die someday from something ... those of us with this disease become more aware of that then many, and if you let it that can be a great eye-opener to really living and enjoying what you have.
