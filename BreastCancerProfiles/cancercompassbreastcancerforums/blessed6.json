      "Content": "Hi, this is my first time to post a message, so forgive me if I break etiquette rules.  I am 41, with 6 kids ages 5  to 17 ( 4 teens!)  I had a bilateral mastectomy in June, the right was elective, the left breast had invasive ductal carcinoma with 11 lymph nodes cancerous also.  I have just finished my last of 6 chemo treatments, waiting to begin radiation in about 2 weeks.  I have been feeling pretty positive until just recently, but for some reason the past week I have felt like having a major throw-down pity party.  I dont understand the reason behind it, except that this last treatment was a doozie, and I'm 2 weeks out and still feeling sick. I'm still nauseous, I want to sleep 16 hrs a day, I have all these sores on my head, my eyelids are peeling and raw, my eyes water constantly, and I cant focus on any task long enough to finish it.  I cant even remember my original reason for posting this message.  I guess I just needed to hear from someone - is there normalcy  after this? Right now I'm this bald, swollen, boobless, sick person, will I ever be ME again?  ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your response.  I have to say, that was probably my worst day emotionally. I went the next afternoon to the hospital and hung out with the folks I used to work with, and they let me do my old job for a while just to show me I was still capable.  Yesterday I did spend the whole day crying, and I realized, I never cried when I was diagnosed, or when I had surgery, or when I lost my hair, and so yesterday it really kicked in, If I wasnt laughing I was crying, about stupid things. I actually cried everytime someone said \"I hope you are feeling better.\"  It felt good, I went to bed early, exhausted, and slept great. Today I got my wig styled, put on eyelashes and tons of makeup and a sparkly shirt, and went to my kids homecoming game. I even drove my daughter in the homecoming parade, and went to the aftergame party with all my teens! I wore what used to be my tightest jeans, which fit great now! I think one of the things that really hurt me that day was the \"pride\" thing, because a few of my closest friends said to me, get over it, you have not worked in 6 months, you have six kids and Christmas is approaching, ASK FOR  HELP! I finally had to admit that things AREN't normal right now, and I cant do it alone (that is, my husband and I cant do it alone), and for once we are gonna have to realize that its OUR turn to be helped.  Thanks to everyone who responded to me! I really needed to hear it. Love and God Bless, may you be cured and cancer free forever. ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Stage 3 invasive ductal breast ca, 11 lymph nodes affected (total 30 removed from left), no distal mets. I was ER/PR positive, HER2 negative. I was premenopausal, but after all my chemo I have pretty much become menopausal, I guess you'd say.  I have received 6 chemo treatments. The first 3 were  5fu, epirubicin, and cytoxan. The last three were taxotere. They were spaced 3 wks apart,  I am taking about 4 wks off, then will begin radiation to the scar and axilla area, about 35 treatments.  THEN, because I was positive for a mutated gene, Im going to have my ovaries out. My oncologist is really encouraging it, because he wants to be able to treat me as a post-menopausal patient, and recommends that I take an oral drug, not tamoxifen but another oral drug, for 10 years rather than 5 because of my age and the rather aggressive nature of my cancer (It grew fast and spread to my lymph nodes, to a Stage 3, just since my previous mammo less than a yr ago, NEVER skip a mammo appt!) My questions are these: 1. Has anyone else followed this chemo protocol and does it sound pretty typical? I read up on it and got a second opinion, but would like to hear about it from a patient, or at least, anyone with any experience of it, 2. There is a microsurgeon I have talked to who does lymph node relocation to the axillary area to prevent lymphedema.  I'm interested in this.  Are my chances pretty high to get lymphedema with 30 nodes gone?  Has anyone ever had this surgery or know of its success?  He would do it at the time I got reconstruction surgery, whenever I was able to have that. 3. If there is someone who had stage 3, with alot of nodes involved, and you had a reoccurance, how long were you cancer-free? And where did it return, breast or a distal site or bone, maybe? I dont know why I asked that last question. I really feel as if I am already cured and it will never return, but my doctor told me that even with the treatment he recommends, I have a 40% chance of recurrance within, three years if I remember correctly.  But he hates to give me statistics, He says, there is only one YOU.  You personally have a 50/50 chance of it returning, and IF it does, we will cure you of that round also. I like that attitude. Thanks to all...Kim     ",

      "Content": "This really IS an important issue.  I had a DIEP flap, and on my second surgery, my surgeon gave me a choice to have a nipple procedure while I was getting my reconstruction fine-tuned. He was honest and told me 1) it doesnt work on everyone, 2) he wouldnt recommend it, except I was already going to be put to sleep so it would be easy for me and 3) I would still need to have areolas tatooed. I agreed and he basically made me nipples out of scar tissue. It was ok at first, but I healed really well...so well that there was minimal scar tissue.  THEN I went to a local surgeon...a plastic surgeon...because his office did areola tatooing.  His tatoo artist prepared everything but the surgeon insisted on doing the tatoos himself, even though she told him it would be tricky...I am very fair skinned and my natural areolas were extremely pale. Well, I cried all the way home. Looked like 2 pepperoni's glued to a sheet! I let them peel and it made them much lighter, but I still hate them.  I keep saying I will try it again but with a regular tatoo artist...have not got the courage up. I am divorced now, no one ever sees them anyway, but I went through all the trouble of reconstruction...the scars will always be there but I was hoping the areolas would make them look more normal.  Oh, well! (By the way, I was 42 when I had DIEP, it was a tough surgery, ladies. Make sure you are ready!)  ",

      "Content": "I do not take neurotin myself, but my dad did for years, and it worked very well for him. Unfortunately, he got confused one day and took too much - actually, he told me he had not taken his meds and I gave it to him, then realized he HAD taken that days meds. It made him have an over build-up and he could never take it again.  My sister takes it...she had a preventative mastectomy after my cancer and we all found out we were BRCA2. She has had minimal side effects with neurotin, and she DOES have a history of depression. I guess, as with any other drug, some people respond well, and others do not.  I have alot of shoulder pain from my radiation, and pain in my mastectomy sites. I take a drug called Meloxicam when it is really flaired up. I also took Ultram, it is not supposed to be as strong as hydrocodone, but it works better for me, with the pain from Femara to my joints and muscles. I am off it now for a while, I was getting sort of immune. Now I take alot of Advil, like 600 to 800 mg at a time, but you really need to check with your physician. Dont overdo anything. I dont know what other meds you take, and something might interact. Also, I swap it up with Naproxin (generic Anaprox, or Aleve). Some days nothing works!",

Although I havent got the final results from my oncologist, I lucked up because, having worked in healthcare for 20 years, I knew the radiologist who read my scan.  He actually reviewed my films with me and told me my lungs look great, no masses, no fluid, no enlarged lymph nodes, even in the chest wall.  Of course, this is a preliminary report, he will study it more, and sometimes they offer followup recommendations, but it looks as if Im in the clear.  Thanks for the prayers and support, and if anything is different I will post a message after my appointment on Monday.",

I am now 3 months behind my last chemo treatment, finished radiation Feb. 18, and I havent had another period. My oncologist said I might start again some day, but my gynecologist did bloodwork and said my ovaries are not working at all.  Regardless, I am having my ovaries removed next week, so I wont have another period.  Did you ask your oncologist about that? It sounds very uncommon to me, but it may not mean much, who knows?",

      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed last June (08) with Stage 3 invasive ductal, left breast, with 11 of 30 nodes affected. Im 42 with 6 kids, ages 5 to 17. I had bilateral mastectomies.  I had chemo, then 38 radiation treatments, which I finished in Feb.  Since Feb., I have had a persistent cough, and it has responded to nothing.  Ive had antibiotics (3 rounds) and steroids (shots and pills, almost constant since Feb.)  I have had breathing treatments, with xopenex and advair.  No cough med works.  The rad. onc thought I had radiation pneumonitis, as I had one beam of radiation to my clavicular area, which went deep enough to hit the lung.  But it hasnt shown up on chest xrays or one ct of chest without contrast that I had in March.  (Of note: I had a negative PET in March as well.) I had to see my rad onc again today, because the cough is worse, has become productive.  They even did heart labs, and I dont have congestive heart failure.  So, basically, my dr said he was puzzled, somewhat concerned, and that I should have a chest ct with contrast tomorrow.  I am to go back Monday to see both the rad onc and the med onc.  He did an exam, and I have several areas at midline and slightly left of my sternum which are sore, and he thinks he feels enlarged lymph nodes.  He said I might have mets to the thoracic lymph nodes.  He always talks \"best case vs. worst case scenario\" because I always ask.  Now, I didnt cry when they said I had cancer. And I didnt cry when I first saw my scars. I never cried with the surgeries, the chemo, any of it.  I have been so POSITIVE that I was through with this. I havent even allowed myself to say \"But if it comes back...\"  Now here I am, its almost midnight, and I dont think Ive had a 2-minute period since leaving his office that I havent felt panicked and near tears, and I admit IM SCARED TO DEATH.  It cant come back this soon, it jjust cant.  We have no more money left, my kids are so glad life is back to normal, my hair is back finally.  I cannot do this.  Please yall pray its nothing...",

      "Content": "Hi, I am 41 (actually my 42nd birthday is today, as it is after midnight my time!) and I was diagnosed with stage IIIC breast CA this June. Thats one step away from Stage 4, it was in 11 lymph nodes but no other body part thus far.  I will tell you what my oncologist told me.  Dont think about statistics, or prognosis.  If it is YOU who has cancer, then you have a 50/50 chance, either it will metastacise or it wont, either you will fight it or you won;t, either you will live or you wont, you get the picture.  I believe at least 80% of the battle is mental and spiritual.  My cousin, who is much older than your sister, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and told she had maybe a year.  She is now in remission, and doing great, and that was about 5 yrs ago.  Sometimes you beat the odds. Having said that, my mom was diagnosed with breast ca at age 54, and before she died 5 yrs later, it was in her lungs, lymph nodes of the neck, spine and base of the brain.  She did well until the last 2 months, when her lungs became so congested with fluid that it made breathing difficult.  She did have some pain from the bone mets, but she handled pain much better than the difficulty breathing.  Ive never seen anyone fight harder to live than my mom.  The only reason I am telling you this is, we as a family just knew when she reached a point where only hospice care was appropriate, there was no guesswork to it.  And cancer care has come such a long way in the yrs since she died, it amazes me.  From diagnosis to treatment, to management of side effects, to pain management, to end-stage palliative care, it has improved drastically. Tell your sister I am praying hard for her.  I have 6 kids, from ages 17-5, and I know the fear of thinking that I wont get to see them finish school, or have babies, etc. I hope we both are on God's \"miracle\" list...",

      "Content": "Dear Kellyann, I was diagnosed with Stage IIIc invasive ductal carcinoma last June 08.  This is the same category that IBC is in, from my understanding.  I was 41, with 6 kids, and had bilateral mastectomies with 30 lymph nodes removed, 11 of which were cancerous.  I had a venous access port put in July 3, and started chemo July 23. Now, nine months later, following 6 rounds o fchemo and 8 weeks of radiation, my life is beginning to return to normal.  I just got the results of my post-treatment PET scan this week, and no METS or remaining cancer was seen, thank God. I am having a hysterectomy with ovary removal, bladder tack, and rectal repair next week, and I am more worried about the pain and recovery from it than the other 3 surgeries I have had in the last 9 months (had to have my gallbladder out in December on short notice!).  You know what, it is a really scary thing to be diagnosed with a more advanced state of cancer, and sometimes I wonder if I will live to see my 5 year old graduate high school.  But I FEEL healed...I feal different, less energetic, especially since I just started taking the Femara, but I just have every faith that everything is gonna be OK.  Just talk about your feelings, fears and symptoms, and be honest about your limitations to those you love and trust.  And remember, your cancer fight is YOURS, you may not have the same side effects, you may have some no one else has had or has been willing to talk about, but the choices you make and the feelings you have are YOURS, dont beat yourself up if you seem to have more bad days or negative emotions than others.  Just remember, all cancer SUCKS, but it can be beaten, You can beat it, and you dont have to go through it alone.  We ALL have similar fears, of reoccurance, of pain, of the lifestyle changes which must occur.  I will be praying for you to have peace, strength, and successful treatment...Let me know if I can help in any way...Kim Also, a note about the chemo.  Its no fun. I watched my mom go thru it 15 years ago, and the symptom management was not nearly as good then. Also, Im a big wimp and I really expected the worst. But, surprise! They managed my side effects so much better than with my mother, I survived the hair loss, and it went by in a hurry.  In a few months you will be over it. I wish you the best. KC    ",
