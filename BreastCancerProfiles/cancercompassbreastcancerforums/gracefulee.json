    "Content": "I took Arimidex for 5 months before the side effects became almost dehibiltating where I considered retirement and moving to a dry warm climate.  My onocologist gave me 2 weeks off then I am to begin Aromasin.  After one week off the Arimidex I have so much more energy, no body aches, I can participate in activities after work...like grocery shopping.  All without pain!!!!!  My onocologist said that he would like me to continue on Aromasin for 6 months, however if the pain is as bad as it is with the Arimidex I don't know if I can continue. I am not looking forward to Wednesday when I have to begin the drug.  I also take Zometa by infusion every 6 months.  After the first infusion I felt like I did after my chemo infusions.  So with the next infusion due soon I am a little apprehensive.  Just like with chemo I knew it was something I had to do but I dreaded it each time to the point of getting sick with the side effects two days before the actual infusion day. Right now I am just going to follow Drs. orders and see what if any side effects occur.",
