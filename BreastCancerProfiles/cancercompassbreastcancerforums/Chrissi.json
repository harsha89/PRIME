      "Content": "I saw my family dr today who gave me a prescription for an analgesic and another for muscle relaxer. She couldn't offer much else. There's not much choice but to stay on one or the other. To complicate things I have 1/2 dozen degenerative discs in my back so the Arimidex and Femara have made that pain worse. I lasted 15 months on Arimidex and now 18 months on Femara. Both cause so much pain. Often it's tolerable, but if I do anything physical I'm a mess for days afterwards.",

      "Content": "I just found this sight and have been reading the messages. Did you ever change your meds due to the bone pain. Like you I had tremendous pain brought on by Arimidex. I was on it for 2 years until Dr. switched me to Femara. The pain disappeared immediately and I felt like a new person for a while. After about a year the pain is back with a vengence. I have 15 more months before I can go off of the medications. Just wondering if you found a med that didn't cause so much pain. Chris",

      "Content": "Following chemo and radiation, I took Arimidex for 2 years until I was afraid I would have to quit work due to the intense bone and joint pain. When I switched to Femara, I thought I'd found a wonder drug. The pain went away immediately. But after time on Femara, the pain came back with a vengence. I hurt all over all the time, but especially in my lower back and hips. I have to stay on one of these drugs for another 15 months. I hope I have working bones left by then. Chris",
