    "Content": "Hi, This happened to me about 6 months after I gave birth.  I was only 32 at the time.  The lump was removed and it turned out to be benign -- fibrocyctic tissue and some calcification from nursing. It happened to a friend of mine and it turned out to be a cyst. If you are really concerned, I would suggest you do what my friend and I both did -- get an appointment with a breast surgeon (not your family doctor or regular ob/gyn) and have it checked out. Good luck!",
