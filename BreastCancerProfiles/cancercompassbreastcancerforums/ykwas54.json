      "Content": "About two months ago I found a few lumps in my right breast, the one in which I had a lumpectomy in March of 2006. I also had the full spectrum of radiation treatments.  My doctor and I were thinking it was just twisted scar tissue, as I also had a seroma removed from the spot in August 2007 I had a biopsy Thrusday, and he removed scar tissue, some muscle, another seroma, and he said that there was also a nodule. Anyone have any experience with this, or is it cancer again?",

I am having all the side effects associated with Aromasin. I can't seem to find what the percentage plus is for taking it. Can anyone help me? I would love to know the answer to this as well. I had a lumpectomy in Oct. 2002, chemo & 33 radiation treatments. I have been on Aromasin for 4 years.  I have numerous side effects with the latest now including a severe degenerative disc.  However, I am a single mom and am afraid not to abide by my doctors wishes.  I did 2 years on Tamoxifen, I thought I was going to get off of my meds last year (at the 5 year of meds mark) but my doctor said they changed protocol and now want you on Aromasin itself for a total of 5 years...  I worry that next year they will say, let's just keep on going.... The sore/tired joints, muscles, aches, pains, weight gain, fatigue, etc....  and I am only 47 (I feel 77).. Good Luck!!My oncologist told me I would probably have to take it for the rest of my life!  Last week my regular MD told me I may have developed Rheumatoid Arthritis, so on my own, I have stopped taking the Aromasin. I don't know for sure if the Aromasin is what caused it, but no one in my family has ever had it.  I am so tired of being sore and tired!  ",
