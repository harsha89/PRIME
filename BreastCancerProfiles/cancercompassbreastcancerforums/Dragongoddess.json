My mom was only 12 when her death happened and she was the oldest child. My Grandfather is no longer with us. My mom said that we can't really worry unless we are told bad news. This will just make waiting for my appointment longer. She did mention that my grandfather had Malignant Melanoma. She brought that up after I showed her my light bruise and she noticed red blotches across my chest area. Well, I guess I just have to wait until Monday. Thanks to everyone for your feed back. Becca Best of luck to you on Monday. I am new to this list, found by surfing. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001, both types (lobular and ductal on the other side.) many many surgeries later, mastectomy, partial on other side I am doing well. If i can be a support or just a sounding board to anyone, feel free.   ",
