    "Content": "Hi Frobbi, Just had a question regarding the night sweats. You said you know of 2 products to help. Can you go into more detail? My mom has breast cancer and had a left masectomy in 2003, she was 82. She was clear for 2 1/2 yrs. even w/o taking any drugs, radiation, or chemo. The decision was against all becuz she is prone to strokes & TIA's. Now it is many places in the spine, sacro/joint, femar, and she is having chills and sweating like never before. We just got this bad news days ago and she has not started Aromacin yet but has had the sweats for 2 wks. Is there something to help? Also, are they common with cancer - the sweats? Many thanks! terri",
