      "Content": "Hi,  I did my research on the internet on Arimidex and found so much info on the side effects.  I have almost all of them but I've toughed it out.  I have a will of iron but I had an allergic reaction to the chemo so I'm really high risk, they are even worried about when I do get off it so I'm trying to get my body alkaline as much as I can.  I don't have much of an immune system, it was first damaged by Lipitor and the chemo wiped it pretty much away.  I get IGG infusions every 6 weeks now, they had to make them sooner, my levels dropped before the bottom so I'm feeling worse.  I have severe nerve damage all over from the allergic reaction, it was like I was being beaten by a baseball bat with nails in it.  I also can't take any pain meds, the Lipitor damaged my liver also and any new high tech pills elevates it.  I go to acupuncture and use some chinese herbs for some of the things but I also learned bio-feedback and most of the time can do a pretty good job of refocusing away from this body that is in probably a 20+ pain most of the time.  I've had about 14 surgeries to destroy some of these nerves, they grow back and some are coming back healthy but I have a long way to go. I think you need to do your research on Arimidex yourself o the internet, there is so much info and start at www.arimidex.com .  I found out most of the doctors have no idea what is in the medicines they prescribe and luckily I have a really good pharmist at SuperTarget that has my whole medical history record and if I question the drug I call him and he gets back to be and will tell me no way or try it and if you get this side effect stop immediately.  Its very important I don't damage my liver anymore either.  I was stage one 2 cm grade 3 but it was very contained but very fast growing and my lymthnodes were clear also but they sent a piece off for another test and it came back off the chart.  Cancer runs in the male side of my Dad's family, I'm the first female but I'm a non childbearing female that has two partial hysterectomies in my mid 20's and was on Estrace 3 mg for over 30 years which even made me a higher risk but the alternative was when the hot flashes started I'd black out.  My nights are the worse, I have the hot flashes really bad at night, the chinese herbs help some but they do wake me up and while retraining my biofeedback after all the shock of all this I found out that the monitor would pick up the night sweat before I really felt it and when I thought it was gone, my mind and body goes into major anxiety so most nights are very sleepless, Arimidex also causes insomonia, bone deterioration, cateracts, arthritis, and a bunch of other things.  My oncologist told me soon as I hit the 5 year mark I'm off it which will be 11/2/11.  They don't have a pill for after Arimidex and i'm 63 so am praying I will have passed the menopausal thru all this and it will go away.  The doctors can't even give me hits because of all the reactions. We are our best advocatite, research and ask your pharmist, they can look up things for you, the pill my be interacting with something else you are taking.   There is another pill that is available, he didn't tell me the name or I have forgotten it but he told me it would be best if I toughed it out for the 5 years, my best chance of survival.  Also I'm trying now to get my body alkaline, cancer can't live in an alkaline body.  My problem is it requires lots of fresh fruit and veggies, not meat, chicken or fish.  With my immune levels so low I'm breaking out from raw veggies and am now allergic to egg whites, cows milk, the oak got worse and so did the wheat.  It really makes it hard to eat.  I can't exercise due to the SI nerve and joint damage and and now they found a spur in a disk hitting a nerve that has shifted.  My first injections for that are in April.  I go through most of the minor surgeries in a slightly dazed dosage of Versed and even that effects my system.  They aren't allowed to use any steroids on me, they found out it was causing my cancer antigens to keep going up, the PET scan proved there was no new cancer and since they stopped the steroids the levels are going down.  I also drink about 4 tablespoons of Naturally Pomegranate, I order direct from the company in the 32 oz bottles and I drink liquid Chlorophyll.  I'm also working with a product specialist at Vitamin Shoppe and she has be on protiotics, some protein supplemtns and we are cleaning out the colon.  She told me the radiation made holes in the intestines and why I'm doing this for 3 months it should heal it and some of my allergy symptoms should start going away before I even get off the Arimidex. I ask lots of questions and I bring a little red book with them and I put the answers in there also, have been doing it all along, I think I intimidate my doctors but one some of these things I've become more knowledgable that they are.   I hope I have given you some help in where to start, also take your med list to the pharmist and ask them do check your stuff out.  Usually they can find out more or know more of what is in the medicine and they know what interacts.  My Pharmist will even contact the company.  He knows I've gone through hell and back but I'm a strong willed woman of 63 1/2 and I do plan to be around a lot longer, even if I have to fight the whole way.  I know we will all know more as the Arimidex leaves my system on what is permanent and what will go back to normal or almost normal.  Also if you don't like the info from any of your doctors and your treated like a number, find another one and change.  Also about two weeks after each appointment call and ask them to send you copies of the doctors dictation notes and test results.  Keep you films of any type yourself.   My primary told me when she left the clinic that they pick and choose what they will send to a new doctor and they only go back 2 years and you have a right to get all your records so best to do it after each visit or procedure.  My files are so full I am planning on getting a neat scan with an external tarabit hard drive so I can just start scanning most of this stuff in it and then it will back-up twice so I don't have to keep so much paperwork. I have tons of it. If you have any more questions don't hesitate to ask but you might even want to call the company that makes Arimidex and tell them, they usually have a patients advocate for help, especially with any cancer medicines. God Bless noknots",

      "Content": "I just passed my 5 years on it on 2/20/10 and I had about all the side effects, it gives you hot flashes and night sweats, raises cholesterol and tryglicerides, gives you neuropathy, I had cataracts removed but I think that was from the chemo directly.  I am tired for lack of sleep and the pain.  I had allergic reaction to the dosataxel and it was like being beaten by a baseball bat with nails in it.  I seem to live in out patient surgery trying to reduce the pain levels 20+ on there scale of 10.  I had acupuncture thru my chemo and have since.  It helps will side effects, I also take some of the chinese herbs.  My acpuncturist is qualified chinese herbologist and can do injections and uses a cool laser also.  The pain gets overwhelming but most of the time I can refocus away from it.  I learned biofeedback a long time ago.  Also when you get angry, type a letter in a blank page and figure out why your angry and then trash it when you are done.  Really helps take some of it away, I have to do it often, they messed me up for life and I was only stage 1 but you are in shock so you follow their protocal and with a damaged liver and immune system I should have only had the radiation.  I've read enough to know that. If you have any questions you can email me, I just signed into this site so I don't know if they put emails but I will check box if someone replies.  Good Luck its a 5 year after chemo and radiation are done deal and I don't finish the little buggers until 11/2/11. noknots",
