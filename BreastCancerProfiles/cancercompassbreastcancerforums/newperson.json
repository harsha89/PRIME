      "Content": "Hi everyone, Can anyone give me any suggestion on whether taking Tamoxifen or any other drugs after mastectomy? I had mastectomy surgery four months ago since I had ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS, stage o breast cancer). After the surgery, I went to see an oncologist. The oncologist suggested me to take tamoxifen for five years. And I was told about the side effects of may getting uterine cancer. I'm still hesitating to take tamoxifen. But I'm scared of the recurrence of the bc. Does anyone have the same situation as mine? What should I do? Any input would be greately appreciated.",
