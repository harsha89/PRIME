    "Content": "I know what you mean. After chemotherapy I cannot stand myself, the smell oozing from my skin is horrible - a toxic chemical smell. Nobody else has complained about it, apparently I'm the only one who smells it. but I do. It's awful. My local herbalist recommended chlorophyll pills. I take 5 or 6, at a time, they do help. Eating parsley helps too. Using scents to try and cover it up does not work for me and actually makes it worse.  Kind of like scented kitty litter......... the smell is still there, underlying the fragrance and the two together are intolerable.   I really do think that even though we humans have a weak sense of smell what we do detect consciously or unconsciously has an effect, positive or negative.  Cancer can stink. and of course, they have been able to train dogs to detect cancer by smell and there are stories of some dogs who have been the first detectors of their owner's cancer. Try the chlorophyll tablets. My understanding is that they are harmless and quite a lot of the pills can be eaten without problems. The only other thing I can suggest is, make certain that the smell isn't actually due to something else.  A forgotten wet sock stuck under the couch cusions can ruin the whole couch (been there-done that). I shampooed a rug once, it didn't dry properly and it got so musty- nothing could fix it and the carpet had to be tossed. Good luck, smells really do have an huge emotional effect on us. ",
