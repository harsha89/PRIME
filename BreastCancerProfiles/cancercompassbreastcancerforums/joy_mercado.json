I met Tara in our squatter place Don Sebio. I was interested in meeting her because our neighbor told us that she had products that would change my life. It was late in the afternoon of Dec. 8, 2012 when she came into our house, I listened and watch as she had her product demo. At first, i was kinda confused because i thought she will introduced me medicines for my breast cancer. By the way I had breast cancer with 5 small growing lumps on the mid part of my breast and one big lump on the lower right side of my breast. It wasnt a med that she introduces me but supplements. I was curious at the same time in doubt. I asked myself, Is it really possible? She told me to watch some videos on youtube about there testimonies and met the people who uses it. So I did what she did before trying tthere products. I watch some of there videos and met some of the people who were being healed by there products. Due to my curiousity i asked some copies of there diagnosis and went to the doctor to confined if its really true. I have found out that its not only Cancer that were being treated by this but also people who were almost being operated by kidney stone removal,bypass,etc.. tha operation were CANCELED! So after my thorough investigation I took the challenge. Its my 25 days of challenge right now and my 5 small lumps were gone and the big lump was shrinking. To God be the Glory! What is the name of your product that you've been using?",
