      "Content": "I have recurrent breast cancer and have been in chemo since last August. My cancer is also hormone receptor negative, which I take to mean I just get standard treatments, no tamoxifen for 5 years stuff. The chemo doesn't seem to be working too well, so we may add some radiation treatments, even though I had radiation with my first go around. Other than this, I don't know of anything else that would be a treatment option. What treatment are you receiving? Jeannine",
