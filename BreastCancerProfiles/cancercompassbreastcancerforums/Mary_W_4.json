    "Content": "I was diagnosed with urethral cancer in 1998. After surgery in January 2000 I went into remission until a spot showed up in October 2002. I recently began taking MGN-3, Cell Forte with IP-6, vitamin A, Coral Calcium Plus, Selenium, vitamin E, Milk Thistle Extract, and a blend of Sheep Sorrel, Burdock Rood, Slippery Elm Bark and Turkey Rhubarb Root extract (Essiac). I have not seen the doctor yet since I started taking these supplements. Do you see any benefits or any problems w/taking all of these at the same time?",
