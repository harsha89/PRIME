    "Content": "My situation is very similar to yours. I recently found a lump on my left breast. I was sent for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. They found a total of two lumps on my left breast and the radiologist report states I will need a aspiration and put the BI-RAD at a 4. My doctor called me and is sending me to a surgeon. So, now it is the waiting game for the surgeon to call. The radiologist made it sound like everything was fine and now I have this report that I don't truly understand and lots of things going through my mind.",
