    "Content": "I was diagnosed with two forms of cancer, uteran and fallopian in Sept 08, and I had just lost my brother-in-law to suicide a few months earlier. I have so many people in my life who had cancer and died from the treatments much earlier than the first estimate of life expectancy. My father -in-law hemmoraged from vomiting 6 weeks into treatment, my friend lost her vision and wouldnt heal ... leaving her wheel chair bound at age 50 in an old folks home until she died last week (14 years of hellish treatments). My mother in law took radiation and she is now 5 years cancer free.  Farrah might have been saved through alternative treatments if she hadn't had chemo that destroyed her ability to heal. I don't know what works. I only knew that for me, destroyng healthy cells sounded like a really poor plan for treatment. I want quality of life too. Maybe the loss of my brother in law just reinforced a sense of inevitable loss...but the need to be fully present in the now. I refused treatments. I may be crazy, it may kill me! I am trying alternative healthy lifestyle treatments. I felt it should be the first avenue of attack. I have had two cancer free results, and this week go for my next test. I always worry, and I can't even talk to family about my fears since they were livid about my choices. I told them that refusing treatment is an act of bravery too, but they think it's suicide too, my husband burned candles for 3 months straight and has an undercurrent of anger most of the time. 30 years of marriage and he thinks the choice should be his.lol I know if this goes bad only death will let me hear the end to it.... What ever we do, right or wrong, we have to advocate for ourselves and not be bullied into something. Do your research. Support each other!  ",
