    "Content": "Hi all! I was just diagnosed on 6/8/2012 of ACC of the breast and am trying to see how everyone is doing and any new information that might be out there.  My biopsy was shown as a benign tumor and I elected to have it removed.  Good thing I did.  Final pathology report came back as ACC.  I did not have clear margins and am going back in on 6/20/12 for another surgery and a node check.  Pretty scarey stuff to think I could have said...oh never mind, if it's benign leave it there.  How many women have had this happen?  How many women are walking around with ACC and do not know it?  My tumor was only 1.5 cm and the margin taken out was 4 mm all the way around.  Can anyone tell me how long it might take to develop a tumor that size and have it be invasive?  I've never had a mammo until now (I'm 46) and don't do self exams (that's going to change).  I'm curious as to how long I may have had this inside me. Thanks and bless all of you!  Best wishes in your journey. Mary",
