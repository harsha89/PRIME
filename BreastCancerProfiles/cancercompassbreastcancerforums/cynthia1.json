    "Content": "It would be stupid of me to say not to worry.  But, just try to be there for her and talk to her and help her and let her know that you love her.  My dad was diagnosed with rectal cancer Feb. 06'.  He did resection surgery and chemo and radiation.  It will be a year next month that he finished his treatments.  The ct scan picked up 3 spots on lungs in july.  They rescanned in October, the 3 spots were still there, 2 grew very little and 1 the same.  He goes back in January.  I pray that they will not be bigger but am afraid that it is in his lungs now.  We are all scared.  Hope things go well and hope you all have a good Thanksgiving.
