      "Content": "My younger sister just started chemo this week for stage 3 inflammatory cancer in one breast and stage one in the other. Her lymph node on one side was hard and sore but but on Friday they said it had not spread to the rest of the body.  Good news. Monday I was with her to get her port inserted, education at the oncologists office, and they did another scan on upper body late Monday afternoon. Tuesday was her first chemo treatment; I wasn't with her but she did fine. Now today they tell her they see something and want to do a CT Bone Biopsy.  It was scheduled for Dec 22;  her Dr called and said they are going to try and get her sooner. She tells us it's scary.  When I picked her up Monday we hugged she she I'M SCARED.  I tell her \"I know\". Hell we are ALL scared.  We aren't dwelling on it though. I posted Nelson Mandela quote about courage on her face book.  I texted her back \"of course its scary! you are in a war for your life.  We will win this war. Do not let fear triumph.\" I was wondering what is the best was to keep her  positive through all this? What is the best thing to NOT say? ",
