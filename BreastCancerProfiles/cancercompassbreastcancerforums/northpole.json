      "Content": "I took Femara, Aremidex,and aromasin for a year and a half. I had to stop because my muscles in my legs hurt so bad. I could hardly walk, standup of sit down. It's been 3 years since I stopped and I still hurt. Some things have helped recently. Soaking my legs in the bath tub with Epsom Salt. Also taking Arthrotec 75. I recently got a cortizone shot in my outer thigh for bersitis. Actually this helped a lot. My Internal medicine doctor feels a Steroid Pack probably would have helped and I may need to do that once a year to help my muscles recover. A blood test several years back showed high levels of inflammation and then I was checked for RA. However RA was not supported by other tests. I feel that the Estrogen blockers caused high inflammation in my leg muscles. Seems that the Arthrotec, Cortizone shot and Epsom Salt Baths have all helped in some way. I'm not back to normal but I'm better than 6 months ago.",

      "Content": "Maybe a 6day steroid pack would help. I'm guessing you might have high inflammation. Steroids reduce inflammation. The other med you might try is Arthrotec 75. That also reduces inflammation.",

      "Content": "I have oxycodone also but can't take it if I need to drive. I try very hard to only take it once in awhile. Mayo clinic suggested Lyrica for pain and it helped a lot however it caused diarrhea issues every other day so had to stop. It really sucks. Before cancer I was an active walker and etc. hard to exercise now because I pay for it with pain",
