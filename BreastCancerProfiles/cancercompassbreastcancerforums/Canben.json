    "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer almost 2 years ago at the age of 46.  My father's sister was just diagnosed about 3 months ago (I think she's 53).  And my great-grandmother (my father's mother's mother) had it at least twice before she passed away. My mother's oncologist said I need to start having mamograms every year (I just turned 30 this past November).  I spoke with my dr.  He approved for me to have one last year, but now this year he's saying I probably don't need one EVERY year, just every 2-3 years.  He said if I decide to, he'll approve it, but said that my insurance may put up a fuss since I'm so young.  He also said there's really no reason for me to unnecessarily expose myself to that much radiation.  He did suggest getting the genetic testing done, but I'm worried about being declined life/health insurance based on the outcome. Any advice you have would be GREATLY appreciated.  I don't know what to do!",
