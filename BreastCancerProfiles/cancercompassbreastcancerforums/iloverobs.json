      "Content": "My sister is just about to start treatment for medullary breast cancer. She needs IVF then Chemo, radiation and mastectomy at this point. I have made her a book for her her doctors notes and a folder for path reports etc. But I am wondering if anyone can recommend other ways to help her through the next few months. Can you give me examples of great things people did to support you. What did they do or say? Also what did not help or bothered you? Thanks. Sending you all my positive energy.",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone has any information with regards to the gene BRCA1 187 del AG. My sister has this and my Mum has asked me to research it and explain it to her. Unfortunately, when I look it up I keep finding very technical, medical information and I am struggling to understand it in non medical terms. Just checking if you had come across it on your journey. Many thanks",
