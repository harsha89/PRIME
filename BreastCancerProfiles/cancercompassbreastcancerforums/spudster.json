      "Content": "Hi, Bahamasgirl-- I'm in a very similar situation: I got my core biopsy Addendum results on Friday afternoon and spend the weekend researching them. I have IDC, Grade 3, 1.6 cm. My MRI is scheduled for tomorrow. What I'm wondering is when did you find out about whether the tumor is estrogen- and progesterone- positive? My report says the tumor is \"positive for E-Cadherin and consistent with IDC, NOS, poorly differentiated (Nottingham grade 3/3 and score 8/9: tubular 3; nuclear 3 and mitotic 2). P63 highlight a few DCIS ducts with high nuclear grade and solid type.\" I'm impressed with how quickly you seem to have gotten a handle on your treatment plan. It's inspiring to me!",
