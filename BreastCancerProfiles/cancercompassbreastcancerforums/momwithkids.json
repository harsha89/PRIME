    "Content": "My wife (45 years old) has been on Xeloda for a year and half at this time.  She is generally just suffering from fatigue and pain in some areas (this is explained as there may be some nerve damage associated with treatment).  Prior to Xeloda she was on a number of more aggressive chemotherapy agents.  Her Xeloda is prescribed at this time for prevention (to keep if from coming back).  She is currently on 2,000mg per day (two weeks on and one week off).  My question to you is how much are you using per day?  I am glad to hear someone else has been on it for this period of time since examples of long term use are not easy to find.  My hope that you continue to tolerate it well.  Stay well hydrated during treatment.  Please let me know your dosage.  My wifes is being used defensively since she is in remission from Stage IV stomach cancer.
