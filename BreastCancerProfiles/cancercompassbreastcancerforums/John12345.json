      "Content": "Thanks for that information. My mother is on day 3 of 10 of the irradiation. After this she is being moved to a hospice. I feel so sorry for her as she understands everything that is happening. I feel it would be better of she didn't. Her speech is worsening too. It's going to be more difficult for my sister and her children as they have always lived with my mother.",

      "Content": "Hello, 18 months ago my mother received the news that she had breast cancer. The reason they found this was that she was suffering for months with bad back pain. When she went to the hospital they found that the cancer had spread from her breast to her bones and had eaten away at a bone in her back. They did not operate. She received 6 different types of chemo and got radiation on her back. The docs also gave her something to fill in the holes in her bones. She has been getting weaker every month and has had numerous bad falls. She was still driving on and off till about a month ago. She has severe numbness in her hands and feet which the docs say was due to the chemo. Her appetite has been very bad and she has lost a lot of weight. She was having trouble swallowing over the past month too. 10 days ago she started vomiting so was admitted to hospital. They did scans and noticed a dark mass at the back of her head. They did a lumbar puncture and the results came back that she has CM. We met yesterday with the oncology team and they want her to go into a hospice. At the minute she cannot walk and her speech is very slurred. Vision is good but gets confused about which day it is. She is very down and gets aggressive at times. She gave up on herself ages ago. The docs have decided starting today to give her radiation in this mass for 10 days. But have decided that no more chemo. The question i have is, how long has she got left ?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. Sorry to hear that your wife passed away. Its a horrible disease. I feel helpless. There's only myself and my sister and i live about 2 hours away. At the minute I'm seeing her about 3/4 times a week. I have tried to get her to eat healthily, but the doctors told her to eat anything that contains sugar so she can start to put on some weight. I totally disagree with this as sugar fuels cancer from what I have read. She doesn't want to go to the hospice but the doctors said there is no way she would get the help she needs at home. She can't walk alone or unaided. Its hard to know what to think at this stage. She's 63 and was never sick before any of this.",
