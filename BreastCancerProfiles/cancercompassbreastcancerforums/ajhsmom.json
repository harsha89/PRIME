    "Content": "I was diagnosed January 9th with IDC breast cancer, Stage 1, grade 1, in my right breast. I had a lumpectomy and excision in the past month. Oncotype testing came back with a low score of 4. Next course is radiation and I've been presented with the choice of brachytherapy or 4 weeks of EBRT. I am small breasted so the surgeon and radiation oncologist were determining if small device would fit in tumor cavity which is small. Radiation oncologist said recurrence rates similar for someone with my type of cancer and age, 53. Has anyone out there had experience with either? The brachytherapy does appear to be more invasive- risk of infection but not sure other than convenience ( 1 week vs 4) effects.",
