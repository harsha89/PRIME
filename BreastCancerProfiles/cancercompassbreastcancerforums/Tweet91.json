My 75 y/o mother was just diagnosed with IDC just yesterday and we're all just dealing with so many emotions! But fear is number 1. We're scared that my woderful, loving mother won't make it through the surgery. We're praying to God to give her the strength to fight this horrible disease. If there's anyone out there that had /has this and would like to offer some advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you and may God Bless you and your families, Maria Have faith you and your Mom will get through this I am 56 but was diagnosed in 2005 and completed AC;Taxol/Taxotere & Herceptin in 2006 and will be 3 yr survivor 11/22/2005.  It is alot to take in but after you recover from the shock and know what stage;grade;type the tumor is and treatments she will need I think you will be able to absorb all the information you receive.  I have IDC stage IIB grade 3 ER/PR neg HER2+++ and have been in remission since chemo/herceptin completed Dec 4, 2006 except for some long term side effects live a fairly normal life.  I also have a friend diagnosed at age 75 with same type except ER/PR positive and HER2 neg she had lumpectomy and rads and is doing fine also volunteers for ACS and her church.  Even took a trip to see the Pope when he was in NYC.  So have faith and your Mom should do fine. God Bless Cindy   ",

( I personally don't think it's been so easy ).  My doctor has said that some people who went smoothly through the AC's have a tough time with Taxol.   I have since been reading about Taxol and the pain, pre-treatment drugs and other rumors have scared me a bit.  Has anyone else out there had any experiences with taking the same drugs as me that can offer some advice for getting through the Taxol treatments. Thanks.   Andi Andi I had the same treatments you are currently going through in 2006 other than severe fatique and neuropathy made through AC OK except for emergency gall bladder removal started 12 wkly infusions of taxol and herceptin but only able to complete 4 due to extreme diarhea and nausea  so switched to taxotere and finished as decided had alergic reaction to taxol.  I later learned alot of the problem could be what they use to mix it up with can't remember what it was called but most people do better if saline is used instead of normal drug so you migth discuss with your dr.  I wish you much luck and may you get through this with good results and become cancer free.",

They tell me they found somthing that didn't look right so they need to do a biopsy.  They did this while I was awake which was very scary.  I had to wait a week, well I called the doctor to find out if the results was in and the nurse said \"no one has called you to make an app. to come in, can you come in today at 3:30.\" I didn't have time to call my daughter, she lived 2hrs away and I couldn't get ahold of my boyfriend so I had to go by myself.  I was along when the doctor told me I had breast cancer.  I'm scared, I know theres a lot of women who have and are going through the same thing I am.  Just need to talk to someone and hear there story and experiences.  I think there should be faster ways to get things done so you don't have to wait so long to find out your results. 10-23-07 has changed my life.   kd, I had a situation like yours Sept 2005 I went for annual mamogram about 6 months late since I had never had a problem I didn't worry when I didn't hear anything assuming everything was norma as usual.  A month later they called me for a sonigram seemed they needed to verify a change from previous mamo 18 months earlier at a different lab.  I had changed doctors and it took them a month to get previous xray to compare. The day they did sonigram they made appt for biopsy the next day on what was caused possible cyst.  I did not get the results until a week later they called me on the phone at work (my oldest sons 34th birthday)advised it was cancer - who was my breast surgeon.  Needless to say I fell apart and cried for 2 days but started on anxiety meds which help tremondously and after talking to surgeon and my family knew I was going to fight and be a survivor.  The result was stage IIb, grade 3 HR/PR neg but HER2+++ with 1 positive sentinel node but clear margins. They gave me a unfavorable prognosis but I went through 6 months of Chemo, 33 days of radiation and 8 months of Herceptin completed 12/4/06. Today was my annual mamo which is clear with no sign of cancer. Although I suffer form side effects from Chemo and am no longer able to work. I am glad I did the lumpectomy plus all the other meds.  Just be strong, have a positive attitude and strong faith and you will get through this stronger than ever.  Good Luck and God Bless.     ",
