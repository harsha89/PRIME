    "Content": "I recently had a lumpectomy to remove two very small tumors, but different types of cancer. A very small questionable margin remains just under the skin, apparently somewhere between the nipple and armpit, but can not be pinpointed. Also, out of 13 lymph nodes removed, three were malignant. I have not had the mastectomy yet.They did a oncotest which showed the cancer to be slow, non-aggressive, and a 92% cure rate with hormore therapy. The three mentioned are arimidex, aromasin, or femara.   I am a 69 yr old widow and have struggled with Fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease in my back for years. I have strong inclination towards alternative cure options rather than surgery and hormone therapy. I already deal with extreme joint, bone, soft and connective pain and extreme fatigue...my life has been like pushing a freight train uphill for years. I am very concerned that the \"cure\" would be as dibilitating as the \"cancer\".  Would appreciate any comments regarding methods of allopathic vs alternative means to fight this tiger.  Also any comments regarding reconstuction success or problems as I'm not yet prepared to go from a H cup to zero. Quality of life is very important to me as I want to enjoy whatever time I have left....and can anyone tell me statistically what that looks like between the two options.  Thanks for any comments as I am really in quite a dilemma about this.",
