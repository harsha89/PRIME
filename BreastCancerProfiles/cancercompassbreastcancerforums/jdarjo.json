    "Content": "Dear Barb, I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and completed chemo in October followed by six weeks of radiation therapy. Barb, you need to be in as healthy a state as possibe before beginning chemorx.  Of course I am not a doctor but a plain everyday cough or cold would not last from November to Janurary. I definitely understand the financial worry in regards to bill payment ( have been there). But If there is anyway that you can see your regular MD it would be a benefit to your health.  I pray that you will have a complete healing. Your post makes complete sense. We all need answers, advice and support as we go through this medical journey. God bless, Jean  ",
