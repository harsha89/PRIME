I thought today that I was going to new doc to start another round of chemo, due to a petct scan that said that I had a new 2.4 cent. nodule in my left lung and that it was to be considered malignant until proven otherwise..this is a direct quote.  It also mentioned persistant and residual activity in the other areas that had been previously treated with chemo last fall.  The new doctor that I am seeing now, ordered a new ct scan to be sure about the other scan report, and it came back clear of any metastatic activity in my lungs.  I am very pleased about this new finding but am very confused about it as well.  I know there can be false positives and false negatives to any of these diagnostic tests but they seem to be very differant in their reporting of these findings.  The two scans were done in differant hospitals and differant radiologists reading them.  I am elated at the new news of no need for chemo at this point when I thought today I would be starting more of the stuff.. but like I said, I am so confused and not sure how to feel about which one of these reports were wrong?  I looked at the cd rom of the petct, the new nodule was very apparent and very easy to see.. it looked like a quarter laying in there.  I have not been sick bronchial for there to have been any infection going on in there, and could it have been disolved within just a month by my system?  Should I get yet another radiologist to look at both scans and make another determination?  Sorry, I am just needing to know if others have experienced this miracle or confusion?  At this point I am seeing it as both!  I want to believe that this new report is correct, but if so, then why did the petct which is suppose to be pretty acurate show up this new nodule, and now its not there?  I am thinking out loud here.  None the less, I am glad that I am not having to go forward with more treatments.  I dont want to use this chemo medicine unecessarily causing the cancer to become resistant to the only drugs that may keep it under control.  I was taking herceptin treatments, and the new dr. now feels this is not necessary to continue either since I have already been on it 6 months.  I am her2 pos. Had recurrence in lungs which was biopsied in Aug. of 07 and proven to be breast cancer spread to lungs.  The new dr feels that yes there may very well be new cancer growing in lungs but until it reaches a higher SUV value more than 4 then it isnt considered to be abnormal enough to warrant more chemo at this point.  The object I thought was to keep it from growing in there at all or being able to spread elsewhere in my body..any loose cells can do that, I guess its just a ticking time bomb that waits for its moment to go off and start growing again.  Anyway, thank you for anyone who has some medical knowledge of any of this to send me some answers if you can.  I dont want to seek yet another dr..I am satisfied with the new one, but I just want to feel confident that these scans are being read and reported accurately. Thankyou so much. Jodie So what do others think?  I recently went through something very similar.  One CT showed two small nodules, another didn't.  The CT's were done TWO DAYS apart at different hospitals with different machines.  One was a regular CT the other was a sprial CT.  The PRELIMINARY report from radiology said clean; the FINAL report mentioned the nodes.  The pulmonologist never viewed the scans, only the prelim.  I demanded he view the scans; both he and my oncologist later concurred their were two nodes to be concerned about but they were too small to be definitive on a PET.  I had a PET two years ago but it was done on a machine that is no longer in use so now I have had a \"baseline\" PET on the new equipment.  The two PETS were not compatable as far as getting a comparative read. Meanwhile, we will be running another CT in a few weeks though I would prefer a PET but Medicare and BC/BS will not pay for the PET unless something shows up on the CT.  My Oncologist, by the way, presented my scans to THREE radiologist!  Nadine (a five year nsclc survivor)  ",

However, do not be worried that you have done something wrong, just do something better going forward and make your own. Stevia is a great sweetener available at Whole Foods and at health food stores. Evryone with cancer will have quality of life issues. Someone's anecdotal writings of what they read and what they did should no more rule your life than the statistics of survival for your cancer-from do. You are you.  That being said, avoiding REFINED sugars is advisable for the cancer-feeding reasons you have read about.  But, you are not going to avoid sugars in a modern diet, even a modified modern diet. Avoid high fructose corn syrup -- it's in lots of foods, inc. granola etc. marketed by General Mills, etc. Read labels. Many markets now make baked goods with honey. I eat frozen custard which has cane sugar, but it also has eggs and calories that are good my my weight maintenance (which is MORE important) as well as a treat! ( I am a stage IV pan. can. liver mets 6 month survivor this week still working and at 98% target weight, NO chemo side effects!). I highly recommend this book:vhttp://www.amazon.com/Cancer-Essential-Things-Revised-Update It speaks to what you ask plus much more.  If you have access to a oncology nutritionist via your clinic, seek them out. Most all have them. Mine was invaluable. A piece of chocolate and some sugar in your cappucino on the weekend and a vanilla milkshake are not going to kill you.  If they did, then you would not bereading what I just wrote. Best of luck to you.     Sounds like you have retained a great sense of humor--something that will serve you well in your travels through Cancerland.  Continue to laugh, smile, chuckle, chortle, snort, whatever.  It helps!   Nadine",

      "Content": "  There is a REALLY STUPID AND FALSE  e-mail that has resurfaced recently claiming researchers at Johns Hopkins have uncovered special eating techniques and foods you must completely avoid (i.e. sugar as it feeds cancer cells (NOT TRUE)), etc.  Check out snopes.com and search for Johns Hopkins.  It will clarify what I am trying to say, that is, the info sent by e-mail is completely false.  As a survivor who is currently riding a high because I am still in remission felt like I got kicked in the gut when a well-meaning friend sent the e-mail to me!   Take heart and eat what seems right to you and strive to make your plate colorful!
