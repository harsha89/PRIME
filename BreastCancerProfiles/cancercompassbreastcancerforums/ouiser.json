    "Content": "  On 6/20/2009 kaybell wrote: I had a double mastectomy last July for breast cancer. I had reconstruction with an expander and saline inplant put in this March. I still have a fair amount of pain especially after doing any activity that uses my upper body. I have always been a gardener but many of the activities like pulling weeds, hoeing, using the rototiller, etc. leave me in pain. Will I ever get to where I can do these things again? I am feeling pretty depressed about this. I am thinking that I made a mistake by getting reconstruction. Has anyone else had this problem? Do I just need to give it more time? Deborah Well I am thinking about reconstruction after 9 years of having a lumpectomy.  During my chemo & radition Ii had implants that were about 20 The radation hardened my implants so 2 yrs later i had them removed. now one breast is very small ( the one w/cancer) and the other one is almost to my waist.  I am tired of wearing the \"fake\" breast and my bra weights a ton!  Do you think after all of these years its a mistake to have my implants replaced? also do you have trouble with your mammagram hurting?   charlotte",
