    "Content": "I am new to this site...I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer in 2010, had a double masectomy, and a complete histerectomy. I have been cancer free for 2 years. I was on Tamoxifen for the two years, and tolerated it ok. More recently I was put on Arimidex, but after reading these blogs, I am concerned, should I stay on this or go back to Tamoxifen?",
