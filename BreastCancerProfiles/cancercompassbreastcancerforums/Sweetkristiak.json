      "Content": "well it is cancer i'm getting a mastectomy feb 3rd and also sentinal node mapping cuz they don't know for sure if it has gone anywhere else yet so i don't know if i'll need chemo or not. I got to really look at mt mammograms and asked a whole lot of questions. the calcifications looked like hundreds of litle white dots some were clusterd together but not big enough to form a lump and biopsy came back pos. dealing with it ok, have wonderfull support from family and friends, but i do feel like i was robbed cuz i did get lumpectomy and radiation but it still came back",

      "Content": "hi danka, well they saw breast calcification in december and it looked suspicius so the did biopsy and it came back pos for cancerso we decided to go ahead and take that breast off cuz i had lumpectomy and radiation 3 yrs ago..so feb 3rd i had the surgery and they did pathology on it and found the lump they say tubular lump i do self braest exams and did not feel it and it did not show up on any mammogram dr. said it probably has been there for at least 6 years so that means radiation did not kill it my nodes get taken out march 9th and i'm only 33 yrs old with 4 kids and i'm getting pissed off about it cuz every time i go in it's always bad news they also found high estrogen levels in it doc says thats not good cuz it multiplies fasterbut i think the prosess is going to slow i just want to start treatment cuz i'm scared the longer i wait what else could happen and is it anywhere else in my body",

      "Content": "helo again,..i think it's wise to get both breasts taken off , i'm almost considering it cuz that one lump they could not see for over 6yrs who to say my good breast does or does not have a lump and you bet your a** i'm getting a reconstruction done right after chemo to me one of the things that seperate us from men is having breasts and you and i both have years and years to go and i will have breasts again and if they are nicer and firmer than now good for us all the crap we go through just to stay alive and healthy we deserve something to make us feel good about ourselves and i look forward to the day when i can fill in my bra again..i'm just waiting for my node surgery and waiting sucks cuz then you wait for the path report and then appointments and then treatment but my husband promised me a vacation in mexico when all is said and done so there is light at the end ... thanks for the support and good luck",
