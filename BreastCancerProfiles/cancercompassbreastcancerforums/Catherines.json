    "Content": "Last Thursday (April 14th 2006) I felt a small lump in my breast, my husband confirmed that this was \"new\". The next day, Friday, I called my Dr. and she ordered a mammogram and ultrasound the same afternoon. These tests confirmed what I felt, a 2 cm lesion at 2 o'clock in my inner upper right breast. It looked irregular and black on the ultrasound. It definitely looked like it didn't belong there! The radiologist scheduled me for a core biopsy (this Thursday April 20th). Since last Friday I cannot sleep normally, I go from tears and emotion, thinking of all my fears, to denial, to sanely doing research. I can not concentrate on any of my work and I only get through the day doing mundane household tasks. My husband is extremely supportive and loving. I find myself being a chaotic bundle of nerves, alternately being needy and being stoic. To compound matters I am an RN , so my imagination has more vast incite in to all the worst possibilities. What can I do to decrease the anxiety?",
