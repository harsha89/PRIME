      "Content": "Hi all! I'm part of Margo Rey's street team, trying to raise awareness for Brides Against Breast Cancer, a great organization that is helping people all across the nation who have had their lives impacted with cancer by raising money for education, information, and outreach services to cancer patients and their families. Through Brides Agsinst Breast Cancer, people have the chance to donate wedding dresses, as well as purchase them at great prices.  Margo, a two-time breast cancer survivor and bride-to-be, will be attending select bridal shows across the country and providing the campaign's theme song with her single \"Let It Rain.\" Margo believes no one should go through cancer alone, and wants to be there to support those who need it most.
