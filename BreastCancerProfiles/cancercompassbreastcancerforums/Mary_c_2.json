    "Content": "Julie, My name is Mary from TN. Three years ago Oct I was diagnosed with breast cancer that had gone to the liver. With the help of chemo and herceptin, the liver cleared and the tumor in breast shrunk considerably. My doctor told me that he could not cure me, but could keep all under control--which he has done. Three years later, I am still around here liver still clear and tumor very small. I have had some spots that \"woke up\" but they are back asleep now with the help of navelbean and herceptin. Hang in there--there are a ton of good meds out there--Keep in touch with me as I will keep you in my prayers.",
