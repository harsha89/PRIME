      "Content": "I'm really worried that the physicians working with me on this aren't as concerned as my GYNO or myself. I am very nervous and feel like there is something more than nothing going on, I haven't felt like myself in months. But every time I meet a new physicain or radiologist it's the same story... All I keep hearing from everyone is \"Well you had a child very young so it's hard to say if anything is more than just a clogged milk duct. and just because it's in your family doesn't mean you have to worry. You're too young for something like this.\"   Do all doctors that deal in this type of thing always brush everything off like this? I'm sorry I understand quite a few people have been where I am I'm just worried that it could be overlooked now and later be a much scarier situation.",

      "Content": "Hi, So I'm 22, have a family history of both breast cancer and non cancerous breast lumps. I have for the last like 2-3 months had a dark discharge from my nipples and my breast have been much more tendor than normal. I went to see my GYNO and she was very concerned given my family history and person history. She did a breast exam and found a lump that neither of us had felt before. She had ordered an ultrasound but it found nothing \"alarming\" according to the radiologist. I have still been having lots of breast tendorness and discharge and my doctor has me going to see a breast surgeon to follow up and have more imaging and or testing done. My concern is no one seems concerned other than myself and my primary doctor. Given my family history I'm scared it just may not be anything detectable. Is it possible to have breast cancer and not have it be detected? How do I go about getting something done if no one believes that it could be something serious?",

      "Content": "So I went in yesterday to meet with a breast surgeon after having a breast ultrasound show nothing. After reviewing my paperwork and a simple exam he discovered a lump easily 2 cm in diameter. I was having discharge from my nipple so they also took a sample to test for blood to determine was to do next. The sample came back positive for blood. My doctor ordered more imaging, a ductectomy I think it was? I have no clue what that is and can't get a good answer online. He mentioned that surgery is probably going to be needed to remove the lump to stop any discharge and make sure it's nothing more serious. I am horrified. I don't know what to think. Can anyone help me with this? Some insight would be great.",
