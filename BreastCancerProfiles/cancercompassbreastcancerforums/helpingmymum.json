    "Content": "Hi, My Mum has stage 2 cancer and has had a lumpectomy. They also removed 17 lymph nodes of which 15 had some cancer present and has started her course of Chemo yesterday. She is being given Flourouracil, Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide through a drip every 3 weeks and should have 6 doses in total. she is also being given Taxotere to help reduce side effects. As far as she has told me everything went really well yesterday and she felt comfortable adn was not as scared as what she expected to be, the doctor sat with her through her whole treatment and talked her through everything but obviously they can only give you some advise as everybody reacts differently!  My Mum had her dose at around 1pm and I made her a cup of tea around half 6 and at about 8 she was sick, she felt a lot better afterwards but felt quite tired and she looked rather pale! She went to bed at about 10 and the sickness started again at around midnight and then throughout the night, not a lot but enough! She tried eating some scrambled egg for breakfast and managed to keep this down for around an hour but then this was all brought up again but again felt better afterwards and then was sick again after a glass of lemonade at around 12pm! We know that she is going to feel sick and the doctor said that this would generally kick in around 4 days after the treatment and we know that this is something that she has just got to live with but as this is our first time that we have ever had to deal with Chemo we are unaware as to if it is normal for the sickness to start more or less straight away and just wondered if anybody else has had the same treatment and if they had the same side effects?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Sam x  ",
