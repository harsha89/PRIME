    "Content": "My mom had breast cancer 15 years ago. She had the breast removed and went through chemo and radiation. When everything was finished, she was told her treatment was successful and she was cancer free. About 6 months ago, she started coughing, which led to vocal cord paralysis and the loss of her voice. She had many tests done, but there was no cause found. Then, about 2-3 months ago, she started having difficulty sleeping at night. She would be up all night coughing and was having rib pain. More tests were done and she was told she had some fluid around her lungs and heart, but it was nothing to be concerned about. About 3 weeks ago, she insisted that something be done about the fluid around her lungs. The doctors removed the fluid; she finally had some relief and was able to sleep through the night.  Last week, she was told they tested the fluid and it showed non small cell cancer...not lung cancer, though, it is breast cancer... They said when she had breast cancer 15 years ago, some must have \"gotten out\" and it has been dormant since then. She has had numerous tests done throughout the last week, and she was diagnosed this week with Stage 4 Breast Cancer. The cancer is now in the fluid around her lungs, in her left lung, two vertebrae, the left side of her pelvis, lymph nodes, and there is a tumor in her bowel. They have not tested the fluid around her heart yet, though I do believe that will be done soon.  According to the doctors, surgery, chemo, and radiation are not options for her. They have given her an oral medication in hopes it will help control the cancer from spreading further, but I do not know what it is called.  Can anyone share experiences or suggestions with me? Or help me understand what is going on? I've tried to research some of this, but it is still confusing... They said the fluid around her lungs contained \"non small cell\" cancer but she does NOT have lung cancer - she has breast cancer from 15 years ago that has been dormant until now. Is the non small cell cancer not always lung cancer? Or is it possible to have non small cell breast cancer? ..... How is it possible that they've done at least 1-2 tests a week for the last 3-4 months and they are just now seeing this? How has it spread to so many places without being detected until now? .... What made it come out of the dormant state to begin with? ..... Why are they saying she can't she be treated? Or why aren't they doing something other than the oral medication? .... What exactly will the oral medication do? Is it effective? .... Are there ANY other treatment options? .... The doctors have not yet given a prognosis. My mom is 55 years old, and this has hit us out of nowhere. Someone please help me.. There has to be something that can help her.... Please.. I can't lose my mom..",
