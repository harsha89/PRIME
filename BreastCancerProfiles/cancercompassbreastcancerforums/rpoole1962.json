I should have had it done the first time and now that it's back in the other breast, I really wish I had. So live and learn, Hi Sandylee, No need to stress about whether you did the mastectomy back then or not.  I had the mastectomy, chemo, and 33 radiation treatments and delayed reconstruction. I did everything the onc recommeded to avoid a reoccurance.  I was cancer free for 3 1/2 years and found a lump in my next 3 weeks ago.  Hat a CT Scan and found 3 cancerous tumors in the lymph nodes above and below the clavical, and many lung mets.  The even radiated the lymph nodes!!  But still...it came back.  I seen women who did the most aggressive chemo...\"the red devil\" and it still comes back. I'm scared of chemo now because all the articles on the immune system. Chemo depletes the immune system allowing the cancer to grow and spread.  I am currently on Arimidex, but am going to MD Anderson to try anything possible.  I don't want to stand by and take the hormonals and maintain..until it stops working, then move on to the next and the next..  I want to give myself the best fighting chance I have.  I know stage 4 is not curable, but I plan to fight this for a very long time!

      "Content": "Hello,  I have been on Arimidex for 5 weeks with no side effects.  I have the occasional hot flash but not anything like how it was on Tamoxifin.  I was cancer free for 3 1/2 years on Tamoxifin but had a reoccurance.  Onc put me on Arimidex and I have heard all the bad side effects, but none for me after 5 weeks.  I'm so scared it is not working.  And I have to wait 2 more months to find out!!  This crap could be spreading and growing.  Isn't there a test to send off tumor to see what works and what doesn't?  I don't like trial and error method. Thanks for any input. Robin",
