      "Content": "I had my left breast removed 17 years ago. My Dr gave me Tomixflin and I went to see him every three months. The six months and finally twice a year for five years. I had a scan before each visit. I think you should get your medical records and go to another oncoligest, or Cancer Treatment center. Something is out of kilter here. Do not just stand by and say OK. Dr's are not all knowing Gods, Mildred",
