      "Content": "Hi Smitten!  I had a similar experince as yours. Found a tumor, left breast extremely close to the chest wall.  Had surgery then the Onco test which came back pretty bad.  A month later found it spread to my liver.  After a few days of asking \"why me\" I figured I better get myself together and start fighting.  Started chemo (Taxotere only) and my hair only thinned out on the top.  It was still a shock though & I didn't know whether to laugh or cry as I stood there in the shower holding a handfull of hair.  My husband pulled out the clippers and I have had a buzz cut ever since and I have to say I like it!!  It is so darn convenient to slip on a wig when I go to work.   Last treatment was 5/27 and we can see that it is growing back.  My lashes really thinned which I miss more then anything else.  But I feel good and I'm alive and I know I'm not alone in this battle.\\ Keep a real good attitude, laugh alot and remember that this is only temporary!  Enjoy the day!  Barbara    ",
