    "Content": "After 5 month of my FLAP reconstruction the sorrounded area of the breast is hard as a rock. It is called Fat Necrosis. I will have another reshape of the breast since it's very flat, and a removal of that hard tissue in one and a half month.  I'm very exceptic of the final results because I think that the breast will look even smaller than now, even when the plastic surgeon told me that he may use some of that fat for the reshape. He also told me that he wants to adjust the other breast to the size of the reconstructed one, making it smaller. I said \"Don't touch the good breast\" but he says is for\" symetry\" I'm 63, and I think that I can find the symetry with any \"wonder bra\" and be away of any other complication in the good breast.  I will like  the comment of someone who may have been trough the same experience. Thank you !!",
