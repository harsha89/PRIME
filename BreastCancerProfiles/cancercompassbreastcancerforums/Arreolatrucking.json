During chemo she had lost her hair and went through some depression. Also she has had some problems with her heart. B/C of her heart problems she had to stop chemo on and off. My biggest worry though is her Dr. thinks she might have another lump in her breast and if so what does that mean? I know it means the cancer has come back, but does she have to go through chemo again or does it mean she is going to DIE fro m this now? It worries me so much that im scared to find out the answer to this:( I cant sleep, eat or concentrate on anything. I cry evernite when im alone. My mom is the only parent I have, and i dont know what i would do w/ out her. Please, if anyone has anything to share with me i would be so grateful. Thank you  I don't know much about the cancer itself.  I'm new to all this.  I am stage VI breast cancer.  I only have 2 chemo's under my belt and a third next week coming.  I just wanted to give you some moral support be strong for your mom.  I am 38 and have 3 small children.  My oldest is 7 and I have twins that are two and a half.  Hearing their support is vital.  I also get scared and can't sleep at night or wake up really ewarly scared and can't go back to sleep.  I trust in the lord, and I know if it is my turn and gods will nothing will change it.  Make sure all your time is quality time because you just don't ever know.  Each day that goes by is another notch under the belt sweetie.  I lost my mom 6 weeks after my twins were born but she had been sick since 1999 when my oldest was born.  It wasn't cancer she was on life support and basically died of heart failure.  She was only 53.  Her twin my aunt died at 51 she had lupus since the 80's and died of kidney failure.  We can't keep everyone we love.  But we can support them until the end whenever that may be.  And most important keep everything special either jotted down or weight it heavy in your heart so you never forget the ordinary or the special moments with your mom.  Stay positive ok.  I'll include prayers for you when I pray at night.  Davina Duncan",
