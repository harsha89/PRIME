      "Content": "R,   I'm deeply sorry to hear about your mom.  I had to make a similar decision regarding my wife almost 2 years ago.  She was diagnosed with cancer shortly after giving birth to our son and passed away when she was only 31.  Don't feel bad about bringing your mother home as I'm sure it is the right thing to do.  I wish you and your brother the best during this ordeal.   Tony ",

      "Content": "My wife passed away on June 10th, at age 31, less than 2 weeks after she was diagnosed with carcinomatous meningitis secondary to breast cancer. She was diagnosed with breast cancer a little over a year ago and we thought she had beaten it after all of her scans had come back negative in early May. She first started to show signs of the illness about 4 weeks before her death. She had started to lose strength in her legs which got worse with each day. About a week later she was completely unable to stand. A MRI of her brain and spine showed nothing, but the doctors feared that the cancer had spread to her spinal fluid. Their fears were confirmed after a spinal tap was done and the results were positive for carcinomatous meningitis. We tried chemo one time, but stopped all treatment after finding out that there was no cure. Chemo would have prolonged her pain and suffering, and neither her nor I wanted that. I've read that the median life expectancy for this type of cancer is 4 - 6 weeks if it goes untreated. During her last weeks, she showed signs of severe agitation at times, slight dementia, and eventually lost the ability to move any body parts. Her legs were also in a lot of pain which was kept under control by heavy medication. We eventually had to rely on large doses of valium and sleeping pills to keep her sedated until she passed. I hope this helps shed some light on this evil disease and pray that a cure will be found one day.",
