I finished chemo, radiation in Jan '06 and I'm exhausted all the time. It's all I can do to get out of bed some days. It's so depressing. Would love to hear from others. Hi Jeannies, I wanted to respond to your email.  I am a breast cancer survivor.  I was diagnosed Jan. 21, '05 and finished my treatment regimen Aug. 19, '05.  I did neo-adjuvant therapy (chemo FIRST, before anything else.)  Chemo was quite a HAUL for me.  I had A & C, combined, and then switched to taxotere.  Taxotere was a horrifying experience, to say the least.  I only had one treatment of taxotere, and then I had two treatments of Taxol.  I was interested in your comment of being tired much of the time.  I am doing well, physically.  My doctors are ecstatic when I see them!  They are just thrilled with how I am doing.  At any rate, I do struggle with being tired.  Of course, I am back at my work.  I am a teacher.  The tiredness kind of comes and goes.  I do notice that my stamina is not right where I want it to be.  It's frustrating to get a mentally tired out feeling, too.  I wondered if you were doing better, now?  I find the best thing that works for me is to make sure that I get my rest.  Exercise also helps -- but that is such a double edged sword.  My job is so extremely important to keeping my health.  I just HAVE TO KEEP UP with my job.  It's basically a tie with priorities -- the job is right up there.  I have to have employment and I absolutely love what I do!  So, when things get crazy at school, of course, exercise is one of the things that will get left out.  During the winter months, it's not as convenient for me to get the exercise, as well.  I am looking into other avenues for how to cope with the tiredness.  I am not satisfied with what I've discovered, or not discovered, thus far.  Talking with a counselor has been helpful.  But, I'm currently trying to find one that can better help with issues such as living a normal live after cancer, losing a breast, and what I'd like to call my own versiou of post traumatic stress disorder, which was from the chemotherapy. Take good care of yourself.  I'd like to know how you are doing now. --Heartbig    ",
