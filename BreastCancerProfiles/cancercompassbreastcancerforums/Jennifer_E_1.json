    "Content": "Hi Pat, My lymphedema did not start under the breast but rather the entire breast swelled. It occurred soon after I completed radiation and has never been painful. A year and a half later, it remains swollen two bra sizes bigger than my unaffected breast. I highly recommend that you see your doctor, not because it may be the cancer returning, but because it is more likely an infection of the tissue. I have experienced greater sweeling after strenuous activity involving the arm on the side of my affected breast. Do you recall any activity which may have aggravated the muscles in your chest? Any swelling that is red or painful definitely needs to be looked at so a possible infection does not spread and cause you more harm. I hope this is helpful. Jennifer",
