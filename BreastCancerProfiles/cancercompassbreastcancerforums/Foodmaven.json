      "Content": "Femara has kept me stable for 9 years. I am a 28 1/2 yr survivor of breast cancer and endometrial sarcoma. I am a stage IV for 17 years.Â  All drugs have side effects. I have never known anyone taking Femara to get blood clots of strokes. It does cause arthralgia and can be pretty bad at times. If you want to live, you will try whatever you can. Quality of life has been good but started going downhill 2 years ago. I have had 10 operations and plenty of damages. You cannot believe all the statistics you read. If that were so, I should not be here. I urge you to take an AI and if you don't like it, you can always quit taking it. RP",

      "Content": "Megan, Do not procrastinate. The life you save may be your own. If it as small as you say, it can be removed as a lumpectomy with no further treatment but an aromatase inhibitor or radiation. It may also be benign. Wouldn't you like to have a clear mind about this instead of wondering? I don't know where I'd be if I didn't go to a breast surgeon. Mine only showed up in a mammo as microcalcifications. It could not be felt. Good luck, get going.......don't be afraid. I found out it is worse to not know......... R",

I am now taking Femara. Why don't you ask the doctor for an aromatase inhibitor? Look up this word on google.com Educate yourself and be prepared. Better safe than sorry.",

I had bad aches and pains taking femara and am off it for 1 1/2 years and still ache in my hips. I am stable with lung mets from uterine sarcoma. It works on this cancer too. I had LCIS 3x so that is why I took tamoxifen. Did you have your thyroid tested? Sometimes hair falls out from hypothyroid. None of the women on my list complain about hair loss while taking femara only terrible aches and pains and tendonitis. I don't think this is the cause.",

Blood tests for liver function and cholesterol should be done every 3 months. I had mets in my lungs and it has kept me stable. Off the drug one year now. I was on it for uterine sarcoma but I also had lobular carcinoma in situ 3x and it kept it from becoming invasive. Hope this helps. From a long-term survivor.",

I am still fighting the cancer but I am here. I have gone through plenty but there are people that are worse off than me. I have had multiple lung mets 3x. I have had 10 surgeries, taken anti hormonal treatment. I have lived my life from scan to scan. I am still here, I can still enjoy. I live! Let your attitude be that you will be the one to survive...you will live to help others so they will not go through what you do.
