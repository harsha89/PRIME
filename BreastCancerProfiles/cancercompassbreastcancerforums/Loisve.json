    "Content": "I have been taking Arimidex after radiation for breast cancer. I had severe pain in my wrist and arm, so discontinued it for a month, and the pain has subsided. Now the Dr. says if I don't want to go back on it, I can take tamoxophin. Has anybody had painful bones or bad side effects from that? I feel so much better since discontinuing the arimidex. I hate to take on a new set of troubles. thanks. Lois",
