    "Content": "I will have internal radiation for Stage 1 breast cancer, not in the lymph nodes next week, twice a day for 5 days. Then, the docs want me to take Arimedex for 5 years. I read of the nasty side effects which do not please me at all particularly as the doc couldn't provide me with statistical information on how much the drugs reduce the chance of recurrence. The radiation doc said doing the radiation reduces the chance of return from around 30% to 2-4% but the doc who will oversee the oral meds couldn't state any numbers, just said it works all over the body, not just at the site of the initial tumor which the radiation hits. Â Any information out there, please?",
