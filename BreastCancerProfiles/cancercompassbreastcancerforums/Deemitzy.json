    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the site and I have found the threads sound very familiar to my moms story. In Sept '92 my mom (42 at the time) was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent numerous chemo and radiation treatments. The cancer was *cured* and she was in remission. From what I understood if you stay cancer free for 10yrs then the cancer *shouldn't* metastasis and you should be in the *all clear*. Eight yrs into her remission, '00, she was diagnosed with bone cancer in her hip, and lower vertebrae. Her bone was described to me as being like \"honeycomb\". She was given 1 year. Here she she had more radiation therapy and also took a medicine that she calls her \"bone glue\" (not sure actual name). She responded to these treatment quite well and her prognosis was changed. It was good. Well for the next six years or so she continued with the \"bone glue\" every month. In late November '05 she started receiving radiation again due to the tumours growth. Which, again, she responded to quite well. At christmas she was getting weaker and had more severe back pain and pins and needles in her legs and feet. In February '06 she was weaker again relying on a cane to walk, becoming less and less active. She was reluctant to go upstairs and slept on the couch most of the time. She also experienced numbness in her feet. In mid-march she was feeling unwell, very nauseous. She went into her oncologist for anti-sickness medicine. Her doctor noted how weak she had become and admitted her for further evaluation. It was suspected that she had cancinoma meningitis. The following week she could no longer get out of bed or walk without assistance. By April she could no longer walk. She had become incontinent and was catheterized. She was hallucinating and becoming very confused, showing signs of dementia. Needing assistance getting in and out of bed into her wheelchair. She received 3 treatments of MTX intrathecally. She showed some sings of improvement. i.e she was more alert and most of the signs of dementia were gone. But as this process was painful and would not *cure* her, she decided to stop the treatment. She still received some radiation treatments for her bone cancer. Her prognosis was uncertain, weeks to months. During this time the docs were trying to diagnose her as it was only suspected that she had CM due to her symptoms. But they could not find the cancer cells in her CSF. In June she was placed in a hospice. By now she could no longer get in and out of bed without the assistance of a hoist. Her prognosis took a turn for the worst, 6 weeks. Her mental condition remained good, as with her sight and hearing, all throughout June, July and most of August. Its now late August. At the beginning of the month we had a meeting with the doc. The prognosis was 1-3 months. Which I thought was OK... But now she is extremely weak needing a full hoist to get out of bed. Her \"dementia\" is back, she gets very confused, anxious, upset and very tired all the time. She can't lift her arms and now has pins and needles in her hands and forearms. The doc has changed her prognosis again, now for the worse 1-2 weeks. Before she was taking *steps* downwards but plateauing off for weeks at a time. Now I see her taking *steps* but with no plateau. I was just wondering if anyone Else's loved one was given such a variety of prognoses' and also if the *steps* were in any way similar to my moms. She was never \"dianosed\" with the disease but she has it. It was described to me as \"leaves in a pond\" you know they are there but you just can grab one as they scatter and float and move. As of right now I have no idea what to expect. It is like a rollercoaster. I would just say to anyone who has a loved one fighting this horrid disease, if they have mood swings or lash out remember its the disease not them. If they are confused or mess things up be patient. Be kind and remember that they love you. Keep my mom in your prayers and thoughts, Thank you for taking the time to *listen*, Dee",
