      "Content": "Radiation for me (post rad tx 2 months) were totally uneventful.  My schedule was quite hectic and I truly never really experienced any fatigue that slowed me down.  Each morning (7 AM) I would stop and see a relative at a hospital, the go to work, walk quite a distance to tx, come back to work and work the complete day, go back to the hospital to see the relative, stay until 8 PM, do laundry when I got home.  DId this for 30 treatments and honestly never felt fatigued.  Hopefully your experience will be similar!",

Does anyone have any suggestions. I haven't got much info on helping me cope with this. I think I'm more scared of the rad tx. compared to the chemo. I'm a RN and have treated pts w/ radiation burns and the damage is terrible. I have an appointment w/ a nutritonist upcoming, but I've found cancer survivors are the best teachers. Please help. Reny! I just completed 30 treatments (25 regular and 5 boosts)and had no problems.  I am not sure if I am the norm or the exception.  I was told from the beginning to use Aquafor cream (made by Eucertin).  This is an over the counter cream.  I was instructed  to be faithful and use it 4x/day.   Unfortunately because the consistency is like vaseline and I did not like it on my clothes, I used it maximum twice a day.  I did not wear a bra (bought cheap camisoles as instructed) since I had to work every day.  I was told I would feel tired half way through and I can't really say I was.  Other than some itching once in awhile, I had no other problems.   While you are receiving the treatment, you feel absolutely nothing.  I hope I helped answer your question.  ",
