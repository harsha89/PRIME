I have breast cancer mets to bone and liver.  I'd like to hear from those taking the above meds.  Let me know how these are working for you.  Side effects?  How long you've been on chemo.  Have you experienced bad skin burns while taking these medications or while taking Taxotere?     Linda (muzk2myear@sbcglobal.net)  Linda,  I have been on a clinical trial with Avastin, Taxol and Gemzar. I started in the trial August 2006. My one year anniversary is coming up. I was originally diagnosed in 2/2203 with breast cancer, triple negative. I was feeling great when I got some fluid in my lungs last year. My cancer met. to the lungs only. My side effects have been pretty manageable after they worked out the kinks. I haven't had skin burns??????Mostly tired and weak. With the feel of flu like symptoms. I'm down for about 2/12 days a week. Migraines are the worst for me. They can last three days. We are working on managing the pain. I have been on this clinical trial longer thatn anyone in Pittsburgh. I'm being treated at the Hillman Cancer Center. Are you going on these drugs? I will tell you I have had some fantastic results. No advancement in my cancer in almost 12months. Also the fluid in my lungs dried up afer two months of treatment. All things considered I'm doing great. I have a friend who is on the Avastin and Taxol alone. In this study you either get picked for the two drugs or the three drug treatment. She is on the two, I'm on the three. She had it in her bone, neck, chest and liver. She has also had some great results. She has only been on it for almost six months now. With very little side effects. If you would like to email me that would be okay. I'm not sure how this works. I found you by getting google updates. You just showed up. I hope this helps you, I would recommend this combination to anyone. I believe it has saved my life!!!! Wishing you the Best, Dawn dawnedelstein@zoominternet.net",
