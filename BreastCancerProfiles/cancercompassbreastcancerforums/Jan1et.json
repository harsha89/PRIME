    "Content": "I need some advice from some veterans out there, who have experience with Taxol. My friend, who is in her early 70s, has a stage 4, very aggressive, metastasis to her spine, with probably only a few months to live. Radiation has not been effective. She is now confined to lying in bed because of pain in her lower back while sitting or standing. Her oncologist is urging her to try Taxol in order to reduce her pain and discomfort and increase her quality of life, however long that may be. My friend is considering it, perhaps even stopping after one treatment if the side effects are too bad. Her question is, what are the likely side effects of, say, one treatment of Taxol? Would she lose her hair? Would the discomfort outweigh the possible advantages? Anyone with experience out there, and can give us some guidance?  Thanks very much. ",
