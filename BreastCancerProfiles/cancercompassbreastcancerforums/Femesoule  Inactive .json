      "Content": "Hi Connie,  I have not had a mysectomy nor breast reconstruction.  I think that it is in your best interest to read about all of the side affects of radiation.  There are many.  There are also no garrantees that it will kill all cancer cells should there be any left.  It does make sense to me to get the reconstruction done after the radiation.  The surgeon is correct in stating that it can burn the new tissue.  It probably won't but it is a possibility.  The surgeon does not make any money by not doing the surgery.  I think that you need to listen to him.  Also, if a breast makes you feel like a woman, then I would suggest that you get some therapy to improve your self image of yourself.  We are not our body parts.  We are more then our body parts.  Yvonne ",

I did go off of my raw food diet which I went on at the health institute for awhile.  The cancer returned.  Again, I opted out of surgery and purchase a low level light laser.  I am using the laser daily and it seems to be helping.  I know that my immune system is not that great.  My red blood cells are clumped together and there is inflamation in my blood.  I learned this by having a Microscopic Darkfied Live Blood Test. I have suffered from a low evergy level all of my life.  I am a widow and live by myself.  I do not think that I could go through more fatique alone.  I also get the cancer magazine \"Cure.\"  After, reading the side affects even of radiation, it does not motivate me to do it.  I am doing everything that I can with alternatives.  I am 70 years old and feel great and do not look my age.  I want my last years to be happy even if I should pass on sooner.  Yvonne      ",

She has breast cancer that spread everywhere even while on chemo. Though the chemo seemed to be working on some spots she now has ascites. Can this be cured or helped with treatments? Is there much time or much that can be done for her? Hi, I went into treatment for stage 4 metatastic breast cancer December of 2008.  I had had breast cancer for 7 or 8 years at that time.  My breasts had become hard as rocks and the cancer had spread to my back.  It also went up my neck.  While, I was on Chemo 10 months later, I was diagnosed with cancer tumors through out my brain.  I took 10 radiation treatments to the brain.  I think that I am through the ordeal but I still need another scan as the tumors had just shrunk sugnifficently. I am putting off the second scan as I have had so much radiation that I am afraid of lighting up like a light bulb.  LOL I look great and I am always told how good I look.  I am very tired most of the time but my attitude is very good.  I almost died December 08 for the second time.  Death does not scare me.  I know where I am going when I leave this world.  May as well enjoy all the experiences that we are challenged with. The first time that I almost died, I lost about 7 or 8 pints of blood.  I had uterine cancer that was not dianosible until the uterous came out.   Everything was mush. I am on new chemo, Tykerb and Zeloda.  They are new medications and both are oral.  Both have help from their pharmaceutical companies. Has your mother had her liver checked as many of the meds are hard on the liver.  Has she had water pills?  All of this needs to be discussed with the doctor.  Maybe, you could go with your mother to the doctor's so he can explain everything so that you can understand it.  Let your mother know how concerned you are about her. Best of healing, Yvonne      ",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, I am 72 years old and a senior athlete.  I have been working  out since I was 48 years old.  My body image is important to me. I have forth stage breast cancer.  One right breast mysectomy.  Both breast had turned as hard as rocks and the cancer spread to my right side and back after the surgery.  The left breast was smaller then the right breast.  Now, the right breast is smaller then the left breast and there is scaring on the skin of the right breast as it was leaking for a period of time.  I have decided that I may never be able to wear low neck tops.  What are the choises?  Will be giving many tops away to my daughter, other friends and Salvation Army. So, give yourself time to heal.  There are plently of pads that you can get to enhance your size of either breast.  I had a lot of old blouses with shoulder pads.  Some of the pads are very comfortable and are wonderful in the bras. Holy Healing, Yvonne ",

      "Content": "Hi Katy, I had the same diagnosis as you. I had a lympectomy Nov 04. The surgeon, the best at the hospital, did not get clean margins. I opted out of the second surgery, chemo and radiation. I went to Hippocrates Health Insitute and learned how to eat a Raw Food diet. I went off of it for 6 months and the cancer returned. Now, I am being recogmended to get a complete masectomy. I opted out of this procedure and I am back on my raw food diet. I also am taking Mistletoe shots prescribed by my holistic physician in addition to several other holistics avenues of healing. Some include wheat grass, essiac tea, vegetable and sprouts green drinks and etc. I know that I will be healed. Read about Ann Wigmore. I do not like meds and the side effects. I am a senior citizen olympian and I do not want to compromise my physical energy. I will go through the trials of raw food and feeling wonderful to the other alternatives. --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.

I tried holistic for almost seven years.  It works for some but not for me.  I had a mysectomy on one breast but it did not stop the cancer 2 years ago.  Both of the breast turned hard as rocks and the cancer spread to my right side and back.  It also started to drain fluid.  While, I was on chemo, it spread to my brain.  I had 10 radiation treatments last fall. I started chemo 14 months ago.  I am on HER2 as an infusion and Zekerk and Zeloda which I take orally at home.  Both are very expensive and there is help from the pharmacetical companies that you may access.  If, you are on Medicare, it covers one of the medications.  Both, oral medications are the new Biological ones.
