      "Content": "Hi Weezw, I know how you feel. Doctors simply will not tell you. I think they feel Hey we got rid of the cancer (but of course there is no way to know that for years) and we should trust them as experts. What they don't tell you is the future damage than can be as deadly.  I watched a documentary on netflix about this breast cancer and the treatment. Call in slash-burn-poison. Pretty much sums it up. Why is it that heart attacks that killed so many men have such good none disfiguring outcome but breast cancer still is not only disfiguring but worse. If you have early lung cancer they don't start removing the whole lung.   I think it has been just a cop out and easier to just cut off the breast and a lot more MONEY since the government made a law stating insureance companies MUST pay for reconstruction.  They tried to get me to do a double masectomy when I had only a tiny amount of cancer. It is too radical. Now they want me to do a hysterectomy with just abnormal cells which aren't cancer yet. Might never be cancer. Then what do we have, I can't take estrogen because HER positive and then what prolapse of whole area? I want to leave the world as well as possible but not in pain and to suffer more an more surgeries. I even looked asked for my biopsty and the nurse who called me told me WRONG. It is a wait and see from all the research and cin 1 not 2 and not cancer. I trust no one now. They never told me if I had radiation that if it came back I would not be able to have implant reconstrution due to the radiation but a trans flap which is so much harder and dangerous.  I will do the minimum but will not live the rest of my life with them taking me apart piece by piece to suffer before I die.",

      "Content": "Shelly--thank you. I was bullied too for 3 months. Finally they said they got me in a pro ton trial and they had only had 4 women in this through Pro cure. I thought since a trial I would be convered, ended up costing 20k..insurance paid 15k but still was already strapped.  I would not do this either again a waste of money I believe. There is no guarantee anyway. I can't believe women go through the 6wks of radiation. Why do you think they techs wear cover?? it damages you. I think this whole process has tons of unnecessary procedures. I had 4 ct scans, 3 ultrasounds, 4 MRI's all for a lumpectomy. It is ridicuous and just makes them money. This treatment is barbaric and they won't change it because it  makes the doctors lots of guaranted money since they must fix you after they destroy you. Insurance companies by law must. So they have a blank check and with what insurance doesn't pay you have to life anyway.",

      "Content": "I would say I do not think it is not wrong to express an opion about radiation and not doing it.  My mom had breast cancer 40 yrs ago, this many years later, they are still pushing for radical masectomies. The imporvement is small in many ways. They don't put you under and then you wake up with a radical macectomy like my mom these days, you get to think about it. But they still are pushing them. I see the whole propogand from doctors after surgery--WE cured you--they don't know that, because they don't know why it showed up in the first place.  I agree some treatments are needed. There are many new ones which have not caught up with the general public yet. But even 40 yrs ago my there was NEW thinking on lumpectomies and the OLD protocal of radical is only treatment was the protocal. Only a few years later the thinking changed. She never had to look like a burn victim, here cancer was not invasive, they did not tell her or could she make a choice. Yes that has changed. BUT, they are scarying women into double masectomies. I am single 61, very little family or people I know, and no one to help take care of me so I choose a lumpectomy. I refused radiation for 3 months, finally did it. Still wished I had not. Doctors do know there are new treatments, they know that their treaments might temporary expand life, but and they can say They Cured Cancer with you, because they do not let you know the 'treatment' down the road leads to other damage and illnesses of which the quality of life might not be worth it. I choose to do the least damage and gamble. If it comes back we can do a lumpectomy again.  I see a win win, if it comes back and is really bad, you can't second guess it.  On a documentary on Netflix I watched decribes the treatment as \"Slash-BURN--Poisen.  That is the curent treatment. The arimidex causes so many severe problems for a lot of women. Doctors are doing what they are taught. And keep doing that throughout their careere even when things change. Proton therapy and a few other new ones on the horizon. Example a new breast implant that has the radiaiton in it when it is done, the implant remains. ---It would of course cut out a whole lot of money to oncologist and radiologist would it. I say research, learn all you can about your particular cancer, study the drugs, the blogs and make your own choice. The doctors choices might not be right for you",

Silence sure keeps them from having to bother with it.  They are not required to tell you all the organ damage or problems you will go through.   WE finally forced drug companies to list the side affects and now have do the same for Doctors.  They do not have to tell you anything. They have you sign a blanket waiver---that anything can happen with treatment.  Lets them off the hook. I am so upset after thousands of dollars I can't even get the oncologist to tell me anything--They bring me in will do a MRI or act if don't find something they don't tell you--hey it's a radiation problem, No it is silence.  And a lot more money everyone makes becausse with cancer, they have a blank check.",

That is why it is important doctors know a little about each patient. But it is line patients up get as many through in a day. Time is money. so hard to sit and get to know them. It is sad that medicine is more a business than back when doctors went into the profession because of their heart and caring for others. I find each week I find new issues, so I hope in the future some of the problems will subside. thank you",

I can not even wear a bra or sleep on my back because he pressure of my breasts even on the rib cage hurts.  It is so hard to know what to do in all this.  I worry of what is next to come. I still have shooting  breast pain and arm pain and swelling. I don't think it will improve.  I know this I would not do radiation nor allow them to take out lymph nodes again. There are better treatments but many doctores just continue their protocal and have not tried the new things which to me is shameful. my heart goes out to you",

      "Content": "smpfj, thank you for the kind thought.  My cancer was invasive and had not even made a tumor yet it was fast and aggressive. However, I do know they use to take out a whole bunch of sentinel nodes and learned it was very damaging and read recently that many doctors are stopping all of it. I know they tell us they have to do serious things 'just to be sure' and I know their clincal trials are what they go by but it is all guess and estimates. For me, my quality of life is the issue. I know some people have lots of family, a nice life, and so forth, and they have people around to take care of them.  I do not. So for me, I am not afraid to die but afraid to suffer and do so alone. But I do believe they have new treatments that work and IT is simply hard to get them to change. My bone scan was bad and therefore refused the Arimidex which depleted the bones also.  When you remove ALL estrogen you have severe bone breakage and other issues from  this drug. I would rather live 5 more years feeling pretty good, than 10 or more and continue to become more and more disabled. I think doctors should tell us ALL that could happen to each patient so we can make that choice. I appreciate your kind message",

      "Content": "GLCAC785-- I am so sorry you have all this going on. I worry about it also.  They simply don't know why this happens. If you have invasive breast cancer, it just takes one to get into bloodstream or lymph glands to travel to other areas of the body.  Radiation even if you have masectomy might not get every invasive cancer cell. Even with masectomy they can miss a part of the breast skin which contanes a cancer cell. If it travels to other parts of your body it is still called breast cancer. For example if you get lung cancer and had invasive breast cancer it is still called Breast Cancer, not lung cancer. This is because DCIS is a breast cancer that stays in the breast and does not break out of the area where it can travel. If it does any cancer from Invasive BC will be the cause of it in other body areas. I had both DCIS and Invasive BC.  I did only a lumpectomy, and targed pro ton readiation. I refused chemo and refused the terrible drug Arimidex. It is a risk but it's all a risk based on trials and percetages. There is no cure, it is always trying to treat and pray. I am suppose to have a hysterectomy but I said no it's not bad in first watch stage so i will wait and watch. Had a pap last week no changes. So again I will wait. I watched a documentary abrout this all. The treamtmen for BC is--Slash/surgery--Burn/radiation/-Poison/chemo---There is no cure and still you can do it all and not get rid of it. What I do is always get copies of reports, because they have made errors in what they have said, where report of serverity was not as they said. So, I require PROOF i can read and see. We are in charge of our bodies and must not just be a sheep led to slaughter but have ALL THE information. As I said, I took a risky (by doctors protocal) and learned all I could and choose my own treatment I am sending prayers and hope this helps a bit.",

Because of the law passed where the insurance MUST cover reconstrution, Guess what they are 'pushing' double masecotmiies. It is a money game. The treatments on TV and all their raising money runs are all made to be pretty and women running around laughing and cheerful in pink. It is a lie, it is not pretty, it is horrible, full of drugs that damage your bones, pain from so many things can not even tell them all. As I told them and I do not have those issues of your mom--I will do the least amount, I will not allow all this done to spend years of recovery, devastation of bones, lungs, ribs, lymph systems and on and on in order for  them to SAY we cured you. They don't know, if will come again even if you do all that. Just as they can't tellyou WHY IT appeared in the first place.   I would rather live only 5 years longer feeling good than 10 years being sick, and in pain, and more tests all the time and money money money out for no reason.  Please research-doctores have a 'SILENCE CODE\" They think we are stupid and they are SO SMART. they brad of curing you but DENY they damage they do. Thank Goodness through the years I have seen many doctores opionions be wrong so I didnt' trust them I hope to feel good enough to start a campainge like we did on prescription drugs--That doctors MUST TELL US OF ALL THE SIDE AFFECTS of all their treatmants as  THE DRUG COMPANIES must do now.",
