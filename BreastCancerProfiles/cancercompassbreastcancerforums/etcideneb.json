    "Content": "I read this morning that article about Jenny Dowell newly-elected Lismore(australia) mayor who has been diagnosed Breast Cancer before the election result.  http://www.finda.com.au/story/2008/10/02/jenny-dowell-diagno I found her testimonial very interesting on how she decided to fight and live with her disease in front of the public opinion. She is a good example approaching cancer in a positive way even if it hard to live with it.        ",
