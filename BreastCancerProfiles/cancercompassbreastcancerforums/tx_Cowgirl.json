I am back to my old self, lost the weight, and feeling great! Joint/foot pain is gone and I can do what I want to do! We all just need to stay aware of what drugs can do to our bodies. Blessings to you! Tx Cowgirl",

      "Content": "Immediately after Chemo, I began taking Arimidex.  I felt like I was 80 yrs old and had constant pain, no weight loss.  After 7 months, I asked to try a different drug and my dr put me on the Aromasin.  Within the first couple of months, I started feeling good again - went to the gym and now I ride my horse several times weekly, volunteer at an equine therapeutic riding center and am outside mostly.  Just in the past few months I have noticed that the hot flashes are becoming less and less.  No other symptoms that I am aware of.   May you be blessed with good health - and put this behind you.",

      "Content": "Hi all.  I just quit taking arimidex 1 month ago due to sever joint pain.  I began feeling like I was 90 years old.  The doctor now wants me to take Aromasin, which seems to have the same side affects.  If not, I'll try tamoxifen.  My cancer was stage 2 , treated w/dbl mastectomy and chemo.  Just found out my bones are going down hill fast in just one year.  Boniva has been prescribed.  Same side effects are listed.  My delimma is how to take these without knowing which one is causing side effects.  I'm pretty discouraged at the long term affects these drugs can cause to my already fragile body.  I was a very young 50 yr old, riding my horses, keeping up with my grandsons, and now most days I'm too tired to move.  I am gonig to Physical Therapy to try to regain strength.  Weight loss is difficult also - walking is way too painful to be considered an exercies.   Help!",
