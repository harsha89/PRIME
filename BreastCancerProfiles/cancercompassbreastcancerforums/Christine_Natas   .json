      "Content": "Hi my name is christine and I am a 4 year breast cancer survivor stage 3 breast cancer. I had my right breast removed and was taking tamoxifen for 2-1/2 years. I developed severe side effects where I needed a complete hysterectormy because of it. I am now on Femara and all is fine. Its scary everytime something happens but try to remain positive. I remember when I lost my hair...I had to go to my granddaughter's first communion...and my hair was in knots...but I was saved by wearing a hat on that occasion. Losing your hair as well as thinning hair is quite difficult for any woman as we are judged by it as well as having breasts. I have come to full term as I did not have breast reconstruction because of side effects...but I am still alive to enjoy my family. Try to be positive as best as you can. I do a lot of praying and helping others in their fight against breast cancer. Please respond as we can keep in touch with each other....Live life....",

I was on tamoxifen for 2-1/2 yrs but developed a serious side effect and had to have hysterectormy because it became pre-cancerous. With cancer its like always waiting for the shoe to drop. I am now on Femera....since October 2005....so far so good. My hair did not grow back completely as I always had long hair. It was very traumatic but life goes on...and I enjoy everyday that I am alive. Keep fighting....hair or not...you are still alive....enjoy your family and friends...keep in touch..I will say a prayer for you.",

I went to the doctor and they wrote on the report it is \"a palpable abnormality.\" In other words,there is something growing there. They thought it was a cyst,as I have had fibrocystic disease a few years back. So they send me for a mammo & said there was nothing there! Fine. But now,this year,the pain is still there,in and around the breast,outside quadrant and near the nipple. Also it hurts when I lie on it,pain in my underarm too that was horrible a couple times. A few days before my period,I saw some stuff coming out of that breast,clear fluid,then it turned white. I can squeeze it out & it also comes out by itself. As a matter of fact,for a long time I've had sudden spotting from that breast,very briefly,but this came out more this time. I have NEVER had any kind of nipple discharge in my life,only when I had milk in the breasts for the kids. I'm hoping it was cyclical,but,as I said,this is the 1st time I EVER had anything like this. Nipple also looks kinda strange,and breast feels kinda rough,like the pores in it are enlarged. What do you guys make of this? Thank you, N.Y.  I am a 4 1/2 year breast cancer survivor who had a radical masetctomy. I had fibrocystic breast disease which started in 1984. I had several biopsies, all benign. and lumpectomy. In 2001 I started to feel completely fatigued, went to personal physician, had vitamin b12 shots....nothing worked until I went to Gyn....she said I had a lump and needed to see an oncologist right away....I did and also went for 2nd opinion. I had no discharge and no pain in breast...but had another mamogram, ultrasound...oncologist found breast cancer. I'm not saying that you have this but you should get another opinion, go to a different imaging place...and visit your gyn doctor...preferably a female...they seem to understand more. I am doing fine and hope you will respond to this message....but don't wait...get another opinion right away...a radiologist is only as good as they read it....take care",

Lumpectomyis  as successful as breast removal and maybe more so.  I would google the information.  Also there are better inhibtors than Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has way too many side effects.Tamoxifen is falling out of favour. Femera is a much safer hormone inhibitor and way less side effects.  Please look this up on the net along with \"rates of remission for mastectomy versus lumpectomy\" On 3/29/2007 Spiritsquad wrote: If I have dcis and I remove my breast won't I be removing all the dcis hence lessening the chances. See what I have been struggling with is I just have been notified that I need a re excision due to poor margins I have necrosis cells I have solid pattern with high grade on my first biopsy and intermediate grade on the lymphectomy biopsy. I have no great attachment to my breast and my spouse wants me to have it removed to lesson worry of reoocurrance. with reconstructive surgery as an option I guess the thought of removing my breast w/reconstruction and not having to go through more reexcisions (Possibly) and also not having to go through Radiation as well I am not a gambler and from what I have researched so far a masectomy seems the savest route to take. I have yet to read or hear that lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen has a better cure rate than masectomy. I have heard that its about the same I guess I am just a littel confused.  Thanks for your answers they are greatly appreciated.  God Bless,  Spiritsquad     I am a breast cancer survivor 4-1/2 years....after taking tamoxifen for 2-1/2 years, I needed 2 dnc's and eventually last year had a hysterectomy because of all the serious problems I had with it...it became pre-cancerous. I did the right thing but had to convince my oncologist that I needed to go onto Femera....which I have been on since and so far no problems. You need to address this...I think down the road tamoxifen will be considered dangerous. ",
