I have never heard of anyone relapsing from triple negative breast cancer after 5 years.  I have heard if you make it to the 5th year then you are pretty much considered cured.  Do you know of anyone with this type of breast cancer who has relapsed after 5 years and rather this information is true or not?",

      "Content": "Hi Dulcey,   I was just reading your story about you being a 6 year breast cancer survivor and it made me feel so happy . I will be 28 years old this year and unfornately, i was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in December of 2007 when i was 26.  Triple negative is a very aggressive form of breast cancer.  This breast cancer does not respond well to hormonal drugs.  The only thing that will treat triple negative breast cancer is chemotherapy and radiation treatment.  I get so terrified of relapsing and having a recurrence and losing my life that i don't know what to do.  Reading your story about how you are still alive after 5 years has given me some hope.  Thank you for sharing your story and may God bless you.",
