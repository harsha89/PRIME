I am seeing my onc next week for my yearly checkup and asking him how much longer I have to endure this as my quality of life is very low at the moment. I have a big problem with my feet as I can hardly walk as they are so sore. when I wake up they are stiff then they loosen up and after three hours at work I can hardly stand as my legs and feet are acheing so bad. Another problem I have is my hair is thinning and it is getting worse as the months go on. I'm afraid that the onc will say \" It's better than having cancer\", which is supposed to be comforting to me! I do think however, that after you stop this, things will get better as the estrogen is returning to the system. Can I ask why you have stopped? Was it prescribed by your doctor to stop after three years? Thanks for your time. Good luck with things. Val Hi! I have only been taking letrozole for 8 months and i'm also 55 and feel like 90. I had to take up bike riding because walking was so painful! I also have a huge knot in the thin park of my ankle. My muscles feels like they are tightning like atrophy but I move and excersie (biking) and it does not seem to matter. Sandra",

Im new to this blog and ran across you post which is a good one. Thanks. I do know that soy products can be used to help relieve menapause symptoms...I don't know about the other foods. Good luck!

The joint pain got worse and worse in my hands, I met with the oncologist after two months and after explaining to her that I could barely use my right hand some days (and of course I'm right handed) and that the morning of my appt with her I could not open the front door of my house, both my hands bothered me that day, she said it was time to take me off of the letrozole, I agreed.  She gave me an appt in 5 weeks and at that time if the joint pain has subsided she will start me on one of the other AI's, and if I can't tolerate any of them she will prescribe Tamoxifen.  She stated that the joint pain should subside within two weeks, well I'm at the two week point and still wake up with achy, stiff fingers and my knees and feet still hurt quite a bit in the mornings. I'm wondering after being on for just two months how long it will take for the pain to go away?  I was never nauseous with the Letrozole but I have severe joint pain. usually at night i take advil so I wake up able to move better. That usually wears off mid morning. Once the pain starts the Advil dosent work as well. My hands also swell and it makes it difficult to close. I started squeezing a soft ball to keep them from seizing up in the eveings or if I am sitting for a long period of time. I retain fluid so I have stopped putting salt on my food. some days it works better than others, I have also stopped earting out because they salt their food to heavily for me...something I found to be unusual was the cancer was in my left breast but I am mostly having the pain on my right side. Dr. can not explain.",

I had Lobular and ductal cancer and had surgery last year in May. I had chemo and radiation.The side effects of the letrozole leaves me in pain, even getting in and out of bed is painful. I also take advil, I try to keep it to every other day or every 2 days and it does help with the pain. I am 55 and have started riding a bike because walking is too painful and I can't seem to get the weight off. ",
