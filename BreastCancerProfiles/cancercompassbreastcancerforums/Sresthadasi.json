      "Content": ",yes I am still in treatment. this time the body pain was worse then last time.. i did get a red reaction on my face the first time but it went away in a day. really the worse reaction i had is the bone and muscle pain so i am taking lortabs and alieve which help. the doctor gave me morphine but it makes me sick. after the next treatment they will see if it is working. I have togo through another pet scan. I hope it is working .. the doctor says there are other chemo's but they may be worse etc. we shall see. if it is working I will take it a total of 6 sessions and the herceptin probably for a year or two. I had the cancer in 2003 and had a mascectomy and chemo.after the a/c they wanted me to do the taxol at the time after but my mother was dying of brain cancer and I felt I had had enough. but 2 years later it came back with a vengence, I had been taking the anti hormone arimidex all that time but in the end it did not work. It also gives you muscle and joint pain so i thought as it was getting worse it was the medication .. but the cancer had spread to my bones and lung and lymph.. so I also need alot of prayers. thank you and good luck. God Bless, Sue",

      "Content": "I have had two treatments of taxol. and each time they gave me steroids for three days becasue these chemo are extrememly allergenic. the chemo nurse told me to help reduce the numbness in your hands and feet. to take 100 mg of b6 three times a day and that seems to have worked. the worse problem I have is bone and muscle pain the 4-6th day.after but I have stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to my bones so that may be why. but next to a/c this one is easier except for the pain. I have had no nausea either but they give me nausea meds for at least three days but i have the opposite I am ravenously hungrey .. perhpas from the steroids. Hope all works out for you .",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2003 did chemo for four mouths of cytoxin and adriamiacin. it was very rough. In may of this year I discovered that it had spread to my bones, lymphs, liver, and the lung lining. I had been taking arimidex and then femarra since 2003 and obviously it did not work for me although I know others who are over 5 years with no recurrence who take the medication. one of the side effects is bone and joint pain. so it masks the symptons of the bone mets. Now i am being treated at Shands at the university of Florida. first they gave me radiation so that the mets in my backbone did not enter my spine and for pain. and then i had to have a lung operation because my right lung separated from my chest wall and was filling with fluids. and since then i am on chemo. taxol, I am her2 positive so I get herceptin , xomeda for my bones it helps them not breaking. and now they are giving me a cutting edge drug that stops the cancer cells from making their own blood supply. i think iits called avastin or something like that.. I have an ok two weeks and a rough one.week.. the thing is to take each day and live in the now in the begining i thought i would be dead in a few months but now i know i could live for some time with the chemo.. every three months they do a pet scan to see if their is any improvement and based on the scan they make adjustments. there is a book called \"I rather do chemo then clean my garage\" Its very funny at the same time very inspiring. and give you hope and the knowledge you can cope. I wake up in the morning and thank God for the day. and I try to go to the park or do something I enjoy .. chemo week I watch comedies and try not to get down. my doctors wanted me to take all these heavy narcotics for pain.. but it clouded my mind. so i have been able to work it out with alieve twice a day and in the afternoon when the pain increases a half a lortab every 3 hours does the trick.. the taxol does not give me nausea the main side effect is pain and weakness the first 5 days. and of course chemo brain.(forgetfulness)",
