    "Content": "I've been getting regular mammograms since I was 30. I am 49 now. Last year was the first time I had to have an ultrasound after my mammogram. Radiologist wanted to check my left breast, above the areola straight up. Turned out to be fine. This past March I had my annual mammogram. All good. At the end of May I was laying down and felt a lump(or something)on my left breast, right above the areola. I called my Internist(she's had breast cancer). I went in for her to check me. She felt something too. Ordered a mammogram along with and ultrasound. Radiologist suggested I see a breast surgeon since my Internist and myself felt something. Radiologist didnt see anything specific. I went to the breast surgeon and she ordered a MRI. Results show a 2.7 cm mass and suggested I have a MRI Guided Biopsy. So here I am. This coming Monday, June 22, 2015 I will be having the biopsy. It may be nothing at all....or....I am thankful for....I felt something and proceed with it and that my internist felt the same way as I did. My mammogram did not show anything.Â  Women really need to do self exams!",
