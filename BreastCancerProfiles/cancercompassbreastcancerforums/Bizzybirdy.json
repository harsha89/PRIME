    "Content": "I had a bilateral modified radical mastectomy with ancillary dissection [18 lymph nodes on left side removed] and have been in horrendous pain since a few days after my drains were removed [8th day]. I am taking perkosets 5mg, 800 mg. Ibuprofin and it hardly takes the edge off. It is a crushing, burning viselike pain as if hot cement is on/in my chest and under my arm. I need to get some help soon as I can not go on much longer like this. My surgeon says it is nerve pain but I do not think this much is the norm. My primary says I have an infection as under my arm is very swollen and red and my back and chest is still very swollen. My surgeon aspirated a small amount last week...said it wouldn't make a difference and it didn't. I feel like I am going to die!",
