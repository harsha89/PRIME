My side effects are minimal (sore muscles), but I'm wondering if I'm doing all that I can to save my life. Three doc. opinions tell me no surgery, so I sit with the tumor in my breast and cancer cells in my bones. Has anyone had a lasting success with just these 2 treatments and no surgery with Stage IV? Everyone I talk to has had their breasts removed (or at least has had radiation), but no one wants to do that. I'm wondering if it is because they don't think I have that long to live to put me thru that. Any survivors out there with Stage IV that DID NOT have surgery? i was diagnosed with stage 1V breast cancer 2 years ago, with tumors in my breast and lymph nodes, and unfortunately too it had spread to my bones (my spine). i went through 5 rounds of chemo, but did not have radiation.  i was put on and still take arimidex.  the chemo destroyed the tumors in my breast and lymph nodes, i have an exam every 3 months.  it didn't totally destroy it in my spine tho, but it did show marked improvement.  we are being given arimidex because the type of breast cancer we have is hormone receptor positive, it needs estrogen to exist or grow, the arimidex blocks the hormones from getting to the tumors.  about 2 months ago i started having horrible back pain, an mri showed 3 slipped discs and arthritis besides the cancer.  surgery on the discs wasn't an option because of the chance of spreading the cancer, so i was hospitalized for 3 weeks of radiation and pain control.  it is somewhat better now, but the radiation can take up to 5 mos. to work, so i am given alot of pain meds. and doing alot of praying.  i'm not an expert on anything, but i really would suggest you talk to  your dr. and ask him the questions you've asked in your email.  not knowing where you stand or why they are choosing the choice of treatment they chose must be emotionally draining and frightening, and i think these are things they should have discussed with you.  please feel free to email me personally if you want to talk, it sounds like we have been riding in the same boat for a while. my thoughts and prayers are with you",

      "Content": "i was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer last october, it had spread to my spine.  i live in a small town in westbygodvirginia, small hospitals, small options for drs.  but anywhere you will find good caring doctors.  i had seen a female surgeon ten years previously for a benign lump. i was impressed with her knowledge and also with her compassion.  she had an appt. made for me with an oncologist in charleston two days later.  and he is kind and gentle and very good at what he does.  the most important thing to me is that he cares and will listen. i go in and he will talk as long as it takes to answer my questions.  he knows i want quanity and quality, we all do.  he knows how to treat the cancer and to treat the side effects of the drugs needed to battle it.  he never promised a cure, but what he did promise me was hope, hope for more time with my family. and faith in him that he will do all he can medically to achieve that.  i was lucky to have been sent to him, but if i felt like i wasn't being treated the way every woman in this flippin situation deserves to be treated, i would have gone elsewhere, and elsewhere till i did.  one suggestion would be to go to a breast cancer support group in that area, talk to women facing the same situation, we have the most understanding, i know where to send anyone seeking help in my area.  right now my cancer is under control, the side effects are under control.  i have today to live in, and a hope for tomorrow.   your family is in my thoughts and prayers, my prayer tonight will be for you to find the help you need.  i think you will because it sounds like you won't settle for less. much love, mary",
