      "Content": "Has anyone been initially diagnosed (just found out yesterday) with breast cancer, only thru a biopsy in the lymphnode under my arm pit?  Dr cannot find  breast cancer in mammogram or ultrasound, but they know it's breast cancer from the pathology test.  I also have no symptoms. Will go to oncologist tomorrow and have Breast MRI, next week.",

      "Content": "Just to update everyone, I am primary occult breast cancer, with cancer just in one lymphnode.  I had evidently enough of a suspicious area on my mammogram, to have an ultrasound and that's how they found the cancer in my lymphnode.  The suspicious spot in my breast is abnormal cells, found after the lumpectomy, nine lymph nodes remove, with just the one being positive.  Just wanted to let you know this can happen, pretty rare, 1 out of 100 breast cancers in case anybody else is primary occult.  That will not be ruled until, all tests are done.  Including a few mammograms, breast MRI, breast biopsy, cat/PET scan before surgery, lupectomy with sample sent after surgery, cat scan after surgery.  Thank God for good insurance.  It is treated like Stage 2 breast cancer, best case scenario, awaiting radiation.  Anybody else out there with a primary occult breast cancer a few years out?",

I also am going to try to cut down on sugar, dairy (don't really like anyway) and eventually meat which will be the hardest. I'm estrogen positive also . Worried about Arimidex.",
