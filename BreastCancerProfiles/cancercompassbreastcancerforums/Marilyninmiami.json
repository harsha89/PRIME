    "Content": "In response to your question I will be 59 in Jan (stage II breast ca, triple neg) and am 1/2 through with dose dense ACT. One week after first dose was hospitalized for 6 days with neutropenia. Melissa Etheridge said it all when she said \"chemo is hell\"! I have managed to work (barely) but all my blood counts have bottomed out and I was unable to take my first Taxol treatment Friday since platelets were 72. Good luck! I read dose dense is very effective but it isn't a picnic!",
