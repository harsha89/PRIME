It's good that you are getting mammograms. I started at age 35 (I am now 46). Early detection is key. There are so many advances in treatment. Take care & please let us know what happens.

But i am too depressed to stick to a diet. I am a pathetic loser. Things just got worse. My mom is losing her hair. She never did during her first bout of cancer in 1988. But she is now. She's handling it as well as one could expect her to. It will take everything I have in my not to totally break down when I see her these week to take her to get her hair cut short or shaved....... Thanks for listening to me rant.",

      "Content": "My mother, who is my best friend, is battling breast cancer for the 3rd time. She was initially diagnosed at age 47. She had a lumpectomy and a year of weekly chemo. Fine after that until age 63, she developed another cancer (new one) in the same breast. She had a mastectomy and that was all. Just a month ago, she is 69 now, she was found to have a recurrance of the 2nd cancer. She is taking chemo (once every 3 weeks for 4 hours) & will have surgery after that to get the rest of it. I have been depressed most of my adult life. I am 46. I am being completely honest when I say the only reason I am living is because of my mom. I could not leave and hurt her like that. But that being said, when she goes, I will have nothing left. I know I won't be able to handle it. I am now not sure what the point of this post was. I guess to vent about my feelings.......... This saying sums it up pretty well: I have been dead for a long time. I just haven't died yet.",

Lasted 4 1/2 hours. She did well. She got a shot the next day to bring up her \"white cells\" (not sure on that). The next day she started feeling bad. Weak, joint pain, nausea. I just talked to her & she put in a bad night. Didn't sleep well. Feels like crap today. What concerns me is her mood. She's so down. Which is understandable. I am trying to keep her spirits up. I told her it will get better. Her next treatment is 8-1 & she also has an appointment with her oncologist that day. Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "I tend to ramble so I will try to keep this short. My mom is 69 years old. Her first breast cancer diagnosis was at age 46 (1988). She had a lumpectomy with radiation & a year of chemo. Her second diagnosis was in 2004. A new cancer in the same breast. It was caught at an early enough stage that she had a mastectomy & that was it. A few weeks ago, she noticed a small hard lump in the middle of her chest. She made an appointment with her oncologist & was seen within a few days. The doctor was concerned because it was hard & wanted her to get a biopsy. Instead of just doing the biopsy, they took out the entire lump. Her surgeon first of all said it looked like a cyst. After he got it out, he made a comment \"well, it might not be....I still think it's benign\". That stuck with me. Mainly cause I know that they can tell a lot looking at it. My mom's oncologist called her on Monday & said the results were in & she wanted to see her that afternoon. I knew it was bad news then. They don't mind giving good news over the phone... So far, they say it's a local recurrence of the 2004 cancer. It is HER2 positive. They are doing a CT of the chest/abdomen & a bone scan next Tuesday to see it it has spread. I wonder if there is anyone that has even survived getting breast cancer 3 times....I know she will die someday. I just wanted to have more time with her. It will kill me when I lose her. Most likely, literally. Her & my Dad are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary Friday night. We have having a party. I hope I can make it through with breaking down crying. Doubt it. Thanks for listening. Sorry for the book.",

      "Content": "Hi Lisa. My mother was first diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 46. She had a lumpectomy along with radiation & chemo for a yr. She was also part of a clinical trial where they removed her ovaries. Last Sept, she went in for her yearly mammogram & they saw something. In the same breast. Her oncologist said that it was not a recurrance but a \"new\" cancer. She had a left mastectomy. I have had yearly mammograms since age 30 (I'm now 40) & have had 2 lumps removed from my left breast. Both benign. I, too, wonder/worry all the time about getting breast cancer. It scares me to death. Please think positive about your mom. She's very young & there are so much treatments out there. I hope my email gave you some comfort, at least in the fact that you are not alone. My prayers are with you & your mom. Connie",
