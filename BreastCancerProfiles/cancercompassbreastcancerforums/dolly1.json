      "Content": "Hi Carolyn Apart from your message I have not received any other, however I have been doing my own research and it looks like it is a myth. There are some essential oils that are not recommended but it goes on the individual, the treatment they maybe receiving, any side effects they maybe experiencing etc. So at the moment I think it all will rely on the consultation we have with the client before the treatment plan is set up. At the moment I know that Lavender, coconut oil and frankinsence and myrth are safe oils to use. Any citrus oils we have to air on the side of caution particularly with clients who have/are having radiation treatment. Thank you for replying to my message, and if I come across any further information regarding the matter I will either e mail you or post it on message board. Can I ask if you are a complimentary therapist? if so  do you come across a lot of problems regarding the contra indications of massage with cancer patients. I would appreciate it if we could share any information we both may come across regarding the therapies. Take care Kind regards Pauline (England)",
