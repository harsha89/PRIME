      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer with mets to the bones and ALSO primary kidney cancer in 2001. I was put on Tamoxifen and a monthly Lupron shot (shuts down estrogen from ovaries). After 8 months I finally gave in to my oncologists badgering and had a kidney removed. That seems to have cured the kidney cancer. At the same time I had my ovaries removed, since I was 48 and didn't plan on kids. This helps with the estrogen production and cancelled the need for the lupron shot. My oncologist also put me on a monthly IV drip of zometa for my bones. At the same time I did Dr. Richard Schultz's \"Incurables Program\" which is a series of bowel, kidney, and liver cleanses and changed my eating to mostly juices and all natural. I also followed Hulda Clarks protocol for zapping. (You can google these people's name for anyone interested in them.) The breast cancer went into remission and I continued on the Tamoxifen for arround 5 years, at which point my markers started to climb. At that point we tried another homone treatment of which I can't recall the name.I had been having periodic CT and bone scans to check for progress.  The tumor marker results showed a slight decrease in the numbers but the CT scan showed lesions in my liver. At that point, my oncologist felt the liver lesions should be treated with chemo.  I have to mention here, that after I went into remission I slowly fell off the all natural bandwagon and reverted to my old diet. I think this was a huge mistake. I went on chemo (Taxotere) for 7 months. It was brutal, I lost all my hair and felt terrible most of the time. By the end of seven months my markers had decreased to the \"normal\" range and the liver lesions showed no progression. I've been off chemo for aound 14 months now. Two months ago my markers started going up but my scans remained stable.  My oncologist feels that the scans will change soon but he is not suggesting chemo until they do. Until then, I convinced him to let me try another homone therapy. He said it couldn't hurt, so I've been on Aromasin for around 4 months now and have an oncology appointment in 3 weeks. In the interim I've been resurrecting my natural eating and cleanses. I've been having back pain on the right side. Hoping its not my liver. In any can It's been about 6.5 years since I was first classified as stage 4. I'm still very hopefull that natural methods will help.",
