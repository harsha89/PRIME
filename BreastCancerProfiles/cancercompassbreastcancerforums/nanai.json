      "Content": "Hi there, I am new here . Saw your message My mohter had breast cancer 12 yrs ago and was a cancer free till Jan 09. in Jan this year she developed Ascites. They tested her and found out the ascites was malignant and the cancer had spread slightly to the liver. She had Xeloda. That did not work. She then had Carbo/ Gem. That too did not work and last she had Taxol. They dont feel that is helping either. Now they want to give her IXEMPRA IXABEPILONE early next week . The Doc mentioned that this one is a high risk one and the only one she feels might slow the cancer down and dry the ascites up. She said the side effects are very harsh. Like heart related and nerve . And the white blood cells come down much more than the other chemo drugs. She said my mother could also develop peripheral neuropathy.??? I have tried to research it on the net . From what i understand this is still in trial stage. Please let me know what you think .What should i expect. I dont want her to suffer a lot just for a little extra time. The Dr did mention that this drug will not cure her ,it MAY only slow the spread. Look forward to you reply. And anyone out there if you know anything first hand about this drug would really appreciate your views.. thanks Nanai",
