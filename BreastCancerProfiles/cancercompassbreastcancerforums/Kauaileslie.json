    "Content": "Hi Marie, I too went to CTCA. I live in Hawaii on the island of Kauai, and it was a 9 hour flight each way for me, but it was worth it. They were great almost to the end. I had some problems with them not pre-medicating me for my second type of chemo, taxotere, and I had a horrible reaction. When I asked why they didn't, I was told that they like to see what happens first. What??? All my research after that told me that you have to have the pre-meds for this drug or else..... My general doctor here was appalled, and pre-medded me from then on and I changed to a wonderful doctor in Honolulu. I would recommend them still, even with the problem that I had. I believe in the way that they give the chemo - 18 hours of it instead of 1.5-2 hours like all other oncologists in the country give it. I never got sick, just the reaction to the taxotere as I said and that went away after the proper pre-meds. I was in Zion too. I am anxious about it returning like we all are most the time, but feel that I have done the best thing by going to CTCA and also following the diet of Dr. Joanna Budwig with the flax and cottage cheese regiment - do it daily. Get the book \"How to cure and prevent cancer\" or the other way around. Great book and her regiment is in there. Get it and do it... you can read about her theory and results with it when you do a search on her name. Stay healthy. Leslie on Kauai",
