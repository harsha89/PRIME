      "Content": "i stopped Femora in January, am taking Biotin and women's MVI.  It is still coming out.  My beautician told me to keep my scalp oiled with a nonpetroleum based oil, and am massaging Jamaican castor oil in my scalp.  I found a wonderful fringe hairpiece ($15.00) with a partial scalp (I colored the scalp, I am African-American) that clips in. It was cut to blend in with my short hair and covers my bald spots. I am very happy with it. As far as being \"real\", it is what it is\" is my attitude. ",

In some cases, it can induce alopecia ... especially with all the emotional turbulence and stress from this time in your life.  There are a couple options for you including getting a micro-analysis of your scalp, scalp/hair treatments, and resting hair programs. I am open to answering any questions privately. <3 Source: currently working with a Hair Recovery Treatment specialist who focuses specifically on women who have undergone chemo I have been massaging my receding hairline one to two times a day. Use an oil (I am African American) when massaging the area, about 1-2 minutes. See a dermatologist to make sure there is nothing wrong with your scalp. In the mean time, wear a wiglet to cover those areas. I  just had my hair cornrowed; I wear a sassy wig most of the time. I suggest no chemicals in your hair. ",

      "Content": "I thank God I am alive. I just stopped femora 2 months shy of 5 years. My hair grew back thin and began thinning out within the past 3 years. I wear scarves, hats, and wigs. I just bought some fringe hair that clips onto your hair (have to have enough to clip).  I wear my hair short, but it will give me bangs, coverage on top of my head, and blend into my hair. (I will be getting it cut). I have accepted the fact my hair is not coming back. I am grateful for life, having hair is minor. Thank you Lord. ",

She has shown her cruelty; you are not responsible or her.  I had breast cancer. It took a toll on me and my husband for a time. I was 54 yo, I was bald headed with a tube coming out of my body. I wondered if I was attractive to him, would it come back. Nothing makes you think about your mortality  than a cancer diagnosis. I dont know if she discussed her feelings with you during the time you were married.  It can be hard to reconcile because of the trust issue. This can only happen with counseling and God's help. ",
