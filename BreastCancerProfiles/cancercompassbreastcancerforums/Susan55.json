      "Content": "Hello I too am on Zoloft and Mobic plus Armosin. I have such hip joint pain that I can not stand it any longer. I see my oncologist in January, but I don't know if I can wait that long. I wonder if I could try another aromatase inhibitors that would cause less hip pain. I will not go off of it, but I hate to think I have to endure this day in and day out. I can barely move after spending 3 days over at Disney. Any thoughts/comments would be greatly appreciated.
