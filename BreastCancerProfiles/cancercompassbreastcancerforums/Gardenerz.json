      "Content": "Hi there, and congratulations on getting thru w/Adria/Cytox! Those were really rough, then having that Neulasta on top of that. Whew! What a warrior you are getting thru them. Didn't get put in hosp for those, almost tho as I didn't get Neulasta at the first and white counts dropped to almost zero. Taxol wasn't near as bad, I had an appetite, could stand to smell things again, had more energy. However, the Taxol and Neulasta do give quite a bit of pain. (Hated the Neulasta belly shot...called it my liposuction and told my nurse I kept the little extra fat there just for her.)  There is a lot of info out there that isn't very encouraging so be careful what you read. I  had to learn to give in to rest, (not easy for a busy bee), and  taking Advil, or  unaspirin, and/or a prescrip pain med (half at a time as I'm sensitive to meds) plus a sleep aid at nite. Always remind yourself that it will be better in 5 to 8 days. Kinda like being in labor....pain during but a great blessing at the end. Our blessing is being 'delivered' from cancer.  My hardest time was going to bed/lying down. Seemed to ache more then. Also hot shower would bother my feet. Getting up and walking around a bit helps, as did some midnite milk & crackers and another tylenol. There is some feet & finger numbing, but it too does go away.  i am 4 wks since Taxol and it is much better. Had some physical therapy done on feet, accupressure. Unpleasant at the time, but helped the numb/tingling. Above all, DON'T WORRY!  Easy to say, but I can say it, as I also had bouts w/Mr.Fear & doubt. Our Drs are there to help us, but the Lord is our #1 Physician.  He was always there in the nite hours to help calm my spirit.  Hope you call out to Him too. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. Talk about rambling...sorry but I'm seeing the light at the end and know you will too. One day at a time dear friend. Hope I was some encouragement for you.",

      "Content": "Totally understand the Taxol pain. Couple that with Neulasta, and it takes me 7-10 days to totaly get rid of the pain/ache. I'm sure many factors are involved, like type of cancer, other meds, but I find if I get up and down all day, try to just walk helps. Also been using a warming blanket, on low. Weakness is also common for me. It is going to pass, just very \"taxing\" on our bodies. Also sitting on the couch relieves leg pain better than lying in bed. Maybe some of this will help.  Don't give up, all these things are working together to accomplish our healing.",

      "Content": "Hi Andrea 1959,   Had 4th/last Taxol last Tues, followed by Neulasta on Wed (those white cells really take a beating from the chemo). Been using Aleve (2) this time, unaspirin in between as needed, plus when it gets too hard to handle, 1/2 prescrip pain med at a time. Also helps to eat a little something w/the meds.  Unbelievable the different sensations.  The numbness/tingling has been better this time.  So glad it is the last Taxol.  Then start 16 radiation treatments. Not sure what that will bring, but they said there won't be the same affects as the chemo.  We can do this! The Lord is my Strength, and yours too. Just try some different things, and maybe even the accupuncture or massage. God Bless you during your healing process.",
