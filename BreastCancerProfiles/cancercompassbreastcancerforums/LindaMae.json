The list of posts will show you 'Primary Peritoneal Cancer'. You'll find some of the info you're looking for. One more thing ladies: I don't care how aloof or busy your docs are - tell them you have cancer & you're damned well not leaving until you get your questions answered!! This is YOUR LIFE!!",
