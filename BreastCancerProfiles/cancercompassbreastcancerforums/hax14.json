    "Content": "I\u2019m a 41 year old female and I had my first mammogram last Monday. I received a call the following day that it came back abnormal for my right breast and they wanted me to come back for more pictures and an ultrasound. My ultrasound findings are; \u201cAt the 10 o\u2019clock position there is a lobulated, Complex cystic mass measuring 9x6x6mm. This has no internal vascularity on color Doppler evaluation and has multiple internal septations and a thickened wall. Whether this accounts for the mammographic nodular density is uncertain. Ductal dilation is noted in subareolar region. Otherwise there is no discrete mass.\u201d My Birard score was 4A. I was referred to a general surgeon who did a FNB on Monday. He stated the fluid was clear and it seemed to have collapsed but wanted me to have a mammo immediately to see if still showed. It was still present on the side view of the mammo. I asked him if he was going to send my fluid in to be biopsied and he said it would only complicate things. He also asked if I had family history which I don\u2019t. He told me to come back in 3 months for another mammogram to see how it looked. Just curious if this sounds like the right path to follow. I thought core needle biopsys were best for complex cysts? Should I get a second opinion or wait the 9o daysLThanks so much",
