    "Content": "Hello,  I'm wondering if anyone can offer me some ideas on a gift for my mom. She will be having surgery (radical mastectomy) on Friday. I'd like to get her an extra special get-well gift. I was thinking of something that will help her through this time but I don't want it to be strictly about the cancer...I'm sure she thinks of it enough. Any ideas?  Steph ",
