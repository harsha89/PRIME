Any information would be helpful since the doctors around here have no experience of this type. I am going for a masectomy soon and I am very scared Hi, I was diagnosed with Adenoid Breast Cancer of the breast on July 05 and I had mastectomy and reconstructive surgery on sep. 05. I was diagnozed also on April 06 with MGUS blood disorder precurser to Multiple Myeloma I was the first for my Oncologist and surgen and nobody heard of ACC before so i started researching and I joined a group just for ACC and the more I knew the better I felt.  all I did is just mastectomy with reconstructive surgery no chemo and no radiation. this rare cancer comes with pain so I had pain for 3 years before they found out I have cancer... and it usually happens in the head and neck in the glands. and we have much better prognoses that it is in the breast because we can have clean margins and it does not come in the lymph nodes but you still you can have the surgon check it out.  it does have a recurrence but also you need to know that it is slow and what type of ACC it is. solid cribriform. make sure you have a copy of your pathology report and your tests.  I had every 3 months blood tests and chest scans or x-rays and lots of other tests which you can after your surgery tell me what your doctor recommended and I can tell  you more..my next app is on September 15th. my 6 months this time. in other words dont worry . relax which is hard and go for your surgery and take it from there ACC is slow growing ...try to read as much as you can about it and there is about 200-250 cases I believe for ACC in the breast..it is more rare in the breast...but you have to be wathed after on regular basis and have chest x-rays ..etc I live in California in the bay area.. write me back if you have any questions.   I am going through one more breast surgery on July 31 08I still have pain and my implant is deformed.. you will be very ok..dont worry and  all is ok. trust me I worried and nothing came out of it..:) if you type in the Yahoo search ACC or Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma you will have more info and better understanding than me trying to expalin to you...but I am talking from my experience..and what I hear and will tell you more when you tell me more about your story and surgery..and pathology report results.
