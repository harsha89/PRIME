      "Content": "I have metastatic breast cancer in each lung.  Since January I have been taking Xeloda, 7 days on (5 pills a day) and 7 days off.  One tumor is shrinking, the other is stable.  I am working with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Just wondering about side effects:  anyone experience chest pain--what I call three bean bags on my chest?  Not really painful, just annoying.  And primarily on the last days of my \"on\" week. Cheers to all you champions who have been on Xeloda for a long time.  You give me courage. Onward!           ",
