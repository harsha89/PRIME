      "Content": "Hi Breeze, Sorry for the long delay. It sounds like you still have some hope! As my Mother always tells me...Never, Never, Never, give up hope. In regards to green tea...Green Tea is good for you. Green Tea Catechins are the molecules in green tea that provide the health benefits. If you type Polyphenon into google, you will see a few links where Polyphenon is being studied as a preventative to certain cancers. Check it out. My Mom was diagnosed with CLL(a rare blood cancer) and I have been giving her Polyphenon 100 capsules. She did go to her doctor not too long ago and got a good review. Hopefully the Polyphenon capsules are providing some benefit. I hope this message reaches you well. Thank you for responding to my post. HOPE is a powerful thing! Wayne",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy, My name is Wayne. I have a B.Sc in Kinesiology with a minor in Nutrition. For the past 4 months I have been working with a company who manufacturers natural health products formulated with green tea catechins. I am sure you are aware of the benefits of green tea catechins and cancer patients. Polyphenon is produced by Mitsui Norin Co, Japan. About 25 years ago their lead scientist Dr. Yukihiko Hara was the first person in the world to successfully extract the catechin molecule from the green tea leaf. Polyphenon is the result of his efforts. Dr. Hara has been providing evidence that Polyphenon works both inside and outside of the human body and now the U.S. National Cancer Institute and many other Cancer Institutes around the world are using Polyphenon in their clinical studies and trials with the goal of developing preventives for cancer. Origin BioMedicinals is now offering people in North America this marvelous substance. We have take Polyphenon and put into a capsule. We call it Polyphenon 100. I hope that this message reaches you and that you help your friends, patients, and clients in gaining a better quality of life. Lots of love. Wayne",
