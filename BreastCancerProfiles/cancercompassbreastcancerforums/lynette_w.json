      "Content": "I had the cancer removed from my breast through 2 operations 1 year ago, also 18 lymph nodes removed, no cancer present in them. So even with that, there was quite a bit of scarring. Due to a backlog in New Zealand, I did not get my radiation treatment until 4 months later. My Radiation Oncologist decided to complete the brachytherapy radiation treatment and 23 rods in total were placed through my breast. Every thing appeared to be going ok, until 8 months after the treatment when scar tissue started to develop around all the operation and rod sites in my breast(up to a large egg size). You can imagine I got quite worried, thinking the cancer had come back. After many tests, which were all negative, they said I was ok. Has any one else experienced this? In the meantime I have been massaging the breast and have seen some reduction in the lumps.",

      "Content": "Jennifer, I have just been to the top private specilist in NZ, he said the same thing as your doctor. I have a feeling they are just waiting a seeing what develops. Massage has had some effect on my breast but not on the swelling under the breast. Today there is a deep throbbing comming from that area of my breast. I have done some physical work this am, weeding the garden, maybe that has caused some irritation. My breast is now one size larger than the good side.",

      "Content": "Hi Pat, you may find it is the time of the month, or an imbalance in your hormones. I have continued with my daily massages and just this last week I have found the main operation site is slightly larger. I am slowly going through the change of life, and I think with Tamoxifin my hormones get a bit mixed up at times.",

      "Content": "18 months after cancer, lymph node removal and 1 year after brachytherapy I have developed enlarged glands between the rib cage and breast. They are the size of fingers and at a right angle to the ribs. My surgeon is doing the \"wait and see\" at the moment. I am not happy. Any one else experienced this side effect?",

      "Content": "Libby, It is a bit difficult to email you directly as this notice board won't allow you, so here is my email address. wintersl@xtra.co.nz. I have continued with the massaging and I feel it is some thing I will have to continue with for the rest of my life, I have practically no swelling in my arm now and want to keep it that way. It's great how you mind can play games with you after you have gone through cancer treatment. When ever you notice a slight variation in the breast or other parts of your body you get paranoid.",
