    "Content": "I live in Colorado and use a product called Honey Oil that is 70%THC & 7% CBD (Cannibidiol). I also use a product by Dixie Botanicals called Dew Drops, which is a liquid CBD only. It can be bought on the internet because there are no psychoactive properties in it. Although I do not have any pain and am only trying to control cancer, (I have Stage IV breast), I know that any product with THC will give pain relief.Â  Good luck with finding something that works for you :)",
