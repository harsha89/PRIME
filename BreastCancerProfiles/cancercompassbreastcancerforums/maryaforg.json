      "Content": "Hi, have been on Paxil for some time and recently reading risk increased if taking Paxil. Mostly Canadian/European studies. Also reading Paxil recommended for hot flashes induced by Estrogen inhibitors like Aromasin. USA studies. ? an oncologist point of view or someone well versed. My oncologist hasn't mentioned yet, won't see until Aug. Also anyone experiencing difficulty sleeping on Aromasin? 2 yr. survivor breast cancer stage II. Thanks Mary Anne USA",

      "Content": "On 5/2/2008 Oncrx wrote: The problems I am aware of involve Paxil or other SSRI's and tamoxifen.  The problem appears to be that Paxil and SSRI's can prevent the liver from converting tamoxifen into its active form. If you were on tamoxifen then switching your antidepressant to Effexor appears to help and avoids the interaction.  I am not aware of any problem with Aromosin and Paxil. Thanks for reply and happy to know no interference in absorption. I have been on Paxil for a length of time and don't seem to do well without. Panic issues. Have tried a number of other antidepressants but didn't work as well. Just hope the Paxil isn't a carcinogen in and of itself. Take the lowest dose possible. Want to remain cancer free. Mary Anne",
