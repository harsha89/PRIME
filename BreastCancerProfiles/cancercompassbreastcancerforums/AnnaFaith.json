      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with stage 4 infiltrative ductile carcinoma Her2nu positive on Dec 11,2008 with mets to the liver, lungs, trach, and in the lymph nodes. I was a wreck. Did taxol and herceptin. liver and some others went away. non active. Then went on arimadex for awhile and my rib started hurting and swelled up, got an Xray and the cancer was in two of my ribs. Got radiation and showed on the pet scan the spot on my liver came back and a few others. They put me on chemo again. Navelbean and herceptin. I did not do well on Navelbean even though I looked up on sites that alot of people can handle navelbine well. I was in bed 4 out of the 7 days of the week. I was so sick. I had cold chills and sweat like crazy. I couldn't keep warm. I felt like I was dying. I told the doctor I wanted to be taken off of the Navelbine. I am now on herceptin still every 3 weeks which the doctor said I will be doing the rest of my life and tamoxifen. We are now seeking alternative treatments. My husband did alot of research on Cantron or Protocel. We changed our diets drastically. That is huge on getting rid of your cancer. Nutrition is very important. Read alot of Books beating cancer with Nutrition, Knockout by suzanne somers,Outsmart your cancer alternative non toxic treatments, A cancer Battle plan, Cure your Cancer your guide to the internet, etc. There is such a wealth of information in these books. I wish I would have read these before I did any chemo but time was not on my side and I was so afraid when I got my diagnosis that we did everything the doctor told us to. except I started changing my diet. I stopped sugar right away. Cancer feeds off of sugar. This was life and death so it wasn't hard for me to do that. We found out so many fruits and vegetables that fight cancer. I juice alot and we use alot of curry and tumeric in our foods. They are known to attack cancer cells. I take supplements. I lost about 30 pounds which was great. oh another book that is really good is Green for Life by Victoria Boutenko. We drink alot of green smoothies and we have so much energy and it is so good for you. Cancer was a wake up call for me. I want to live and I will cut out anything I have to, to do that. I also have alot of people praying for me.I will fight this and I have been told that God will heal me. If I can be of any help let me know. I can try and answer any questions I can.

      "Content": "Hi I have stage 4 breast cancer. Was diagnoised Dec. 11, 2008. Went through two different chemos. After learning alot about how nutrition effects cancer, changed my diet drastically. Also I am doing alternative medicine. Google cantron and read up about it. Since I have been on it I feel great. I cut all sugar out and eat alot of fruits and vegetables. Eat a little chicken. I take supplements. I wish I would have done this in the beginning of finding out I had cancer. There are a few books you should read.  Beating cancer with nutrition, Outsmart your cancer- non toxic treatments that work, Cure your cancer -your guide to the internet.  Hope this helps. Anna",
