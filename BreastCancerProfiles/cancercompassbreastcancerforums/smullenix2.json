His phone # is 626-376-3411 (in Los Angeles).  Too bad my husband didn't have the chance to meet him. God bless your husband & you.  Take care.     Thank you for your reply.  What do you know about the doctor you mentioned (Dr. David Lewandowski) does he deal with nutritional issues for cancer patients or something else?",
