    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with estogen postive bc in Feb 2006.  I had bi-lateral masectomy and 4 rounds of chemo. After taking Tamoxifen for two-years my oncologist suggested I take a blood test to see if my body was metabolizing the Tamoxifen, blood test indicated that it was not -  so my oncologist recommend I get my ovaries removed.  While on the Tamoxifen I had little to no side effects, maybe head-aches once in a while but very tolarable. I just had my surgery 2-weeks ago and recently started taking Aromasin because now I am consider post-menopasual.  I'm starting to get minor side effect, bone pain, head-aches, very minor night sweat.....but no hot-flashes.  I'll be able to deal with these side effect as long as they do not get worst.  Does anyone know if side-effect stay the same or get worst over time of taking the medicine?  Anynatural supplement suggestions to help reduce the side effects.  I'm taking Evening Primrose; and it seems to be helping...I think",
