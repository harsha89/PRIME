      "Content": "Hi Bonnie, I too was terrified I joked with the nurse that I must look like a deer in the headlights the first time I had chemo,  One thing that I did was have a port installed.  It's put in just under the skin on your chest that way you avoid having needles stuck in your veins all the time.  They can even draw blood from it.  I am SO GLAD I had it done.  Usually right  after treatment I felt fine because they give you steriods.  We usually went out to dinner afterward.  It was the next day it caught up with me.  The worst part was losing my hair.  I wear it short but still - MY HAIR - I think I whined about that most of all.  I choose to have my head shaved as soon as my hair started falling out, about 2 weeks after the first treatment. Another thing I did was start a blog, that way all the fears got out of my head onto paper.  I'd even make notes in there I wanted to ask my flotilla of doctors.  If you're interested it's www.winecat.typepad.com It's been since May 2006 and I'm still here and kicking!      ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed 2 1/2 years ago.  Very tiny (less than 1/4 inch) but very aggressive cancer, triple negative.  I went through chemo and radiation with the accompanying drama - hair loss, horrible side effects the whole works. I was fine for a while then all of a sudden about a year ago I realized I wasn't fine. It totally took me by surprise. I waited far to long to ask my doc about changing my depression meds and getting a therapist.  There was talk of hospitalization and I was put a suicide watch.  That was in August.  Things are better now but I'm scraping myself up off my therapist's office twice a week. I'm wondering if  anyone else has experienced this or was even told to expect that it would happen?",
