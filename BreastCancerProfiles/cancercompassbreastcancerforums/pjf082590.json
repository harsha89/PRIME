I had a bone scan which showed osteopenia. He started me on fosamax. I finished treatments for breast cancer in March. I went to my oncologist this week for blood workup. He wants me to return next week to recheck my blood because of the elevated calcium level. I have been looking on the internet today and it appears that there may be a link between hyperathyroidism and cancer. Has anyone else had the two conditions?   I too was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism 12 yrs ago when I was 34 yrs old. I had the radioactive iodine drink b/c the meds did not work. I actually read somewhere on the internet that there may be a link between  hyperthyroidism and brst cancer. I am not sure if it mentioned the radioactive drink though. Did you take that drink as well? Kathy  ",
