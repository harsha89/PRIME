    "Content": "Hello Ladies! I took tamoxifen for 2 years following surgery, chemo & radiation.  I suffered from horrible migraines throughout the entire treatment, so when the opportunity to switch to aromasin presented itself I was very excited.  It took about four months before I went from being a very fit and active 42 year old to resembling a 90 year old woman when I would get out of bed in the morning.  I would stumble all the way to the kitchen because my feet and ankles hurt so bad.  I was not able to take supplements like glucosamine due to a sulfa allergy.  I persevered, and finally found a solution that seems to be working for me.   I had repeatedly asked my Dr. to test my thyroid as a result of the symptoms, I had no idea that everyone one else was feeling the same way.  Always the test came back normal.  Finally I just asked to be put on a low dosage of synthroid.  The doctor agreed thinking it couldn't hurt to try, and after about five days the pain in my hands and feet started to subside.  I have two months till my five year celebration date, and another six months after until I will throw those meds to the curb, but at least I feel like I am 44, and I nolonger have to drag my ass everywhere I go.  I hit the gym daily which is what we all really should be doing, exersizing and living life!!! I don't know if this will be the solution for everyone's problem, but it couldn't hurt to mention it to your Dr. next visit........ Cheers Reen  ",
