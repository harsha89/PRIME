    "Content": "My oncologist told me to talk to his naturopath and she told me to get L-glutamine, available at any health food store. It really helped by post chemo neuropathy. He also said that my potassium was low and that really helped.   I took tamoxifin for 10 years with no side effects, arimidex for two years,  and femara for two with no side affects and am about to start aromasin.  I've also used faslodex (shot once a month) that acts as a blocker to estrogen uptake. I say this so that everyone out there thinks that these drugs cause problems for everyone. My neuropathy was due to chemo (Taxotere) combined with Avastin and is going away with the L-glutamine and potassium. Vitamin B!2 has really helped my mental state, alertness and my energy level. Good luck,  everyone! I first got my breast cancer 25 years ago, have had four metastatic recurrences in the past 15 years. So hang in there. You don't have to die from cancer if you just keep fighting. ",
