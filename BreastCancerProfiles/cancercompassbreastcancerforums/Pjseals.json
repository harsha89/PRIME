      "Content": "OK here goes, back at the beginning of January my 44 year olds sister was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. She also had a tumor in her neck (which came back as cancer) and it was removed. However, there is still a bit left in her neck, and it is now in her lower spine as well. AND IN BOTH BREASTS. My question is WHY will the oncologist NOT do a double mastectomy?? Would there be a reason why they would not remove both breasts? She has had 5 radiation sessions to the lower spine so far.....................but this coming Monday at 9 A.M. they will be inserting a chemo port into her chest.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am new to the website. The beginning of January my older sister (she is 43) was having extreme neck pain and had to go to the ER. Well, once she got there, they discovered that there was a tumor in the neck. They did surguery and removed the tumor (discovered that the tumor from the neck was cancerous) which prompted further testing. They discovered cancer in her right breast, and she also has 2 tumors on the lower spine. She has been having numbness, and difficult bladder control as well. Sooooo fast forward to today and she is starting 10 sessions of radiation to her lower spine (for the two tumors) My question is why have doctors not suggested to have the breast removed? Is it because it has spread beyond the breast? I have been researching and trying to learn everything I can about cancer. Also AFTER the 10 radiation treatments to her lower spine they are suppose to start administering her chemo. Of course I know they will not do all 10 sessions at once to the spine, but in the meantime isn't the cancer in the breast going to continue to spread? They will not do radiation and chemo at the same time? Also one last thing, when they removed the tumor from her neck a month ago,,,,,,,,,,,,after scans it was discovered that they did not get it all SOOOO therefore there is still a bit of cancer in her neck region is this bad? Give it to me straight as I am worried sick. I am 41 so only a couple of years behind her and I have NOT even had my first mammogram!",

      "Content": "Hello, when my sister was first diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer around beginning of Jan. we went to see her. This was during the time that she was in the hospital and docs were running tests . They had to give her a blood transfusion. Is there a reason why cancer patients would need a blood transfusion? Thanks :)",
