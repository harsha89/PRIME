I am praying your results were good and if not, that you are now recovering from surgery that removed everything bad.  I am a 14 year survivor of ER- breast cancer.  Like you, I had breast calcifications and a diagnosis of non-invasive DCIS.   My treatment was a  modified radical mastectomy with TRAM reconstruction and breast reduction surgery on the other side, all at the same time as I knew I would be too chicken to go back for reconstruction later.   Like you, I had no chemo or radiation.  I go for blood tests and followup checks every six months and once a year mammograms.  I have experienced no other problems with it so far but remain ever vigilant.  I will keep you in my prayers and hope to see an update on your situation soon. Karie Dear KarieB: Glad I checked in and saw your message. I appreciate your input. Have not yet had the surgery. The powers that be have made me wait 50 days. I'll come back with results when I finally get them. Our stories are so very similar. It lifts my spirits that you are doing so well after 14 years. I hope to follow your lead in this journey we're both on. Thank you so much for replying. It calms me down.",

The scariest part (for me at least) is that the cancer always seems to be lurking in the background - like a stalker. I was also ER-/PR-, but got chemo and bilateral mastectomy. PET scan showed BC clear, buy showed something in my digestive system. So, we'll get working on that next. Just wanted to let you know I'm thinking of you and hope the worries fade with each good checkup. Dear OKnow: Thank you for asking about me. I am scheduled for a needle loc excisional breast biopsy followed by the removal of the papilloma in one week. It seems that once I take a step forward that old cancer scare is right behind me. I am curious that you were able to get chemo and bilateral mastectomy. I was absolutely refused by two oncologists. Makes me wonder but not worry. Past worrying now. Please let me know how you are doing. I so very much appreciate your checking in. Still waiting. The waiting is always the hardest part.",

I still have a fair amount of pain especially after doing any activity that uses my upper body. I have always been a gardener but many of the activities like pulling weeds, hoeing, using the rototiller, etc. leave me in pain. Will I ever get to where I can do these things again? I am feeling pretty depressed about this. I am thinking that I made a mistake by getting reconstruction. Has anyone else had this problem? Do I just need to give it more time? Deborah Hi Deborah: I feel I only have a bit of information to share regarding your post reconstruction pain as I got a total mastectomy with reconstruction only 2 weeks ago. I am going through the expander/saline injections and have to say that it is a strange feeling at best. The worst part would be the \"pulling feeling\" and hardness of the feeling of your reconstructed breasts. Though it's only been 2 weeks for me, I have a feeling that you will be able to overcome your pain soon. I am also a gardener and have already mowed my front and back lawns, pulled weeds and planted flower and vegetable gardens. When I get that \"pulling\" feeling, I put an ice pack on my breast and it tends to make me feel much better. I truly don't believe that you made a mistake. In the long run, I believe you will be glad that you decided to get the expander/saline treatment. Please consult your doctor. There must be something that he/she can tell you. Trust them. And I send you my well wishes. You are most certainly not alone in this. Peggy  ",
