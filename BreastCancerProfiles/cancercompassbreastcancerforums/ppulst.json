      "Content": "It's so comforting to have found these messages and threads! I finished radiation 20 months ago for DCIS.  Two weeks ago, I started noticing that the ribs under the radiated breast were really sore.  After about 10 days of this, I started worrying that maybe the cancer had spread.  I went to the walk-in clinic to get the area x-rayed, but of course, regular x-rays don't show much.  I'm still concerned about the cancer spreading, but I also have hope that it's a side effect of the radiation.  On Monday, I'll have to call either my primary doc (which is what the walk-in doc recommended) or preferably my RO.  I never knew about the connection, and I thank all of you for sharing your experiences.",

      "Content": "After this happened, I went to my radiation oncologist (not my general oncologist, fyi). He did a complete check and convinced me that it was chest wall pain - sore muscles around the ribs. He didn't think it was related to radiation and told me it was important to bring down the inflammation: Advil, ice, or whatever natural remedy you might know about, such as turmeric. Have you done any research on natural ways to reduce inflammation? I know of people who use a turmeric/black pepper supplement for that.  I've also heard of a few foods that can help bring down inflammation, but I can't remember what they are right now. I wish you the best in getting relief. By the way, about a year after I dealt with that pain, it came back again, but was a shorter amount of time.",

I have not experienced it since then, so it could not have been related to my radiation treatments. However, I have had 2 bouts of rather intense chest-wall pain  since radiation, which was 4 years ago. Those bouts were approx. 2 years apart. I don't know whether or not it was related to the radiation, but I wouldn't doubt it. Take care, Everybody! ",
