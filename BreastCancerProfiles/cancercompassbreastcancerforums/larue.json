It seems from all I can read or tell that for estrogen positive cancer there is no limit to how long after treatment a recurrence can happen. I'm only 2 1/2 years out from my dx and I'm still cancer free, but it sounds like I will be on femara for the next 10 years and then something else.",

Stay informed, but try not to look too far into the future. All you can possibly do is take the next step. Our hearts go out ot you and your Mom. Hopefully this is a better diagnosis and she will feel more hopeful as the treatments progress. Take care of yourself....hugs and prayers!",

      "Content": "On Feb 05, 2013 6:56 AM DogmaWI wrote: With a projected cure rate of 92%, I would not hesitate to take the hormone therapy and surgery. I had chemo. A modified radical mastectomy with auxiliary node dissection (23 lymph nodes removed) and radiation. I am now on the hormone therapy, Tamoxifen. My cancer was HER2 positive, and I get Herceptin infusions every three weeks for a year. My cure rate was only about forty percent, but my body responded to the chemo and the cancer was completely gone from my tumors in my breast and lymph nodes when I had surgery. The chemo and radiation were the worst part of treatment. The surgery and hormone treatments aren't nearly as bad. You have a better chance of cure than most of us, and you don't even have to have the most difficult treatments! Why would you NOT go the conventional route? Losing a breast is not the end of the world! It is better than risking death by refusing to take a course of treatment with a 92% projected rate of success!I agree with DogmaWi. I have been on Femara for 2 1/2 years and I had a mastectomy, left breast. As i said in another discussion...I feel better much of the time now than I did before the cancer. My doctor insisted on a strict exercise regimen and I ddropped almost all sugar from my diet...and I make green smoothies in the mornings and eat much better than I did before cancer. I take fish oil supplements and vitamins. I have had some joint pain, but it doesn't last long. I have another friend who has been on Femara and she has minimal side effects. Remember most of us who aren't having problems on Femara or other hormone inhibitors don't post too often on these boards because we aren't having bad side effects. We need a thread of women on these treatments that are doing good with them to balance it out. I am thankful to God for my health and being cancer free every day. I'm 69 years old and enjoying my life. I wish you much success with your treatment whatever you decide.",

At times I had problems raising my arms above my head, etc. BUT my doctor told me to take fish oil. (rather large dose) and exercise. I engaged a personal trainer for weight training and I exercise 4 or 5 times a week on my eliptical. The pain is minimal at this point. I work hard to keep moving my joints regularly and that seems to help. Also starting yoga classes. This side effects are uncomfortable, but I believe bearable if we stay on a good diet and keep moving!",
