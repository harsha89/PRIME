I am 47 years old and hope to live at least 10 more years if not more. Yes at this point they just treat us we can live for a very long time. If one treatment stops working we move on to the next.  I feel fine work full time, you would never know I am stage 4. Best of luck to you both. There is a very good web site called BreastCancer.org it has section that is just for Stage 4 breast cancer and will be informative for you to post questions and also to see that your mother inlaw is not alone in this battle.",

It seems like it was just yesterday I was posting on this site looking for help, you gave me so much support. I had no option for surgery due to it was stage IV, just hormone therapy. I thought this is it, how could hormone therapy work. I have been on Tamoxofin and monthly Zoladex injections,  I was just hoping for no progression, but this, this is awesome.

      "Content": "I did ask my oncologist about Green tea she said that it is ok to use, if you search on line you will see that green tea increases tomaxofin benefits. See below: Epidemiologic data have suggested that green tea may prevent breast cancer. Studies in our laboratory have provided evidence that green tea extract inhibits breast cancer growth by a direct anti-proliferative effect on the tumor cells, as well as by indirect suppressive effects on the tumor-associated endothelial cells. In this study, we asked whether concurrent administration of green tea may add to the anti-tumor effects of standard breast cancer therapy. We observed that green tea increased the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the proliferation of the ER (estrogen receptor)-positive MCF-7, ZR75, T47D human breast cancer cells in vitro. This combination regimen was also more potent than either agent alone at increasing cell apoptosis. In animal experiments, mice treated with both green tea and tamoxifen had the smallest MCF-7 xenograft tumor size, and the highest levels of apoptosis in tumor tissue, as compared with either agent administered alone. Moreover, the suppression of angiogenesis in vivo correlated with larger areas of necrosis and lower tumor blood vessel density in treated xenografts. Green tea decreased levels of ER-alpha in tumors both in vitro and in vivo. We also observed that green tea blocked ER-dependent transcription, as well as estradiol-induced phosphorylation and nuclear localization of mitogen-activated protein kinase. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show the interaction of green tea with the ER pathway, as well as provide mechanistic evidence that the combination of green tea and tamoxifen is more potent than either agent alone in suppressing breast cancer growth. These results may lead to future improvements in breast cancer treatment and prevention.",

My mamagram came out ok but my CAT scan showed suspicion in my breast along with 6-8 places in my spine, ribs, pelvic, etc. I have been reading a lot I want to start on treatment. I have been suffering with my broken bone in my back for 5 months and feel a lot of pain in the places the CAT scan showed disease. Should I start taking Immunopower, Ultramet, Polymvul or is there soething better. I think the doctors will give me a gloomy outlook but I want to start fighting back right now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Hi, Have you been given your diagnosis yet?  Your case sounds very similar to mine, depending on what type of cancer you actually have.  You can click on my profile to read about mine, but the bottom line for me is that having Stage IV LOBULAR breast cancer (which was determined by a biopsy to a couple of my vertibrae) is not such a bad thing, so don't panic.  I was diagnosed in July & thought I wouldn't have much time so I gave away a lot of things that I wish I had kept since I really feel just like I did before I knew I had cancer.... some aches & pains, but mostly just fine.  I have no symptoms at all & have been told I can \"live for years\" with this disease & that seems to be the way Stage IV lobular breast cancer works because I've heard from others who are the same. If your diagnosis is the same, I can go into more detail as far as treatment goes.  I'll be hoping for the best for you.  Write me....... Toni I also have breast cancer that spread to my liver and bone. I have not started treatment yet I have a vist with the Oncologist onThursday of this week. They are looking into hormone therapy. The crazy thing is I feel fine. Your case sounds similar to me, what treatment have you had?",
