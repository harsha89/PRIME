    "Content": "I have breast cancer and after mastectomy last october 21, 2012, I cannot move my right arm. I feel so frustrated because I cannot use my right arm. My doctor said to give it time, because during surgery, nerves are cut and so I have to wait and be patient for the nerves to regenerate. I just want to asked how will I wait??? Please share your experiences. Thanks a lot.",
