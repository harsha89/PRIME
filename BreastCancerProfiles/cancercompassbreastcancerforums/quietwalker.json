    "Content": "I have been on Armideix for ten years. In 1996 I was diagnosied with stage 2 breast cancer with 4 lymph nodes involved. I underwent a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. In 2001 the cancer came back in the same place and was surgically removed and I underwent radiation. I was placed on Armideix in 1999. I had no side effects until a month ago I began experiencing severe pain only at night in my upper left leg. When I get up from bed and walk around a little the pain goes away. A month ago I fell but the pain went away after a day and I did not seek medical attention. Now I am wondering if that caused the pain I am experiencing now or is it the Armideix or has the cancer spread to my bones. I have lost no weight and other than the pain in my upper left leg I feel fine. But the thought of cancer is always with me. My doctor has ordered a complete bone scan to make sure the cancer has not spread. But I thought the Armideix was suppose to prevent the cancer from spreading?Â ",
