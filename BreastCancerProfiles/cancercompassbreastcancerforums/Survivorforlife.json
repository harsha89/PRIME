      "Content": "Hello I'm a. Breast cancer survivor as well and from my experiences your hair never grows back the way it was due to the fact our bodies have been through so much. The med given to save our lives is very powerful. As a woman I truly understand your feelings. Be patient and massage your head as often as possible and it may regenerate the hair follicles. Wigs aren't bad option they are why most actresses use them so often. Play around with them you may find one that really works. Thanking God for life.",

      "Content": "i am a three time breast cancer survivor and my experience with the faculty in Chicago was excellent. Although they felt my doctor here in Florida was on point it was a nice experience to know that there are people out there who really care. They take excellent care of their patients. I'm in stage four and I'm going back to Chicago in about two weeks for evaluation. Having good positive people around and having faith is some of the keys to survival.",
