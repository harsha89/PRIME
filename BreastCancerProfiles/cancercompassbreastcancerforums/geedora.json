    "Content": "I was diagnosed with cancer in 2007. It is now 2013 and I'm still experiencing mastectomy pain I have tried every treatment known to mankind including narcotics. I was placed on Lidoderm patches and just recently my doctor at the pain management center place me on neurontin. Neurontin does make the pain go away, but it does come back. Lidoderm also takes away the stabbing pain but it does come back Currently I am persuing the use of cryotherapy. Does anyone out there has info on this treatment and where it can be found. I am desperate, and my doctor is willing to freeze those nerve if we can find the equipment. Please email me at",
