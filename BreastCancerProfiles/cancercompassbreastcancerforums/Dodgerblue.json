    "Content": "Hey,    Just my 2 cents, but I would follow through with any recommended conventional treatments.  I totally agree that alternative treatment/lifestyle changes are key to long term survivorship.  Whether your chances of recurrance are 7% or 99%, you might be on the wrong side of that number!  I'm currently on monthly chemo, I don't particularly like poisioning myself every month, but if it means it might keep the monster at bay I'll take it as long as I can manage side effects, which I have very well so far.  Best of luck with your health decisions.
