    "Content": "Hi. My stpemother has breast cancer, and she had one of her breasts removed. It went to her liver and now today I was told it has went to her spine. She is going to be going for radiation and we are hoping it will work. I do not know what level the cancer in her spine is but she has trouble walking and is in pain. I am sorry about your mom and I will say a prayer for her and hope for her to feel better. Tara from New York",
