      "Content": "Hi Carol I know you feel really uncomfortable with the radiation treatment. I would much prefer radiation than losing my breast. Funny when I was in my twenties I believed that breast cancer could be the worse thing to happen to me as I dont think I could cope with losing a breast. Now I am grateful that treatment now allows some of us cancer patients to keep our breasts I am gong to find the Indol 3 you were taking I have been off the tamoxifen for a week the hot flashes are still happening though not as strong I believe the tamoxifen has pushed me permently into the change obviously I was on the border as I have never had the hot flashes until I started treatment.as yoy can see I had trouble logging on again now molly4 lots of luck have a good weekend",
