So From what i am reading, different formulation of the medication doesn't matter, the side effects will be the same. Is there any one med that is less intense?",

I was taken of the med and on weds i am going to talk to my doc about other medications available. After reading all that you are going thru.. i am scared ---less!!! My kids are still very young and I would like to enjoy spending time with them like hiking, swimming and even running the marathon. But if I take these drugs i may be just sitting on the sidelines in a chair and living a fruitful life.. any suggestions??",
