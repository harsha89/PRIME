This one thing I may have control over \"change\" I am responsible for the steps I take now. I would appreciate any further advice you may have. I applaude you accomplishments. No one else but someone who has gone thourgh cancer understands. Not even the greatest friends. Thank you.",

      "Content": "How do I start the change. I have been 2 years cancer free. I still dont know where to start the change of the way I live. I just know I need to like, yesterday!Â  Do I throw out all the food I have now? Do I change where I live? Vegatables are suppose to be good for you, How do I get my 16 year old and 5 year old boys to give up the things they like to eat or do I? Sugar! Bad! I like sweet things. I know it is bad. My house I cant seem to catchup with everything. Life just has not slowed down. I am getting sick more easliy and before cancer or chemo I didnt. Not hardly a cold or cough much less the pink eye I just got. It is making me feel depressed. Can you shed some light on what to do? Thank You",

      "Content": "Thank you for your advice. Everyone that I know that may know of the fact that sugar fuels the cancer tells me cut the sugar. It is hard. I saw the Stevia in Wal mart and now I cant find it but I will be requesting it. I work there in my town store #4238. Well as for the flaxseed I am trying to remember to take the flaxseed oil capsules. I havent tried the seeds. Also I ve heard cutting the meat. I am trying to switch over to the chicken without the antibiotics. Kind of expensive! That is why so many of us are in the road we are in.(cancer) All the things that are done to the food. Any other advice you can give me helps. Visit me at myspace mariposatere is my username. Thank you again.",
