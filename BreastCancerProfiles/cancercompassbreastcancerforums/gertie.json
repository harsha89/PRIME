      "Content": "Before I was diagnosed, I had pain and a burning sensation around my nipple.  I have a fairly large tumor now, but, it started out small only two months ago.  In the beginning, any pressure applied to the breast was painful and stinging.  Up until I was diagnosed, we still had hope that it was a cyst.  Keep up the hope that you may not have Breast Cancer!",
