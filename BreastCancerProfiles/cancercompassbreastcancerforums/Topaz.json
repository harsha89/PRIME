      "Content": "I really need advice from people who know. In December I went for my annual and mammogram (I am 42). I was called back for further tests on both my breasts in January. The xray showed five masses in one breast and 4 in the other. After 8 series of xrays and a two hour ultrasound on my breasts the doc tells me that the masses are \"probably benign\" and I need to have the mammography again in six months and if there are changes in the breast tissue then I will have to have a biopsy. The hesitation for a biopsy, as I understand it, is that my past records of mammograms could not be found (prior military and lost during transition)to compare the recent series to. I told the doc that I have never been recalled nor have any masses ever been identified. I have had a dark green discharge from both breasts for ten years. Previous docs were unable to find the cause. Recently, I have experienced a weird kind of pain in the breast with five masses and it even hurts in my ribs. Sometimes, It feels like someone has poured hot water inside my breasts that I have always attributed to the green discharge. I feel like the doc did a thorough exam but still don't feel comfortable with waiting for a biopsy. My first cousin just died of breast cancer a few months ago. Additionally, one of my co-workers was told the same thing ten years ago about a mass in her breast and she insisted on a biopsy and cancer was discovered behind the benign mass. She lost her breast, but it was caught early and she is doing great. I don't know what to do. I don't want to seem paranoid, but both my mother and father have survived different types of cancers. My coworker says to force them to do a biopsy. How do you force a doc to do a test they do not see necessary at this time. What do you think? Should I follow the doc six month wait or force the biopsy. Worried in Virginia, Topaz",

      "Content": "Thank you both so much for your input. I intend to go to my doctor and try to get the biopsy scheduled. You both are right, I need to follow my gut on this. I have to be honest, I have not slept well since I saw those masses on my xray. I have an uneasy feeling about it. Hearing from you gives me a calm and steadiness I know I have to have to go in the right direction. Your voice is so encouraging! Please don't stop talking to people and easing their fears. Thanks so much, Leisha",
