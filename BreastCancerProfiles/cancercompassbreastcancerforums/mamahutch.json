    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer ILC and IDC 10/08, had unliateral mastectomy, nodes neg., completed reconstruction July/09. I had chemo Jan - dec 2009 and finished herceptin Dec, 09. ER+/PR+/her2+++ I have had back numbess for 3 months. Bone scan clear by mri shows prominant hemangiomas and what they call bright lesions. Has anyone else ever had these and can they be a sign up something more serious like mets to the spine?  It is the weekend and I have been unable to speak to my oncologist. Thanks! mamahutch",
