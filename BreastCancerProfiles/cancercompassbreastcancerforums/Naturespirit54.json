But now I am back online thank goodness so I will do my best to answer your questions. I personally have been battling cancer off and on for several years. When I follow my diet and keep the stress down to a minimum, it doesn't bother me. But for the last two years I have had a job I didn't like so my stress levels have been up there. I'm happy to say that I have quit the job and am doing much better. Actually I am just preparing to start another period of heavy treatment. I will be doing Dr. Johanna Budwig's mixture with lots of raw veggies along with the cesium chloride protocol to kill whatever is happening in there. Those two are my main weapons along with alot of walking, deep breathing, sleeping, and just in general being really grateful for every beautiful day that I am able to stop and smell the roses!!

      "Content": "Dear Belinda,      As I read your message, your courage sent chills down my back! Taking a road different than the mainstream is like bucking City Hall...not an easy choice for the faint-at-heart, but very worthwhile considering your chances for actual quality of life are soooooo much better!! I have been studying alternative healthcare ever since my children were born because I didn't figure loving them included giving them drugs...ever for any reason! So started my interest in wholistic health. That was 31 years ago, but in the last 10 years my study has centered around cancer because I seem to be quite prone to suffer from it off and on. I consider it to be an old friend. I am grateful for how it makes me shape up my life. And, I am very grateful to possess such a large and effective bag of tricks with which to battle it--all natural, all w/o the intervention of the BIG 3--medical, insurance, or pharmaceutical. I think the more a sick person seeking treatment has to do with any of these 3, the more that person can count on being taken for a ride that will benefit no one except one or all of those 3. I certainly don't believe that any of these I,M, or P (Insurance, Medical, or Pharmaceutical) companies are interested in anything but the bottom line($$$). There certainly may be individuals working for these companies that are compassionate, kind, loving, and caring, but that doesn't diminish the fact that mammograms are encouraged dispite the fact that they involve radiation and cause breast cancer; that there will NEVER be a cure for cancer found by the allopathic establishment (dispite the fact that many alternative cures had been discovered years ago and totally suppressed) because cancer is such a huge money-maker; and that The Susan J. Komen Foundation is a prime example of our healthcare system gone awry in the name of pure unadulterated greed at the cost of millions of women who have blindly sacrificed themselves in the false hope that a cure is right around the corner if they can only raise enough $$$'s to fund it! Anyway, keep up the questioning Belinda, and meanwhile make sure that you check out the cancertutor.com site; also, curezone.com is another good site. You're in my thoughts. Take care and please keep in touch, Linda                                                                                                 On 2/25/2007 Belinda04 wrote: Linda-- I could have written your post! I am 44, was diagnosed right before Christmas with b/c, had a lumpectomy/sentinel node map-biopsy on Jan 16. The surgical margins were great, the cancer had not spread to the nodes; the er/pr were both positive. However, the first visit to the onco she starts talking about chemo and I'm like, \"uh, I don't think so.\" So we decide to have not only a PET scan (oh yeah, injected with radioactive glucose--this is when I start thinking WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I *DOING*!) but oncogene testing as well. The oncogene test comes back with VERY low likelihood of recurrence and the PET scan (according to the lab) showed nothing unusual, although \"inconclusive\" due to a gray area (not hot spot) in the lymph area. So we're going over these results and I'm thinking, \"hey, this is great!\" but then she starts on the chemo conversation again. After much conversation, it boils down to that she thinks the lymph area has cancer and that chemo will cure it. I said, uh, wouldn't it be easier to actually surgically remove that node you (but no one else) are questioning and see for SURE what we're dealing with? She actually said \"Surgery is a very radical move.\" I actually said, \"And chemo's not?\" Then I start thinking, hmmm, perhaps I look like a Mercedes? On to the next subject of diet (under the assumption that a second opinion indicates chemo the best solution) and she said \"I don't recommend my chemo patients make any lifestyle changes at this point because chemo is enough of a lifestyle change.\" Uh, yeah, that's right, and I'm asking this question because I believe that there are certain things one can do through nutrition to maybe mitigate some of the lovely effects of chemo. So, I'm getting a second opinion, but at this point I'm thinking just to skip all the \"treatment.\" As I've done more research, it sounds like all of it is going to kill you in one way or another. Can't wait to check out the site you recommended! Blessings -- Belinda  ",

      "Content": "breast cancer, with the right diet and lifestyle can be healed in 48 hours with 3 substances.....soy, green tea, and the herb tumeric (which itself stops cancer 12 different ways).......Yes, I know that this will not make the MEDICAL/INSURANCE/PHAMACEUTICAL TRIANGLE any money, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. It does. I've used it myself with great success. This is together with the appropriate diet, etc. of course. What these 3 substances do to the cancer is very akin to what chemotherapy does only in a non toxic fashion. They attack the cancer at different stages and stop it. And do you know why both orthodox and alternative treatments for cancer must be administered in a very controlled fashion? Orthodox cancer treatments such as chemo and radiation kill so many healthy cells where as alternative treatments such as those mentioned above kill so many cancer cells! One is killing the cancer and the other is killing the patient!! Is it any wonder why I will always opt for alternative treatments that give me a much better chance at not only surviving my cancer but actually healing myself. This is something the TRIANGLE mentioned above can never accomplish because they are employing toxic substances which are foreign to the human body! Is it the way that they try to scare the begebbies out of you that keeps you from trying a new treatment mindset that will not only give you a fighting chance at actually healing yourself but may also give you some quality? Think about it and write me if you have questions or just want to talk. Meanwhile go to cancertutor.com and learn.....blessings, Linda",
