    "Content": "Hello. Was browsing and came across your message. I can see it was posted almost 3 months ago so i don't know if you're still visiting this site. My mom passed away last year at age 63. She also had carcinomateous meningitis and was treated with intrathecal chemotherapy of methotrexate, but it had very little benefit. She lost use of her legs very quickly and soon she couldn't swallow. This is a brutal and terrible disease and there is no cure. My mum died 2.5 months after diagnosis. Make the most of the time you can spend with your mum, and be there for her. Peace & Hope.",
