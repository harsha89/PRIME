I had inflammatory breast cancer dx nov 2007,chemo mastectomy all lymph nodes removed 10 out of 16 positive after surgery had radiotherapy,tamoxifen for 4 years and goserilin implants for past 18 months finished r/t for spinal mets 6 weeks ago which suddenly became very painful having had them for a year with no symptoms at all. Hence my reluctance to start yet another drug sometimes feel the treatments worse than the disease",

Had apt with palliative care team tues assured by oncologist this is strictly for pain control NOT because as i put it to him gonna be in a box in 6 to 12 months! They have suggested eithe a tens machine,nerve pain drug(neither i nor my gp think its nerve pain) or horror of horrors morphine based pain control this feels like a huge deal to me and another step towards grim reaper,people who never get ill don t know how lucky they are and only those of us on this hidious journey can know how mentally and emotionaly hard it is to deal with. Don t think ive every felt so indecisive or scared in my life,hate it",
