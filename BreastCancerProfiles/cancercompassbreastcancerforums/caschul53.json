      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Grade 2, ER+ PR+ Her2- invasive ductal carcinoma in December 2013.  Following chemo and radiaton therapy, I was prescribed Arimidex/Anastrozole for 5 years (possibly 10) taking 1 mg tablet/day.  I began this regimen in November 2014 and approximately 5 months later, I developed a very nagging, achy pain in my left gluteal (butt) and near my left hip for no reason.  I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time every night without having to get up and do yoga in the middle of the night (to stretch out the hip area)in order to sleep for the next 2 hours. I am a firm believer in exploring natural remedies for non-traumatic medical issues and so, over the next 2 years, I persued help and resolution to this pain that came on, which I thought for an unknown reason.  I got many different diagnoses & little help from a physical therapist, acupuncturist, massage therapist, chiropractor, Rolfer, Reiki Master but none of these therapies gave me lasting relief.  Finally, I thought about what my oncologist would ask me at my every 6 month visits.  He'd ask how I was doing with the Arimidex and if I was having any bone or joint pain.  I'd respond that no, just the \"normal\" pain from staying active.  Then it dawned on me that the Arimidex was the root cause of this pain!  I decided in July 2017 to call the oncologist and say I wanted to get off the Arimidex.  He said fine, try it for 2 weeks and we'll check in on you after that time.  His office didn't contact me again for almost 6 weeks and by then I'd decided I didn't want to take it anymore at all, which is the patient's ultimate choice!  The oncologist's office (nurse) said fine.  The chiropractor I had been seeing at that time mentioned something about the \"half-life\" of medications, that is, how long the medication stays in your body.  As it turns out, 10 months later, I was pain free!  Recently, I made a rough calculation of the half-life of the arimidex over the time I'd been taking it to the time the pain was gone.  The number of days matched the time I had been takng the Arimdex!  After too long going along with this all-consuming pain, spending so much time trying to figure out what its cause was and spending too much money on therapies, I'd gotten rid of it by putting together what the oncologist was asking and what I'd been experiencing.  When I met with the oncologist for the last time in February 2018, he was happy that the pain was dissipating and he said that being on it for the 2-1/2 years was helpful in itself.  He'd also told me that 5 years to be on the Arimidex was an arbitrary number.  That the length of time doctors felt you should be on it could change at any time!  I hope this help you to decide what to do to relieve your discomfort!",

      "Content": "The reason they don't tell you what to expect is that most times, they don't know themselves what any side effects are!  I'm glad you had the guts to challenge your oncologist and others!  It has been very different for me NOT having any constant pain in my hip/glute area after being all consumed by its presence for 2 years.  Slowly, I'm getting used to not thinking twice about long walks or not being able to sleep all night!  It's been wonderful.  Continue to enjoy good health.  ",
