    "Content": "Hi I've been on Arimidex for four months. I was diagnosed with Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma.  I've had alot of skeletal pain and suffer from \"arthritic like,\" conditions. Most of my joint pain is in my knees, and now my elbows and currently my ankles.  I am doing some acupuncuture which has helped with my knees and anxiety.  I'm starting to question mental clarity considering that I'm a teacher's aid and I am having a hard time helping out with math. I'm not great with math but I do know my times table and I've noticed it's been confusing at times. My bones crack and ping alot and I've got alot of fatigue. I'm sticking with it though. I want to stay around for as long as I can.",
