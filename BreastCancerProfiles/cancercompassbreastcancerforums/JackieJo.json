Waiting for test results is one of the hardest and most stressful things to have to do but remember that cancer is not a death sentence. Most cancers are highly curable. Have they staged your cancer yet? Please know that I am holding you close to my heart and in my prayers.  Love, hugs and continuing prayers JackieJo",
