      "Content": "Dear Jodie, Hope you are doing okay. Thanks for the reply. My onocologist did order more CT scans. She thought that she felt something in my neck and I had a CT scan of my neck, check, and abdomen.  The results showed no DEFINITE metastasis. The neck was clear and the liver showed some type of cyst,but the nodules in the neck were too small to characterize at this time. She says this is good news for now.  I will have them repeated in 6 mos. So, it is still a waiting game.    ",

      "Content": "I was originally diagnosed with stage 2B, ER+, Her2Nue + breast cancer less than 2 yrs. ago. I had chemo(Adriamycin and Cytoxin and then Taxol, following by Herceptin for a year. I also had radiation for 6 weeks. I am on Arimidex at this time. I had a CT scan done last week for reasons not pertaining to my cancer (it was actually a coronary artery calcium screening) due to my now having high cholesterol. Anyway, during the CT scan some non-calcified nodules showed up on my lung, along with a small lesion on the liver.  These are small and my internist suggested to me to wait 4 mos and have another CT scan. The lesions were less than 4mm. Just wondering if anyone else has had anything like this show up. I can't help but worry that this is a metastasis and don't know if I should push the issue of further test at this time or if it is safe to wait and see if they are growing?  ",

Lots of bone and joint pain, depression, not sleeping at night, etc. Is this going to continue to get worse?  I have no energy, feel like I am 80 years old. I go to work and all I can think about is getting home and going to bed. Do any of you have tingling and numbness in your arms or legs.  This only happens when I am lying down and it is hard to sleep.  Called my doctor and asked about this and was told that it could not be a side effect of Arimidex, but it makes me wonder.",

My doctor told me that before Herceptin that I would have had a bad prognosis, but the Herceptin stops reoccurance in about 50% of pts. I am doing well now and hope that everything turns out well for you. Keep you spirits up (I know it can be hard).",

What type of chemo are they talking about putting you on.  I had Adriamycin and Cytoxin every three weeks for 4 cycles and then Taxol every week for twelve weeks. The Adriamycin and Cytoxin were harder on me than the Taxol. I did lose all of my hair, including my eyelashes and eyebrows, but they do come back. The medicines that they make for the nausea are very good now. You will feel very tired, but your energy will eventually return. Like I said before. I feel good these days except for some muscle and bone pain that is brought on by the Arimidex that I now take for 5 years. But, this is manageable and if I have to do all of this again I would. I had a port put in for my chemo infusions and this was helpful. If you have any questions about what you are going through or just need someone to vent to feel free to write me here or email me directly. Stay positive and everything will work out.",
