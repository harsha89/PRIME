    "Content": "I had a deep tissue breast abscess (non-lactating 49 yr old) surgeon tried to aspirate, couldn't complete the aspiration (too deep) but was able to aspirate some blood.  Saw a surgeon 2 days later and her words were \"not breast cancer\" ok I am fine with that, I asked about breast abscess and her response was I was unlucky.  She put me on augmentin for 2 weeks.  I was her 9 days later, again she said \"no breast cancer\" and will see me in 6 months.  I received a letter in the mail dated the day before I saw her from radiology stating breast image shows an area that is probably benign,and upon examination will warrant a biopsy. I am also to be seen again in 4 weeks.   OK , are you confused yet because I am.  I called my primary and she explained that an addendum was added to the original radiology report that a breast lesion was obstructed by the deep tissue breast abscess.  She also told me it is not to deep, I asked her if I should worry about B Cancer and she told me she honestly can't answer.  I guess my confusion comes from the surgeon who told me I didn't have Breast Cancer without a biopsy being done. I have discoloration of my breast in an irregular shape, I have thickness and dimpling.  So annoyed right now",
