      "Content": "Hi, I am assuming that by progressing you mean that her disease is advancing?  I know how heart breaking that must be for you and your family.  I would like suggest some things that after much reading and researching that we have been using in my care.  I cannot say whether they will specifically help your mother, but many people have used them with favorable results.  Unfortunately, we are each unique in our makeup and so what works for one will not necessarily work for another.  That is why medicine is as much an art as a science.  !.  She must boost her immune system as it is the body's main way of destroying the abnormal cells that are produced in our body everyday.  That is how we keep from getting a cancer mass, our immune system destroys the abnormal cell before it multiplies.  When we get cancer it is often because our body/immune system was not able to destroy the cells faster than they were multiplying. Medicinal mushroom supplements are a great place to start. Shop around as the prices vary a lot from site to site.  2.  Exercise daily if at all possible, even if it is just walking around the bed with a walker.  Outside exercise is best. Sunlight will cause the skin to produce Vitamin D, a critical element in the fight against cancer.  (No sunscreen for at least 15 minutes each day as sunscreen blocks the ability of the body to make Vitamin D from the sun's rays.) 3. Sleeping in total darkness, at least 8 hours a night, so the body can produce melatonin.  Melatonin is a critical hormone which the body uses to fight cancer.  You can take supplements also.  Doses up to 40 mg have been recommended by some natural health practitioners.  Also  using a sleep mask will help block out all the light in our modern environment. 4. Eat NO refined carbohydrates such as sugar, white flour, white pasta, cake, etc, etc.  Whole grain products must be used in moderation, fresh vegetables or lightly cooked vegetables are the best.  Fresh fruit in moderation.  Avoid fruit juice as they are so high in fructose which the body converts quickly to glucose.  Cancer cells have to have glucose to survive and all the highly refined foods mentioned above release glucose into the body in large amounts, very quickly which gives a real boost to the cancer cells.  Read more about it on the net, there are many sources. 5. Deal with any emotional stress or trauma from the past or present.  This is critical.  If you are a believer in a higher power, prayer is essential.  If you don't believe, check into it more as you may find truth there that you didn't recognize before. 6.  Start taking supplements to restore and build up your body's reserves.  No matter whether you are going the conventional route, conventional plus alternative, or  just alternative methods, your body needs to be strengthened for the fight.  There are many excellent sites out there on alternative or adjunctive treatments.  LifeExtention.com has a great section of breast cancer covering breast physiology, diagnosis, conventional and alternative treatments.  But there are others as well.  7. Start taking some fish oil, Cod Liver Oil is one of the best - it now comes in flavored types so it doesn't taste bad.  Don't get the deodorized as in the process of taking the odor out they take out many of the good properties.  Be sure and get one that certifies that there are not contaminants like mercury.  Norwegian source is best, but brand is not critical, in my opinion.  I always shop around for whatever is most affordable.  I was a total vegetarian, ate nothing that was produced by anything that had a \"face or a mother\" but finally realized from all my research that I had to start taking the Cod Liver Oil.  I had had to take it as a child because I had Rickets (lived in the forest in the mountains and did not get enough sunlight to make Vitamin D so my bones were weak and I was extremely bowlegged!).  I had the bad memory of the taste.  But this new stuff doesn't take bad although it still feels like Cod Liver Oil going down.  If you can take pills and have the money, you can buy it in soft-gels.  I gag with pills, so the oil is best for me and it fits my budget (Social Security) better. 8. Learn to enjoy life in the here and now.  None of us knows if we will be here tomorrow.  There are many ways that we can die, cancer is just one of them.  Live, Laugh, Love.  Laughter truly does do good like a medicine as stated in Proverbs. Well, there are many other things I could say, but I think I had certainly said enough for now.  Do not despair!.  There are many choices and you and your Mom can make that do not require a prescription.  DO NOT DEPEND ON THE DOCTORS!  We each have to take responsibility for our own health, so encourage your Mom to take responsibility for her health. Many people who have been given up on by their docs have gone on to improve or even recover.  (I was a family doctor myself before being disabled by a car accident, so believe me, I know that doctor's are just humans like the rest of us and none of us humans are infallible.)  Consider your choices after much research and then go forward in faith, enjoying each day as it comes.  God bless you and your family.  You and your Mom will be in my prayers.

      "Content": "Hi: I have a breast mass and have chosen not to have conventional treatment.  I am using a large number of supplements that boost the immune system and others that help destroy cancer/abnormal cells.  I have spent hundreds of hours on the net researching, but there is a large body of information available at LifeExtention.com.  They have a really good article on breast cancer and both the conventional and alternative treatments.  The only areas they didn't seem to cover well was the area of immune stimulation.  Using alternative treatments with conventional is possible and a lot of people do it.  It usually improves the outcome, especially if you are using the ones that boost the immune system as the chemo and radiation destroy the immune system as it is full of quickly dividing cells which is what the chemo and radiation are targeting since cancer cells are in that category. For immune stimulation, check out the medicinal mushroom supplements.  Shop around because there is a large difference in costs on site to another.  AHCC, MaitakeGold, Aquarius (sp?) are some of the best mushroom supplements for building up the immune system.  CoQ10, Curcumin (from Turmeric), Vitamin D3, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, B complex (in the right combination), and several others are good.  Also, get her off all white sugar, white flour, any refined carbohydrates as cancer cells require glucose and those food release a LOT of glucose into the body very quickly.  If she is able, exercise at least 15 minutes a day, preferably outside as sunshine (without sunscreen) is important for the body to make its own Vitamin D.  Vitamin D is converted in the body into a natural cancer fighter - can't remember the name right now. So, don't give up hope.  There are many things to try.  Chemo is up to your Mom, but if she decides to quit taking it, that should be her decision. And, there are many other things she can try, it is not her only choice. God bless you and your family.  Prayer and a healthy emotional outlook is a critical part of the healing process.  If there are any emotional traumas in your mom's live that she has not dealt with, it is very important for her to do so as soon as possible as that can really interfere with the healing process.

      "Content": "ginnybisho: Please read my previous post about things you can do to prepare your body and mind for the battle/healing process.  Even surgery is very hard on the immune system, causes it to be depressed.  So build it up.  There are many supplements that you can take before and while recovering from surgery.  There are many that you can even take while having chemo and radiation that will help protect the immune and the body from the damage caused by the treatments.  Please research this and see what I am talking about.  More people survive cancer that use supplements to assist their body in the battle than those who don't.  If you choose to go the conventional route, go at it from all sides.  At least you will have spent some money you might have spent in some other way, at most you may save your life or give yourself a longer or more time with a better quality of life.  God bless.

      "Content": "Hi: It is not uncommon for the total diagnosis and decision making process to take several weeks.  It certainly can seem like a lifetime when you are newly diagnosed and wondering what the future hold. It seems like every minutes means a greater chance that you won't be able to beat the thing.  Fortunately, most cancers are not fast growing and a few weeks will not likely make much difference.  But there are several things your mom can be doing to prepare herself and her body for the battle, in fact things that will begin that battle right now.  !.  She must boost her immune system as it is the body's main way of destroying the abnormal cells that are produced in our body everyday.  That is how we keep from getting a cancer mass, our immune system destroys the abnormal cell before it multiplies.  When we get cancer it is often because our body/immune system was not able to destroy the cells faster than they were multiplying.  Medicinal mushroom supplements are a great place to start.  Shop around as the prices vary a lot from site to site.  2.  Exercise daily, outside if at all possible.  Sunlight will cause the skin to produce Vitamin D, a critical element in the fight against cancer.  (No sunscreen for at least 15 minutes each day as sunscreen blocks the ability of the body to make Vitamin D from the sun's rays.) 3.
