    "Content": "Severe rash on forearms and lower legs seems to be getting worse as the Taxol treatment continues.  I'm 10/12 weekly cycles and the various side effects are getting me down.  If any sisters are experiencing rash, neuropathy, or extreme fatigue, please share how you're getting through it. I begin the four FAC cycles in two weeks.   Some women say it's hard, but I wonder how much different it can be from the Taxol cycles. Thanks for sharing!",
