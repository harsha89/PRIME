    "Content": "Hi everyone. Just had 2 different turmors removed, one Metaplastic, the other CCIS from one breast. Radiation is planned. Â The also want to do chemo, but the info I have found says Chemo & Hormone therapy are not effective. Surgeon recommends the radiation, but says don't let chemo people push you into anything, and that I should advocate for myself. Has anyone been in this spot. And what helped you to determine the correct path to take. Thanks Francez",
