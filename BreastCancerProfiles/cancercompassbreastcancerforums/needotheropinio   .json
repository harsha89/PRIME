    "Content": "I had a left mastectomy with lymph node removal and it was two and a half months before I could start doing exercises to improve the range of motion of my left shoulder.  I still only have about half the range of motion.  I was told this never happened to any of my doctors patients before.  Please tell me did it happen to you??",
