      "Content": "Hi Donna: Thanks for writing back.The nurse I talked to at the breast assessment centre says recurrence rates are 30%, even after treatment. That seems frighteningly high. I meet with the oncologist April 17 to set a date for chemo to start. I also feel really afraid of the chemo. I'm also ER and PR pos, and I read that the her2+ discounts the positive effect of tamoxifen, but another study says that hormone pos. her2/neu patients had and advantage and longer disease-free time then hormone neg. The fear is taking up all the space in my life right now. Pauline",

      "Content": "I just got my path report 2 days ago from the surgeon. Primary 1.3 cm tumour in right breast with 3 positive nodes. ER/PR+ and her2/neu+. The surgeon was happy it was HR+ and only had 3 nodes, as the sbr score was 9. He didn't even mention the her2 status or what it meant. I went home and researched and found out the her2+ means the cancer will probably be resistant to hormone therapy and recurrence higher and survival rates are alot lower. I'm really feeling scared. Every bit of info I get about this cancer is worse than the last. CT scan and bone scans clear. So far.But for how long? Pauline",

      "Content": "I've just been diagnoses with her2/neu pos, hr pos BC. I read of a study at Brooke Army hosp in texas where they have devloped a vaccine for her2/neu pos BC to be used after treatment, and now, in phase 2 of trials they are finding it reduced recurrence by 50%. Has anyine else been in this trial or know anything about it? ALso, what is the recurrence rate for HER2/neu HR pos BC? I think it might be quite high and I'm feeling very scared. It seems survival rates are low in the stats I'm seeing. I start chemo in a month.",

      "Content": "I talked to someone about it at Brooke Army Medical Centre in Texas, where they are doing the research. It's one shot a month for six months, after you've finished all your treatment. Theresearch has gone through 2 phase and will start the 3rd phase this summer. After that they'll go for FDA approval.Results are very good so far, and they are beginning to est a variation of the vaccine that shows a further 50% reduction in recurrence over the first one. So far minor side effects like itching at the site of the injection. The other thing is that treatment is free in a clinical trial.The trials are being done at a number of different hospitals in the US. Pauline",

      "Content": "Jodie: Also, your doctor might not know about it as the first reports on the trials were only just published in a medical journal in February/08. If you Google Brooke Army Medical Center and look around the web site you'll find out more about it. If you call them they can tell you the hospital closest to you where trials are being done. I'm also her2/neu positive -- just got my path report from the surgeon 2 days ago. He told me nothing about it, just focussed on how I had only 3 nodes positive, which he seemed to think was good. I came home and started researching, and now I'm really scared. Do you know anything about higher recurrence rates for her2+? Pauline",
