      "Content": "I am also experiencing swelling of the brest.  I was diagnosed with stage 1 triple negative breast cancer in Jan. 08, had a lumpectomy and three node removed, plus chemo and radiation.  My swelling started during radiation treatment and my doctor said not to worry.  It has now been 9 months since I finished my treatment and I am still swollen and the skin gets very hard and stiff feeling by the end of the day.  Every time I have a check-up I mention the swelling and my oncologist has not once sad the word lymphedema.  She continues to say it's a normal reaction to the radiation and it may or may not go away.  I am thinking about making an appointment with my primary care provider and getting a second opinion.  I don't want to end up in worse shape down the road because nothing was done when it was in it's early stages!",
