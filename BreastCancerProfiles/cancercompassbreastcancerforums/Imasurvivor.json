    "Content": "Hi, I am a five year breast cancer survivor who started off taking tamoxifen.  I really thought that after five years I would be able to stop taking meds but to my surprise my oncologist recommended I start taking Femara.  I took it for four months and experienced nothing but pain all over my body.  I would get home from work and fall straight to sleep.  I had no energy.  I finally called my doctor and he switched me to Aromasin.  I do have aches in my legs and have since been diagnosed with carpal tunnel and trigger finger (I need to have surgery to correct all this).  I do feel like I'm older than I am because of all the aches.  If I sit down, it takes me a while to get up and warm up. All in all its still not as bad as when I took the Femara.  I read about taking a baby aspirin and I might start doing that to see if it helps.  Good Luck! D :)",
