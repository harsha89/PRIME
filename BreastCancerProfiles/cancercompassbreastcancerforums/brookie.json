      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear about your mom. My mother has also been diagnosed with carcinomatous menegitis at the beginning of August. She was diagnosed with breast cancer last year June. She underwent a mastectomy, strong chemo and radiation. In May this year, she started to lose ability to walk. She went from a cane, to a walker, to the wheelchair within 2-3 months. She woke up about a month ago with her face paralyzed. After being admitted to the hospital, FINALLY, there was inflammation on the meninges covering the quadrant of the brain that affects the nerves in the face. She had a spinal tap which concluded the diagnosis with 3-6 months to live. We really don't know when that time frame started since she was feeling the symptoms back in May. So now she can't walk, has lost total hearing and has a frozen face. The only treatment that she has gone through is radiation which is now over as of last week. SHe has lost her hair...again. ANd very little help with the face paralysis. This was done to aleviate the symptoms. Chemo was offered thru spine or through the resevoir that is put directly into the brain. She has been through so much at this point and chemo was not an option to her. This probably didn't have an answer for you but I want you to know you're not alone with the anquish of this disease. It would be nice to be able to communicate with you in regards to this. My sister and I are wanting to find out answers about this. It has blind sided us and we want to know why breast cancer patients seem to get this disease. Praying for your mom and your family through this. On 9/25/2007 space wrote: My mom was first diaganosed with breast cancer in 1992. She had a mastectomy on her right side and was declared cancer free for about 10 years. In 2003 the cancer reared its ugly head in her bones. She has gone through various treatments - hormonal therapy, radiation and in February of this year, chemotherapy. About 4 weeks ago she started loosing control of her legs and after being transferred to New England Medical Center in Boston was diagnosed with carcinomatous meningitis.  The doctors want to put her on a regiment of depocytr - which is interthecral and an oral chemo called temodar. She is 79 years old and we are very concerned about the side effects of this very strong chemo therapy. They say that this chemo will not extend her life any but may help her to regain some use of her legs - she has no feelings below her waist - they say maybe a 10% chance of some improvement. Has anyone out there had any experience with this combination of chemo - its usefeullness as well as the side effects. We want to make these last few months - the doctors say 2-3 months - as comfortable for her as possible and are concerned that this treatment may be worse than the side effects of a treatment that has not been proven effective. I would appreciate any feedback.  Thank you  ",

      "Content": "Leah, First I want to tell you that your family and mother are in my prayers. This is a terrible disease. My mother was also diagnosed with the same. She has been battling breast cancer since June 06. She had some lesions on her brain in April and had Gamma Knife surgery. Her face was paralyzed in August and that is how they found the cancer cells in the spinal fluid. She was offered the resevoir and spinal chemo with little extension to life. That was not an option to her. She had already been through so much. She has gone thru 15 treatments of brain radiation to hopefully alleviate the paralysis. She has lost total hearing and use of her legs. And her face has not recovered. She is at the point of daily watch. Very mentally alert but physically falling apart. Unfortunately she is declining every day and we have hospice coming weekly to check on her. I didn't tell you this to put a damper on your hopes. There is always hope and miracles. I still pray daily for a miracle to happen. Do research on the treatments and the disease. ANd it is going to depend on your mothers current health. Is she strong enough to handle the chemo. I heard it is pretty harsh and invasive. My mother's onocologist told us that the statistics weren't good with this disease. On a lighter note, my mom told her Dr that she was going to put him in the record book for a survivor of this disease. I understand the anguish you are going thru. My mother is 67 years young.It is frustrating and maddening. Keep your chin up and if you have faith that is the best strength you can have at this time. Please keep me up to date on your mother's progress. Courage and strength are our mother's driving forces.",

      "Content": "My mom was diagnosed in AUgust this year. Shewas given 3-6 months. Her symptoms started to decline in May. My mother had stage 3 breast cancer last June 2006. She had 3 tumors in her right breast and they removed 24 lymph nodes 21 ofthem were malignant. She also had lesions that were radiated from her brain in April. These were the secondary cancer from the breast cancer. She has had an mri, pet scan and others to determine that the cancer hasn't spread anywhere else. But the brain is the only area. Chemo when given intraveniously cannot go to the brain. There is what is called the \"Brain Barrier\" i beleive. This doesn't allow for chemo to go to the brain. That is the reason for the resevoir. It goes directly into the brain. Your mom may not get the hearing loss or the loss of movment in the legs. Everyone is different. And it's is unfortunately my moms experience. My mom's cancer just hit the right areas to effect those functions. Carcinomatour meningitis is brutal. The effect of the chemo that is given via resvoir I can only imagine would be like any other chemo. Not sure though. If you want send me your email through this website and I can gather up some links that will help you. They helped me.",
