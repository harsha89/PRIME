      "Content": "I'm so overwhelmed with the number of people that have been impacted by this terrible disease.  My heart goes out to all of you.  msf2011 - I'm so sorry for what you and your family went through.  Like my mom, your wife was so young and that makes this even harder.  Thank you for taking the time to share your story.  Please be well.  In advance, I apologize for not responding to some of these messages sooner.  I will give an update on my mom at this point because I hope it will give you all some hope.  My mom initially started treating with the Methotextrate back in July 2011 and she still continues treatment.  They started her off with treatments twice a week.  Her weight had dropped suddenly from 125 pounds to 99 pounds right before she started treatment.  She had absolutely no appetite and could barely get out of bed.  When we started to notice the cognitive problems, we asked the doctors if it was ok to decrease the chemo treatments down to once a week and then down to twice a month and now we're at once a month.  It's actually been 6 weeks since my mom has had a treatment.  Each time they give the methotextrate, they take the same amount of spinal fluid out and test it.  I think we were lucky in that when she started the chemo treatments, her fluid was still clear to the eye, not cloudy.   Her results from each test since have varied from \"rare\" to \"clear\" occurrences of the cancer cells in no particular order.  For a couple weeks they will be clear and then we'd go back to rare again.  From what I've read, it could be that because the cancer cells are in fluid, they are always moving and the doctor may not get a complete sampling each time.  The doctor has told us he thinks that the \"rare\" occurrence could be dead cancer cells that haven't made their way out of the body yet.  Unfortunately, there's no test for this at this time.  The side effects of the Methotextrate have been very hard on my family and I would like to express how important it is for the family to stay vigilant on the care of the patient.  My father, myself and my grandparents were always the ones to say it's time to cut back on treatment.  The side effects have mostly been related to memory and speech.  She's gained all the weight back and really enjoys eating again, which is so great since everything tasted terrible when she was on the Tarceva.  I highly recommend speaking with a nutritionist.  They told us how important protein is, so my mom has at least one drink a day packed with protein and it seems to help greatly.  When the chemo treatments were more frequent, we noticed that her speech suffered.  She was unable to complete sentences.  We increased the time between treatments and saw an improvement in her speech; however, her short term memory is lost.  We are hopeful that by spreading out the treatments, her memory will start to come back even more.  It's hardest on my dad who is there with her 24/7.  It's similar to a patient with dimentia.  I try to get out there to help as much as I can, but it's never enough.  She is noticeably better lately, though.  I hope her memory comes back.  She's forgotten who I am a few times and has had a few hallucinations.  Overall, she's much better than she was 6 months ago.  I'm hopeful that the methotextrate has helped keep the progression of the cancer at bay for awhile.  I'll keep you all updated and please continue to share your stories.  Please stay vigilant with your doctors to make sure they are always updating the patient's treatment based on what's going on with the patient.  Additionally, early disagnosis is key, so be proactive if you know of a long term lung cancer or breast cancer survivor. ",

      "Content": "Hello.  I'm so sorry to hear about your mom.  The nauseau came and went.  When my mom wasn't eating well, her doctor put her on steroids which increased her appetite.  She had medication (zophran maybe?) that helped with the nausea, too.  My dad worked really hard to keep her weight up after she dropped to 98 pounds after first being disagnosed.  When she passed she was heavier than I'd ever known her!  She would have been so mad, but she had dimentia and didn't really understand a lot of what was happening.  I highly recommend a high protein drink like Ensure or Boost.  We gave her those and made them taste better by blending them with ice cream and extra protein powder to keep up her energy.  She would usually drink the chocolate milk shakes.  It was amazing the difference it made.  Make sure you speak to your doctor about nutrition as I think it made a big difference in the quality of life for my mom.  Best wishes to you and your family.  Please let me know if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them. ",

      "Content": "Thank you, msf2011.  I agree, people just don't know about CM and it seems that doctors rule out a lot of other things before they do the lumbar puncture.  I've told anyone I know that has had breast or lung cancer about the progression of the disease.  I only hope they remember to ask their doctors about it if they start to see symptoms a few years after initial treatment. This may be hard for some of you to answer, but I've heard my mom complaining of more pain lately.  She says her teeth hurt and she has a shooting pain in her arm.  Her stomach has also been upset, but she hasn't lost her appetite.  We have an appointment with the doctor next week and will mention them.  I'm a little concerned since they are new.  She can still get ready herself each morning and her hands seem fine, so we assume the pain must not be that bad, but she can't explain things very well.  Has anyone's family members complained of similar symptoms?  Obviously every patient is different and I know there's no cure, but I just worry this could be a sign it's progressing.  Any thoughts are appreciated.  Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hello.  My mom was just diagnosed with CM and I'm hoping to give this message board a jump start.  It was so active for years and I hope that people have new stories of hope to share with others like myself.  My mom is about to turn 59 and was diagnosed about 6 years ago with NSCL cancer, she had a lobe of her lung removed and was in remission until about 2 years ago.  The doctors thought she had a frozen shoulder and ignored it, but a tumor had actually grown in her shoulder and another in her brain.  She received radiation and was in good health and spirits.  Her oncologist put her on Tarceva and there were no new tumors for 2 years.  She tolerated the Tarceva reasonably well, but had many side effects.  She recently started complaining of blurred vision, headaches, sleeping all the time and nausea.  We thought these were just side effects of the steroids and antibiotics she was on to deal with the side effects from Tarceva.  The doctors did not see anything when they did the 6 month scans 2 months ago, but when the symptoms recently worsened a few weeks ago, they did a spinal tap and diagnosed her with CM (lesson to all with this type of cancer, do the spinal tap early!).  This is the first board I've found with so many real stories.  My mom started intrathecal chemo (Methotrexate) and had her third treatment today.  I feel like the world must have made progress on treating this progression of cancer over the last few years, but it seems like by the time they find it, it's too late to really get a patient in a clinical trial or monitor progress. Does anyone have any stories to share of recent developments/treatments/prognosis/successes... anything?  My family and I appreciate any insight you're able to provide.   I know if you're on this message board, you are going through or have gone through something similar.  My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.   Be strong and make the most out of every moment!",

      "Content": "Hi stoutej, I was so sorry to hear of you and your wife's story.  She is so young.  The good thing is that she has you to stand by her side and help her through all of this.  It is most difficult on the caregivers and it's so important for you to continue to be strong for her.  My mom was similar to your wife in that she really didn't want to know and by the time it got bad, she was so blissfully unaware that it was better she did not know.  I'm not as familiar with the drugs your wife is currently taking, but I do wish you comfort and strength.  I hope the treatments she's currently undergoing help and as my father and I always hoped, one day soon the doctors will understand the drugs and cancer better and be able to treat it all better.  Continue to be vigilent in your wife's treatment.  The doctors only see what they see in the office and it's hard for them to change courses.  I know how hard it is to get answers to all these questions.  I hope they'll start doing more studies on CM soon; however, our doctors explained that usually it's discovered too late to get patients into a clinical trial.  Be strong and fight for her health and comfort.  Kindest regards.",
