    "Content": "I have stage 1 breast cancer. In  2001 I had a  simple mastectomy followed by   6 months of chemo. They put me on tamoxifin above my protests for 6 months. I was told about an Italian study on tamoxifin. Both the English and the Italians have been studying tamoxifin extensively. The studies agreed that tamoxifin doesn't prevent a recurrence and if the stuff causes cervical cancer why wouldn't it cause other cancers?  I stopped taking tamoxifin after 6 months. So far no signs of a recurrence of breast cancer and no signs of any other cancers.",
