    "Content": "I would like to know what your opinion is about taking this chemo if you have heart disease in your family. It seems to me that the health issues out weigh the benefit of getting this. I have POLB2 gene which has made me a guinnea pig for the medical community. I would rather not do this and take my chances that the surgery will remove the cancer and I will have no recurrence. however if there is a recurrence I would rather my heart be healthy and my body. please list any experience you have had with POLB2 or herceptin.",
