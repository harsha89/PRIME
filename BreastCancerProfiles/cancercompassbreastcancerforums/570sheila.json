      "Content": "PLEASE tell her she NEEDS to take the chemo....IT CAN help her live for MANY years and they have medicine to help her from NOT getting sick.If its her hair please tell her it WILL grow back but UNTIL then she can be blonde one day, a red head another and have it short or long when ever. She needs to get POSTITIVE and FIND THE WILL TO LIVE....which she can do for ALONG TIME if she sets her mind to it. SHE IS NOT ALONE....many people on here ARE willing to help and listen.                           Hugs Sheila",

      "Content": "Hello... You are right...CHEMO BRAIN does happen and doctors are finally excepting this. My husband can run into people he has known for years...he looks at them and he knows who they are yet has a hard time rembering their names. It is awful but not the worse thing that can happen to you...so chuckle it off when you have those moments you are NOT alone. HUGS Sheila As my husband would say ...WHO? .LO.L.",

      "Content": "Hello Katrina,     Our journey with this disease started in July of 08 and I will tell you if it was not for this site I do NOT know what I would have had done. Ted goes for a catscan this Monday to see if he needs to cotinue with his chemo so as you see it has been a LLLOOOONNNGGGG journey but we continue to do this TOGETHER and together we will WIN. Sure we have many good days as we do bad but we stay POSTITIVE....and continue to be POSTITIVE. I do belive it is important ....even when you forget a name or something you want to say....just laugh it off and say CHEMO BRAIN. If you laugh then you will not cry....laughing IS good for you and the soul. HUGS Sheila",
