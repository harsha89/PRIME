      "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 2 years now. I had a lumpectomy with radiation treatments. Since being on the Arimidex, my hair has gotten very thin, mostly on top, joint and muscle pain so bad I cry at times with them. I have gained a good deal of weight. There are other side effects that I am having also. Was wondering if anyone here has had the same problems with Arimidex. If so, did you stop taking it? Did the symptoms from it go away once off it? Any information you can give me about it would be a big help. I go to the doctors this Friday and I am thinking of telling him I do not want to stay on the Arimidex. Thanks for any information you have.",

      "Content": "Sorry that you are also having pain. I am on Darovcet, so far that is the strongest I have been able to get. I got to my oncologist Friday. I stopped taking the Arimidex Sunday. Guess he will not like that. I have been doing a lot of research this week on the effects of having no estrogen and what it does. I have decided that it is better to maybe have 5 years of good quality than 10 years of quantity with no quality. You said you had a mastectomy, that is another thing I do not really understand. My mother had a complete mastectomy with all lymph nodes removed many years ago. She was able to go back to her life without pain. Made me feel so week that I am not able to do as she did.",

I should say we have a small one connected to the hospital. It is not like say Duke would be. Where are you and where do you go for treatment, etc? Until next time, take care. Mary",

Just do it and get it over with.",
