    "Content": "I have a cousin with three children under the age of 9 who has been battling cancer for 1 year.  Put on Hospice this week.  So sad.  I watched my grandfather pass away with cancer 13 years ago.  I hate to think of what my cousin's family will have to go through these last days.  My mom had cancer as well.  We got ahold of the book Christians Curing Cancer.  It changed our life and possibly the outcome of her cancer diagnosis.  Have any of you read the book Christians Curing Cancer?  It does a wonderful job supplying a dose of hope in this devasting world of cancer.  It is about a woman who was healed of terminal cancer 6 years ago.  Tells her story and offers some advice.  We, caregivers and patients, all need a bit of hope, don't we?  I want my cousin's wife to read the book but I am at a loss of how to give it to her at this late hour.  How do you all respond when people try to give you advice, books, etc.?  Do you see it as offering support - or do you see it as being pushy?  Thanks.",
