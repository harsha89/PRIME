I had a diagnostic mammogram and last week had an ultrasound. Today I was advised that I am being scheduled for a core biopsy. Should I assume that the previous tests are suspicious for malignancy & the biopsy will confirm it? Has anyone else experienced this? Thank you I found lump and was sent to the breast clinic in my local hospital.# I was due for an annual mammogram but the lump appeared first. I went had a core biopsy and was more or less told that the lump was suspicious. The out come was that I have breast cancer in mt left breast and have had a lumpectomy an four nodes talken. Things have moved at pace and I've having chemo, then radiotherapy. This is all very frightening I know for you. I pray all works out well for you x",

After tests mammogram and a core biopsy, I was told I had cancer, the biopsy would give the Drs an answer to what sort of cancer its was, I will be back to find out Monday 16th. I know there will be an Op and there will be a discussion on treatment. The worry is my husband has terminal Pancreatic Cancer, I'm his main carer and all this is happening when my husband has started to deteriate. He may have to go in the Hospice for respite, I promised him I would look after him at home it looks as if I may have to break my promise x",

I am so sorry about your diagnosis and I know how scary and overwhelming it all feels right now.  I am 61 and going through my second round of cancer after first being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. First, stop, close your eyes, take a deep breath and then slowly let it out.  Imagine yourself breathing in Peace and exhaling Anxiety.  There is no need to rush into any immedicate choices or decisions. When you meet with your doctors again, they will make recommendations and you will have choices.  Remember!  You have time to go home and think about everything and do your research first to decide what is best for you.  They will suggest a lumpectomy or mastectomy based on your cancer.  The follow up treatment may consist of radiation, chemotherapy, medication or a combination.  The choice will be yours after their suggestions.  Depending on your current health and physical ability, you may be able to keep caring for your husband at home.  If you are in good physical shape other than the cancer, and depending on your treatment choices, you may come through all this fairly easily.  I was able to keep working with just a week off after surgery.  I felt more tired during treatment and slept more, but kept on doing what I had always done.  Even went hiking a few times! I am very sorry to hear about your husband's condition as well.  Remember though that you need to think about your own needs just as much now.  Hospice offers in-home care in most cases so your husband may not need to leave.  Having someone available to give you a few hours to yourself each day would be wonderful.  Do not be afraid to let others know you could use some help!  Many of us have a hard time asking for ourselves but this is one of those times when you need to accept all the help available to you.  Most cancer centers, that I'm aware of, have people to help you find what you need with these kinds of situations.  Joining a support group, if you haven't already, might also help with some of the stress and being overwhelmed. I wish you both the very best.  Do not dwell on the sadness of all this.  Enjoy and laugh every minute you can; watch funny movies; read inspirational stories; reflect on the good times; get out in the sun and live life.  Sometimes we have to fake it till me make it. Best wishes,  Janet                                                                   Thank you for your reply and enccouragement. I will know more on  Monday. so may be in touch again x",

I feel I have to smile and be happy in front of my family as my girls are so upset because over their beloved Dad, he is undergoing palliative care. I need to be strong x",
