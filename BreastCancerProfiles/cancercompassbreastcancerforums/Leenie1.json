    "Content": "Hey Mietie, I finished chemo in October and due to complication from chemo side effects didn't start femara until Dec.  I had lost all body hair too.  My eyebrows were the first to start growing.  I barely had hair on my head when I started but it slowly has come back.  So hopefully yours will too. The only side effect I have experienced is joint pain.  Its not terrible but the mornings are a little tough.  In comparison to chemo-its a piece of cake.  ",
