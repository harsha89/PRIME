    "Content": "Personally i think your friend may be dealing with a mental issue not breast cancer. My sister has double masectomy due to breast cancer in both breast, and she was very weak during these times. The treatments alone makes you tired, i really hope your bestfriend is not lying to you. Why is she still smoking and drinking if she has cancer? You need to have a good talk with her, ask to see her medications. I  have a bad feeling about your friend's situation, maybe she is in denial about something, her behave is totally opposite to that of a woman with stage 3 breast cancer.                    ",
