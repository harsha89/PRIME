If you wish to contact me directly, the email is --Message edited by CancerCompass staff. For personal protection, email address removed. Consider private reply. Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html-- .   I am hla-b27 positive which I passed onto my 2 children.  the hla-b27 has to do with the immune system and I wonder if that is why I got breast cancer or a contributor to getting it.  I intend to do some research when time permits.  I have found out that through a study at Oxford University that the women who did not take or have enough iodine came down with cancer and now they are wondering if there is a link to not having enough iodine in your system.  I will be off to buy some kelp today and start taking that for starters.   Also found out that  metformin (for diabetes) is showing some promise in fighting breast cancer.  I am diabetic and my doctor has given me a script for that.   Thank you again for all your info.   I think it is great if we all share any info we get our hands on to fight this monster and help future generations.  Thanks ",

      "Content": "I am to see an oncologist monday and after reading all the blogs on tamoxifen,femara,etc  I have made a decision to not take anything.  Is it worth it to take drugs that cause ovarian cancer and are known as a poison? I've had surgery for breast cancer and a re-excision and the radiation oncologist told me I would not even need radiation but that I should see the oncologist and take the meds.   Not after what I've read and a friend of mine is in pharmacuetical sales and has told me about all the horrible side effects, its just not worth it.   So if you take this garbage and you don't have breast cancer again and you get ovarian cancer and feel horrible all the time, it just makes no sense. One person I know about, has been following a diet and has been in remission (without any pills/or pain) for 9 years now.        Has anyone out there done diet alone?   If so, please let me know, I would appreciate any feed back.   ookie  --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

      "Content": "  On 8/27/2009 Cancercured wrote: It would depend on the staging of your cancer and nodal involvement if any as well as the type of your cancer. I was told to take the little pill (arimidex) for my stage 1- 3mm tubular carcinoma- no nodal involvement as well as radiation. I struggled with the decision- ultimately did rad. therapy prone for 16 days. The rad was delayed and I tried the little pill which gave me more trouble than I think it was worth as my risk was low for recurrence anyway. Someone at Fox Chase told me to do one or the other at least. The risk for osteoporosis and depression and insomnia was not worth the low rik I may have for recurrence. I went off the lttle pill and my doctors were comfortable with my decision. See the MO and see what he says. They told me it is more to decrease risk of new disease than recurrence for me. If you could forego rad. I think your chances for recurrence must be low but I am not a Doctor. thanks for your input.  I have really been struggling with the decision to take or not.   Well, last nite on the news they were saying that TAMOXIFEN ,& all the other drugs  in that same category,raise your risk factor to 440% of getting cancer again!!!! So why would anyone take drugs that reduce your cancer returning by 50% and INCREASE YOUR RISK BY 440%.   Of course the pharmecutical company is going to say it is safe but then we are the dollar signs for them.   No, I will not take the 440% chance by taking that, or any other drugs.   Instead I will be doing alot of research and seeing what a good alternative would be.  So far, I have read that Oxford University had a study that indicates that women who do no have enough IODINE in their system seem to be much more likely to get breast cancaer.   So the next time I go our shopping (soon), I will be buying Iodine in the form of the kelp. The women in my adoptive family took kelp and not one of them had breast cancer.  I never really took it, as I always thought it was not necessary.  Now I am starting to think differently.  What is an MO doctor?  I have seen the Radiation oncologist and an oncologist.    I HOPE ALOT OF WOMEN SAW THE NEWS ABOUT TAMOXIFEN AND ALL THOSE TYPE OF DRUGS.  It sure helped me make my decision along with your input.   thanks ,ookie   ",
