Those two terms describe a different kind of breast cancer. My first bout was in 2003. I was ok until 4 years later. Almost exactly to the day, I was diagnosed with cancer in the lung. Metaplastic almost always goes to the lung first. I did have a nagging cough before my diagnosis. I had most of my left lung removed in August of '07. The cancer was found in my bones in December, and what is left of my left lung in April. I went on Xeloda and Avastin in April, and had amazing results in June. The nodule in my lung was completely off the scan, and the uptake in my bones was diminished. Unfortunately, my scan in August was not as good, even though I continued my chemo regiman. The cancer was small in my lung, but growing more rapidly in my bones. About three weeks ago, the scan showed that the cancer is now systemic. Ribs, hips, femur, spleen, liver, lung......I have so few choices, and it's maddening, but out of my control. I don't mean to frighten anyone. I just know that finding the metastatic cancer earlier is better than later. I hope this is beneficial to someone.   I am going to try to answer the best I can.  I am not sure if his cancer is metaplastic, or squamous differentiation.  My husband was dignoised with met male breast cancer.  The lung specialist he was sent to for the cough stated that his lungs looked like a industrial disease prior to me telling the dr he also had a large lump in his chest.  The cancer is speckled in both lungs with the right side (same side as the tumor) being far worse, at this time first CT also should liver involvment.??  SInce the start he has cracked several ribs from coughing, and the Dr.s  now know the cancer has spreed to the bones. He has great pain in the shoulders and now his hip is hurting.  He will not ask for pain meds, doesn;t want to risk addiction. I talked him into getting sleeping meds so he can get a good nights sleep.  He had vicodin 2 years ago for a while but he thinks the pain now only needs tylenol.  I don;t argue, it is his decision.  I think next visit I will suggest the vicodin again.  Last visit the tumor markers are on the rise again Last year the marker went up to 800s then early this year back to 200, now we are in the 400s. I am so afraid of losing the person in the center of my life. .  ",
