      "Content": "I am writing to find out if anyone out there can give me some advice. I had my annual mammogram recently and was called back for a compression test. The facility also uses CAD (computer aided detection). I was told they saw a \"mass\", but it could just be a fold in the skin. I also had a sonogram the previous year to take a second look. I have been told I have very fibrous tissue,and they also used the term \"dense tissue\". I have been told now that they have detetmined there is no concern, that my test is clean. My sister died of metatastic breast cancer at age 37, fifteen years ago. I am 52. I feel umcomfortable with this, and it just seems as though it's all too vague. I called my family doctor and asked them to read the report to me, and that didn't really ease my anxiety either. I asked if maybe I should have another sonogram, or maybe an MRI, but they don't think it's necessary. Should I insist? Thanks so much to anyone who is interested and concerned that replys.",

Knowing how insidious this disease can be, and reading all of the message boards here and on other sites about missed diagnosis, I would be a fool not to. You must be a strong and brave women to stand up for yourself, and I am going to think of you when I talk to my doctor. I pray for your victory for a long healthy life!!!",
