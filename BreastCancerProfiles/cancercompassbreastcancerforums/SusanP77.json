      "Content": "I had a recurrance of DCIS in 2009; after surgery, chemo and radiotherapy, I had herceptin over a period of a year and have been taking armidex since early 2010 together with Vitamin D tabs. I am just wondering if anyone else has found that the chemo-brain and fatigue has continued post-treatment. I am having a very hard time work-wise - this could be due to age 61. Please let me know!",

      "Content": "Hello Rainy I am sorry to hear that you have had such a horrible experience. I am really surprised that you had such extensive burning and blistering. I had 30 sessions of radiotherapy to the whole breast + 5 booster sessions to the tumour bed and had burning and blistering that was confined to the areas radiated. The fact that you had such extensive skin damage suggests that there might have been an issue with the delivery of your radiotherapy. I think you need to take this further. By the way, you werenotdumb - you did, as most of us have, take advice from medics in whom you had reason to trust. Good luck and let us know how you get on.",
