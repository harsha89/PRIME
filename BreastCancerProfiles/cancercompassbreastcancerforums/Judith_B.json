    "Content": "Well, I'm glad someone is happy with Herceptin. My oncologist advised me that it was only good for those young gals, before 50, and it only gave them a few years of added life. I am one of those stage IV's that have survived 4 bouts with cancer. No, it has not been all metastatic breast cancer. If anyone wants the whole gory story I will give it to you. I have had Taxol, and a year of Navelbine to combat the lung spots. So far they all have disappeared. The spots that is, not my lungs. My problem is now neuropathy of the hands and feet. Oh, it is such fun when you can\u2019t feel your hands or feet and you want to drive to the store. Got any solutions or help? I'm the surviving daughter of a 35-year breast cancer survivor. And I am now 65 and looking to check out when I am 100. Let me know if I can be of help.",
