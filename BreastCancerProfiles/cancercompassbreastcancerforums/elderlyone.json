      "Content": "Hi:  On my breast cancer I never received any papers telling me just exactly all I should know about it only what the doctors have told me while setting in their office.  I don't want surgery or chemo nor the pill or the cancer killing cell drugs. Is there anyone out there that took things like vitamins, or used spices to deal with their cancer.  If so, what did they use and what has been the effects on the things they drank or took in the way of different homopathic things or whatever you would call it.  elderlyone",

      "Content": "Hi:  I now have breast cancer since late August, 2017.  Prior to my breast cancer I did have Squamous Cell Type II skin cancer on both my left inner leg and on my forehead.  Before I had the skin cancer removed I was diagnosed with right side Breast Cancer.  I believe the Squamous cell cancer gave me the breast cancer.  I feel I have now Inflamatory breast cancer.  Which means it has spread to other parts of my body.  The oncologist claims that is not true without checking it out.   Nothing has been done about the breast cancer due to my getting shingles 3 weeks ago.  My breast cancer is a small one.  Have had lots of problems with the shingles.  It first came on just as a large round spot about 2 inches around on my lower part of my breast.  Looked like what Mastitis looks like.  The article said that sometimes this is misdiagnosed for Mastistis when it is really Inflamatory Breast Cancer.  This round inflamed area was really red with darker red around the outer edges.  A few days later then there was a small red bump or pimple looking thing on my area just below my breast.  As the days went on then it got worse more raised bumps.  At that time I had an appt. with my oncologist and he confirmed what the surgeon had thought I had the shingles.  The surgeon put me on an antibiotic for 10 days.  The shingles have not looked like regular shingles nor have they festured or broken open like shingles would normally do.  My breast was heavy, my nipple itched, my left armpit felt swollen and sometimes had quite an odor for a while more so  before I got the shingles and is the same today. Now, 3 weeks later the shingles are just as bad as ever.  My breast bothers me to the point where I have to go and take Tylenol to stop the  discomfort.   I notice I have a very odd smelling odor from this area where the shingles are.  If I pull my t-shirt away from my body I can smell it and can't describe what the odor smells like.  Not a good smell.  I read a lot of articles on the site concerning the smell of cancer.  I thought it was from the shingles.  Perhaps it is but it really bothers me that it probably is from my cancer.   I have diabetes, heart trouble and cancer plus the shingles that hopefully will clear up in a week or so.  It claims that most shingles will clear up by six weeks unless you are unlucky and have them for months.    I noticed ever since I was first diagnosed with the skin cancers my two cats have been even more loving.  For the past week after I noticed that odd smell coming from around the area where the shingles are on my breast and the area below  the breast my little dog has been acting really strangely.  She will come and jump up on my lap and usually if I make her get off she will go off and do her thing but for about a week now she has just kept right on jumping back up onto my lap for several days now.  It has been since I noticed this bad odor coming from the area where the shingles are on my breast with the cancer that the dog has acted so differently. I have felt the cats know I have cancer now because they come and set on my lap a lot during the day and eveing moreso than ever before.  I realize now my dog also knows from how she has acted here this past week.  Just wanted to get this message out as I think I have inflamatory breast cancer which has spread to other parts of my body.   Regardless of whether anyone wants to believe it or not, age does matter many times whether a doctor regardless of how well known he may be that it is easier to just sort of slide an old person along if perhaps something is worse off for that old person that pehaps the doctor thinks is best not to let them know and you know sometimes it is better you don't tell them.  Or not to take the time to have them get the tests they need to let them know what is going on with their bodies.  Myself, I would rather know the truth than to be kept in the dark. I am 83 years years old, live alone, do my own driving, take care of my little dog and two cats.  Don't ever want to have to be put into a nursing home.  Maybe the oncologist thinks it best to keep me in the dark.  He already said that most people die from other causes other than the cancer they get.  Of course the doctor and surgeon are all for using the knife on anyone supposedly to keep them healthy.  I figure if I had not had the mammogram done back in August they would never have found the cancer to begin with and so perhaps I may have years yet without any surgery.  Quality of life is very important for me because I wish to live in my home till the day I die.   I have chosen not to have the breast surgery on the cancer.  They claim it might even be a one day or maybe not even that and might get to be home before night time on the same day.  My personal life to me means the quality of life I can have.  Having surgery of any kind is not what I wish to have when I have no support from my family.  Just is not worth the pain and suffering.  I will take a pill and call it a day.  It is my decision.   Thanks for listening.  Am so glad I happened upon this sight where they were discussing the cancer smell.  elderlyone    ",
