    "Content": "I wanted the bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP free-flap reconstruction. Unfortunately, the world-reknowned hospital in Baltimore wouldn't do it all in one procedure as they said they they would when I made my appointment. They placed tissue expanders, I got a pseudomonas infection around a week after surgery in one...I was very ill.  I was directed to Cleveland Clinic about 9 months later by a neighbor who had the bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP free-flap reconstruction...her results were awesome! I cried, because that's what I had been seeking. I since have had MY bilateral DIEP free-flap reconstruction by Dr. Bernard at Cleveland Clinic. It was a 14+ hour surgery, I was in the hospital 3 days (usually a week is standard). I love my breasts...they are warm and comfortable...my clothes fit...I have a cleavage! I since have met another woman in my town who had hers done at Cleveland Clinic, and is also very happy with her results. Have also met a woman who went the implant route. She wishes she had gone for the DIEP...she says her implants are \"ok\" but they are kind of cold feeling on her chest. Mine are warm and comfortable. I am having my nipples \"done\" this September. That's just my story in a nutshell. DIEP free-flap is state-of-the-art, but not everyone does them, or does them well, even if they say they do. Prayers for your wife, and blessings for your journey!",
