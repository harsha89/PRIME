      "Content": "Good Morning, first let me say that I am sorry for your diagnoses and the her2/neu protein.  I also had her2/neu breast cancer and am 6 years cancer free.  I had chemo, radiation, herceptin (for 1 year) and Femara for 5 years.  This diagnoses is NOT a death sentence.  My cousin also was diagnosed stage 4 her2/neu and continued on with chemo, radiation and Femara.  She is now 3 years clean.  The Herceptin (for me) had no side effects and was glad that this treatment was available as it was not a year before my diagnoses.   I hope that you are doing well since your post of 09-12-2014.  ",
