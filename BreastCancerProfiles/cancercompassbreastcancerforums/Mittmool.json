Thank you     Finding a lump in your mother's breast does not necessarily mean that's it's cancerous.  Please don't think the worst, try to think a little more positive about your mother and her health status.  I'm sure your mother will be just fine, as long as she is following her doctors guidelines and implemening natural remedies she will recover and be back to normal.  I know the feeling where your scared and can't sleep, your mind wanders and you think the worst, but don't let fear win you over.  Pray and give it to God and empower yourself by listening to Adam on dreamhealer.com.  When you go into www.dreamhealer.com-Click on the page where Adam speaks on Live Radio about how our intentions influence our health and how we can heal ourselves with the right energy.  Adam is only 20 years old and has helped millions of people feel better, he has a DVD and many great books to help relieve fear and tension that we all go through when we hear that our loved ones are not doing well.  I'll be praying for your mom and you and wish you both the best.  Let me know how you make out with the web-site on Adam.       ",

Against my doctor's advice, I chose not to have chemo or radiation or even lymph node removal. My doctor told me there was a 25% chance it would return in 2 years without the treatment. Well, that is a 75% chance in my favor! The cancer was 4 cm. and they said they had clear margins upon removal. I just had my 6 month check up and everything is going well. I made drastic changes in my diet and lifestyle. I follow the diet which can be found at: www.hacres.com. There is also a very good book by Anne Frohm (sp.?) called the \"The Cancer Battle Plan\". My best to you both. Teresa Hi Gary,   I was diagnosed last June 2006 with triple negative breast cancer. Like you, against my doctor's advise, I chose not to have chemo or radiation.  I had a lumpectomy for IDC no invasion of lymph nodes and felt it was not necessary to have chemo or radiation due to it being a low grade cancer and clear margins.  I followed a restricted diet with a good nutritionist and did every measure of prevention possible.  I went for my blood markers every 3 months followed by a MRI and every thing came out negative.  Now the shocker comes, I was experiencing Vertigo and having some very bad dizzy spells which the docs kept telling me was just Vertigo. They continued giving me Meclizine which helped but then it would come back.  I knew deep in my heart that something else had to be going down, so I asked my Oncologist to schedule a Pet Scan on my brain which gave me some very astonishing news.  I am now dealing with 2 brain tumors located at the left side of my cerebellum and 1 tumor located in my spinal cord at the T4 level.  Due to the tumor being located at my spinal cord, I have been in chronic pain with my left back and legs for the past month.  I am going blind doing research and have received more than 5 opinions.  My oncologist is highly suggesting TOMO Radiation therapy, from what I have read it delivers a very good measure of eliminating tumors on the spine, without receiving any awful side effects.  The surprising aspect about this whole issue was the case that if I didn't take the initiative to schedule the brain MRI I would have never known about these existing problems.  The oncologist do no tell women how high the rate is of breast cancer spreading to the brain.  My question to my Oncologist was:  If Breast Cancer has a high percentage of spreading to the brain, then why isn't a Brain Scan highly suggested after 1 year following breast surgery.  His answer was the cost which  is no excuse for neglect in this area.  My health is relatively excellent, I exercise and eat a very healthy diet, had all past and present negative reports in the last year,  and then to find out that my breast cancer metastises to my brain and spinal cord  is mind blowing. I am sending this message out so that women can demand brain scans once a year to protect their bodies after breast cancer.        ",

The tumor had not spread to surrounding tissue or the sentinal lymph nodes. However, the tumor was irregular in shape and I think that means that the cell activity could be active. It is my intention to go through radiation therapy and take Femara. My pathology slides were sent to be tested (oncotype DX) to see what the possibility is that the cancer could spread to other organs. The results came back in the intermediate area, which is the grey, unknown area. My oncologist recommends chemo (4 weeks). I am very reluctant to take chemo. I have a great sensitivity to drugs, and along with chemo he gives steroids. I got very ill with a virus for many months, when I took steriods for a foot problem. The virus went to my eyes (iritis) and I eventually lost the sight in the central part of my left eye which has completely changed my life, and not for the better. I don't feel my immune system can take all the toxicity. (I also have Gauchers Disease.) I told him I don't want chemo. My gut feeling is that I am correct. However, he said that with radiation and femara, I have an 85% chance that the cancer won't spread within a 10 yr. period. chemo improves that about 4%. I don't feel that 4% is worth taking a risk with my health condition. As I said, this is my gut feeling. I just don't want to start worrying that I made the wrong decision. Am I wrong to feel this way? I know there is no guarantee, but I think they are overdoing it, to be honest. Any guidelines would be helpful to me. I know this is a personal decision in the end and I take responsibility for it. Thanks, Dogwalker  ",

If you need any further information, please write again.  Good luck-                   ",

I was anticipating the worst scenario only to find out it was a breeze. The most important question to ask you doctor before going into nuclear medicine is to have them apply a anti-numbing cream which will desenitize your nipple. This cream will numb the nipple area where the very fine needle will be applied. I had this procedure done on June 2, at Williamantic Hospital here in CT and the doctor who perform the nuclear mapping procedure was wonderful. As he inserted the needle after numbing me, his assistant held my hand and told me to take deep breaths, while I only felt stinging and before long it was all over. The nipple area will be blue for some time but, you feel nothing afterwards. I'll pray for you and hope that everything turns out fine. Good luck with the procedure.",
