    "Content": "Emily I'm so sorry your friend is going thru this and that is Ts so hard on u... My mom was diagnosed 3 years ago with stage 4 her 2 positive breast cancer.. It's been devastating .... But she was in a clinical trial and the drug has been amazing ... Never has vommited .. No hair loss.. Minimal side affects...but after 2 years it spread to brain ....had to go off clinical trial because of it progression ... Had full brain radiation which was awful! Because of her age it made her week was in hospital and care home for a month for rehab... Had to learn to walk again etc. it's been a long road she's been home for over a year now I live with her her short term memory is bad and now getting worse... The cancer was growing because other treatment didn't work as well as the clinical trial drug... It was approved by the FDA and she was able to go back on it and the cancer is stabilized!! But due to radiation on brain at her age her memory is the biggest issue..... I hate cancer I hate what it has done to my once VERY independent mom... It breaks my heart! But at the same time I feel blessed I have had her in my life for so long.... I just want her to be happy..... Your friend has age on her side which is a good thing! Try to stay positive and love her !!! She can beat this!!!! God bless u both!!!",
