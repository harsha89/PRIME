      "Content": "Hi Jodi. Wow, we seem to have almost the same diagnosis. It is very strange and I keep asking myself-why? How could this be? I had breast cancer 11 years ago and was so faithful about follow up and tests, etc. After 11 years, I felt pretty confident I was one of the lucky ones. I had my cancer check ups in October 2006 right after my daughter got married. The by November, I started with a dry cough and hacked all the time. Went to doctor several times and was put on antiobotics. The third time was in January of 2007 and I asked for a chest xray at that time. (Urgent Care). They did a chest xray and said-WOW, looks bad. Fluid and scarring in my left lung. Went to oncologist and had CT Scan which showed lots and lots of nodules in both lungs. Was again put on antiobotics as my doctor couldn't believe it could be cancer. My original cancer was Stage II, 2 CM and I had a lumpectomy, no lymph node involvement at all, so I had radiation for 6 1/2 weeks daily, and tamoxifen for 5 years since I was estrogen positive. I finally had to have a lung biopsy which showed it was BC mets to my lungs-numerous mets to my lungs. I had to have my lungs drained once and I may have to have them drained again. Was put on Femara since I was estrogen positive and it shrunk cancer in my lungs now almost 50%, but now they find cancer in 6 places in my spine and two places on left rib and one on right rib. I have another CT Scan on September 24th to see if the bone cancer is responding to the Femara or not. See my oncologist on Oct 2nd for results. At that time I will know if the Femara is working or not and what is the next step. My husband and children and I were all horrified that this happened--I am just trusting God for everything now. I wish you the best of luck and just keep your faith. My lung hurts all the time when I take deep breaths and my upper spine is hurting badly also--I am just keeping my faith and taking one day at a time. Cancer is very sneaky as I have learned. I have not figured out how all the testing can help us since I was so diligent and had just been checked and had a chest xray in October and then this happened in November--the cancer was numerous by then in both lungs and my bones. I don't know how this wasn't picked up sooner before it spread so much.... Ayway, you take care and write and let me know how you are doing now, Patti",

      "Content": "Hi. Has anyone out there had any experience taking the oral chemo called Xoelda? I am not sure of the spelling, but I just picked it up today at the cancer center and have to start tomorrow. I am very nervous. I am currently having radiation to my femur thigh and hip bone for cancer there and the cancer has spread to my lungs, spine, ribs, hips, and siatica. Basically, pretty much all over. I was on Femara for 15 months and now the new CT-Pet Scan showed it is growing all over. The Bone scan from 3 weeks ago didn't pick up hardly anything in my bones and the CT Scan from a month or so ago didn't pick it up either. But the CT-PET SCAN picked up a lot of stuff. I just pray that it is right. Is this a good test? Is it pretty accurate compared to the bone scan and CT Scan? I start this oral chemo tomorrow morning and am pretty nervous about it as it says something about mouth sores, hand and feet burning. Could you please help me out if you have any experience with any of this? Thanks so much.",

My brother just saw it on the news a few weeks ago and called me about it, so I looked it up. Good luck to you and I pray that it works for you with no side effects. Patti",

      "Content": "Hi.  I am really scared.  Had breast cancer and now have been diagnosed with the cancer in both my lungs.  I am in pain and coughing a lot.  Oncologist did the lung biopsy and I was called in yesterday for results.  He started me on Femura or something like that and I take it once a day.  He wants to start on it and see if it shrinks the cancer and not do the chemo (agressive) until later because if this works, it will prolong the chemo.  I am scared because it seems like we should start out agressive first.  I am having a hard time breathing also.  He says the pill takes several months to start shrinking the cancer.  Has anyone else had a similar experience with all this?  Let me know if this is the correct approach or if I should be on agressive chemo to start with.  THanks so much for your help, Patti",

      "Content": "Hi. I have Stage IV breast cancer in my lungs and bones. First took xeloda, which I only made it through two cycles but vomited constantly. Then was switched to abraxene and avastin chemo drugs. The problem is I had to go off them for three weeks as my stomach and intestines are in really bad shape. Because of the burning and pain in my stomach and I can't eat anything, I think I have gastritis. I am scared if this doesn't get cleared up before I go back on the chemo drugs, I will have holes in my stomach. Has anyone had experience with gastritis while on chemo and if so, what were you able to do to heal the stomach and keep on the chemo at the same time? Help as I need the chemo-but have the stomach problem. Thanks.",

They put me on Femara as the cancer is estrogen positive. I am going to have a CT scan next week to find out if the cancer is responding to the Femara and if not, I will be put on agressive chemotherapy. The coughing has eased up now and I had my lung drained once and it is filling up again. I am in really bad pain in my lung (left) and my knees hurt a lot. Other than that, I haven't noticed any side effects from the Femara except \"occasional hot flashes\". I am praying that the Femara works for me to shrink the cancer. I was shocked when I have been free for 11 years and then \"wham\" I am now dealing with a lot of problems. I pray that it works for you. Has your cancer spread from your BC to other places, or are you just on Femara for the original cancer? I took tamoxifen for 5 years after my original BC. Take care and God bless, Patti",

      "Content": "Hi there. Yes, I am also in the Dallas area. Doctor has me on Femara for the breast cancer in my lungs-he says it takes 60 days to give it a full chance to work. I have three weeks left before 60 days are up. I am in the Plano area of Texas. My breast cancer was 11 years ago, Stage II, no lymph node involvement. I had a lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxifen for 5 years. Then nothing else-now both lungs have cancer in them. I am still in pain-had the lung biopsy to prove it was cancer and have had my lung drained one time already and fluid is there again. I am praying the Femara works for me. They gave me anti-inflammatory pills to take for the pain and inflammation, but still hurts after taking them for two weeks now. Doctor wants me to try the Femara before agressive chemotherapy as he wants to stall the chemo as long as possible and he says that with estrogen positive cancer, the Femara may work for awhile. How long did you take the Tamoxifen and is that what cleared the cancer for you? Are you still on the Tamoxifen, or are you on any drugs right now? How long have you been in remission now? Thanks for helping me out, Patti",

      "Content": "-----quote------ Hi. I was wondering if you could help me. I had breast cancer 11 years ago and had lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxifen for 5 years. No lymph node involvement at all and stage 1 cancer. Now I have been in pain and had this cough for several months. They did ct scan and found nodules throughout my lungs. Then I had pet scan and it showed moderate levels of activity. Then I had a lung biopsy which shows cancer in my lungs now. I am devastated. My family is devastated. The oncologist wanted me to start on anti hormonal drugs first (it was estrogen positive cancer) which I started two days ago (Femura). He said he doesn't want to start out with strongest thing first, like chemo so he is hoping this will shrink the cancer. During the meantime, I am having a hard time breathing, hurt really really badly and am SCARED to death. I have been praying a lot. Is there anything you can tell me to help me out. I am also in Dallas. Thanks and God bless, Patti",
