    "Content": "As hard as it is to go through this part of life, I'm so glad I found this board. I've learned a lot about a disease my father was diagnosed with hours ago. I've been searching for tips on  how to cope, how to help my mother deal with this, and how to help my father out in any way. Thank you all for the information you've provided. I would love to talk to anyone who wants to. -LL ",
