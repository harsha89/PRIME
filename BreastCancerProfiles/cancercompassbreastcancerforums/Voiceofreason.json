      "Content": "A fibroadenoma is normally a long standing tumour with little change to it but it may become more noticeable due to various reasons.  Most FAs are diagnosed on simple FNA and a core biopsy should confirm this but 5 cms seems pretty large and I would wonder why your clinician would still not want the lump removed.  Excisional biopsy recommendations are commonly made anyways, especially for those whose age starts putting some lesions into a grey area.  If it is causing you some issues physically or emotionally, then I think it would reasonable for your clinician to excise the lump and confirm it was nothing more than a benign FA.",

      "Content": "If a lump is palpable, then it should be able to be sampled.  The results suggest that there is nothing that can be seen to be causing the lump but a lump can be there for numerous reasons. If you are not satisfied with the results I would recommend returning to your physician and requesting further investigation of the lump(s), which may include performing an FNA to see what types of cells compromise the lump.",

      "Content": "Normally the Radiologist would perform an FNA on anything that was considered of interest at the time or if they do not see the images right away, they may suggest a follow-up scan and FNA on the report.  What you need to do is follow up with your primary care physician as they will be able to put together your complete clinical picture and make the best decisions with you.  ",

      "Content": "What is the concern with the result?  If it says F/C disease, that is pretty common and aside from having an FNA performed on any lump/mass to confirm that diagnosis, there doesn't seem to be much you should be concerned about.  From what you have written, as per the u/s report, it sounds pretty benign. If you are not satisified, then by all means ask your clinician to do further workup.",
