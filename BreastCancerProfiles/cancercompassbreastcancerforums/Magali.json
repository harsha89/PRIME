    "Content": "I was just reading all these messages and feel better knowing I am in the same boat.  I had a masectomy in Dec/o3 followed by chemo and radiation.  Started Tamoxifen in Aug/04 and was then switched to Aromasin almost a year ago.  While on Tomoxifen everything went great.  However 3 months into taking the Aromasin I started having joint pain in my fingers.  I t has gotton worse and my knees are know starting to hurt as well.  With the hand situation I can barely write anymore and is difficult opening bottles and even buttoning a shirt.  I  have also gained alot of weight (belly).  I still have another 2 years on Aromasin.  Does anyone out here who has been on it longer or is already off know if the joint pain goes away after.  Will I be back to normal? Or is it permanent damage?  I know it is better than a reacurrence (my cancer was 99% estrogen receptive) but I am a 43 year old who feels like she is 60! Waiting to hear from someone! Thanks, maggie",
