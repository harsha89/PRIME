    "Content": "Hi Newmom.  I just now seen this on CancerCompass about your cancer.  I was diagnoised with Metaplastic carcino sarcoma Triple Neg. Rec. on Jan. 18, 2010.  Right away was sent to have all the scans and when it come out it had spread to upper lymph nodes.  Stage IV.  Started chemo (Placitaxol) 3 times a month on Wed. and (Avastin) 2 times a month on Wed. Since this is a very aggressive cancer, these two chemo are very powerful for killing the cancer cells.  My doctor also wanted to remove breast before chemo, but decided not to because of more spreading. After two months Pet/Scan showed cancer was gone out of upper lymph nodes.  Changed diet completely, No SUGAR or FLOUR foods.  Excersice.  Would like to hear how you are doing.  EnergyKay",
