I have been trying to connect with anyone dealing with this disease and this is my first success in 4 years. My strategy has been to keep my immune system healthy. And stay busy. Hi, I saw your posting and thought I'd drop you an email. My mother-in-law, age 70, has been diagnosed with Carcinomatous Meningitis following bladder cancer earlier in the year. She's currently at Sloan Ketterring in New York City receiving radiation treatments, but the doctors have not indicated any other treatment options. Her prognosis is 3 months. We were encouraged by your posting and congratulate you on remaining cancer free for 4 years. Was wondering if you could share what treaments you had, where you had them, etc so we can explore our options. Regards, John    ",
