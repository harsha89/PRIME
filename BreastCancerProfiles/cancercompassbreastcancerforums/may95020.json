I am so sorry you have had a very bad and terrible experience with radioactive iodine, now that you mentioned it I also had the same thing, perhaps the difference was that the amount administered to me was so small because my weight was that of 14 year old boy and I was around 45 + years old, tall and have big bones. In my case that one time I got lucky as my doctor had several consultations with his collegues to be sure he would not use too much and hurt me & he did a fine job. I don't know how your Endocrinologist calculated how much of the iodine he had to use on you but I believe your Endo simply over did it, there is an International chart but it should be  adjusted to the patients age, weight, bone density and several others. These are the mistakes that anger me, we are the patients who seek help to get better because we are in pain, they are the ones who are supposed to know so as not to hurt us. This is becomming too common now a days. Your hearing issue has a horrible name, not for you, for the doctor shame on him. Are you taking any meds for the hypo? I take one pill before breakfast and I feel great. Try to drink lots of fluids, juices are great those will help you feel better & perhaps avoid the breath issue, I understand it must be terrible for you. Do you know what happened with the Pathologists in the US? If you wish and have the time Google it, I can not post such a terrible issue. It is good to know because it is a disgrace for those pathologists to have hurt so very many people with and without cancer. That's why it is good to research on our own and ask all we can until we turn green and if possible get a second and third opinion to be on the save side. Of course I don't believe all pathologists do such terrible things, but this issue gives that community a very bad name, unfortunately we are in their hands, but victims are now going to do something about it I believe I heard it will be in Canada because the courts in the US will not favor the victims, it was a scandal in the US.  In my personal opinion each person should have the right to choose their own pathologist and not have to blindly accept who ever the clinic or hospital likes.    Please take care, don't feel bad and remember that what you have is a doctors mistake. If you ever feel you need to vent, write to my personal email I am a good listener. God bless you and regards.   WHat topic should I google to find out about the hearing issue? I am severe pain that I did not have prior to treatment. I am in the US and have heard nothing of this. Thank you.",
