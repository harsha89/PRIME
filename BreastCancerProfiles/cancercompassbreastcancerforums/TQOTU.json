I believe that post mastectomy pain syndrome is just a fancy way of saying that the doctor made a mistake during surgury and it can not be fixed. I believe completely that that surgeon cut to much skin off and then was forced to stretch my skin so much that with every movement that I make it feels like someone is ripping the skin from my body. And if its not an surgical error then why are the doctors not being taught about this in school and why are they not telling their patients that it could happen to them after all this has had a name for almost 24 years at least and with all the stories that I have read one thing we have in common is are doctors all lack education about this syndrome and we are stuck paying for their mistakes it ends up costing us our whole lives that doctor made a mistake and I'm going to find a way to prove it. I need help any information that you feel might help please email me at lewis.starla@gmail.com. He took my life and I'm going to get it back one way or another.  I am 10 months post-mastectomy (bilateral) and have been in constant pain every day since. Three basic kinds of pain: a constant squeezing/tightness right through the incisions (I believe it is phantom pain-they still feel like they are there!), a numbness/tenderness mostly under my right arm (doc says most likely nerve damage from surgery) and then sharp, shooting pains that move from place to place. All pain meds that have been tried so far have not given me any relief. Just started on Neurontin last week but have not felt any difference yet. I've been looking for answers but so far only my GP has been willing to really try to help me. Both surgeons have basically told me to \"live with it\" and that it will last up to 2 years. Any advice would be most appreciated!",

      "Content": "I had a bilat-mastectomy last July, tried tissue expander reconstruction surgery at the same time, got a staph infection so had to have the expanders removed, tried reconstruction again in Dec, had problems with the left side so had to have that expander removed in Feb. I have been having lymphatic drainage almost non-stop on the left side since the surgery in Dec. My doc hasn't really answered my questions about whether or not there is a problem with my lymph nodes that is causing so much drainage. He keeps testing for infection and so far there hasn't been any this time but I did end up with an infection just prior to the surgery in Feb. I'm not sure I understand what is supposed to happen with normal lymphatic fluid, where does it go? Why the constant build-up on the left side now? I had 2 nodes removed from the left side and 1 from the right with the mastectomy but had no lymph node involvement. Any information on this would be helpful or even questions to ask the doc when I see him again next week. Thank you! TQOTU",

      "Content": "I am a 50 yr old divorcee who has just been diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. I am scheduled to have a double mastectomy with tissue expansion reconstruction at the same time the end of July. My question is how long after surgery will it be before the actual expansion process begins and how long does that take before you get to the size you want? (B cup for me) I assume that you have to allow some time for the incisions to heal but no one has told me how long that will be. Any help with this is greatly appreciated.",

My docs don't seem to know what to do for it and pain meds have not worked at all. My insurance does not cover alternative therapies. I'd like to hear from others who have experienced this and know if anyone has advice on what might have worked for them. Right now I'm being told to just \"live with it.\" If that's the case, I'd like to have some idea of how long it will last. Thanks for any help you can give me!",
