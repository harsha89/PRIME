Partner left me because he hated looking at my scars. Dr. does not acknowledge post-mastectomy pain syndrome or chemo-brain. Lost my health insurance. Nobody around me understands that I freeze a lot after chemo and I found a new lump that i hope is just a fat glob.Â  I am crying daily and cannot find any support. I feel alone. To tommy44: Have you tried contacting Komen? I have heard they help women that don't have insurance with their treatments.. Maybe if you contact Komen they will also start telling people about male breast cancer so male lives can be saved..",
