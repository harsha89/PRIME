My last 3 treatments was taxotere I am diabetic and am suffering terrible neuropathy in my legs and feet also swelling, my primary care Dr. said I was suffering more with this because of being diabetic and she prescribed \"Lyrica\" and it does help some. There are other things to help with neuropathy talk to your Dr. Good luck to you.........jp I too, received 3 rounds of Taxotere and suffer from terrible neuropathy in hands, fingers, feet & toes.  Onc. says this is rare, but I don't think so.  My last chemo was 8/07, and I still have the neuropathy.  How are you doing?",
