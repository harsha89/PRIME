    "Content": "I have a message posted Dec 12. I have breast cancer spread to bone. It was caught as it was restaging into stage 4. They have me on Zometa and a very small shot of Nevelbine. They stopped my nevelbine after it made my white blood cells bottom out.They don't tell me much of whats going on either. I kept having pain in my leg for a long time, & when the bone scan/biopsys came back positive some of the black spots on my bone were STILL being called arthritis!!! Im tired of dealing with these educated idiots. When I remind them They were NOT in the very 1st bone scan, they are silent.Im not sure whats going on. I will soon be walking with a cane. I will probably have to get a 2nd opinion, too. I have changed my diet to alot more fruits and vegetable & it works. I was taken off Arimedex because he says it wasnt working. Will post more later.
