      "Content": "HI, My mOm has a stage 4 breast cancer, but she lives longer for almost 5 years, going throught under chemo theraphy and radio theraphy , back n forth every month and taking her medicines on time makes her better. but what makes her stronger is that my mom never gives up She is strong  woman i'v ever known she is 72 years old and still kicking and fighting the cancer for the certain range of years. But what makes her special than the other cancer patients is that \"worship is her battle cry\" always praying and praising God , even if she  has no hair, still keep coming to church without worrying her hair! and the other cure for her cancer is that her love tank on her hearts never runs out!  She always let us feel how much she love us, not only us but people around us. She never thinks she has a cancer, Medicines is not the only one that can cure your diseases but deep within your soul, cleans it , ensure that your love in your heart never runs out, be happy, be kind, and have FAITH in your heart that you will be  cancer free.. Always smile, dont stress yourself cause it can only add to your worries..Listen to your favorite music and sing a song that comes from your heart.. and last Have faith and Trust God , glorify God, and let God enter to your heart coz God will heal you because HE loves you that much.. and you are God's powerful champion! He will never ever let you down! :)",
