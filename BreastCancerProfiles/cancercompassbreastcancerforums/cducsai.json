    "Content": "Hello, all, I am 3 years into treatment for my metastatic breast cancer and I'm about to start treatment with carboplatin+abraxane.  My oncologist is extraordinarily positive about this treatment saying it has shown itself to be very \"active\" against my kind of cancer.  Does anyone else have any experience with this drug combo for metastatic breast cancer? Thanks!  Christine",
