      "Content": "You are most welcome!!!  My Oncologist has me taking 1200 mg of Calcium and 2000 of D3 daily, too.  Thanks for your wishes for good health!!  I just received a diagnosis of a need for a 3rd round of fighting on March 2nd.  I begin radiation tomorrow, have a biospy on Monday to learn if this is a metastises of the breast cancer or something new, and a PET scan on Tuesday.  The Dr says if the cancer doesn't show up anywhere else, the prognosis is good.  We should know more by midweek next week.  The Medical Oncologist will make a plan for combating the cancer after the tests results are in.  He took me off the Aromasin.  I think it's because I can't be on it when I start chemo again.  GOD bless you on your journey and may you NEVER have a recurrence!!!  ",

Testing was done to find a recurrence risk which came back at only 7.5%. There was no chemo or radiation as the Drs said with the low risk of recurrence, the mastectomy and taking the medication, they couldn't say that I would benefit from further treatment.  I was put on Tamoxifen until 2010 when it was recommended that I have a hysterectomy so I could switch to Arimidex as the fibroids I had were changing with the Tamoxifen and there was a small risk of developing uterine cancer.  I took Arimidex 4 years and had a recurrence in 2014. The Oncologist said the Arimidex worked as this was a local recurrence and not a metastasis. I underwent chemo, radiation and surgery this past year.  I've been experiencing lower back pain and am to have a bone scan and MRI tomorrow morning.  Reading your post has given me hope that should this be another battle, to keep fighting.  THANKS!!!

It was soft to the touch.  A few days later it was time for a routine followup with the Oncologist.  When he pressed hard against the spot he decided to have an ultrasound, which led to a biopsy and a recurrence diagnosis.  All axillary lymph nodes were removed and the path report confirmed the diagnosis.  ",

      "Content": "The first time around was Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  The second time there was a recurrence on the side where the mastectomy had been done.  A sentinel node biopsy was done the first time around and only 3 lymph nodes were removed which were all negative-no cancer.  The reucrrence was in a lymph node.  The Surgeon told me that had they done the traditional lymph node dissection they have done for many years instead of the sentinel node one, they would have caught it then.  As I told him, we can't go back, so we go from where we are.   I'm thankful your pap test showed no changes last week.  I think the waiting would be harder than having the hysterectomy for me.  We are all different, of course, and each have to decide what course we will follow.   I, too, get copies of all reports and yes, they do have errors sometimes.  Any time humans are involved there is a potential for error.  We even ask to see the film studies as well.  I take a list of questions with me to my Doctor's visits.  I'm blessed with good Drs who welcome my questions and said they wish their other patients did the same.   My biggest issue with non traditional treatments, although I know the traditional ones can bring harm and may not do what they are being used to do, is that I had a sister who refused non traditional treatments out of fear and spent money chasing after a cure and a few days past a year, she passed.  The Dr had told her without treatment she would live about a year.  She even saw a \"Dr,\" who did magnetic treatments and told her she was cured if she'd only believe after the last treatment, while there was a tumor on her neck that was ever growing.  She suffered with that tumor and all the horrible things that went with it until the day she left us.  Thank GOD, we were with her.  I had finished chemo and went to be with her on Friday after the last chemo and stayed with her until she passed on Monday morning.   Thanks for your prayers and I do pray that you are blessed as well!!! ",

      "Content": "I am SO SO SORRY that your Mom has been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer.  I highly recommend the site breastcancer.org  I used it many, many times during my journey of almost 6 years now. I was positive for Estrogen receptors-meaning Estrogen acts as fuel for the cancer I had.  Triple positive means the cancer is fueled by estrogen, progesteron and the HER 2 gene is the information I have been given.  Femara is a drug used to treat the estrogen recptor aspect.  Herceptin is used in the treatment of the HER 2 gene aspect. breastcancer.org /symptoms/diagnosis/hormone_status\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breastcancer.org /symptoms/diagnosis/hormone_statu  This web site has a lot of information about breast cancer.  This is a link that talks about hormone receptors. I would say you also need a physician who is willing to answer your questions.  You might want to ask if there is a Nurse Navigator at the treatment center who can help you with information and resources.  May your Mom be blessed with many, many more years!!!  Stage 4 patients today have a much better outlook than in days gone by.  I've read of those who are 13-20 years past a stage 4 diagnosis.  May your Mom be blessed to be one who is as well.   I'm beginning the third round of fighting, with this being the first time it has been somewhere besides the original location.  I'm thus staged at 4 as well.   GOD bless!!",

      "Content": "While I am a person of faith and know that GOD has been with me through my first and second battle with breast cancer, I think Daisy is going a bit too far with giving advice to your Mom about something as serious as breast cancer.  I would say, unless GOD speaks directly to your Mom-not through Daisy-she should follow up with the Oncologist.  I don't believe that it was proper for Daisy to tell her to hide it from her family.  With your being pregnant, this is stress that you don't need.  I'm a firm believer that if GOD does something, it isn't to be hidden.  I also believe that when HE does a healing, the tests will confirm that healing.  Denial can be a part of the whole cancer diagnosis reaction and Daisy needs to be careful that she isn't taking your Mom's life into her hands by giving her this advice.  If your relationship with your Mom is where you can, maybe just sit down and discuss your concerns for her out of your love for her.  While you can't make your Mom followup, you and your family can try to speak to her of your love and concern for her and pray she will listen.  It isn't an easy road to make the journey for cancer treatments and sometimes due to the fear of that journey, denial seems easier.  May GOD bless you, your family and especially, your Mom!!!",

      "Content": "A great site for research is breastcancer.org  Type What is Mastectomy? in the searchbox and you should see an article about different types of mastectomies and who normally is a candidate for each specific type of procedure.  Here is a small portion of the article having to do with simple mastectomy.   Simple\" or \"total\" mastectomy Simple or total mastectomy concentrates on the breast tissue itself: The surgeon removes the entire breast. The surgeon does not perform axillary lymph node dissection(removal of lymph nodes in the underarm area). Sometimes, however, lymph nodes are occasionally removed because they happen to be located within the breast tissue taken during surgery. No muscles are removed from beneath the breast. Simple MastectomyLarger Version Who usually gets simple or total mastectomy? A simple or total mastectomy is appropriate for women with multiple or large areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and for women seeking prophylactic mastectomies \u2014 that is, breast removal in order to prevent any possibility of breast cancer occurring.",
