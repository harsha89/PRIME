      "Content": "The fact that they waited 6 months seems to be pretty good evidence that the docs don't believe it is cancer.  However, that being said, the only way to really know is to biopsy the lesion.  So you have a decision to make; insist that the docs do a biopsy or take their word for what the lesion is.  Of course, it is your life and if it is cancer and they miss it, you are the one who will have to live with it, not the docs. Good luck in making your decision. Joan L",

      "Content": "Hi Firefly, You have had a very tough time in recent months.  I'm so sorry about your husband and your sister and now your own diagnosis of breast cancer. I'm sure it is tempting to just have the breast removed and be done with it, but I would caution you not to be hasty.  It might not be necessary.  Wait and hear what your options are, do your own research and then make an informed decision.  That way you won't feel later like you jumped the gun and made your decision before all the facts were gathered. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Jenn, No one should have to be in such terrible pain, even those suffering from Stage IV breast cancer.  My advice would be to take her to the ER ASAP.  She doesn't deserve to live this way; she needs to have some relief from the pain, even if it makes her a bit 'out of it'.  The ER docs will evaluate her and she will get the help she needs; good luck.  She will have to count on you to do this for her since she is unable to do it for herself.  She may be in too much pain to appreciate what a good daughter-in-law you are to care so much for her and so I will take this opportunity to do it for her \"Thank you, Jenn, for being a good caretaker for your mother-in-law and a good person.\" Joan L ",

      "Content": "My younger sister had surgery for breast cancer one week ago, including removal of breast tissue and some lymph nodes, path report not back yet. Question is this: isn't staging usually done prior to any surgery?  She has not had CT, bone scan, etc.  Is this out of the ordinary? Older sister deceased from breast cancer some years ago so I am concerned.  Thanks for any help anyone can provide. ",
