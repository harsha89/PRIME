      "Content": "Breast Cancer and Stress 7/9/2007 Stress I\u2019m a male approaching seventy and the positive side of aging is the fact that life experiences can be defined by nothing else than the repetitive times they occurred. My whole adult life I was plagued with the skin on my hands pealing to a degree that I was ashamed to shake hands. I had many doctors prescribe all kinds of creams and lotions without any improvement. I had a stressful job, but it wasn\u2019t until an event occurred in my personal life that I realized that the pealing was associated directly with stress in my life. I couldn\u2019t believe that my total adult life had been spent with a condition that I actually had control over. From that point on with each skin-pealing episode I identified the source of the stress and physically made an effort to eliminate it, or sometimes simply identifying it would help the condition. As an example, road rage, when cut off in traffic the idiot would drive off and the event would be over for him. I on the other hand I would be enraged for hours, sometimes reinitiating it for my wife\u2019s sympathy which seldom worked. Now simply realizing the anger and the stress eliminates the skin-pealing problem. (7/8/2007) I heard that a study was completed that reflected that Black females who felt they had been discriminated against were 46% more apt to contract breast cancer. A radio announcer that brought the study to the forefront and to my disappointment took the story to the shallow political conclusion that now Blacks had yet another reason for lawsuits and would play into the hand of the Lawyers\u2026 Actually knowing what stress did to me, it wasn\u2019t much a stretch to realize that stress could have an effect on all body cells. The point isn\u2019t if Black women were discriminated against, but the ones studied truly believed that they were, and lived with the extreme stress on a daily basis. I was lucky that my obvious skin problem could be seen and I had an opportunity to solve and work with the problem. Compare that with the elusive cancer and its apparent that controlling stress may be more than we ever knew. James",

      "Content": "My wife was one of the first few women to survive inoperable breast cancer. This was 25 years ago when she was your age. The operation was still called Inoperable, but she elected to have the procedure the doctor suggested, today she is still cancer free. Sadly the cancer appeared a few years after our marriage separation and I now wonder if that situation of added stress resulted in breast cancer.
