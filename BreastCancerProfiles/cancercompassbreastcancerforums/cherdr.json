    "Content": "worrying is a thing that happens with cancer.  trust in God to get you through.  I am now cancer free for 2 1/2 years and I am still worrying, Just had my pet scan and everything was fine, except they want me to have a ct scan to make sure no problems exist.  I had cancer of the voice box and it was removed, also had 4 other operations with chemo and 2 rounds of radiation.  I try very hard not to worry but it seems to go along with the word cancer.  I wish you well and I am sure you will do fine.  trust in God and be positive Take Care, Cheryl",
