I'm still nauseous, I want to sleep 16 hrs a day, I have all these sores on my head, my eyelids are peeling and raw, my eyes water constantly, and I cant focus on any task long enough to finish it.  I cant even remember my original reason for posting this message.  I guess I just needed to hear from someone - is there normalcy  after this? Right now I'm this bald, swollen, boobless, sick person, will I ever be ME again?   There is absolutely nothing wrong with a little pity party. Going through chemo after having such traumatic surgery is probably one of the worst and hardest things you'll ever have to do. I too would have occassional pity parties, the tears flowed, I asked Why Me over and over again. But then I started to read books about Breast Cancer, did some research, but I didn't become obsessive about the things I read, and I took lots of anti-depressants! (I don't think they really worked, but it made my doctor happy so I took them.) It will be 4 years in February since I was diagnosed and then treated for both the invasive ductal carcinoma and the less invasive type (I like to blame my not remembering things on Chemo Brain although its been 2 years since my last treatment!) I am taking Arimidex which is a type of chemo so I'll blame it on that!.)  I had reconstruction a year and 1/2 ago and am much happier now that I have cleavage again! I still have some pain from the original mastectomy surgery, but even that's getting better. My hair has grown back to the way it was before I went bald, my eyes quit watering and my nose stopped bleeding within a couple months or so after I finished A/C, then taxotere, then Herceptin. My nails are just as strong as they used to be, too!  Try to think that \"You\" will never be the \"You\" you once were. You'll be better! You'll be stronger, more compassionate and you'll eventually feel like getting back to doing things that make you and your family happy. Eventually, all of the symptoms you described will go away. You just have to be patient and allow yourself to heal and to mourn your loss.  Rest when you feel like resting and cry when you feel like crying. It will be better soon!  Hold on to those around you for support and, again, give yourself time. Take care, my sister!  Carole  ",

I had my mastectomy in April of 2005 and Micro-Surgical Breast reconstruction using \"tummy tissue\" in May of 2007. I still suffer from the original nerve damage from the mastectomay and from lymphedema. However, about a year after the mastecomy I started going to a physical therapist who was certified in treating Lymphedema. She taught me how to stimulate the other key areas that gets the lymph fluid moving. She also released the scar tissue from the good tissue by pulling and stretching my arm and chest area and that gave me a lot more mobility and less pain. Further on in my therapy she taught me exercises that would help using those rubber band exercisers. She also did and I continue to do a massage to all of the scar areas I have and that has helped soften the areas. I know this is not the answer for everyone, but I feel that this kind of physical therapy is a well kept secret the Surgeons and Oncologists should be recommending to their patients once they feel the healing is at a \"safe\" point. Had I gone to the therapist earlier I would not have had to endure the pain from when she would do the pulling to release the scar tissue. You could actually hear the pop and feel when it let go!  I admit, I still use pain meds when necessary because of the nerve damage from the lymph nodes, but I, like you, feel that \"live with it\" is no answer. We have to be more proactive in our recovery. If there is anything you'd like more information on, I'm more than happy to share. We Breast Cancer Survivors are all Sisters and we have to help one another with whatever resources are available to us! By the way, insurance companies are supposed to cover Lymphedema therapy due to Breast Cancer. Don't take no for an answer! Feel better soon, Sister.
