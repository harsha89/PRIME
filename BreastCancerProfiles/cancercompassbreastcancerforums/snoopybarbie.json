    "Content": "I had my right breast removed Aug. 2004. Then in Aug 2011 had my thyroid gland removed (Thyroid cancer). My Pet /Ct scan Nov. 2012 showed a bone met in my left scapula(shoulder blade) which turned out to be a breast cancer met. My Dr. said it was the size of a quarter. I am on Arimidex 1mg and monthly shots of Densomab(Xgeva)for my bone. My Dr. has not said anything about radiation treatments. Are there any other treatments available? So far I am physically fine and have no pain.",
