      "Content": "I took this medication for two weeks after I had recovered from a lumpectomy (followed by radiation). Had to discontinue due to an extreme amount of joint pain. I've chosen to beef up on the vitamins...take \"cats claw\" and other suggestions by Dr. Andrew Weil in his books (Healty Aging, etc.) So far, so good. I feel good and the last mammogram was \"a pass\".",

      "Content": "I finished radiation post-lumpectomy last November and I tried arimidex for three weeks to see if it would give me more assurance that the cancer would not return. My \"lump\" was small and no lymph nodes were involved. I had to stop taking it after the three weeks due to extreme stiffness in my joints (at one point I could hardly type out an e-mail). My Oncologist was in agreement with my decision...telling me that those women who cannot tolerate it well, know almost immediately. I've been having hot flashes daily as a result of going off of the HRT routine...it was hard to tell if the arimidex was also giving me hot flashes. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and trying to live as healthy a life as I can...excercising...low fat diet. So far, I feel great.",
