      "Content": "Hi Pat, you sound just like I did after I had my first chemo treatment. I went for 17 rounds, and when I went back for the 2nd one I broke down and cried saying I couldn't do it ... My oncologist, the best in the world, was always so sensitive and caring and told me he perfectly understood because he had been on chemo before. He told me to commit to one session at a time, and that's how I did it. I dind't even think about all the remaining sessions. I only counted \"one more\", and did it. I also completely lowered my expectations about how I was going to feel and behave after chemo, and allowed myself to stay in bed for 7 straight days after each round. Yes, it took me 7 days to be able to walk on my own and even think clearly after every round, but my oncologist said that was completely normal given my sensitivity to drugs, and that if that was what my body needed to do to recover, then that was it. Pat, I wish I could give you a magic recipe, but I don't have one. You have to do this because it's your way to health and survival. You cannot give cancer another chance. Rest, rest, rest, and when feeling good, do what you want. One session at a time, and you'll get done. Yes, it gets done!!! I'm praying for you.",

At first I noticed a large lump that on the mammogram showed to be just full of water, but the mammogram showed two smaller tumors in the other breasts, it was cancer. More mammograms and ultrasounds did not find any additional tumors in either breast. I had to have an MRI to make sure everything was fine, and it was then that two more tumors were seeing in the other breast. Both tumors were cancerous as well. I had dense breast tissue, so the small tumors couldn't be seen by mammograms. If you feel something is wrong, it probably is. Ask to have an MRI to make sure. I keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",

I finished chemo 1 year ago, after having bilateral mastectomies for invasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts. I was terrified from the moment I was told I needed to have the first 3 biopsies. It took me a long time to get hold of my fears, and even now I still have bad moments. It takes time to realize that this monster gets the best of you, of your family and loved ones, if you allow it. You have to gather your courage and determination to decide that even in the worst moments you will not allow cancer to rob you of hope and faith. You are not alone. You are surrounded by all of us who went through this before, and those who are going through it right now. Please write again and let me know how you are doing. Monica",

I had to have 5 biopsies to determine the status of all the tumors. The biopsies were painless. Don't let fear of the procedures take the best of you, because the biopsies are painless. The doctor will give you local anesthesia and you will be fine. Even the first sting of the anesthesia is very minimal. It may take you between 1 and 2 hours to be completely done with the procedure. There was a little discomfort after the local anesthesia wore off, but with Tylenol and an ice pack I did fine. The worst part is waiting for the results. Make sure you have a loved one with you when you go in to see your doctor for the results.There are many of us praying for you right now.

Talk to your doctor about Aromacin, maybe you could switch to that medication. The other thing that helps me a lot with pain management is exercise. I get on the treadmill seven days a week, rain, snow or ice. I get anywhere between 3 and 5 miles every day. Believe me, the more I walk, the less pain I have, and sleeping through the night is a breeze. Whenever you feel up to it, try getting on a regular walk schedule, it will help a lot. Good luck!!!

My only guess is that different doctors approach the removal of ovaries differently, depending on family history, type of breast cancer, and results of genetic testing. I was advised by my oncologist, the geneticist, and two additional consulting oncologists from one of the Mayo Clinics in Florida that my chances of getting ovarian cancer would be the same as any other woman without breast cancer. Of course, the ultimate decision of getting the surgery or not was mine. By all means, you should do what will give you peace of mind and better quality of life. It is very scary to live our days thingking about if and when the monster will return. I wish you the best, and keep you in my prayers. Monica",
