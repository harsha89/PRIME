    "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with this cancer.  Her subset is carcinosarcoma or some people call it sarcomatoid(sot sure about spelling).  My knowledge of this is basic and would like to know more about prognosis.  Her tumor was classified as a stage 2 A.  Her treatment so far consists of a double mastechtamy followed by four rounds of taxatere and cytoxin.  My real question is this, Does anyone have personal information or other follow up information on people with same prognosis?  Any information would help.  Thank you I just feel lost and helpless.  No one seems to be able to tell me anything.  At best I would like to know history maybe of others regarding reoccurances and life expectancy.  Thank you anyone who can tell me anything.",
