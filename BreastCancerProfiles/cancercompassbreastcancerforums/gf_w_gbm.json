    "Content": "sjk1963 -Â  Your assertion that 'mammograms can and will cause Cancer (sic)' and that they're a bad idea is both obtuse and dangerous. I'd like to think that most here know that early detection is key in successful treatment and positive outcomes; that early detection comes from regular mamograms. Sure, a healthy diet is one way to limit one's exposure to a variety of cancers but it's by no means a way of escaping the reality that many of us face. Your assertion otherwise is foolhardy.",
