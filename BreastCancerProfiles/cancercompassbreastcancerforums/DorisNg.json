      "Content": "Hi Laura Thank you for reply. It's really great. It gives us more hope to see you still doing well. You dont know how it means to us. Even her oncologist told me her case is really bad as it spreads to mant of the bone. But hopefully she will get over it, specially with the hope from survivals. She will start with Herceptin and chemo this week. Hope it's going well. Do you have any advises for preparing before chemo? And how the effects gonna be. I hope you all the best and live stronger for long. Hope that sooner we will find the cure for it. Thank you again Laura Doris",

Im so sorry about your mom. Hope she rest in peace now. I know there is no cure for cancer yet. But at least im hoping for a longer time she stay with me. I try my best to keep her stronger and live for next more years. Believe, hope and pray.",
