Thank you for posting, i am curious about the laser therapy and where you found someone to help you with this. I have stage 1V with lots of bone mets pelvis,sacrum, femur, ribs, spine, arm. And the usual breast cancer- liver spleen nodes. I was dgnsd. With 4. And had radiation 2 years ago on my sacrum. no chemo. Is the laser therapy something that is offered throughout the country. Again thank you for your time.",
