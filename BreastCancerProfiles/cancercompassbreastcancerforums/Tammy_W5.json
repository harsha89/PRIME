    "Content": "I have stage IV breast cancer, mets to the bone. I have an extensive family/community/religious support system and I am extremely grateful. Every 4 months I have CT scans and bone scans. The bone cancer has not been spreading, with hormonal treatment and tamoxifen for 1 year. Each time before the scans and results I am unbearable to be with. I wait for the other shoe to drop. I am waiting for the words, \"it is spreading again.\" I am 41 years old with 5 daughters, a supportive husband. Sometimes tho, I feel I should give up and let them go on. How do you go on with the uncertainty and dread?",
