    "Content": "Maryl - my father died on 1/17/09 from severe toxicity from 5FU.  They willnot say my dad had DPD because they never tested him for it but from everything I have read now it sure appears that way to me.   He was diagnosed with Stage 3A colon cancer and had the cancer removed in October.  He doctor felt chemo would be helpful as they found cancer in 1 lympth node out of 10.  He started chemo on 11/24.  His doctors did not tell us about how dangerous 5FU is or about DPD.  Well once my dad started chemo he never felt good again.  After his 2nd does he started getting diarrhea but not too bad to start.  After his 3rd dose it was getting worse and he could not control it.  He told the Dr.'s but they did not seem concerned, did not change is schedule or dosage.  And then on 1/5/09 he recieved his fourth dose.  Ater this dose he could no longer eat or keep anything inside of him.  His diarrhea was now every hour.  He was admitted to the ER after passing ou in the cancer clinci waiting room on 1/9/09.  Over the weekend they filled him with IV's and sent him home on Monday even though he still could not eat and his diarrhea had not stopped.  Five hours later my family checked him back into the hospital because he was too weak to be home and now is diarrhea was every 20 minutes.  The nightmare continued for the next four days witht the doctors trying 3-4 drugs to stop the diarrhea but nothing ever did.  He could not eat anything, his legs began to swell and on Thursday night I met with the doctor.  I asked could he be moved to ICU - they said no he does not qualify, I asked should he be moved to OHSU a big cancer hospital in our area- the answer- we are doing everything they would do.  Friday morning they told me my dad was suddenly in acute renal failure and now he would be moved to ICU.  Once there they found is heart was out of rhythm and in a flutter pattern.  Now is would be life flighted to OHSU but it was too late.  Once there he began throwing up some toxic substance from his stomach every 5 minutes.  He died that night when his precious heart could not keep all of the organs going anymore.  After he died I found out about DPD.  I feel 99% positive that he had this or why else would he have died from severe toxicity.  Does anyone know if 5 FU can kill you even without DPD? Does anyone know if a person has DPD and is given 5 FU can they survive and have a healthy life.  Maryl - how did the doctors save you?  What hospital were you in?  You are very lucky!  What can be done to stop this in the future?  Has anyone had luck pursuing this with the FDA, legislature or legal recourse?   ",
