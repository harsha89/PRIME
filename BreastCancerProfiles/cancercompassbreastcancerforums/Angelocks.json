    "Content": "I just received the news that my 49 year old sister has HER2-NU Cancer stage 3 of the right breast. She recently had a mastectomy done of her right breast and three lymph nodes removed. No cancer was found on her nodes, however, the doctor says this is aggressive cancer and the prognosis is grim. Needless to say, we are all devasted. I need some feedback from your personal experiences; what my sister can expect, available treatments, nutrion, exercise, and of course prognosis. I hear Herceptin is the drug used to treat this cancer, is this drug FDA approved? We live close to the Mexican border, and I wonder if it can be purchased there without a prescription. I am encouraging my sister to seek a second opinion and not to give up. Together we can beat this horrible decease. I also heard that this type of breat cancer is genetically link. We are six sisters and 12 nieces between us all. What should we look for or avoid? Any advise would be helpful. Thanks! Angelocks",
