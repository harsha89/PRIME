      "Content": "I was put into \"chemical menopause\" with a Zoladex-Femara combination.  The Hot Flashes are pretty frequent and annoying.  (I frequently get a tinge of nausea with each episode.)  Haven't counted how many times during the day, but it's frequent.  I'm getting some joint and bone pain -- exercise helps A LOT.  When I brought up the hot flash problem with an older friend, she smiled.  She's never been on any meds, but has been in menopause for a few years now.  She said she carries a handkerchief & the sweat just pours off of her!  Just one of those \"gifts\" I guess.  :)  It's hard for us to know, as our bodies didn't just naturally take us there.  On plus side, many of the studies I've read state that the sweats show the lack of estrogen (thus the lack of \"food\" for invading cells to use), the better our beating any return of breast cancer cells...  I've taken to mopping my forehead and saying, \"Thank You, Lord; You're healing me!\"  :)  ",

      "Content": "3 1/2 weeks ago I was diagnosed with ILC.  A PET scan is scheduled to be done this week.  I did come across a study at MD Anderson that suggested ILC (as opposed to Ductal carcinomas) usually do not shrink with preoperative chemo.   I found a lump with self exam - the follow-up mammogram was not conclusive; a sonogram & biopsy were required. For the same reasons you stated -- an increased probability (with ILC) of being found in the other breast; the complications with later/future reconstruction; and my own genealogy, I too am opting for a double mastectomy.  My surgeon was very thorough in instructing me, re my options.  But like you, I do not want to imagine myself walking through this again any time soon. I feel this is the best option for me.  Thanks for sharing.  Hope you are doing great!",

      "Content": "Tired55 - Thanks for writing!  Yes; it seems too-much-too-fast to try to get your/my head around.  Have been doing as much as I can on my end to read (voraciously), pray, keep moving, and enjoy the many blessed moments in each of my days.  I had been scheduled to have a bi-lateral mastectomy a couple weeks ago, but when the PET scan & biopsy reported lesions in my spine, the surgery was postphoned 'til that could be dealt with. Apparently, lobular breast cancer cells respond more to endocrine (hormone) therapy than to chemo.  I met with the oncologist on Monday (she's great); was started on Xgeva and Zoladex in order to starve the cells of estrogen & progesterone.  (It's throwing me into chemical menopause -- already getting hot flashes/flushes). Will Start taking Femara next week to build up the bone tissue in order to kick out this invader. They're Monitoring blood tests and size of breast tumor every 4 weeks; then look at surgery (mastectomy or partial) in 2-3 months.  I'm using this time to eat as best I can; exercise; play; pray; and organize.  I'd be glad to write back and forth any time.  It does Help to talk with someone else who's battling the same thing.  Already Understand all too well the waiting game and \"mind battles\" that go on along the way.  So Thanks again for writing.   --planeK   ",
