      "Content": "I was diagnosed with estrogen positive breast cancer in 2004. I was 46 years old, so it's been 4 years without reaccurance. Yeah! I thought I was safe because as far as I know it doesn't run in the family neither my mother or two older sisters ever had any problems. It took me completely by surprise, so now I'm convinced no one is safe. I started out with tomoxifen because I was pre menapausal and that was my only choise. I had horrible side affects on that. A year after my lumpectomy doctors decided to take out my ovaries because I kept getting ovarian cysts and I think they were afraid one of them would become cancerous at some point because of my past history. So now I was instantly post menopausal which in itself let me tell you is a bang on the system and they swithced my meds to Arimidex. This med was worse than the tomoxifen, it made me feel like a tin lady. I ached everywhere. I couldn't take the pain any more after a year on this so they swithced me to Femmara which I find to be the lesser of 3 evils. I still feel achy all over but it's more tolerable. I can't wait till the day comes (one more year) when I can be off all meds and start feeling like a 50 year old, well I'll be 51 by then, instead of a 90 year old, but I do often wonder if once I'm off  medication will cancer show it's ugly face again. I guess I can only hope and pray not. I consider myself one of the luckier ones because I caught my cancer early before it spread to my lymph nodes so I only had to endure surgery, actually two becuse the first one didn't result in clear margins, 6weeks raidiation and HRT. No Chemo. My heart goes out to those who have to endure that. Actually my heart goes out to all breast cancer patients. By far the best medicine is a positive attitude, good nutrition and exercice. I know it's hard but I truly believe that's what works.",
