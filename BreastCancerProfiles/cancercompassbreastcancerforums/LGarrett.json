    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast in May.  She had a lumpectomy and did 35 rounds of radiation.  Her next step is to take Armidex for 5 years.  Her doctor told her that by having the lumpectomy, radiation, and Armidex it is considered the same as having a mastectomy.  My mom is always very leary of taking any medication and she researched this drug online.  Of course now after reading the comments she is worried/scared to take it.  She is 75 healthy as a horse, very active and not an \"old lady\" :)  Can anyone relate to this or give me any advise on what direction to stir her in?  I want to decrease the chances of the cancer returning but I don't want her to suffer with pain and other symptoms either. ",
