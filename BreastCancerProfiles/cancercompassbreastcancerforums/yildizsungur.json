    "Content": "Dear Angel, First of all I want to say all my prayers are with you and your mom. Secondly, congratulations for handling your mom's situation so far. I have a toddler daughter and I really wish her to grow up as strong as you.  I'm sure many caregivers here understand your feelings and the emotional transition you are living. At least \"I\" understand them. I'm the caregiver of my mom too, and god knows it's hard both physically and emotionally. It must be much harder for you at your age. But just don't give up, just don't stop hoping. I strongly advise you to find an activity you like, something that needs concentration and gives you a break to your life & responsibilities. ",
