    "Content": "I am a 30-yr old female and I have experienced multiple symptoms over the past 7 years.  I had a sudden nipple inversion of my left breast and leakage of a fluid that was clear to yellow in color (not in conjunction of pregnancy or breast feeding).  Upon initial symptoms I addressed them to my gyno and was sent for a mammogram (age 23).  After the mammogram I was sent for a sonogram for a suspicious spot.  After detailed sonogram I was told that it was normal breast tissue and not to worry.  Symptoms persisted for 3 years.  I then had a maternal aunt diagnosed with breast cancer and sought out an opinion again.  Doctor examined and felt no masses and ordered a mammogram.  Nothing found on mammogram.  Two years ago the breast has a dull ache, which I am told may be psychological due to worry.  Leakage has never subsided.  Nipple has a constant odor, nipple still inverted.  Repeat mammogram and then sent for an ultrasound of milk ducts, no abnormalities found.  Another maternal aunt has now been diagnosed with breast cancer and is undergoing treatment.  I'm now told that there is a condition in which there can be a tumor on the pitutary gland which can cause all of my symptoms.   Could it be that there is in fact no cancer within my breast?  Is this tumor theory possible?  My fear is due to the fact that my latest maternal aunt who is undergoing breast cancer treatment has all of the same symptoms I have been experiencing for years.",
