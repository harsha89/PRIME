    "Content": "I'm a husband of a tamoxifin user and the use of this product has totally wiped out what sex drive my wife had.  She's worried about using something that might increase her risk of recurrence.  She's been on it about 4 months now.  She's only 39 so we're not ready to give up.  Her symptoms are itching and general pain during intercourse.  Can anyone help us here?  This seems to be a cruel drug.",
