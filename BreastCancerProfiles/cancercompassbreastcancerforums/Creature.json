Did you end up doing the test? Tina I just had a lumpectomy at OSU James cancer center in Columbus ,Ohio. I will be starting chemo next week then radiation.  I lost both Mom and sister to breast cancer,both in early to late 40`s. I am in mid 60`s but want to make sure everything is caught. I had no lymph gland involvemnt or surrounding tissue but because of the hormones were negative and her2 neg I ahd what appeared to Dr. to be a aggressive tumor . I was told to have this testing done also because of family history and will start this Friday, at least then my daughters cn maybe benefit from it. Godd luck to you and your family  Sons can also test positive for BRCA1 and BRCA2. My son tested positive which puts him at a higher risk for breast and colon cancer.",
