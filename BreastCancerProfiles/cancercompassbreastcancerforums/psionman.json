    "Content": "My wife (57) was diagnosed with breast cancer 4 years ago. She has had metastises in the liver and bones and now was diagnosed with MC about 2 weeks ago after exhibiting nerve damage (tongue problems and weak arms) for 6 weeks or so   Other poeple have mentioned mood changes. In her case, these have been totally positive. She is now much more calm and  easy to get along with. She knows that the prognosis is poor but accepts it.   Does anyone else have experiance of thsese positive mood changes? ",
