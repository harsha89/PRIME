    "Content": "I was diagnosed with the same type cancer less than 1cm and negative in the lymph nodes.  I took the Oncotype dx testing before I decided which therapy to choose.  My score was just left of center so I could have choosen either chemo or radiation I was almost right in the middle.  I choose radiation and then hormone therapy starting last September.  I have had problems with the Arimidex after 6 months I could barely walk the bottom of my feet hurt so bad.  My Oncologist switched me to Femara which was worse, I am now on Tamoxifen going on 4 months, all seems to be better I still have sore muscles and aches. The Oncotype is just another tool to help you choose therapy.  I did not want to be sick and loose my hair since I am still working every day.  i hope things go well for you.",
