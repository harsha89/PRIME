      "Content": "Hi. I'm new to this site although I gave viewed many posts over the last few months. My mum was first diagnosed 15yrs ago with breast cancer. Since then she has gone through chemo and radiotherapy but eventually it came back to bone liver and lung. And in September after noticing some unusual behavior and decline in mobility an MRI confirmed she has multiple brain mets. She refused WBRT and went with steroids only. She was on a weaning dose of dexamethasone and has now been off them for around 3-4weeks. Initially she was very tired sleeping up to 20hrs a day and really unable to walk.Howeve r over the last few days she has been getting up and walking with little assistance and we have even managed a little trip out in the car. I know my mum is a very strong woman but she is hardly eating anything and having minimal to drink also. I am a nurse and have seen dying patients rally round days before death. Is this what's happening to mum or could she go on for weeks or even months. My sister is due a baby in a few weeks time and with Christmas coming I feel she is holding on for these big events.My daughter and i are over from australia on a one way ticket but have been here for 10 weeks now and with Christmas getting nearer I don't know whether to go back and spend it with my partner and son or to have them come over to the UK. My daughter also starts school in January so she will have to be back for then. Does anyone have any suggestions. Kinda feeling pressure from both sides and have no clue wot to do!!",
