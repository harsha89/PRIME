Dear carolina          I have been on arimidex the past 3 years and yes I have severe back pain .I thought it was either my kidneys or just another side effect , 3 years later from agressive chemo and radiation .Mine feels like I am having periods again, the way my back use to feel once a month. But I went into change of life after 1st chemo.Let me tell you, it must be the drug !!Every month their is some   new side effect.. pain in the neck.headache itch,sore chest on same side  that I had mastectomy,( 4 years ago no).I blame every ache in my body on it especially my back.I know it is suppose to keep me alive, but the anxiety you get with it, i  almost stoped it for good.One day i had severe chest anxiety, and pains in my cheat I stopped it for one day myself and it seemed to work when i skipped a day.I told my oncologist he didn''t say anything.I hope you feel better soon sarah",
