      "Content": "According to my own personal research & reading: I personally wouldn't recommend ANY tanning at all - it's just not good for us.  Having one cancer makes us more susceptible to other cancers.  And it's not natural sun so you're not getting any vitamin D from it.  Tanning isn't going to help you not to burn during rads.     Also sunscreen & tanning in a bottle has sooo many chemicals in them - some acting like estrogen- which isn't good at all, especially for those w/ ER+.  I wouldn't use any of them.  I no longer use sunscreen.  IF I need to, I use a chemical free one called  MEXITAN.   ",
