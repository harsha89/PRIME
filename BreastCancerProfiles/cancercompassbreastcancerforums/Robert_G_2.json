    "Content": "In October 1995, I had a right upper lobectomy. My doctor found no trace of spreading. In 1998, the cancer returned perched on the left Adrenal Gland. Surgery removed most but not all of the cancer. In March 1999, I had 25 radiation treatments. Cancer was diagnosed in remission. I started taking MGN-3 immediately after surgery in December 1998. Cancer is still in remission. I don't know for sure whether MGN-3 is responsible for the long remission, but I won't stop using it at this stage. I'm also taking Immunofin, which is supposed to stumulate growth of NK and T cells. Bob",
