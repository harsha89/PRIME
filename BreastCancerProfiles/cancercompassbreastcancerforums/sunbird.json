    "Content": "I just started with Aromasin after a failed year each with Arimidex & Femarra.  Has anyone expereinced better results with Aromasin?  With the other two, I had elevated cholesterol, feet swelling, high blood pressure, extreme joint stiffness - hands closed up like claws.  Felt much better both time when I was off.  I also lost 9.65 bone density on Armidex & 5.5% on Femarra.",
