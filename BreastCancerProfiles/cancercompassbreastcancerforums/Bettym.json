      "Content": "Hi Pat, I want to know if the CAAT treatment shrunk your husband's tumor or not as my husband was diagnosis with liver cancer & now spread to his pelvis bone. He just enrolled to the CAAT therapy. Are you sure the infection was caused by the treatment? As Robert John from A.P.John Institute told me that the Amino Acid doesn't cause any side effect & infection. Please let me know asap. Thanks. Betty",

      "Content": "My husband passed away on 2006, he did try the therapy, but I don't recommend it.  I know how you feel.  At that time western medicine didn't do any thing to my husband so I searched for alternative medicine, same as you I try to find every possible thing that might be helpful or maybe hopeful and I found AP Join Institute. My husband tried both of their pill & powder, each time he had to take about 26 pills, 3 times a day.  That was too much for him and he couldn\u2019t even swallow so I switched it to powder, it even worst. He took the medicine for about a month.  Anyway, it was a bad experience and I don't think it work.   Somebody sent me a message thru Cancer Compass a year after my husband passed away.  Her husband got liver cancer and they found out AP Join Institute is not really a cancer institute, may be you should find out more before you try it.  I don't know where are you located but I will suggest you to talk to Dr. David Lewandowski, Universally Aligned Health and Wellness Center.  He may able to give you some advice. His phone # is 626-376-3411 (in Los Angeles).  Too bad my husband didn't have the chance to meet him. God bless your husband & you.  Take care.    ",
