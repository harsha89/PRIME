Â The also want to do chemo, but the info I have found says Chemo & Hormone therapy are not effective. Surgeon recommends the radiation, but says don't let chemo people push you into anything, and that I should advocate for myself. Has anyone been in this spot. And what helped you to determine the correct path to take. Thanks FrancezHello, i am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Metaplastic BC is quite rare and therefore not well studied. Its hard to find information and support for your particular subtype. Many on your health care team will be looking at and primarily treating for the triple negative aspect of your cancer. The reason I'm very familiar with is my sister in law has been diagnosed back in jan 2017 and i read every medical journal i could find on it. As a breast cancer survivor myself, of a more typical and common pathology, when my sister in law was diagnosed, i jumped in and have been with her every step of the way. Hopefully, you have some great support as well. There is a very informative website: metaplasticbc.org specifically about metaplastic breast cancer, which are most often triple negative. Im the type of person who wants to know absolutely everything there is to know. My sister in law is the type who only wants to know what she absolutely needs to. I have been able to balance feeding her information as she wants it. If i can help answer some questions for you, id like to try. My experience makes me feel pretty comfortable in my knowledge with this disease. You need all the support you can get and there places and people happy to give it ?? I see your post was some time ago, so I'm assuming you are treatment, which is difficult in itself. I sure hope you are doing well and I'm praying for you!",
