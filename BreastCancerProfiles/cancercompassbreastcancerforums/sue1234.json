      "Content": "Oops, I'm so very sorry about your mom. I'm not going to lie to you, it's going to be really rough on all of you. The chemo has an accumulative effect. Make sure she takes all her meds appropriately. The thrush can be treated. One thing you need to know is take nothing for granted. Double check everything, Google everything for answers. Example; my husband got severe blood clots due to both the cancer and the chemo. I give him two shots of Lovenox in the abdomen, one in the am and the other in the pm. The shots hurt, although the RN told me they didn't. I asked her if she'd ever had any, she said no. Told her how the hell would she know. I couldn't imagine giving him a painful shot twice a day. I googled it. Come to find out, there is a prescription for lidocaine that will numb the area. The info on the internet said to put a dime size spot, cover it with press and seal for an hour, wash it off and his skin is numb. No one in the ER told me about that, I had to find out for myself. There are a ton of side effects from the chemo, really keep on top of every ache and pain. Keep a go-to tote with everything you need for a speedy trip to the ER or doctor. Keep a list of all your doctor's and their emergency numbers. If your mom ends up in the ER ALWAYS double check with her oncologist. The ER doctor was going to prescribe the wrong blood thinner for my husband. Lastly, get yourself some antidepressants, you can't help your mom if you fall apart. Join every support group you can find, they have some great ones on Facebook. Take care of yourself, it's going to be hard. I'm 62, I have promised my adult kids and my husband that I will be ok. Where is your mom getting treatment? Sue",

Please don't do that to your mother in law. Be aggressive with pain management.",

That's how it starts, a change in temperament and mood swings. My husband has cancer and i have joined a few support pages on Facebook. Surprisingly, for some of those people, the cancer diagnosis for their loved ones has increased the decline with their dementia. In some cases where they didn't have symptoms of dementia before cancer diagnosis they were presented with a rapid diagnosis with a sharp decline after. Does your mom take an antidepressant? That might really help. Good luck sue",
