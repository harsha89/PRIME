    "Content": "Hi Holly, I was diagnosed with astrocytoma stage 3 one year ago. I am 52 years old and when they told me what I had it floored me and my wife. Me it only took about a week to realize that if I do not get this attitude out of my head I could no way possible to beat it since it was non-operable. Well it took awhile to get my wife to think positive but we are, I went through radiation and chemo for the first 7 weeks at the same time. Well I had some fun with it when I started to lose my hair I told the wife I was going to get a mohawk. Well I did and the haircutter asked me if I wanted to do some thing funny. I told her yeah anything she wanted to do \u2013 to do it. Well she died my hair blue, green, purple, yellow and a couple of other colors. I had a ball with it. So just do something you always wanted to do but were afraid of doing when you were healthy but were scared to and have fun. It will relieve the tension and anxiety because you are doing something that you probably would have never done. God bless and stay strong. Ed from bullhead",
