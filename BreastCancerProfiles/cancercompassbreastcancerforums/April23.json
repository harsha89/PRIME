    "Content": "My surgeon said My Cancer required a mastectomy on the right side due to size of tumor. I decided to have a bilateral to be balanced. I am an active 80 year old and declined reconstruction. I was not prepared for Medicare to decline payment of a $1,500 bill for surgery on the left. Many phone calls have been made and we now have received notification that their decision (in capital letters) that their would be no further appeals. In retrospect lobular carcinoma in situ was removed from the left breast. Has anyone else had this issue with Medicare.",
