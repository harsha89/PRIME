    "Content": "I had a chest wall recurrence two years after my mastectomy and went on double doses of tamoxifin for 15 years and then went down to single doses making my oncologist unhappy but all was ok. Blood work was great and I felt fine. Two years later I was switched to Femara on the advice from a local (FL) oncologist. She also felt that I might be ok going off meds altogether. My Boston Oncologist did not agree with that but I did finally go off my meds and now it is 18 years after the recurrence and I have had metastisis to the bone and lung.....so if you have had stage 1v and on meds, don't go off of meds if you possibly can hang in. I am now on Aromasin and have all the side effects everyone is complaining about but I am going to stay on until my next blood test in Jan. to see if it is working. Hopefully it will help or we will have to try another med.",
