    "Content": "I to have been taking Aromasin. Just about 2 years. Prior to that I took all of the aromatase inhibitor drugs. Bad side effects. I'm on the down hill for taking Aromasin as I will be 5 years in May. I've often thought of stopping but did not have the courage to do so. My pain has increased with each month. I would say now on a scale of 1-15 my pain is at 15! My knees and feet and hips are so painfull it is difficult to walk, in fact I walk like I'm in my 90s! Hot flashes are minor, no depression but the joint pain is diffucult to deal with. I have been taking Motrin but am a little nervous about creating a problem with my tummy so I'm only taking Tylenol Advanced. I traveled to Italy last Sept and went off Aromasin for 8 weeks and was FINE! not perfect but just FINE. I walked and had engery it was great! When I went back on Aromasin is when I felt the pain increase. Not sure if that had anything to do with it or not. Drs. really do not have much to say except they recommend staying on for the long haul. Oh, the other problem is memory loss I know a little memory loss is normal (I'm 64) but this is a bit much..... I look forward to May when I will go off the medicine and hopefully stay Cancer free. My best to you and hope your pain will not get worse as mine has. Remember we are stilll here! Diane",
