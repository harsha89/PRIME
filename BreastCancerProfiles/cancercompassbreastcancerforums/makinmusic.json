    "Content": "I am a mom of a 5 yr old son.  He called today from school and said that he had a lump and it hurt alot.  I asked him where.  He said by his nipple.  When I asked him if it was due to a bug bite perhaps, he said that it was about an inch wide and hard.  I was obviously concerned, and as he wanted to leave practice early, I had my husband pick him up.  When he got home, I realized this was not just a bug bite.  The lump was actually in breast tissue under where the nipple was, and was about 1 1/2 inches wide, at least and inch top to bottom, and probably a 1/2 inch  thick.  It is hard like a mass, and is not really movable. It is not hot, so it is not an infection of any sort.  I found out that he has had it for at least a couple of months, only it started out really small.  It has hurt for a long time, but he just figured it was nothing.  The other side is completely normal.  I am very concerned, as there is prevelant breast cancer on my mom's side.  I know it is possible, but am having a really hard time finding out any information on this at all.  If you have any info, please post a reply... Thank you so much,  Penny",
