      "Content": "I hope this does not offend you all here. Quick history: I lost my best friend to Stage IV breast cancer last December.  She died 17 months after the diagnosis, it had spread to her bones and by the time they did the mastectomy and bone rads, it was in her liver, spinal fluid and then brain. She went from the regular chest port, to pills, to a port in the head at the end.  So, I am not sure what the \"norm\" is as everyone is different.  When it hit her brain she was declining rapidly - by the day, and, by the hour.   Fast forward to 4 months ago.  I was introduced to a woman who I found inspirational.  I have not personally met this woman, communicated soley through the internet.  She was dx about 10 years ago with uterine cancer.  Uterus was removed and she was cancer free for 5 years until a routine mammogram detected breast cancer.  It had spread to her bones, organs, lungs and brain.  She was on chemo (through a port in the arm?) but had the port removed and now on chemo in pill form.  Up to 4+ months ago she was saying how she was being told it was time to start palliative care.  Tumors were growing, she was getting confused, etc.  This last update was in December they were going to tell her if she should stop all treatment.  She travels weekly to concerts, cities for touring, checking off things on her list she wants to do.  Drinks lots of alcohol, is always running around posing for photos, has the energy of my 5 year old son.  Eats all the time, cooks extravagent meals, says she is going back to school, etc. She looks perfectly healthy. I guess what I am looking for - can it be like this?  Can you have this much energy with \"end stage terminal cancer\" (her words)  I see no resting, being ill, photos at the Dr. (unless it is a generic blood draw)  or really anything specific about her treatment.  Maybe I should not care.  Maybe I am still hurt over the death of my best friend, and how horrible the treatment was.  We went places while she was on chemo, but we needed to have a chair or place to rest at the ready.  There was NO way she could travel every weekend and hit bars and do all-nighters like this woman.  Now of course, she will say during the week how she is resting and over did it.  She is always feeling better Friday-Sunday. Maybe I am just in awe of how positive this woman is ... and she is legit.  If so I will feel terrible.",

      "Content": "Hi. My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily",

      "Content": "Thank you, Dodie. We found out Friday evening that she does, indeed, have cancer cells in the spine.  Tomorrow she is having a port put in her head to have the chemo get directly placed into the spine.  I am not trying to read too much about it, because it only took me about 10 minutes to get the idea that this is not a good thing.  It sounds like there is no hope.  :(  I have cried so much in the past few days, I don't know what else to do.  I want a miracle.  I want one so so bad.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys :)  I am trying so hard to be positive.  I cry at night the most.  I have so many thoughts from \"She is going to die\" to \"SHE WILL BEAT THIS, somehow, SHE WILL\"  and then I just start crying because I am mad and scared.  I have found the most help on reading peoples stories on here because they are real and just not some sort of person that has x amount of months to live like you read on medical sites.  I want to talk to real survivors and their families.  I want to talk to the families of people that have lost someone too.  I hope that makes sense",
