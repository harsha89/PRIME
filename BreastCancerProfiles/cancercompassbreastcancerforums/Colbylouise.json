    "Content": "I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with the DIEP flap. Dr. Chrysopoulo (Dr. C.) was my surgeon. From the moment I walked into PRMA, after having been sent there by my general surgeon, I felt that this was the place I had been sent to for a reason.  All the staff, from front office, to the RN's I had the chance to see, were so professional, yet, understanding. They answered any questions I might have had, and never treated me as just another patient.  Dr. Arishita was the on-call Dr. at the hospital the weekend I was there.  Loved his bedside manner.  I always felt that I had their undivided attention.  I have recommended PRMA to women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and will continue to do so in the future.  Travel for me was not a problem, as I live only an hour away from San Antonio.",
