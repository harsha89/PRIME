Hi thanks for your advice.  My uncle's condition is a leukemia.  I asked about a PET scan and the doctor's didn't think it would help.  I will continue to look for answers.     ",

      "Content": "Hi I was wondering if anyone has had these symptoms 4 years after breast cancer?  I was HER2 postive and had ACT and herceptin and radiation.  I have been experiencing sternum pain that radiates around to my back in the ribcage.  It is not on the same side as my breast cancer.  I had a lumpectomy on the left and 3 lymoph nodes were postive.  I had a full bone scan last week and I am scheduled for a CT scan with contrast this week.  I am worried that the pain is in the sternum but may be coming from my lungs.  I have some shortness of breath and I am fatigued.  It also hurts when I go out in the cold.  Any suggestions or if anyone has had this happen to them please let me know. SCARED. LJMA",

Lor Hi, I have been battling breast cancer and chemo related problems for the last year and can relate. I was told I was clean of my breast cancer w/o a pet scan being done.  I had severe reactions to many of the chemo drugs and doctor felt it would be in my best interest to stop chemo 3 sessions early.  I too, have been having severe bone pain and my stomache always seems to either be nauseas or in pain on my right side under my ribcage.  I was in the hopsital for several days for the pain that they  blamed on an obstructed bowel.  I started getting high blood pressure and edima and after finally having a pet scan ordered, they found another mass that is quite large behind my sternam and between my spine.  They believe it is cancer and are doing my biopsy next week.  Keep on your doctor about this,  I have no cancer markers in my blood, but neither did I when they found my stage 3 breast cancer.  Good luck and be persistant!!!Hi thank you for your advice.  I am seeing a GI doc on thursday.  Good luck on your biopsy.  Isn't it frustrating sometimes?  I'll let you know.  ",
