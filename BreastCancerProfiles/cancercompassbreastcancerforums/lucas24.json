    "Content": "Hello, everyone. I am not sure if this is allowed on the forums so, if not please remove.  I am a junior in college raising money for breast cancer research as part of a class project. As I go to school full time and work full time I am unable to volunteer all that much in week day functions so, I figured I could sell my artwork and give the proceeds as my contribuition. I am not looking for donations but, just help in spreading the word.  If it is possible to link to your social media pages like instagram, facebook, or twitter is would be greatly appreciated. http://artlumo.storenvy.com/ http://instagram.com/artlumo",
