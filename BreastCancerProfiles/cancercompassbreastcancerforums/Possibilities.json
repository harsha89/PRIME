      "Content": "I had many yearly mammograms, all negative.  I had been able to feel a lump in my breast for years but the doctors were convinced it must be a fibroid cyst.  Eventually my breast started itching like crazy, right where I'd always felt the lump but another mammogram was negative.  Then my skin began to pucker and there was no denying it anymore.  Mammogram still didn't really show anything, ultrasound was a \"maybe\", but MRI and biopsy confirmed breast cancer.  They referred to it as \"ghost cancer.\"  Four years after a lumpectomy, radiation, drugs and yearly negative mammograms, it has now metastasized to my bones--ribs, pelvis, spine and femurs.  (Completely found by accident when I went to the hospital for another reason.) I think we've been trained to rely on mammograms to tell us whether or not we have cancer.  I now always advise people to trust their bodies, pay attention to what's happening, and insist on more tests if something doesn't feel right.",

I try to take life one day at a time and keep a positive attitude most of the time.  It's definitely caused a shift in my thinking and I'm more greatful for the small things in life now.  And some things just don't matter at all anymore.  I can now joke with my family about having cancer rather than take it so seriously.  I'd rather laugh than cry; there will be time for that later on, I'm sure.  I've been back in contact with some people in my life that I had let go of and I've let go of some of the people that were in my life that didn't need to be anymore.  I feel much more at peace now and don't fret the small stuff.  I want my family to have good memories of me when I'm gone and to remember me smiling.   Best of luck to all of us!!!!!!  : )  Janet",

      "Content": "Hi.  I'm so sorry to hear about your sister's diagnosis.  I had breast cancer in 2011 and after treatment was told I was cancer free.  I was diagnosed with bone mets (ribs, pelvis, spine, femurs) a year and a half ago.  I too was shocked and devastated and my sister's first words were:  \"What am I going to do without you?\" so I know where you're coming from.  Unfortunately, about 30% of women who have \"survived\" breast cancer, no matter how aggressive the original treatment or how healthy the lifestyle, will end up with cancer metastasizing elsewhere.  There are many, many different treatment options and your sister will be part of making the choice that's best for her.  I take the hormone drug Arimidex daily and get a monthly injection of Xgeva.  The Arimidex caused tremendous bone pain but once I started with the Xgeva the pain almost went away.  I also started taking Prozac after about 11 months because I could feel myself sinking deeper into depression and not coming out of it as I got closer to the one year anniversary of diagnosis.  That was a lifesaver for me in several ways.  Aside from allowing me to deal with this more easily, it also decreased the horrible hot flashes I was having.  I live a pretty normal life right now with low to moderate pain and fatique but few other issues.  I'm less active and a little slower but most people don't even realize there is anything wrong with me.  Aside from the drugs above, I also take herbal supplements but if using those you need to really check them out first and make sure they don't interfer with the drugs.  Since my cancer is ER/PR+, I make sure the herbs do not affect estrogen, and many do.  Arimidex can have a side effect of issues related to the heart and after more than a year on the drug, my triglycerides and cholesterol levels began to rise so I started taking hawthorn berry herb and that has helped.  I also take Vit D, fish oil, calcium, a mushroom blend, and occasionally IP-6.  My last scan showed a tiny bit of improvement---no progression of cancer and a little bit of bone regrowth.  The day will come when this regime stops working and I'll have to try something else.  Remember, there is no cure for this disease but many people live much longer than the average diagnosis.  My doctor has said I won't need chemo or radiation till much later, if I choose to at all, and then it's not a cure but simply a treatment to either ease pain or hopefully slow down progression.  Every individual will need a different type of treatment and what works for one may not work for another.  I spent the first few months constantly on the internet, mostly scaring myself to death.  I finally let it go and decided to enjoy whatever time I have left.  One of the best things one of my cranky old doctors told me was:  \"Girl, go home and get your s**t together!  Start living and stop dying and you might find you live for many years!!\"  Believe it or not, it does get a little easier with time.  I still have my bad days and occasional tears but for the most part, I go on with my life and keep doing everything I can.  I'm traveling with my sister this summer to see family and friends.  I've even learned to joke around about my diagnosis with family members.  Try to find a way to help your sister laugh and enjoy whatever time is left.  Most cancer centers also have cancer counselors available for the family and it might be a good idea for a couple of sessions, just to cry and vocalize your fears.  Best of luck to your sister!!",

      "Content": "Hi Irma, I am much older than you but I'll tell you of my experiences.  I had breast cancer in 2010 and chose the lumpectomy and radiation.  I declined chemo and my surgeon felt I made the right choice although my oncologist disagreed.  They wanted me to take Femara, which I tried, but only lasted a short time on.  I had a horrible allergic reaction as well as going into severe depression (couldn't stop crying for days).  After that terrible experience, I declined trying any other hormone drug.  My surgeon felt she had removed all the cancer and told me I was cancer free. Last year I was told my breast cancer had metastisized to my bones and I'm now terminal.  And guess what---I'm now on hormone drugs to try and stop or slow down the spread.  I know that every person has to make their own choices about their treatment and you have to be okay with your choice.  I have no idea if I would still have this cancer if I had taken the hormone drug or had chemo.  No one can know.  Sometimes everything works out and sometimes it doesn't no matter what you do.  What works for one person doesn't work for everyone.  I don't worry about it because I made the choice that worked for me at that time of my life. You sound like you need to sit down with your doctor and have a more thorough conversation about the choices in treatment and what to expect from each and why each treatment is being chosen as the best for you.  Don't let anyone rush you into something!  There are many hormone drugs and you need to discuss the side effects of each and what to expect in the long run.  Some people have many side effects from the drugs, some don't.  I have hot flashes but otherwise feel well. I hope you get some more answers from people closer to your age who can give you a better idea of what to expect. Best of luck to you!!!",

      "Content": "Hi.  I just turned 60 this year so was 55 at first diagnosis.  I also am very sensitive to medications and have a lot of sensitivities to ingredients.  I was told about the possibility of uterine cancer with Tamoxifen but there are many other hormone drugs out there without that effect if you should want to try one.  Also, just because they want you to be on it for 5 years doesn't mean you have to be.  You could try it out and see what happens.  It took me a couple of months to adjust to this one--I take anastrozole, brand name Arimidex.  Had lots of pain at first but it went away and now I just deal with hot flashes for the most part.  But then I also take a bone strengthening drug which may have helped with the hormone drug side effects.  When I first had cancer and tried the Femara, the side effects were much, much worse and it was a horrible experience, which turned me off to trying other hormone drugs at that time.  If they had given me this one first, I might have continued it.  No, I'm not doing chemo or radiation, just the hormone drug for now.  At some point they'll probably use one or both of them to try and slow the progress but for right now the hormone drug is doing that.  There is no cure for metastases so chemo and radiation are used a little differently than for other cancers. On a side note, I have had friends who have taken Tamoxifen anywhere from 3-5 years with no uterine cancer and their biggest issues seemed to be hot flashes and depression at times. I know it's so hard to know what to do and all we can really do is research everything then go with what feels right for us.  I wish you the best!!!",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm so sorry to hear about your mother.  I know all the news is quite confusing, scary and overwhelming.  I, too, was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer, told I was cancer free, and now have terminal cancer from the breast cancer.  Mine was discovered completely accidentally after I'd been going to the doctor for rib pain for months.  30% of breast cancer patients will develop metastatic cancer---meaning the breast cancer cells spread somewhere else in the body.  It is still called breast cancer no matter where it has moved.  No matter how aggressive the original treatment was, or how healthy the lifestyle, 30% still develop this and doctors don't know why one does while another doesn't.  There is a lot of info on the internet under metastatic breast cancer.  Cancer cells are very tiny and no doctor can truly say you're cancer free, even though they do all the time.  What they should be saying is there is no cancer they cansee. I understand how confusing it is to hear that \"normal\" cancer treatment like chemo, etc, won't make any difference.  Once cancer has metastisized, it is considered terminal because there is no known cure at this time.  The treatment then becomes about extending your life and keeping you healthy as long as possible rather than trying to cure you.  That was hard for me to wrap my brain around in the beginning also!  My thoughts were \"why aren't you giving me something more than this pill to take?!?\"  However, I've been on oral medication along with a monthly injection for my bones for almost 2 years and my life goes on pretty normally, even though I have cancer lesions from my neck to my feet.  I just had new scans a week ago and I show slight improvement in some areas while a worsening in others.  There are various medications and treatment options available and sometimes clinical trials available as well.  Doctors may try different types of meds or treatments to see if they'll work and if not, switch to something else.  My experience has been it takes about 3 months to see if something is working.  Sometimes they will use chemo or radiation to try and halt progression or decrease pain but maybe not at the beginning.   I was in extreme pain the first few months and losing weight steadily but the meds finally kicked in between the 3rd and 4th months and I've been doing okay since.  I have times when I feel pretty good and almost normal but also times when I'm so tired and hurting and just want to lay in bed.  Those days are few and far between now though.  I have been able to live a pretty normal life since the meds started working.  I did go to a couple of therapy sessions from a cancer counselor, which helped, and after a few months went on an anti-depressant which has made my life so much better.  I go to bed earlier now and I'm a little slower but unless you know to look for it, most people can't tell anything is wrong with me.  I still get out and about and do almost everything I did before. While there is no cure and the prognosis you find online is scary, many people are living much, much longer now.  There is hope that this may be considered a chronic disease rather than just a terminal disease in the future.  Believe it or not, it does get easier as time goes on.  Right now all of you are in shock and fear.  Remember, it's okay to cry, it's okay to question, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to be angry, it's okay to fall apart for a while.  But the day will soon come when it's also okay to laugh, joke about it, and have a good day.  Your mother may live quite a while longer (years even), or she may not.  No doctor really knows because each patient is different and each responds to medication differently.  Take each day as it comes, live in the now and try to enjoy every moment you have together. Best wishes to all of you! Janet",

      "Content": "Hello Lesley! I am so sorry about your diagnosis and I know how scary and overwhelming it all feels right now.  I am 61 and going through my second round of cancer after first being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. First, stop, close your eyes, take a deep breath and then slowly let it out.  Imagine yourself breathing in Peace and exhaling Anxiety.  There is no need to rush into any immedicate choices or decisions. When you meet with your doctors again, they will make recommendations and you will have choices.  Remember!  You have time to go home and think about everything and do your research first to decide what is best for you.  They will suggest a lumpectomy or mastectomy based on your cancer.  The follow up treatment may consist of radiation, chemotherapy, medication or a combination.  The choice will be yours after their suggestions.  Depending on your current health and physical ability, you may be able to keep caring for your husband at home.  If you are in good physical shape other than the cancer, and depending on your treatment choices, you may come through all this fairly easily.  I was able to keep working with just a week off after surgery.  I felt more tired during treatment and slept more, but kept on doing what I had always done.  Even went hiking a few times! I am very sorry to hear about your husband's condition as well.  Remember though that you need to think about your own needs just as much now.  Hospice offers in-home care in most cases so your husband may not need to leave.  Having someone available to give you a few hours to yourself each day would be wonderful.  Do not be afraid to let others know you could use some help!  Many of us have a hard time asking for ourselves but this is one of those times when you need to accept all the help available to you.  Most cancer centers, that I'm aware of, have people to help you find what you need with these kinds of situations.  Joining a support group, if you haven't already, might also help with some of the stress and being overwhelmed. I wish you both the very best.  Do not dwell on the sadness of all this.  Enjoy and laugh every minute you can; watch funny movies; read inspirational stories; reflect on the good times; get out in the sun and live life.  Sometimes we have to fake it till me make it. Best wishes,  Janet                                                                  ",

      "Content": "Hi.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation in 2011.  It was recommended that I take medication for 5 years also to decrease my risk of reoccurance so I grudgingly went on Femara.  I had the most horrible experience with that and was unable to continue taking it  Due to how bad the side effects were for me, I refused further medication.  Last year I was diagnosed with bone mets, which doesn't have a good prognosis.  I have been taking Arimidex since the diagnosis and I agree with the above reply---it has been a little miracle pill.  Yes, I had side effects but nothing like I did with Femara.  The hot flashes are horrible and I had a lot of pain during the first few weeks but it went away.  Maybe because they added in an injection to help strengthen my bones but I don't know if that's why the pain went away or not.  Anyway, I've been on Arimidex for almost a year and I have shown improvement and feel great.  There are pros and cons to all medications and treatments so this needs to be her choice.  Everyone will react differently to the different medications.  I've read everything from \"no side effects\" to \"really horrible side effects\" with most all of them.  Perhaps another talk with her doctor about the percentage chance of cancer returning if she excludes the medication might be needed to help her make up her mind.  I wish her the best!",
