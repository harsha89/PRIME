      "Content": "Hi, just want to say hang in there and be your own best advocate. Last year starting in June 2006 I was diagnosed with lung cancer. Have since went through radiation and chemo then surgery to remove part of my lung and then more chemo and radiation and I am doing great. It is tough and scary while going though treatment but you just keep praying and also helping heal you body with self visualization. Every time I lay down I would visualize my cells attacking the cancer and killing it. Does this really work - I think so along with Gods help. Just remember if you body can heal a cut anywhere on you body it can heal other things but I think it needs a boost with the person mentally concentrating on it. One other thing is have someone with you when you are doing your chemo and treatments it is just good moral support-find someone that can make you laugh. Laughter is one of the best healing medicines. I wish you all the best and a very speedy recovery. Will add you to my prayer list. K.",

      "Content": "Scared is what most of us felt when we found out we had cancer. I agree that the waiting is one of the hardest parts. However if you feel you local area doctors are moving too slow try to go to a bigger treatment center. I had my treatments at Cleveland Clinic. From the time I was told I had a spot on my lung till they told me for sure it was cancer was 3 months which was terrible. I think you will find once your treatments are scheduled it is a little easier. However if you are constantly upset, depressed and or crying a lot please call your doctor they can give you anti anxiety medication that will calm you enough so you can function. The treatments will seem long (in months) but just remember they too will pass - and you will survive. Just keep fighting. I will add you to my prayer list. K",
