    "Content": "I have been on Femara for 2 1/2 years and so happy to say have NOT noticed any side effects.  Possibly a little achie at times but I am 67 so who knows....  I am so happy Femara is available...  I also get Zometa treatments once a month to stablize the bones-- for the effects of the femara on the bones....  Zometa does give me bone pain when I have my treatment ( for a few days-)- but I also have saline solotion added with it and it is much less painful. Hope this helps ",
