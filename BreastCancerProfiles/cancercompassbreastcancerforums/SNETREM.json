      "Content": "Hi Pat, Thre are very effective treatments besides chemo out there today! I personally know of 4 people who had end stage and survived for years with alternative treatments. I've been researching for my sister (4th stage BC mets to lungs) I'm convinced that chemo is not the way to go...it's proven not to work so far. Immune system boosting, detox, fever theapy & other alternative treatments seem to be more effective with often long term remission and sometimes even a complete cure. I hope you consider this. God bless you! snetrem ",

      "Content": "My sister went to her oncologist for PET results today.  If you remember, I've been having a time with my sister because her husband is abusive and won't allow her alternative doctors. She's stage IV BC mets to lungs & had a stroke a couple of weeks ago. The hospital had sent her home on HOSPICE 2 weeks ago. I bought Dr Hanoch Talmor's book called \"Uncondtional Healing\". IT's not really about disease as much as it is the power of positive thinking. I worked on forgiving my brother-in-law...and I prayed today while waiting for my sister to call me with her report. I kept telling myself...and imagining that she was healing. She's not had any tests since September 20th so it's been a month. She just called me to say there IS NO CHANGE and the swollen lymph node in her lung has gone down. She still has tumors in her lungs but not as many! Thank GOD. My sister has been taking care of herself at home, despite of her husband. She's been on the Doug Kaufmann diet (one I've never heard of) She's been drinking Essiac tea, taking  AHCC,  drinking oxygenated water and just started drinking acai & Goji juice. She's been trying not to get upset and \"imagine her cancer going away.\"  I call this a miracle! Her cancer hasn't spread further! Though she's living with a very abusive and controlling alcoholic she's focusing on peace and harmony as much as possible. She's amazing. She'll also start using Dr Clark's zapper when they come in the mail. I also bought her a water ozonator. We have a girl weekend set for April in Sanibel Island. About 9 of us crazy women get together every year or so...and my sister WILL BE THERE AGAIN THIS YEAR! I hope this story helps others to believe that God's medicines do work! ",

      "Content": "Sherry This is wonderful news! I can tell you did your homework before you let anyone talk you into poison & burn. You're right about this being a chronic disease rather than a death sentence. Our media wants us to believe there's no way out...but we now know there IS. My sister is doing the best she can do under her circumstances and she's on the right track...but she needs a doctor to guide her thru his. She sees a local holistic doctor, who happens to also be a neurosurgeon, but she's not giving my sister anything more agressive than the tea and AHCC. This doctor graduated in 1999 so, in my opinion she might be a little green yet. My next step (I'm working very gently on) is to convince my sister that she needs more aggressive treatment. What she's doing is keeping the cancer from spreading but she needs to reverse it instead.  I've found a doctor for her to see and she's thinking about it. I will also suggest that she switch to the Budwig from the Kaufmann because it's been proven to work. Vitamin IV is also essential...but she doesn't hear me yet. She's fragile right now so I have to walk gently to get thru to her. Her main focus is still \"not to upset her husband,\" which isnt' good. You continue to heal & please say a little prayer that my sister hears what I'm trying to say to her.  ",
