      "Content": "Dealing with cancer was right up there with my husband's mental illness.....I really found out who my friends were!  I learned to just put aside acomment's like \"why did he get crazy?\" and my favorites  about breast cancer, \" Oh! It must have been easy for you, you're a nurse!\" and \" Who found it?\"  People do seem so insensitive at these times, but , truly, it is simply awkwardness out of good intention.  It taught me a valuable lesson, and that was to anticipate their anxiety, and ask, \"Do you have any questions I may be able to answer?\" and use the opportunity to teach.   Trust me, it turns and awkward monent into a win, win  solution.  It also leaves a more trusting opening for your next encounter.  If  you just don't want to entertain these people, just say, \" Gosh, I'm just not feeling well today, you know, treatments and all....maybe another a time.\"  Then ask, \"And, how are YOU?\"  Hang in there, it will get better, I promise!\"",
