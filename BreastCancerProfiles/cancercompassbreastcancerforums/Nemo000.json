    "Content": "Hi, Im very sorry about your situation.  I am a breast cancer survivor.  What I can tell you about my experience is that having my family at home was great emotional support... for all of us.  Yes.. its hard.. I knew everyone was in pain.. watching me suffer.  I did not want to put them through this nor did I want them to  give up their lives because of me. But the reality is that I needed to give them just as much support  as they needed to give me. If I wasn't going to make it .. I had to be strong for them.. and help them accept God's will and find peace.  And yes, seeing them every waking day..holding them and loving them was critical for all of us.   The suffering and saddness was at times overwhelming but you do find moments of peace, and moments to talk about other things that matter.  I survived.i will pray for your mother. Regarding your job... jobs come and go, and your 25. You have your whole life ahead of you.  Under the circumstances, your employer might consider giving you an emergency leave of absence.",
