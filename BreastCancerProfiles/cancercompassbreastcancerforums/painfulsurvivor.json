      "Content": "I am a two year survivor of breast cancer, however I am suffering daily from post mastectomy pain syndrome. The pain worsens as the day goes on and it is often almost unbearable. I have been to pain specialists but cannot live on perscription drugs; pain blocks did not work. Accupuncture seemed to alliviate the worse pain but insurance does not cover such treatment and the expense is too much for me now. Have any of you experienced this and have found a \"cure\" for the pain? I cannot have reconstructive surgery until I can get a handle on this. Thanks for any input you might share.",

      "Content": "Wow, I have never heard that. My plastic surgeon told me two years ago not to come back until I was out of pain. Of course I have thought it couldn't get any worse, maybe I should go ahead, at least I would not be lopsided.   Thanks for sharing with me.",
