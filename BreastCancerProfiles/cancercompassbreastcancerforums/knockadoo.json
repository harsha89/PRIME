      "Content": "I have been on Femera since January and was on Arimidex for two months previously.  My big issue is muscle and joint pain.  Some days I can barely walk the pain is so bad.  It has been much worse the last month.  I find it hard to be on my feet long enough to get groceries.  I desperately want to be able to go for walks but I pay for it for several days if I attempt it even a short distance.  Does anyone have any suggestions?",
