    "Content": "Hi there :-) Hi there. My sister was recently diagnosed with ACC of the breast, and she asked her pathologist if her 'out of the ordinary' tiredness pre-diagnosis could be related to her cancer. He said that it was totally unrelated. I got a bit annoyed, as although it could be unrelated, I don't belive that there is enough information out there for him to make a 'conclusive' judgement and disregard the possibility based on his limited knowledge and information available - this is the first time in his 30 year career that he has seen this type of cancer. Did anybody else experience tiredness prior to diagnosis? I'd really appreciate your comments. Thank you :-)",
