The theory on my cancer is that it is a mix'ed genotype, it was first Er+,Pr+,her2-, after a series of chemo treatments it came back in three months as Er-,Pr-,her2+ only in my lymph nodes. After a number of different treatments mostly targeted treatment, the latest pathology shows Er-,Pr-,her2-. I have had 40+ cycles of chemo and raising to small kids. Six months ago I reduced my work days to two days a week, so that I ca rest more and spend more time with my girls. I am determined to beat or at least maintain this cancer. So to help to do that I want to start a more positive discussion on how to beat stage IV BC. This is my 4th year beating it. Hello and Congratulations on your success at beating cancer.  I am also Stage IV Breast cancer with 3 children.  My youngest is my daughter, who will be 8 this month.  I was first diagnosed in June of 2009 with stage II, hormorne positve breast cancer.  I was told it was a slow growing cancer.  I had two lumpectomies, 8 rounds of chemo, 6 wks of radiation and 5 scheluled years of tomoxifen. This treatment was recommended even though they only found trace amounts of cancer in my lymph nodes.  I was under the impression that chemo would be good for me and would ensure that the cancer did not return.  Almost 2 years later in May of 2011 i was informed that I was having a reoccurance of my breast cancer.  It had \"met\" to the plural space of my lung.  I had my lung drained several times and started chemotherapy.  After several months it was clear that the chemo was killing me more than the cancer.  It kept me ill and with dangerously low WBC.  I was then moved to a oral chemo (zoloda).  I tolerated this better but after 3 cycles (in late Dec) we found out that it was not working and to make matters worst the cancer was now in both my lungs, bones of the spine, ribs and breast bone.  This is when I began to dig and research.  I found out horible things about chemotherapy that is not individualized.  I also looked into alternative medicine.  I changed my diet, started working with a holistic practioner and stopped chemotherapy.  I am currenltly in radiation due to pain in my back cause by the bone mets.  I however feel better since I started the holistic treatment (balanced PH, vitamins/minerals and herbs) and changed my diet to vegan. I now eat a lot of raw foods and juice each day.  I am very prayerful and also use visiualzation techniques to rid myself of this cancer.  I would like to know what you have been doing since you have been so succesful.  Thank you and I am excited to talk to someone whose situation is similiar to mine.  God Bless! ",

      "Content": "Hi Springflowers, I was wondering how long it took before you saw a change in your markers and a decrease in the size of your tumors.  I have been on the alternative treatment for about 7 weeks and I got a new CT Scan just this past Monday.  The doctor called me and let me know that the pregression of my disease was worsening in my right lung and was unchanged in my left lung.  I must admit that I was hoping for better news and I am trying to stay positive during this next phase of my journey.  I know each individual is different but I am looking for a general timeline for using the alternative treatment and some signs that it may be working.  Thank you, in advance, for any information you can (or anyone reading) may offer. ",

Know there are times you can be so overwhelmed and have doubts the journey worth continuing---but, none of us invivted this beast into our body and we can make it just as uncomfortable for \"IT\" as it is making us..Good you are on whole foods, also intake only purified water.  Add Fucoidan and Phytoplankton to your supplements as well as Iodine to offset effects of radiation.  Curcumin and Indole3 will supress cancer cells in your body, the Fucoidan/Phytoplanktons show signs of actually destroying cancer cells.  Know you've been thru the pitts with the surgeries and recoup, it's not an easy journey, but you do have all here on this site to offer support and prayers, you are not alone, I never end my day without prayer for all my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ suffering from this disgusting vermin, let us hear from you, posting is good, keeps your spirits up and others do care...sending a biggie hug and cheer.    PS.,Tho I only lost little hair on Femara, I know how traumatic that is for us women, doc's sometimes don't realize how personal our hair is to us, nor do I suspect when they tell us \"that breast has to go\", but hey,  time to visit the wig store and be that wild redhead or bouncy blonde, don't worry, you are still you and love doesn't \"see\" our worrisome changes...Blessings to you. Springflowers-  You are an inspiration to me.  Your sweet spirt can be felt through this computer and I just wanted you to know that I am glad to know you!  Thank you for your support to us all and your positive outlook in all things!",
