    "Content": "My mother has recently been diagnosed with bc.  What she did not tell me was that she had seen it two years ago on a mamogram, however she had not only state medical help available nor insurance as she was caught in the financial inbetween.  She now has to wait 6 weeks for the prognosis which awaits because no doctor had room for her in our small community.  I have recently found out that I have three aunts whom died of bc in their late 30's.  I am almost 36.  I too feel I may have a lump where my mother has had benign cysts aspirated.  I am beginning to seriously consider elective surgery for a double masectemy (excuse spelling) if it is a legitimate proactive move.  Does any one know anything about this or have recommendations?
