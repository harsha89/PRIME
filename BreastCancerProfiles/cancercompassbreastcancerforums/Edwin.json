    "Content": "Hi, I am form Holland and my wife has being diagnosed breast cancer in 2003. While it has been away for almost 1,5 years its came back july '04 with metastasen in her lung and spine. The doc tried to treat her with Herceptin and taxotere but within 3months she broke trough and the tumors in her lung and spine started growing again. Then the doc tried Xeloda but it did not work either. Now they started with Gemcitabine and Carboplatin which is normally used for non small cell lung cancer. So far her LDH dropped from 3500 to 400 and the tumors shrunk. Does anybody had any experience with this theraphy in breast cancer? what were the results?",
