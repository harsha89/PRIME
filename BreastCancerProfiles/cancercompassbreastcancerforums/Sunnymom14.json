The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb GI too was warned of worsening hot flashes on arimedex. Sure enough, it was true. My dr. Suggested taking Effexor, an anti depressant/ anxiety med, that has helped patients reduce severity and amount of hot flashes. I refused for 3 months, thinking, I'm not taking another medication, especially an anti depressant! But I finally couldn't do it anymore. I've been ontaking it almost a year now. 75 mg. Has worked! Also, black cohosh and other herbs are plant estrogens. So need to stay away from those \"natural\" hot flash relievers. I saw an ad on tv for another anti depressant used for hot flashes.",
