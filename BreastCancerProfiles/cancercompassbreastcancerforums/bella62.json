    "Content": "I am 46 years old, just had a mamogram and sonogram for the first time.It was determined that my results was suspicious and a biopsy was recommended.  My results came back and it was determined that I have ADH level 4 and another biopsy was recommended to remove the suspicious mass which I was told is a simple out patient procedure. Should I get a second opinion and are there any other alternative or options in term of medication or vitamins that I can take to avoid the biopsy? And If I opt out of the biopsy will I contract cancer at some point?          ",
