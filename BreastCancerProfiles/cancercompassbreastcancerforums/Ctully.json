I had left breast mastectomy with removal of lymph nodes in early January 2017 and began my radiation in late March. My original incision which was completely healed (I thought). After the first radiation a spot opened with a tiny hole that continued to get bigger - like daily. My plastic surgeon stitched it back together. Each time another portion would open and he would stitch it back together - 4 times total. Now we are going to the OR for him to remove this area completely in hopes of finding viable tissue to begin the healing process. I have seen him almost weekly and he has had me on strong antibiotics to prevent infection to get me through the radiation. It would be interesting all these years later to see you all are doing.",

      "Content": "Candy, I was diagnosed with 2.0cm tumor in November 2016. Had mastectomy in January and one lymph node removed and have just finished radiation. It is pretty terrifying, but do try to take things one day and one step at a time. It helps to have someone to talk with, even if it needs to be a therapist or good friend. I found it difficult to talk to my family because I was concerned about them and how they would take the news. How are things going now?",

A few days after the last treatment she became exhausted and weak, can't eat, is light headed and sleeping 16 hours a day. Are these typical symptoms from radiation? The oncologist instructed to stop taking tamoxifen in case this was causing/contributing to her problems. Anyone have any experience or thoughts on this?       I had 36 radiation treatments and really felt good the first week or so. I did begin getting tired after a couple of weeks of treatment and continued until a few weeks after my treatment ended. Make sure she is getting enough protein and nutrients. Best of luck!",
