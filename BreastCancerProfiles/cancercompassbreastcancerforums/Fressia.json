Your friend is fortunate to have a physician willing to be careful & offer bipsy. My mother was told in '05 that the calcifications that showed up on imaging, finally, did not require biopsy & was characterized as a PITA when we kept calling. Less than a yr. later she was dead from 'benign' calcifications that pathology identified as agressive stage 4 breast cancer. The same happened to my eldest sister the following year. My youngest sister had 'benign' calcifications removed w/lumpectomy the next yr.  Pathology later identified her 'recurrences' as a multitude of malignant calcifications missed by imaging due to breast density but only after she fought for 'prophylactic' bi-lateral mastectomies based on family history. By then she was stage 4. By the time I was able to convince a physician to MRI & biopsy in 2009 at age 43 I was in stage 3 w/8 'tiny' malignant calcifications in my left breast. Post 'prophylactic' bi-lateral mastectomies (a fight for me as well as lumpectomy was strongly recommended) allowed pathology to identify more than 120 calcified DCIS lesions, tiny, small & large, bi-laterally stage 3, including lymph nodes, all missed on mammogram due to breast density. In my family calcifications=malignant cancer & mammograms are entirely useless due to hereditary breast density. Stereo biopsy while not the most pleasant of experiences, could have caught our malignant calcifications & saved several young lives. If it were me, I'd encourage my friend to celebrate the opportunity for biopsy & the relief or immediate treatment options it may bring. Best of luck to your friend.  On August 15, 2012, I was told that my mammogram showed calcifications, I had an ultra sound immediately, then a week later I had an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy. The calcifications, turned out to be cancer, a rare cancer cell, since this is the second tumor in the same breast, now I am going to have the breast removed, and it has been recommended that I have a reconstruction. So I can't say enough about getting a second opinion if needed, I was fortunate that I have the best doctors anyone could have at the City of Hope in Duarte CA, I am an 8 year cancer survivor, so to find out that I have a rare cancer cell, in my breast is alarming, but feel fortunate that it was found early. My surgeon told me\" if you are going to get cancer this is the kind you want to have.\"  ",

I have always heard Lymph nodes was not good. Can anyone give me any advice. I am in a real panic. Any advice is much thanked. Marti Good morning....I know that feeling of panic...further tests, and a full explanation as to what they found needs to be given to you, don't go alone to the follow-up, and if need be get a second opinion. I think it is terrible that they let you go home and then called you to tell you that news. I am a 9 year, second time breast cancer survivor....and I have had that same feeling of panic, when I was alone and the radialogist told they had found something in the same breast, I had cancer in almost 9 years ago. I had an ultra sound, then an ultra sound core needle biopsy.  Since then I have had surgery to remove the rest of my breast, cancer was unstaged, and very small, no lymph node involvement, and I am doing very well. Good luck, and God bless you.",

Sigh! My first thought was, I don't even have time to deal with the prospect of this. I just left one job started Real Estate on my own and I have a million fish to fry just like everyone else I'm sure. So I copartmentalized things for a few days but here comes a call from Rose following up on the letter and seeing when I could get the referral in. yep a dose of reality that really scared me. I was grateful yet really worried at the level of urgency. I just wanted to get thru my 46th Birthday stress free, I just needed to be in denial 3 more days. so I became proactive reached out to my primary in another state, and am getting the ball rollong. I just can't look at my breast the same. Today so many little things went wrong that normally I could push through. With this weight on my shoulders I broke down in the shower and cried my eyes out. It felt damn good too. I pray I don't have a long arduous fight ahead of me, but if I do I'm ready! Let's do this! Anyone who is interested in my journey, I'll be sure to keep you abreast (no pun). Don't be discouraged..it is ok to be sad and upset. I am a two time breast cancer survivor, it is a daily battle with the side effects from chemo and radiation, but after 12 years, I take each day as it comes, you might be worried about something that is really nothing, let's pray that it is just dense breast tissue. Wishing you the best..keep me posted I wiill keep you in my prayers.",

I saw my dr today who discovered the ones in my chest on the left side feel shoddy is what she called it. Barely swollen but noticable. I've got a Diagnostic Bilateral Mammogram at Friday at 1 pm at the big Breast Cancer center we have here.    I'm really worried and upset. I'm 31 and I've never had a mammogram and I just am frightened and my mother won't talk to me about this. Just tells me 'Don't borrow trouble' and I just really need a hug. Big Hug going your Way..So sorry that your Mom won't support you on this matter. I am 71 years old and a two time breast cancer survivor and have been through chemo and radiation, in 2005 I had a lump removed, then three years ago I had my remaining breast removed because cancel cells returned in the same area where I had the original lump removed. The cancer cells had not spread no lump was present, and it was not staged yet, so I agreed to to surgery. Don't be afraid do some research and learn all about what tests they want to perform, I firmly believe that the more that one learns is the best medicine, at least for me it was, and has been. They might also ask for an ultrasound. If you do not understand something ask, and don't go alone, take a friend, who is willing to take notes, and if you still have questions. Get another opinion, most insurance companies allow you to get a least two opinions, and most important Keep calm and do some deep breathing. Remember do not go along with anything you are not sure about, surgery and chemo, if that is necessary are serious issues. I don't know where you live but if you are being sent to a large cancer center, they will most likely have patient advocates, someone that can help you intervene for you and help you through this process. God bless you. If I can help you just write to me. I will keep you in my prayers~",

I have dense breasts but this determined after I had my first mammogram. Good luck you are being very strong. My prayers are with you. My Family Doctor is who haas referred me. She was really sweet and told me that the cancer center is really good. I think they said I would have an ultrasound after the mammogram. They said any other tests they want/need to do will be done that way and pretty much I will leave Friday knowing if it's cancer or not. I will call the breast center tomorrow and see if anyone could talk to me about this more. I think that's a good idea! thank you so so much for all your help! Good morning ..I am glad that I could help. Good luck with everything. There are so many new tests available, so don't be afraid, you are really young and healthy, I assume other than this new development with your health. You can also get help from the American Cancer Society there is a lot of information available and there are also a lot of support groups you just have to google and seek and find to see what is near your location.Prayer s going out to you again this morning.
