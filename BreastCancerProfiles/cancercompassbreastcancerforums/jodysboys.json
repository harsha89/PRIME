      "Content": "Good Morning, Bonnie, Yeah, I think the doctors often are not too specific or as forthcoming as we would wish them to be. Probably for a variety of reasons, none of which are much help when we all crave information.  Perhaps in these times of lawyers and lawsuits they are cautious.  Perhaps it is because each individual reacts and responds physically different.  Who knows.  But you are right, people who have been through it are the best help.  I have relied almost completely on the net and on women that I know who have been through bc for the bulk of the information I was/am looking for.  We are a sisterhood, you know. When I was getting the Adriamycin I was also was getting Cytoxin at the same time.  I never received them seperately.  So, most of the side effects I experienced could have been from either one.  However, my onc nurse who was a great help told me that some of the bruising I had during my treatment was probably from the Adriamycin.  It was not a huge problem for me.  But any little bump left a bruise that stayed for a while.  I especially noticed it on my poor bald head.  I lost my hair starting about three weeks after my first treatment.  I would bump my head pretty often and there was no hair for a cushion.  Ha.  One of the other things that was more of a frustration than anything else was that nothing tasted the same while I was on the AC.  Not even coffee, which is something I love.  Food didn't taste bad, just bland and tastless. I had some pretty tough nausea  in the beginning, but after some adjustments in my meds it got better.  I lost about 35 pounds which was a little scary because I have a tall, thin build. (5'11\")  Made me look pretty ill, more so than I actually felt.  I got tired pretty easily and rest helped but did not completely aleviated (spell?) the fatique.  After the first 5-7 days following each treatment I was able to do what I needed to do in the way of taking care of my house and family. Even grocery shop and run errands.  The last of the 3-weeks in between treatments I could also go back to doing some of the lighter farm chores around here and keep the grandkids overnight once in a while.  Seemed like the more active I tried to stay the better I felt, but I tried to get as much rest as possible when I needed it.  Helped with the anxiety too.  I sure have had plenty of that!  So, in short, the side effects I experienced could have come from either of the chemo meds.  But my inclination is that most of them came from the Cytoxin.  But I could be wrong about that.  I wish I could be more specific about each chemo drug. I took 4 treatments, 1 every three weeks for 12 weeks, of the AC.  I started in late Aug and finished in Nov 2008.  By the way, I quickly gained most of the weight back.  At this point, 14 or 15 weeks after finishing the AC, I am just 10 pounds short of my pre-chemo weight of 158 lbs.  Think the steriods I took during the Taxel part of chemo that I just finished had something to do with that.  They really increased my appetite.  I was hungry all the time!  Ha. I am slowly getting back to normal.  I even have hair now, although it is very short and fine.  I feel as good as I have since this all started and seem to have more energy each day.  My blood-sugar is back to being more managable, which is huge to me.  I am able to do most of the things I was doing prior to all this.  Things are falling back into place, slowly in some instances and quickly in others.  You will get here, too, Bonnie.  At some point in the near future BC will not dominate every part of your life anymore.  I don't suppose that part ever goes away completely.  But piece by piece we take back what is ours....  our lives.  There have been days when that seemed impossible but it is true and it is sweet.  I can hardly wait for you to get there, too, Bonnie! My heart to you- Jo  ",

      "Content": "Hi, Bonnie, It is so good to hear from you.  Wow, you have been through so much, dear!  I hope that that horrible rash and hives goes away and stays away.  I think that would drive me insane.  I had no idea you had been in the hospital, either.  But I am glad to hear you had a port put in.  They can be a bit of a pain in the butt at first, but soon I didn't even know it was there until treatment or labs.  Then I was just thankful for it.  So much easier.  Thank you for the congrats.  We are happy that the chemo part is done and ready to move on to radiation.  I think rad. may have it's challenges, too.  But hey, we just get stronger, don't we?  You certainly have.  Our regular family doctor is a cardiologist, Dr. Frank Paletta.  I come from a long line of family members with serious heart troubles.  Thankfully, I have not experienced any up to now that were not treatable with meds and just trying to keep on the healthy side of things like diet and exercise (most of the time anyway).  But I do have a very prolapsed heart valve, HBPand diabetes.  After reading about Adriamycin and the risk of heart damage, the first thing I did was call our family doctor for an appointment.  Our entire family have been patients of his for over 20-years and I trust him completely.  My oncologist had been keeping Dr. Paletta up on my treatment and all labs and so on from diagnosis on.  So, Dr.P. was aware of the up coming chemo and the drugs involved.  When I went to see Dr.P. he gave me a very thorough check-up and then we sat down to talk.  He was not overly concerned about the Adriamycin and it's possible side effects on my heart, even with my family history and health history.  He was more concerned that the cancer be treated with the best course of action there was.  Dr. P. had spoken with my oncologist and was satisfied that he was  aware of all my health history issues and that the oncologist was on the right track. Needless to say, I felt much better.  I have since been in to Dr.P. for my regular 3-month check-ups for the diabetes and all was well. So, that is my story.  Hope it helps a little.  You are so brave, Bonnie.  I am just cheering so hard for you!! God Bless, Jo",

After two treatments, now my oncologist wants to add Adriamycin, siting a recent study, but only use Taxotere for the next two treatments, then 4 of Cytoxin and Adriamycin. I have had a real hard time with chemo, and never thought I would live through it and Adriamycin scares me to death. Please send comments and recommendations. My next chemo is Friday. Help! Bonnie Good Morning Bonnie, I have thought about you so much.  I have not had much time to keep up with the message board in the last couple of weeks, so I may have missed some of your posts.  But I have certainly wondered how you are doing and how the chemo is going for you. I did not get taxotere with my chemo, so I am not very familiar with it.  However, I did get the Cytoxin and Adriamycin together for my first round of chemo.  It is called AC for short.  You have probably done some checking already, but these drugs are meant to interfere with the reproduction and growth of cancer cells. Cytoxin's job is to interfere with the growth of cancer cells and to slow down their spread.  Adriamycin is an anti-tumor antibiotic that gets in the way of enzymes invovled with DNA replication.  Adriamycin works well in all phases of the cell cycle and is used for alot of cancers. Remember, when you are reading or hearing about these chemo meds that many side effects are going to be listed.  That does not mean you are going to get them all.  They list the most common, certainly, but common can mean anywhere from 5% of patients on up.  I have always thought that it would be nice if the manufacturer or the docs could be just a little bit more specific about this.  For example, tell us that \"this side effect\" has a 20% chance of happening to you and so on.  But I think that other factors play a role in the side effects that we experience making it pretty hard for anyone to predict just what each individual will experience.  Things like your age, overall physical health or menopausal status and probably many others as well.  I know you have already heard this, but these treatments are made of very powerful drugs.  They have to be powerful.  You are fighting a very mean, agressive, low-down, sneaky disease.  Sounds like you have a doc who is willing to bring out the big guns to fight it.  The problem is in addition to fighting the cancer, we end up fighting fear and anxiety over the treatments, as well.  I know those fears and that anxiety all too well myself.  Bonnie, you have two treatments BEHIND you now.  After next Friday it will be three BEHIND you.  If I can give you any advise at all, the most important thing would be to always look ahead.  Only look back to say that I have now come this far.  You are in the middle of what I thought was the toughest part of treatment and you are not just at the beginning of it.  You are getting treatments under your belt and moving FORWARD each day.   How are things going with the management of your side effects to this point?  Do you and your onc people have the nausea issue still under control?  Are you able to get the rest you need?  How about your day-to-day activities?  How have those worked out? On this end, I completed chemo Jan. 30!  There is a big brass bell at the oncology center where I go and when you complete your last chemo you can ring that bell.  My two youngest boys, ages 11 and 13-years, and my husband went with me Jan. 30th.  And we all rang that bell so long and hard that folks must have thought there was a fire alarm going off!  Ha!  It was a sweet, sweet sound let me tell you!  We are taking a family trip together in May to complete our celebration.  It will be all my grown kids and their families along with my two young ones.  We are going to St.Marteen and St.Thomas in the Virgin Islands.  Can hardly wait.  You know, you should start thinking about what you want to do to celebrate your finish with chemo.  I can't think of anything more important to celebrate!  We certainly earn it!! Bonnie, you take good care of yourself.  Let me know how you are. God Bless, Jo    ",

By the way, it is chemo-brain and not the age thing.  You and I are about the same age and I say there is no way it is the age! Ha.  I am so thankful to be through with the chemo that each day I wake up early thinking , \"What can I do today?\"  There is such a list that has been put on hold for nearly a year now.  Not just for me either.  For my husband and young sons, as well.  We farm as part of our living.  Chores that once were just that, chores, seem like a gift now.  Yep, even cleaning out an emergency spillway on a pond in pouring down rain at 6am.  O.K., maybe that one is not a gift, just not so bad. Cancer invades our whole lives.  There is not an aspect of everyday living that is not altered greatly or in small aggrevating ways by it.  Fear and uncertainy become the order of the day before we know it has us.  I find myself angishing over Bonnie's worries and fears as well as other women that post and those whom I know who are going through what we have gone through with bc. Because I know the fear and the anxiety so well.  But we made it through, as do so many other women.  And we are stronger beyond any strength we have had before.  My hair is coming back slowly but surely.  Eyelashes and eyebrows are, too.  It was thick and course before bc, but is fine and thin now.  Wonder if it will stay that way?  O.K. if it does, change can be good!  To tell you the truth, I did not miss my hair as much as I thought that I would.  Thinking of keeping it very short from here on.  I have missed my lashes and brows, though.  I took tired without them.  I did the Look Good Feel Better program and had a blast with it.  I even bought a couple of wigs....which I never wore.  My grandkids have had a little fun with them, though. I can not put into words how much the people who post on this site have helped me and my family through this.  (And I am one of those folks who had used the internet maybe 3 times in my whole life prior to last summer! Ha.)  There are some really amazing people out there. Today I am thinking alot about Bonnie.  She was to have another chemo treatment today, as you probably know.  I am hoping that all went O.K. for her.  I always felt that each of the AC treatments was a huge step forward! Deb, thanks for taking the time to write and to encourage.  It means so much, you know.  A hopeful and positive word is contagious!  God Bless! Love, Jo",

She got in first try and the Cytoxin was first, that was fine, Taxotere burnt, so she had to slow it down. The infusion took 4.5 hours. I was given Compazine 10 mg before the treatment and went home with that and Zofran, which I am taking around the clock for 3 days. This is my last day of Decadraon. I have noted some generalized puffiness, and flushing, - face and chest, especially in the areas that previous breast biopsies and the axillary node disection was. Otherwise I am feeling fine and drinking lots of water. One down, five to go. I realize it probably will hit me in a day or so, hopefully not too bad. Thanks to all, Blessing for the New Year, and I plan to continue to post. Still unsure whether I will to to radiation, or double mastectomies after chemo. Still consulting. Maybe both.

      "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy and a lymph node disection in July 08.  I am now completing (only 3 treats. left!!) chemo and then will have radiation after that. Yeah, the bra thing was an issue for me, too.  All my surgery was on one side and mostly under the right armpit area.  I also had a port surgically put in for the chemo which was located on my left upper chest area, about where a bra strap and bra come together. So, it was a bit of a double-trouble thing. I was also told that a sports bra would be the best, but it was not very comfortable for me.  I found them to be too tight and consticting after about an hour or so on.  So, I began a pretty long search for a comfortable solution.  I even went to a specialty bra shop without much luck. After trying and collecting (and I'm not exagerating) about 20 different bras I decided to see what I could do on my own to modify a bra and make it work well. Now, this may not help you, because we are all made differently.  I am a size 36A.  I'm pretty bony, especially in the upper body area.  This might not work for a woman with a larger breast size than say a B cup.  But this is what I did and has since worked for me: Find a bra that is comfortable for you now.  For support I picked a fairly thickly padded push-up type bra that was cut a bit like a demi-bra. This type of bra seems to give me support with out the binding feeling. Most of the bras like this have underwires and/or stays.  I removed the underwires and side stays by cutting a very small slit in the casing that the underwire is in.  I pulled out the underwires.  I took the side stays out too doing the same thing.  But if you are not having surgery in this area you may want to try and leave these in at first.  Also, because you are removing the underwires I found that a bra with slightly thicker width straps was more comfortable.  I my case, the port was also an issue.  The location of the strap, even on a demi bra, was painful.  So, I moved the bra strap over about 1-inch toward the side by removing the stitching and then re-stitching the strap where I wanted it.  Had to do that on both sides so the bra would fit evenly. As I said, this may or may not work for women with a larger breast size.  As for the down time you should really ask your doc.  But even with a lumpectomy and a node dissection with a drain I was back to fairly normal activity in about 12 or 14 days.  I think it may depend on your level of activity at work, though. Best of luck to you. Jodysboys",

Yes, the steriods can make you gain weight.  But don't worry about that right now.  The thing your docs will want is for you not to loss too much weight.  They will probably monitor you closely.  Glad you are getting a pic line.  SO much better than an IV each time you go!  The anti-nausea meds you will be on are familiar to me.  I have had both in the past and they worked well for me.  But if they don't seem to be doing the trick for you, speak up.  Don't just suffer through.  There are many anti-nausea meds they can give you if these are not doing what they should.  Remember to drink plenty of fluids.  They will really help you feel better faster after each treatment.  You are going to do great.  I really believe that!  Keep us all posted.  There are a lot of us pulling for you.  You are not alone in this.

Your hardest task right now is to try and keep a positive attitude. If you can do this, the chemo and everything aspect of it will be easier.  All the folks who replied to your post would agree, I know. Between now and the treatments you might want to try and do some preparations.  One of the things I did was to fix some microwavable dishes ahead of time and freeze them.  Later, you can get them out and heat them in the micro.  Less cooking odor that way and yet you can eat as you should.  Do things around the house or whatever that you may not want to mess with during your treatments. You know, have the idea that there are things you can do right now in the next few days that will take some of the pressure off after you start your chemo.  Like you would plan for a trip or something.  Since you are not sleeping this might help with the time, too.  Do you like to read?  Do you enjoy movies?  Music?  I found that keeping my mind busy with escapes such as reading, watching movies or listening to music was a help.  I rented audio books and that was fun, too.  There is something soothing about having someone reading to you. Your local library will probably have these and there are many sights on the web to down load them. The hardest thing of all is keeping a good attitude, Bonnie.  But it is just as important as any meds or treatments. Everything depends on this.  You can do this.  And I have the feeling that you will handle it all in stride.  I think you are much stronger than you give yourself credit for being.  All of us who have been through chemo or are going through it know the fear you are feeling right now.  You are not alone, dear. I have a feeling that you need to get this show on the road!  Much of what you are feeling right now is fear of the unknown, scariest kind of all.  After your first treatment, there will be much less of the unknown.  That will really help you.  I will being thinking of you this week, as will so many of those you have spoken with here.  You have a cheering section on this message board, you know!

Thanks  -  Happy Holidays  -  Jill Dear Jill. I have stage 2A HR+ breast cancer. I was diagnosed June 17, 2008.  I am an almost 51-yr. old mother of 5 and grandmother of 12. I have had a total node dissection on the right side and a second surgery to remove additional tissue.  I am in the middle of the second round of chemo.  The first round was AC.  It was 4 treatments over 12 weeks.  This round is Taxol.  It is 12 treats, 1 every week.  I will, hopefully, finish up chemo Jan. 30!  Then 6 weeks later I will begin radiation, 5 treats a week for 6 wks.  I worry about not having the lymph nodes and how it will effect my life.  I also worry about how all this treatment stuff has and continues to effect not just my life but the lives of all those around me, both short term and long term. After all, all these trealments are very serious stuff.  But I can honestly tell you that at this point I am confident that I made the right choice in going through all the above.    I certainly would not classify any of this whole breast cancer thing as fun or easy.  Anything but that.  But I also know that there is no quick fix for it.  Cancer, in my mind, is a mean, sneaky and coniving thing.  It takes a lot of weapons to fight it.  I'm talking medical, spiritual, emotional and physical weapons.  I want to use them all.  You see, this cancer has already taken up a huge part of my life.  I has invaded nearly every aspect of my life for the past 6 months.  I will be darned if it will get anymore than I have to give it!!  I don't want to have this dark, loaming cloud hanging around my mind the rest of my life.  I want to know that I have used ALL the weapons I can to take away as much of the chance of the cancer showing up again for a repeat performance.  I would not call any of the treatments so far as being fun.  They are not, though, so bad as to be completely intolerable to me.  And some of it has certainly been easier that the rest.  The surgeries were not too bad.  The first round of chemo was tough for me.  But thankfully there were only 4 treatments of the AC.  The Taxol has really been fairly easy, to this point.  I have 6 treatments under my belt and 6 more to go.  No nausea at all with it.  No pain other than cracked lips and dry eyes..both fixable.  Just some fatigue.  The radiation is yet to come, so I can not tell you anything about my experience with it. But my understanding from several friends and family that have had radiation in the recent past is that it is another inconvenience, but managable in most ways.  So, we'll see. I have also tried to find as much out about cancer fighting nutrition and life-style.  And I have taken some steps in that direction, as well.  Another weapon, you see.  And then there is my biggest secret weapon.  Faith.  Obviously, you do have and will have some choices to make in the very near future, Jill.  Most of them will not be easy and probably shouldn't be anyway.  I guess what I am saying to you is this.  You were not given the choice between having cancer and not having cancer.  But you do have choices in your treatment or nontreatment.  I hope that you use all the resources you have to make these choices.  There is a great deal of information out there.  Information is power.  But only if it is good information.  (It sounds to me like you are on the right track with your searching for answers.)  Talking to many of the patients, survivors and caregivers on this message board and on others is one of the best sources I have found.  As far as quality of life goes, well here is how I feel about my quality of life.  It was great before all of this.  It's not at the best level for now.  But that is temporary.  My quality of life will be absolutely fantastic, once again, in the near future!  It's all my weapons, you see. I don't know if I am any help to you, but I hope so.  I know how overwhelming all this is, especially in the beginning.  I wish you all the best. God bless- Jodysboys PS- 1 node positive sounds encouraging to me. ",

Not sure what type. ALways had yearly mammos, ate right, washed the barbecue grill off before grilling, never smoked, rare glass of wine. Weight normal, probably could have exercised. more. Node desection will be done Tuesday for staging. So afraid of chemo, radiation and probably bilateral mastectomies, (how else can you monitor it's return, before it spread to other organs?) Has anyone else had any experience with this type of presentation of breast cancer? I need some reassurance. Hi, Bonniee I did not have neg mammo, sono or MRI.  They were all positive. So, that part of my experience is different from yours.  I did have a node desection and lumpectomy on the right side, however.  The first surgery was July 7, 2008 and I had a second July 28, 2008 to remove more tissue from the tumor area.  Since then I have undergone chemo and will over halfway through that.  Next will be radiation.  But though our diagonsis may differ I can tell you about my experiences so far and maybe a bit of what to expect.  First, try not to let the fear take over.  Learn as much as you can about breast cancer, the treatments, the side effects... all of it.  The internet is a great place to go for this, but pick your sites carefully.  There are some that do not have as much behind them as they should.  Try the NCI (National Cancer Institute) and Chemocare for starters. Do just what you are doing now and talk to other cancer patients and survivors.  They have a wealth of information that you may not get from your doctors because they are or have lived the experience.  REMEMBER Knowledge Is Power. After your surgery be sure to get the written pathology report.  It may be confusing.  There is alot of medical terminology that will likely be used. But go over it with your surgeon line by line.  Take the time to take notes on what your surgeon says while you are going over it with him/her.  Have someone else there with you for a second set of ears.  If you have questions that you think of later (and you probably will) be sure to call your surgeon or ask at your next appointment.  AGAIN Knowledge Is Power! The pathology report will answer many questions for you and for your doctors.  It will tell them the staging, type and grade of your cancer.  All these things will define the next part of your treatment.  The pathology should also answer many of your questions about whether or not your cancer has spread. OK.  If any of your nodes are positive, your next course of action may be chemo.  I'm gonna be honest, the first round of chemo I had was tough.  It was called AC (Doxorubicin and Cytoxan). I had 4 treatments at 3week intervals. The nausea was not insufferable because of great anti-nassea drugs, but it was not much fun.  I lost all my hair except eyelashes and brows.  Basically, I felt like I had a really bad case of the flu for about a week after each treatment.  Then I would start to feel better and regain some appetite over the next couple of days.  By the 10th day after treatment I felt pretty good.  Then we would do it all over again.  Now the AC treatments are behind me and I am continuing my chemo with Taxol, 12 treatments over 12 weeks.  I have had 3 treatments of this. So far these treatments have been much easier than the AC. I have had no nausea.  In fact I have gained back 5 pounds of the 20 or so I lost with the AC!  I get tired easier, but so far I am able to deal with that.  No other troubling side effects to this point though. If all goes well, I should complete chemo Jan 30 and start 6-weeks of radiation in mid March.  Bonniee, I don't have to tell you that this is a very frightening time.  You are likely feeling a landslide of emotions right now.  I sure did and continue to feel them.  This cancer has tried to invade my whole life!  But one of the things I decided early on was that it was not going to get ALL my life.  I was going to have some control, whenever and where ever I could.  I decided to stay as physically fit as I could through this whole thing. (Not something I was too terribly inclined to do before).  I also decided that the things that I could do, I would do.  For example,I love to work around the garden and outdoors.  We farm so that is really a big part of our lives. There are days when I am lucky to feel like brushing my teeth.  But there are also days when I do have more energy and I can do some of the things I have always loved to do.  Three weeks ago we vaccinated cattle which is a big job here.  I was right there in the thick of it.  You can do this, Bonniee.  If I can, anyone can. I still get scared, especially late at night when the house is quiet and it is just me and my thoughts.  I try to talk to God (even though He may get awfully tired of my rattling) until I go to sleep.  I also keep a small journal.  Writing in that, if only a few words a day, seems to help.  I write down any thing about my physical feelings but also I write about my emotions, fears and concerns.  Then I close the book and get on with things. It helps. Please post and let me know how your surgery goes.  I will be thinking of you until then. God bless, Jodysboys      ",

I was thinking of you last evening and remembered something else.  Are they going to give you are port if you have to have chemo?  I have one and it has been a wonderful thing throughout my chemo treatments. It has made receiving the treatments SO much easier that an IV and basically pain free. My thoughts to you- Jodysboys  ",

      "Content": "Hello, Bonnie! Glad to hear from you.  And I am glad to here the disection is behind you.  Now comes the waiting, right?  I do not have a PIC line.  What I have what is called an implantable port.  They use it to give me the chemo meds, pre-meds and so on..really pretty much any meds that they need to give me through an IV.  They can and do use my port to draw blood, as well.  I think it is the most wonderful invention ever.  One nearly painless stick and they can do my blood test and then using the same needle give me my pe-meds and then chemo! My port is just under the skin just below my left collar bone. It is small, a 3/4-inch disc-shaped device.  There is a small line that runs from my port to a vein under my collarbone. My collarbone actually protects the line. You can not see this line, as it is internal.  It was put in surgically and was pretty much pain-free from the beginning.  They put it in when they did my second surgery prior to starting chemo.  The port can stay in as long as I need it to as long as there is no infections or it becomes unusable.  They tell me this very rarely happens.  I just have to have it flushed (again, a simple, painless procedure) about once a month when it is not being used on a regular basis. Tomorrow I go for another chemo treatment.  I have a great oncology nurse.  I will ask her about PICs and try to get all your questions answered.  I have seen many of the other patients taking chemo at the  facility I go to, with what I think are PICs.  So, Tammy, our nurse will know the answers.  I will post to you as soon as I get back tomorrow evening and let you know what I find out. Guess what Bonniee, you are taking those baby steps and they are getting bigger!  I am cheering myself silly for you! Stay busy and stay positive.  I'll talk to you again tomorrow. jodysboys",
