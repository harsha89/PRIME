    "Content": "My wife and I are currently in \"the fight!\"  She had a mastectomy 10 days ago and is now preparing for chemo treatment.  I have to admit it's been a difficult ride for her, but also for me.  I make sure I'm at every appointment.  I've been right at her side giving her as much support as I can give.  I've realized that I'm running myself down and don't have much, if any, support for me.  I'd never let my wife know this beacause I know she'd worry about me.  What I did learn is journaling has now become part of my life.  It allows me to express myself and my feelings.  Journaling is a really nice release for me!  I also started a blog discussing the \"journey\" my wife and I are going through.  If you're a husband and are having a tough time... try this!  Read my blog if you're intersted.  www.whatarideblog.wordpress.com I hope this works for you!",
