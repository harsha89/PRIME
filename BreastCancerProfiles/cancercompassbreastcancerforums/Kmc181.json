      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 mths ago. She had gotten a masactomy and went thru chemo for 6 mths and then found another tumor in her chest wall on the same infected side. She was supposed to go thru radioation right away but since she wanted a 2nd opinion from a different surgeon it took about 2 wks to get into see her. she was recommended to go thru radiation therapy first to target only that tumor area and hope it shrinks. Now the doctor suspects their may be another tumor near her rib on the same side. she will be going to get a cat scan tomorrow. Previously she had a cat scan three wks ago and nothing showed in that particular area. can a tumor grow that fast? any suggestions? I am very concerned.",
