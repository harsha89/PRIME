      "Content": "On Sep 18, 2012 12:21 AM doggy wrote: I had a lump under my nipple that was painful also, I have cancer in my family so the drs checked and found out I had Ductal carcinoma which is cancer of the milkducts and I was stage 1-2 grade 3 which is the most aggressive type. when they did the masectomy they found the tumer 3mm from my muscle lining, so I got in there just in time. dont wait 6 months,def go get another opinion because depending if its cancer or not 6 months may give a positive tumer time to invade and become terminal! Sorry to be so harsh and upfront but time may not be something you have alot of. Good luck and be strong, you are woman, roar girl! I went for second follow up with a clinic. I got my Brest scanned again. The 2 lumps have not grown nor have they shrunk. The doctor is 90% sure that it is Fibroadenomas not malign. However he suggested , since it hurts I could get them removed and these could be sent to Lab for further testing. Thank you so much for offering me help.",
