      "Content": "I have had 2 treatments of Gemzar and have had some really weird reactions to it. I have had swelling of the throat, hives, tingling of feet and hands, tightness of the throat. The swelling of the throat started when I would eat ice cream or popsicle or a cold carbonated drink. My mouth would get all tingly and then my throat would feel like it was swelling. I would immediately take a benydryl which I had a hard time swallowing and then I would be ok. These effects did not occur until about 4 days after my treatment. Most symptoms occur either immediately or within the couple of days that the chemo is in your system. I have treatments on Fri and this would occur around Mon or Tues. Dr is flabbergasted. She has taken me off Gemzar and am now doing Navalbine which she was going to do a combo with as soon as I got my port in. Has anyone else had any of these symptoms with Gemzar. It is suppose to be very tolerable. Does anyone know whether navalbine is as good as gemzar because this is a mets from breast cancer to lung and some nodes in the middle of the chest (sternum I guess) area. I'm hoping I didn't have to give up a great drug.",

      "Content": "Hi I am new here. I had stage II Breast Cancer diagnosed in 2000. I had all the treatments, chemo, radiation and am currently on arimidex for last 2-3 years. I started to experience shortness in breath (unfortunately I am a smoker trying to quit)Went for regular oncology visit and sent for chest xray. To my surprise I had fluid covering 3/4 of my right lung (pleural effusion) Had 1.5 liters drained and they found no cancer cells, 2nd drain still found no cancer cells. Dr is going in on Tues May 30 with a camera and will drain the fluid and take biopsy. If cancer is found will put talc around lung to help adhere it to the chest and rib area to prevent fluid from accumulating. Of course I am scared to death. Has anyone had the pleural effusion and it was or was not lung cancer? And if not what caused it? I have been a survivor for 6 years and was hoping that I would stay in remission, we'll see. Of those that did have lung cancer mets, how was your prognosis and what treatments? My husband drives truck and is not here for this treatment, luckily I have family to help. I enjoy going on the road with him, but if I need treatment, what will it most likely be or will it be medications so that I can still go on the road with him. Thanks for any help or info.",

      "Content": "I did have the surgery and it was Breast Cancer cells to the lung. What kind of chemo treatment is your mom having? Does she get ill from it and has she had to lose her hair again. My husband drives a truck and he is worried that I will be very ill on the chemo. I go to my oncologist Fri to find out what regime I will go through. Is your mom's prognosis good? Don't know mine yet, only know that it was better that it was br cancer to lung rather than new lung cancer, prognosis would not have been good. I have to convince myself that this is not my death sentence. Having hard time with that. Thanks for sharing. Marty in VA",

Does you mom still have her energy level. I know the first time with chemo was not fun at all for me and hoping this one is less severe. Thanks",
