      "Content": "I completely understand the feeling that the choices are like a maze, and many mainstream hospitals try to put a patient down the pipeline like a sheep getting sheared for the $200K they get from routine BC treatment.  Try to look for oncology with \"integrative care,\" which seems to be the phrase describing treatment aimed at whole health. Such physicians will hopefully help remove some the reasons that contribute to BC and recurrences. I had a breast tumor removed, did 5-day APBI radiation, and hyperbaric oxygen to help after radiation damage - extremely healing after my poor breast\u2019s nuclear meltdown. Vitamin E and Bromelain is shown to help cell recovery too; I had a bottle of each during the month after. There are many types of radiation treatment to consider, and I advise seeking info on all of them & their side effects to make your choice. Wide Beam 35 day treatment is only one route; you may be eligible for other types (APBI, brachytherapy, etc). I did not do chemo, since I had no positive nodes and per Nottingham Prognosticating Index (NPI), chemo was \"of doubtful benefit\" for my case. I found NPI helpful to determine treatment plan - my onc was pushy for chemo based on AdjuvantOnline! (data from 1992 that in a way is sort of skewed - do your own research on that). His company was probably looking forward to the $100,000 intake on the chemo plan for me. I\u2019m now doing 75G/ 1xweek Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (Vit C IVs) as a precaution for 6 mos to help reset whatever went wrong to let the cancer start in the first place. It\u2019s a fraction of the chemo cost, usu @ $150 per IV. I have had absolutely no side effect from the IVs other than mild soreness for 15 mins at the IV site - sort of like a blood draw or something. Even though I feel I have no cancer in me any more, it's INSURANCE. If someone is looking for local drs to administer the IAA (C IVs), try the website ACAM dot ORG. Scroll down their page to search for someone near your zip code.  That's how I found my Doctor.   Other great resources for integrative cancer care: Dr Jeanne Drisko, Univ of Kansas; The Townsend Report (magazine) published by Dr Jonathan Collin; Ralph Moss PhD for various treatment info and amazing up-to-date studies, ralphmoss.com . Re: tamoxifen for ER+ BC. I have pulled all pseudo-estrogens out of diet and personal care products: No BPA from canned food/plastic pkgs. No parabens in makeup, shampoo, lotions etc.  No dairy (hormonal infiltration). No soy (phytoestrogens). Organic food (which reduces endocrine disruptors.  No gluten or glucose (starve out the cancer). Getting detailed hormone tests done. There\u2019s a link between progesterone levels and BC recurrence reduction. Stopped using the microwave - just in case.  There's a lot of research showing it can create indigestible molecules that aren't really food anymore, and for someone with a cancer condition or risk, why add to the body's burden?  I also have various supplements helpful for that form of cancer, such as BreastDefend (circumin and DIM - there is a study by the U of IN).  Also \u2013 high Vit D & Vit K under Dr supv. I use all natural non-carcinogenic household cleaners like 7th Generation Thyme oil ($3 at Target). Most cleaners like windex endust etc have carcinogens, but the FDA doesn't require them to be labelled such since they're not for food consumption. Time consuming? Restrictive? Yes. But once past the learning curve, it's much easier to choose safe food and products.  I learned how to cook very differently and it's getting more delicious all the time, although I still miss cheese and whole-gain toast. If you live in a metro area, it will be much easier for you to find non dairy, gluten free yummies. Is it expensive to go organic/healthy/do supplements and vitamin infusions? Yes and no...maybe an additional $900 month for our household of 2. But we'd rather have great health, drive an old car & wear clothes from thrift stores, than have cancer!!!",

      "Content": "Personally I am SO GLAD I started building up my health with the help of a holistic doctor (MD). He requires tests my oncologists NEVER did - including  testing levels of Estrogen, Progesterone, Cortisol, DHEA, and Testosterone, to find out levels that were out of balance BEFORE I considered adding ER inhibitors (tamoxifen). He analyzes saliva tests which are much more accurate & had to be sent to the west coast (of USA) labs, since here in the south there isn't much holistic medicine nearby.  There is a lot of research on the connection of Progesterone in balance with Estrogen, which reduces cancer recurrence as much as 80%.  Johns Hopkins University, 1981 (Cowan et al, American Journal of Epidemiology). There is somehow a connection between the p53 gene, progest and BC prevention. He recommended I completely remove all pseudo-estrogens as well. To some people this may all be new and shocking - be prepared, but there are a lot of products that mimic estrogens in living organisms....remember the frogs that are going all female in the river deltas downstream of commercial farming? Research these topics: 1) BPA in canned foods. 2) Parabens & Phylates in cosmetics, creams, shampoos. 3) BsT in dairy (I've gone dairy-free). 4) Plastic bottles. 5) Tetra-pak boxes have BPA in liners if it's not foil. 6) Multiple carcinogens in household cleaning substances (not labeled as such since they're \"not for food use\" but inhaled/touched nonetheless). 7) Offgassing of construction materials (sick building syndrome). The real crime is that the EPA considers a small amt of this stuff ok (due to heavy lobbying by corporate biz)... but the cumulative load is enough to feed cancers that are ER positive and I want to do everything I can to make cancer unwelcome in my body.Big Biz CEOs make $20,000-$50,000 PER DAY.  They eat organic, no problemo.  Good book on whole-body cancer treatment: Anticancer by Servan-Schreiber MD. There are numerous documentary movies on these subjects if you find it easier than reading books:Homo Toxicus, Food Inc, Forks Over Knives, The Corporation, Burzynski, King Corn, Killer at Large, Food Matters, Flow, Deconstructing Supper, The One Percent, and many more. I'm also getting Vitamin C IVs and drastically changing my diet to healthier options. http://www.doctoryourself.com/RiordanIVC.pdf My Holistic MD also checked dozens of vitamins, toxin levels etc to modify what is imbalanced. Don't forget that ultimately your mainstream MD has a lot at stake: his company makes avg $5K to $50K per DOSE of chemo. Wait, is that right? Yes, this is a figure told me by a hospital financial services coordinator\u2026.a total of $45,000 to 450,000 on average. Umbrella corporations on hospitals + Big Pharmiceuticals want to pump up the $ volume! They don't mind cancer recurrence. Caution: Mainstream medical personnel may NOT tell you all you need to know. Personally, I was extremely disappointed that this large hospital\u2019s oncologist did not tell me prior to surgery that, based on several factors, I was eligible for balloon brachytherapy \u2013 a $17,000 treatment that would have ended in 5 days, been concurrent with healing from surgery, and had final success rates equal to Wide Beam radiation. Unlike Wide Beam (WBRT), Brachytherapy creates minimal scarring & fibroses, no 5%-10% lung loss, little heart damage and rib fragility, less breast shriveling, burning, and solidification (side effects of WBRT). I was only told of WBRT by this oncologist because it\u2019s all this hospital has in this city \u2013 and the retail price on that 35 day treatment is $250,000. Ka-ching!  Sadly, I wasn\u2019t able to learn about the ($17K) brachytherapy option prior to my surgery when the balloon would have been placed in the surgery site. In the end I opted for APBI \u2013 a reduced field RT that they never offered either. I went to a competing oncologist group after discovering the Brachytherapy information had been withheld by the hospital. The system also put me in a medical \u201cpipeline\u201d \u2013 a progession of procedures and appointments so that I had to wait 3 months for tumor discovery to excision- during which the tumor doubled in size and moved from stage one to stage two. Their solution: $ ! Chemo ! $ My 20/20 hindsight:  Do not be slow about doing your own research. Check cancerdecisions.com and Ralph W Moss, MD to know what your options are. Change your hospital if they do not offer state-of-the-art treatment. Get a good holistic MD also.  Be aware that for-profit businesses, restaurants, and product manufacturers don\u2019t care about your health. Do as little damage and irritation to your body as possible.  Do as much to promote healing as possible. Something started cancer cooking in your body\u2026.do what you can to flip that switch OFF.",
