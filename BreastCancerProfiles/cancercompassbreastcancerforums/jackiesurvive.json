I was just telling my mother about you and it really comforts her to know that someone else, whos young as well is going through the same thing. Most of the people we talk to about it are older and I just came across this site today and it is such an outlet for me. i hope it can be for her too, because i feel like it will be such a vital part of her survival. I'v been reading about people who've been living with this for 13,14,15 years-- and that gives me hope. I am really looking into getting her into CTCA too. Havve you considered that? I actually spoke with a lady while waiting to get in for my chemo treatment time before last that said that she had been in remission for breast ca for 15 years, then was diagnosed with colon cancer.  It's amazing how far they've come with treatment in even the past 2-3 years and she was very positive and reassuring that everything was gonna be ok.  I have heard of the CTCA and have been to their website.  The info on there was great!  If she has the option I'd go for it!  I really do like the physicians and staff where I'm currently going - Texas Oncology.  The oncologist just kinda threw me for a loop yesterday and I'm still freaking out about it even though I know it's pointless until after the CT scan results.  It's always something that's going to be on your mind, regardless of how much you try to not think about it.   ",

      "Content": "I'm 32 years old and was diagnosed June 13th with stage IV breast cancer w/liver mets, later found out that it is HER2+, ER/PR neg.  I have been going through chemo (Taxol, Carb, Herceptin) since July 3rd every three weeks.  Due to the neuropathy in my legs the oncologist has taken me off of the Taxol.  It got so bad, my legs at times would give me a little warning sign of feeling like Jello and then going completely out from under me.  Anyway, when speaking to the doctor yesterday he said that he only suggests taking one breast (modified radical mastectomy) - my thoughts are that at this age I don't want to have to go through this again and to take both, then do radiation and reconstruction.  I won't know about the condition of my liver until Oct 31st when I have another CT scan.  At first scan there were 6 spots largest being 6 cm, the tumor in my breast was 8 cm and is now unpalpable.  I'm really confused about the surgery.  Hopefully I'll get to talk to the surgeon who will maybe agree with me and suggest taking both breasts.  Also, the oncologist told me yesterday that \"in regards to your liver, we're looking to maintain a good quality of life\"... Um... I'm no expert, but that doesn't sound good!  The last CT scan I had showed that the largest spot on my liver was down to 2 cm after 4 chemo treatments.  I kind of blacked out there after he said that about maintaining quality of life stuff and wasn't able to focus on what else he was saying!!  Chemo brain not included - just absolute shock!!  He's never been anything but positive and now this?  Anyone have any idea what he could have meant by that - I'm scared to call back and ask!!!  Also, any ideas on the single vs. double mastectomy would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thank you!  I was 37 weeks pregnant with my youngest daughter when I was diagnosed - was induced the following week so I truly understand the stress of a new baby being factored in.  Your family is in my prayers as well.  My oncologist has never been negative before and I'm really happy with him thus far which is why it caught me off-guard to hear what he had to say yesterday.  I don't know that he's given up, at least yet.  I just have never asked for my prognosis because I don't believe in those numbers... I believe in God and His healing power.  I'll just have to await the CT scan results and see what the liver looks like now after a few more treatments.  Hopefully it'll be good news... just wondering the liver was something that the radiation will take care of if the chemo doesn't.  ",
