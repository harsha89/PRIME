    "Content": "Hi, I usually post about colon cancer. My husband was dx in may 06 stage 3 rectal cancer. My sister in law was just Dx with breast cancer. She had a biopsy. I'm not sure of the stage yet but I think she has lymph involvement. I did not know they take out lymph nodes on a Biopsy. Anyway she is taking tamoxifen (spelling?) by mouth. then they will re check her. Does anyone know the side affect she should expect? What Is the next step after that. Do they give this chemo without mets? Please advise ToniÂ ",
