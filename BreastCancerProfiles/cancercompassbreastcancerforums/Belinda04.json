    "Content": "Linda-- I could have written your post! I am 44, was diagnosed right before Christmas with b/c, had a lumpectomy/sentinel node map-biopsy on Jan 16. The surgical margins were great, the cancer had not spread to the nodes; the er/pr were both positive. However, the first visit to the onco she starts talking about chemo and I'm like, \"uh, I don't think so.\" So we decide to have not only a PET scan (oh yeah, injected with radioactive glucose--this is when I start thinking WHAT IN THE WORLD AM I *DOING*!) but oncogene testing as well. The oncogene test comes back with VERY low likelihood of recurrence and the PET scan (according to the lab) showed nothing unusual, although \"inconclusive\" due to a gray area (not hot spot) in the lymph area. So we're going over these results and I'm thinking, \"hey, this is great!\" but then she starts on the chemo conversation again. After much conversation, it boils down to that she thinks the lymph area has cancer and that chemo will cure it. I said, uh, wouldn't it be easier to actually surgically remove that node you (but no one else) are questioning and see for SURE what we're dealing with? She actually said \"Surgery is a very radical move.\" I actually said, \"And chemo's not?\" Then I start thinking, hmmm, perhaps I look like a Mercedes? On to the next subject of diet (under the assumption that a second opinion indicates chemo the best solution) and she said \"I don't recommend my chemo patients make any lifestyle changes at this point because chemo is enough of a lifestyle change.\" Uh, yeah, that's right, and I'm asking this question because I believe that there are certain things one can do through nutrition to maybe mitigate some of the lovely effects of chemo. So, I'm getting a second opinion, but at this point I'm thinking just to skip all the \"treatment.\" As I've done more research, it sounds like all of it is going to kill you in one way or another. Can't wait to check out the site you recommended! Blessings -- Belinda",
