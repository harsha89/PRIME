    "Content": "Hi Annie,  Bless your sweet heart. I admire your courage. My name is Cathy from Georgia. Had early stage lobular  1 cm tumor removed 9 months ago. I am 54 and was otherwise healthy. The tumor was ER positive and I had 35 rad treatments. Now I am on Arimidex and hate the side effects of hip and joint pain and sexual problems including awful dryness. I am going to hang with it unless the symptoms worsen. Annie, God loves you and you are so right about never giving up. My cousin is in stage 4 in her bone and is still with us after 10 yrs. She stuggles with the side effects of monthly chemo, but she keeps trucking. I believe a cure is in the making. You are probably still here because of your positive attitude. God has the final say when we go and you have certainly blessed alot of people with your courage. I will pray for your healing and all the women that are going down this road. Thank God we are promised a better life than this one when we pass. Love to you and your loved ones, Your friend, cathy",
