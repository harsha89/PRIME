    "Content": "Hello. First off let me say how great it is to have a site like this. Ok, I have an anxiety disorder and recently my wife during her annual wwe was referred for her first mammogram (she is a healthy active (runner and does triathalons ) 37 yo female (duh..). The mammogram showed a couple of areas that needed further examination. Next step was an ultrasound and the radiologist wants her to get a biopsy for one lump, the other area was scar tissue . My wife had breast reduction surgery 1/2012. The radiologist downplayed the results and stated the biopsy was just to make sure it is not cancerous. Then we received a registered letter from the hospital stating that the results of ultrasound show a suspicion of possible cancer and a follow up and biopsy are needed, I have been FREAKED out ever since (remember I have an anxiety disorder ) so today she met with the surgeon who will be performing the biopsy and he said the 1 spot is no doubt scar tissue and the other is an \"unimpressive cyst\" and he is very confident it is not ca, but they will take it out and send it to pathology as a practice of good medicine. But he is very confident it is benign. Does this sound right? Why would they send a registered letter worded the way it was? Is that just a standard form type letter hospitals send out to encourage follow up ? Should I rest easy if the surgeon is highly confident all is well? Her biopsy is next Tuesday and I'm hoping I can function for the next week. I appreciate your time.",
