Two years ago the mam looked wonderful, even though I experinced off and on breast pain, later doctor ordered ultra sound, still no suspicios evidents. My intuition was so, so right I now am stage 4 with mets in liver and bone. It was the MRI machine that detected the hidden tumor under my scar tissues.  I learned about my stage 4 in June of 2010  I have a positive attitude and believe I will be around alot longer than one or two years from now. I am on Famara and receiving monthly IV of Zometa I would also like to hear from others like me.",

The specialists get into action when your levels are at 30 or higher, but up until that point, they can fluctuate depending on how you are feeling at the time.  My oncologist relates it to being a butterfly in a bottle, it can drift up and then down without staying in one place.  If you are stressed (and who wouldnt be at a time like you are going through) they can read higher ( I had this happen when my son was critically ill), but the best barometer is how you are actually feeling.  Always relate how you are even if you think something is silly, it may not be. Let them know if you are having night sweats, any aches or pains or changes in how something feels.  It all gives them a comprehensive picture to work with.  Take care and my thoughts are with you - remember only you know how you really feel.  Love Amanda In June 2010 diagnois/ recurrrent breast cancer stage 4 Marker was at 162 now as of 1/13 2011 onc. said marker is at 23!!!! 1/12/2011 had another bone scan and CT on the 13th of Jan. met with onc good news no show of mts in my liver (it was there in June) bone is not any worst/same.

Also taking a supplement named Glucosamine for advance bone and joint suppport supplement 2x's aday with food I am on Fermara and monthly infusion of Zometa When I first learned about my recurrence/stage 4 I drank a herbal mix from Canada (100 yr old recipe) for six weeks 3 x's a day @ 3 ounces each time. It totlaly detoxified my body It is called ESSIAC look it up on the internet Amazing stuff. My Onc advise me not to continue. She is traditional doctor.  I have a hunch it is a combination of the above that lowvered my number to mid 20's (almost a miracle  A miracle is no trace of caner in my liver) I had two leasions detected in june biopsy/ now gone.
