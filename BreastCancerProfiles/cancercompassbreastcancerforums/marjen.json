      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and 11 node removal, but no signs of cancer anywhere in the margins, bones, blood, etc. I had the full regime of chemo and radiation, 2 years of tamoxifen and now I'm on the final med: I started with Femara and this caused joint pain. I switched to Arimidex, and the same occurred. I'm now on my final choice - Aromasin - and I have the same pain in my feet, ankles, heels, knees, shoulders, elbows, fingers, wrists...and like others, I feel like a 90 year old.  Mornings are the worst, and after moving around for about a half hour, the pain subsides.  I exercise 4-5 times a week at Bally's: walking on the treadmill, 3 reps of 18 different weights, and the eliptical trainer for 15 minutes.  I feel great when exercising, but the next morning it's back to the same old pain.  In addition, like others, I cannot seem to lose weight, especially in the belly. I tried quinine sulfate for cramping when I was on Tamoxifen, and that was GREAT, except it has been removed from the shelves for purchase, even with a prescription.  I had edema and was given Requip, Furosemide and Potassium, but they have not helped much. Topical creams like Sportscreme and Salumpa patches have helped some for temporary relief.  I take Motrin and Asprin, and drink Condroiten/Glucosomine (sp) daily.  I'm now at a loss as what to do.  Is there a doctor out there that has any suggestions?  marjen",

Linda Lou   Hi Linda Lou, I have been off all meds, vitamins, diet aids, motrin, etc. for a month now, and I'm about 50% better, I seem to recover from the morning aches faster, but I'm still not satisfied.  I think if I stayed off, I might fully recover, but this week I have to go back onto my med regime.  I'm not looking forward to that.  I asked my oncologist about Lovaza and she said she would check it out.  I hope to try it.  I think she will be open to trying anything, as if my pain continues with Aromasin, she will put me back on Tamoxofin.  Keep me posted should Lavoza show even more improvement.  Thank you! marjen",

      "Content": "  On 3/19/2008 SunnyHeather wrote: I'm a survivor like you and have been on Arimidex 13 months when I started having hand and knee stiffness and pain. The pain is worse in my right hand (perhaps it's because I use that hand more since I'm right-handed). I'm in my early 50's but I feel older than my 80-year-old Mom sometimes. I told my oncologist about this and she said I can stop Arimidex for a month to flush it out of my system, then take it again. She said this sometimes works on some patients. However, I'm afraid my body might start producing estrogen if I stop Arimidex, so I use reusable hand warmers which I purchased online and massage and exercise my fingers when I first wake up or after a period of inactivity. As for the weight gain, I do exercise on the treadmill and limit my food intake but I'm still gaining weight slowly. I don't have edema, though. I'm cautious about taking Aleve or Celebrex or other Cox-2 inhibitors such as Vioxx and Bextra because previous studies have connected some of these medicines with an increased incidence of heart problems and stroke, and this is not even mentioning their adverse effects on the kidneys (http://www.ccjm.org/pdffiles/WEIR.PDF ). On particularly bad days, I take a couple of ibuprofens but I rarely do this since ibuprofen is also an NSAID. I'm thinking of consulting a rheumatologist if the pain gets too unbearable. I haven't tried glucosamine yet.      Hi SunnyHeather, Since my initial email question, I have done just what you described.  My oncologist pulled me off Arimidex and all the other meds for edema.  She told me to stop taking all the over the counter meds including vitamins, glucosamine, motrin, and the other diet aids.  I have been \"pill free\" for nearly 3 weeks now and I still have joint pain, but it has subsided and I can work the kinks out faster.  Stairs are still a problem after sitting for a while.  I stopped exercising for a week because I thought I'd see if this was contributing to joint pain.  I'm not sure it has, but I have to go back on the Aromasin on April 3....not looking forward to that.  Maybe flushing out my system will help me tolerate the Aromasin better.  I took the RealAge test and with all the exercise, it tested out that I was 5 years older than I am. But I feel 80....actually my mom is 87 and runs circles around me, so maybe 90 is more accurate.  There doesn't seem to be much we can do about this problem  It just doesn't seem right. Thanks for your response.  I wish you well.  marjen",

      "Content": "Linda Lou, Thank you for your response.  I was so surprised to see how many people had similar complaints about these meds.  I was taken off all meds on Monday, so I'm monitoring the pain and stiffness.  They want to rule out rhumatoid arthritis.  I think Aromasin and the others are just too strong for me and it's creating the pain.  I asked if I could take it every other day or every other week, and she did not want to do that.  She is thinking of putting me back on Tamoxifen instead.  I go back next week, and I may be off all meds for a month to let my body recoup.  I have seen some relief, but it is too early to tell right now.  I will ask about the Lovasa next week.  Thanks for your help! margie",
