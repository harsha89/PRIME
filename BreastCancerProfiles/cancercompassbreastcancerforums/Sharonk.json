    "Content": "I completed 5 months of chemotherapy for node positive breast cancer yesterday. I've found that the American College of Oncologist (right name?) endorses no scans after completion of treatment and relies on your becoming symptomatic to identify reoccurence or metastasis. My oncologist generally follows that recommendation, but is willing to order scans within reason because of my profile and does endorse using tumor marker tests for me. I had grade 3, stage 3 breast cancer this spring and have previously had benign thyroid and ovarian tumors (left ovary removed). I'm not comfortable waiting for pain to tell me if the original cancer has traveled to other parts of my body. I'm sure some of you must be having post-treatment tests. Please share information with me re what you have chosen re post-treatment follow-up beyond a simple physical exams.",
