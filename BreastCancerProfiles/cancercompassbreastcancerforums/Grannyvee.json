I don't believe I have high tolerance for pain as I had a good size sliver removed from my thigh and once the numbness wore off it was like my leg had been cut off. Also 14 months ago I had a full hip replacement and it is just starting to settle in and not hurt. Also had fluid drained from my knee just before we left on this trip. The PA said \"bee sting\". It was more like a snake bite. I give my surgeon full credit for his skills and gentleness. Never has hurt me even as he did 5 aspirations. If I ever need surgery again, I'll make an appointment to see him.",

      "Content": "I'm the person who reported here last year about having a pain free mastectomy plus 11 lymph nodes removed - one node was cancer positive. Started on Arimidex in September 2014 and had a few puny days, but over that now. I've also had 2 injection of Prolevia, the first one in my arm which stay quite sore for sometime. Received the 2nd. injection in my stomach which was much better - no soreness at all. The reason for this update is to let everyone know that after going through cancer surgery, I had a mini stroke in April of this year. When I arrived at the ER my blood pressure was 225/110. I've never have had high blood pressure but it stay very high for about a week while in the hospital. I spent one week in the hospital plus 1 week in a rehab facility. Once home I spent 6 weeks in outpatient OT & PT. I'm still not 100% and probably never will be. Left side weakness and fatigue. I need a knee replacement but ortho Dr. will not do it until I gain some strength. I'm 80 now so gaining strength isn't likely in as much as I'm not able to get around well without a walker. I suggested to the ER Physician that Arimidex had caused my stroke and his comment was, \"Arimidex is blamed for most problems people have when taking it\". So curious if others have had a stroke while taking Arimidex? Best to all who are fight their own battle with cancer.",

The surgery was painless and Arimidex only made me feel sick a few days after I started taking it. In April of this year I had a mini stroke. Spent 1 week in hospital and 1 week in rehab. I still have a very week left arm and when I get tired my left food wants to drag. I'm now 80 yo and wondering if others with breast cancer has also suffered a stroke?",

I just wish everyone could feel as well as I do. It puzzles me that the med does so much damage to one's body such as it can burn your skin. What might it be doing to my stomach!

Also the virus that causes those abnormal cells (which may or may not develop into cancer- most don't). I know about this stuff because 20 years ago my stepfather did a cdc study that eventually led to the discovery that this virus (HPV) causes abnormal \"pre-cancerous\" (I put that in italics b/c in most people it never does develop into cancer, so breathe a little sigh of relief and demand a colposcopy at least every 6 months. I waited 3 months after my husband found my lump too actually go to my GYN, who told me to get a mammogram. I dragged my feet on that too because I was AFRAID of getting a mammogram (the pain not the results). Get it checked out. It doesn't hurt that much. Also my doctors told me many, many times that they're finding breast cancer is not necessarily genetic. No one in my family has ever had it and I was 43 when I had it. Granted it's only been 7 months since my diagnosis but they got the whole tumor no lymph node involved and then I had radiation and now I feel great! I'm happier than I have ever been. My tumor was \"typed\" and it showed a very low risk of recurrence. I feel like I beat death. Good luck to you. It doesn't have to be so scary. Hello Amy: I know you are scared having found a lump in your breast. Please get it checked as soon as possible.  I too found a small lump in my breast the end of June, 2014.  I asked my husband if I should wait a couple of months before seeing my GP as I thought the lump would go away or it was a cyst.  He insisted I go to the doctor the next morning.  My doctor said it was \"probably nothing just a thicking of breast tissue\" but he told me I should have a mamogram. I did and because of the lump they also did an ultrasound.   The radiation doctor said my exam didn't look good and in 2 days I had the biopsy.  Cancer!  Within three weeks I had a mastsectomy as 1 lymph node also had cancer cells. The mastsectory was my choice as I am 79 and at my age did not breast cancer.  All has gone very well for me - Core Biopsy (didn't hurt and no pain after).  In fact the next day we drove 600+ miles to visit with out family for the holiday weekend. I've had a Mastsectomy, Anastrozole 1 mg cancer medication, and the Prolia injection (10 days of feeling puny days 10 days after the injection).  I have never had pain, sickness or sore muscles as some have experienced. Perhaps I'm one of the luck ones, but looking forward to the rest of my cancer free life.  Please get your mamogram and let them know you have a lump as they should then do an ultrasound.  Good luck to you and be save rather than sorry later.",

I have had a very easy recovery from stage 2 EP BREAST cancer surgery. So, don't think the Arimidex is not working. My doctor told me that very few people have side effects from the little white pill. People usually only write the bad results as they do with any other type of drug. Good luck and hang in there.",
