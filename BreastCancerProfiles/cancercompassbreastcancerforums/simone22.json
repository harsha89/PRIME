      "Content": "Hello all of you great people! My name is Simone and I'm so excited to find this great forum! I'd love to connect with anyone who went through this bad part of life and hopefully, share some experience. I am 22y old and my mom was diagnosed with cancer that has pretty much spread throughout her entire body. Have you ever had one of those bad dreams where it feels like you are trying to wake yourself up? Sure you did. That's how I feel right now. Like I'm drowning. All of this feels surreal, I'm still pretty much in shock I guess. But at the same time I've never been so scared in my entire life. They started chemo right away and she has already lost her thick long locks of hair. Ugh. But, the hope remains, I think. As long as she's alive, we're gonna fight this thing to the end. I'm exploring natural solutions, testing them with my mom and we've already found some pretty interesting stuff, so fingers crossed. I'll share my findings and updates here, and hopefully someone will benefit from my findings. If anyone here feels compelled to talk to me, please do. I'd love to chat with you. Take care and never, ever lose hope! Yours truly :)",

      "Content": "I just saw a music video with a focus on \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" It got me thinking. I used to believe this was true but now I just don't know. I mean, looking back on the struggle I've gone through to help my mom with her cancer, yes - there's truth in this cliche. One must never give up, no matter how hard it becomes. As long as you're alive, you have to fight. No matter what. On the other hand, it's much harder to cling to those words when we're in the thick of an issue. But that's just my humble opinion. So, what are your thoughts on this? Do you agree or disagree? Take care!",
