    "Content": "My Mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 yesterday afternoon. It has already spread many places, including lungs, pelvic region, and bones. The prognosis offered was grim. What can I do/say to best help her emotionally/spiritually after the initial shock wears off and she is ready to begin discussing/dealing with it? And if she chooses to completely ignore it (which she may well do), am I to respect that as her choice? Or does my duty lay in encouraging her to fight?",
