      "Content": "I was on Arimidex for 10 years.  I started at age 46.  My oncologist said I should be on it forever.  It was not horrible.  I believe I lead a good, cancer-free life.  I never believed I would be alive 3 years out and it is a miracle I am alive 10 years out. Since I was estrogen positive, and had cancer in my lymph nodes (3) Arimidex was a great choice for me.  I found that stationary biking or riding a bike were great for me without the issues with jogging.  However, I still took short walks as often as possible.  The more you move the better you will feel. It is all about a 'new normal'.  I looked at what I had...not what I could no longer do.  Do I have limitations?  Sure.  I sleep a lot more than before.  I have had physical issues to deal with but I came up with creative solutions that I call, \"work arounds\".  We are alive.  That is a gift.  Take it one step at a time.  Don't be too hard on yourself and set 'doable' goals to begin.  The joint pain gets less and less as time goes on.  Give the drug a chance.   I wonder if there are woman who have had recurrences while on arimidex or the similar drugs?  I didn't.  I know they also give it to women who have recurrences' and are estrogen receptor positive so that the cancer will not grow since it is fed by estrogen.  Sure seems like a wonderful thing that we are offered it.  (just my take). I never worried about hair...losing it....having it thinned out...hair color changing.  I was always just happy to have hair.  I use the Nioxin scalp treatment.  I think you can buy it on-line.  You can also try Tea Tree shampoos, and oils from drug or natural health food stores.  There are oil treatments for your scalp.  If nothing works, go to a dermatologist. The focus for me was simple...not to have the BC come back.  Maybe having your life altered is a good thing.  Maybe what is really important is now clearer.  You are alive.  Don't miss out on a single moment of what is important to you! ",

BUT, i would not give up a day of my life because i still have breath in me.  AND, i know a lot of people who are worse off. BTW, my Mom had BC, my grandfather had pancreatic cancer (related cancer to BC), my father had cancer, his 2 sisters had BC, my grandmother had cancer.  AND, my family was not there for support either.   Was it easy...please...is it easy...please.  Cancer sucks and it is not fair.  but it is what it is....and i am a survivor and i will take every day and breath that others do not want.   i have a friend who had BC, then was on tamoxifin and was the .1% who get ovarian cancer while on it, she survived that only to get colon cancer.  she is still here....and we laugh together. BC is never gone. there is no cure...you are right.  it can come back even 40 years later...but i will not allow it to scare me so i don't live life and enjoy every second that i have left.  there is no cure for life either...no one gets out alive. it is all part of a journey...we all do the best that we can do.  don't let fear cripple you...it will get easier as time goes by.  i think of all the people who were helpful and compassionate along the way.  there were so many of them.  and, not a day goes by that i don't think about the little special things, thoughtful things they did for me.   i loved life before cancer...i refuse to not love it after cancer.  and, i am sure i will die of cancer...i just do not know when...and that is a fact.  i chose not to focus on the pain part...don't always get it right but otherwise the negative will eat you up.",

I always seemed to have trouble standing for longer periods of time--seemed to always want to sit down instead but always thought that was something else. Last summer (August) I had trouble walking for any amount of time over 20 minutes. After MRI and X-rays, they said it was bursitis. A shot into that area with cortisone helped although it still acts up. In February of this year I had major back trouble with sciatica. It was very, very bad and they say I have degenerative disc problems. There is no history of anyone in my family having back problems even my 83 year old mother. I still didn't think much about it but my Radiation Oncologist mentioned that maybe it was a side effect off the Arimidex. Now I am wondering if I should stop taking it. I am tired and lack energy but always thought that was just the result of work and commuting. Reading your response is making me wonder even more. I also wake up 4 to 5 times every night.",

I went to a new oncologist and stopped after 10 years.  The old oncologist told me no one knows whether it is worth the risks.  She said to me, I guess in 3 years if you get a recurrence we will know.  Her biggest concern with having someone on it long term was the effect on ones heart.  She said it makes your heart like a mans and they are more susceptible to heart attacks.  Well, I had A/C with Taxol.  And, I was radiated on my left (or heart) side.  I felt that should have been discussed with me before I had taken it for 10 years.  But again, the doctors do not know.  It is ultimately, your decision alone that counts.  ",

However, I could never sleep with my face turned in the direction of the affected shoulder. Within the last year it has become possible. Everyone had a different answer. For me, it was just a matter of healing over time. My advice, listen to your body for what it tells you. If it hurts stop. Raising your arm above your heart when at rest will help if it swells. There are many, many 'secrets' but the best advice is to never stop using it. Oh, fly fishing is the 'best' exercise you can get for it. Why not sign up for Orvis' Casting For Recovery session?

I asked my doctor if I could stop taking it and she said it is not an option because of the excellent protection it provides. When I asked about some of the other drugs people have mentioned on this site, she said they all have similar side effects and that she only knew about problems with feet and hands and does not think the back issues are related to Arimidex (she sees 30 patients a day so I guess she has some knowledge I don't). I have never heard of the chillow. Does anyone know where to get that? That sounds really useful. I find that if I am hot one minute I am going to be cold the next. I also have found that the night sweats get better over time but the hot flashes during the day get worse. For some strange reason, I have found that when I feel one coming on I can often stop it by breathing deeply. At work, I was able to get a net type chair instead of a solid one and that did a world of good. For exercise, I ended up doing stationary bike instead of treadmill. It has a fan on it and my feet do not hurt as much. I also put vaseline on my feet before I put my socks on and it seems to be better. Hope some of that helps...Love, Mary",

That should be done as quickly as humanly possible. I had problems with my spine this year and it was the worst pain I had ever had. I could not do the physical therapy when it was prescribed because it would have been too much. About your confusion, I would ask the doctor what he/she defines as \"manage\". It certainly would be a good idea to ask what goals they have and what options are available. Hope that helps and she is lucky to have you as an advocate.",

If you read that you will see if the surgeon had clean margins or not. Maybe he/she did not. That meant they had a good probability of not getting it all the first time. I just heard a lecture and the Chairman of Pathology in our local hospital said getting a second opinion was something we should all do. She may want to do that this time. Just some thoughts. Hope all goes well for her on Monday. mpb",

      "Content": "It sounds like your doctor is taking very good care of you. And I think concern is a good thing. I have a few suggestions that were not covered by others. First, tell your husband. He has a right to know. Second, you say cancer runs in your family but not breast. If you do not know what kind of cancer, you should do some fact finding to determine what kind. I said that same thing for years but it was not until after I had breast cancer that I did research on my family history of cancer. It led me to get genetic testing. Generally, pancreatic and breast cancers are the only ones that are relevant for genetic purposes. However, it also led me to find out that some of my relatives that I had been told had breast cancer did not and it led me to find out how many of them had colon cancer and heart problems. The later two I had never had knowledge about. If you do the research on your family, it will pay excellent dividends whether you have a problem or not. It will also let you and your doctors know what preventative tests you should have (e.g. colonoscopy for colon cancer risk). Lastly, I too was a smoker. Thankfully, I had quit three years before I had breast cancer. As my husband said to me as I went through a year of treatment, aren't you glad you do not have to worry about quitting smoking on top of everything else. Hope that helps.",

      "Content": "Hope this helps.  In 2001, I had surgery for breast cancer.  i had AC and Taxol for chemo (taxol was tough on feet and hands--neuropathy), then Arimidex for 10 years (no typo there).  I had the bone pain and the hot flashes while on it.  I also had back issues, and a hand issue, and a salivary gland issue.  I am 4 years off Arimidex.   I still have hands and feet that fall asleep or needles and pins.  About the memory issues.  I find if I am tired, finding words is harder.  I write everything down on paper that I need to remember and try to stay organized.  I remember when I was on Arimidex and lost my thought while talking he use to say, just relax and slow down.  LOL  I believe it has gotten better but I find I can't have someone interrupt the thought or else I can't remember what I was saying.  I think relying more on written communication is much easier....email, IMing, letters.  maybe it always was for me...  I think it is hard to say what caused it but I really think it gets better.  I still have hot flashes but not so much of the night sweats kind and not as severe.  If you ask me, it is NOT dementia it is just that the firing of the synapsis is not as fast.  I think doing physical exercise is very helpful...even just 30 minutes a day or so.  I think crosswords, games, reading are all helpful.   on arimidex, i had pain just going up the stairs. I couldn't stand in one spot for long...had to sit down.   i was happier moving( walking) than sitting and didn't have the greatest disposition.  After being off of it for a year or a little more (takes that long for it to get out of your system) my husband noticed a better disposition.  Lots more things seemed to irritate me.  I was a bit on edge...that went away.  The pain in the joints went away.  The neuropathy did not.  My forgetting words has gotten better but I am not my old self...I still hunt for words especially if tired.  I believe you need to give it just a bit more time to get out of your system.  I think I began noticing a bit of change about a year and 4 months out.  I think it was 2 years before things got even better.   Good luck!!  When I was going through it the oncologist said it was getting older...at least now they admit there are side effects.  The best news is I am cancer free at 15 years out...I never thought I would be alive today.  I would do it all again...  Hope this helps....",

I would be interested in what pain you are experiencing. Good luck, I am also going to my oncologist in October and am planning to ask about alternatives. (I had 6 months of horrific pain beginning last February with sciatica. More specific diagnosis was stenosis in L4-L5 and what they referred to as degenerative disk problems (Orthopedist). Just a result of getting old (50) they tell me.) I am not sure I believe this explanation. The pain on my right lower back and down my leg was so bad that I could not bend over and I had shooting pain in my knee and ankle if I coughed or sneezed. Again, good luck.",
