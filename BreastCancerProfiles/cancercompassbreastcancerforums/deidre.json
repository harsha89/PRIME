      "Content": "Thank you so much for your answer.  The predicament I find is that I've been told 5 years on an Aromatase Inhibitor would lower my risk of mets from 10% to 5%.  I've also been told that Tamoxiin would lower my risk from 10% to just  7%.  That means that out of 100 women at my stage one,  10 women would have a metastasis without taking any drug.  And taking the Aromatase Inhibitor, would mean that out of those same 100 women, 5 out of the 100 would get a metastisis.  Taking Tamoxifin would lower the number of women to 7 women out of 100.  I ask myself, would lowering my risk just 5% with the AI or just 3%  with the Tamoxifin is worth it? I am so impressed that you styed on the Tamoxifin and you are doing well!  The doctors tell me to try one of these and if I have the same problem, I can go off of it.  Reading what women go through on on this site  is bringing all of the horror of Arimidex back! In some respects, age is a factor, also.  I'm 72, and a woman age 50 versus a woman in her seventies makes a difference, since as we get older, the risk of other things increases. I know no one can really know what is best or what life will bring.  All the Best to you!!",

      "Content": "Dear Monmouth, I had breast cancer 9 years ago- lumpectomy and radiation. I was given Arimidex and had to stop taking it after a year because of side effects.  Now, in July of 2016, I got a new cancer (separate from the first) in the other breast.  I decided to have complete mastectomy w/immediate reconstruction.  I thought I was done until my doctors told me I had to be on another aromatase inhibitor for five years!  My oncologist said to try Aromasin, but the drug has been in my drawer for the past 6 months.  I have had so much anxiety just thinking about trying it!  Now I found this web site, and have concluded that all of these AI's and Tamoxifin are horrible drugs with a myriad of side effects.  I am thinking quality of life is so important and have been told my reduction of risk would only be 5%.  I don't want the cancer back but I cannot bring myself to go back on a drug!  I wonder how you are doing and what you decided with the help of your doctors at Duke. I have seen another oncologist who also says taking a drug for 5 years is the \"standard of care\".  I am 72, a runner, very active and don't want my life to change since I am feeling well.  I had stage one, node neg cancer each time, but hear horror stories of metastasis and am really frightened a lot of the time. Please, let me know how you are doing, since I think it is over 2 years since you posted this. Deidre",
