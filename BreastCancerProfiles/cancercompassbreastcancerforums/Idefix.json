    "Content": "My friend Arelis was found this august that her breast cancer spread to the liver. Her tumor was 8.8.7 and she has HERV2 that I believe is one of the worst cancers. They recommend to her to use herceptin but because she wasn\u2019t able to afford it I ask her if she wants to try with alternative medicine and she say yes. My husband shows me an article in the internet about a new compound call ARTEMISIN that have been research in the University of Washington since 1995 and doesn\u2019t have any side effect. Anyway from that I started my own research I found I lot of interesting information in the internet and websites from people who used this with outstanding results like keepblairalive.com My friend staring using by the end of August and now her last scan that was made in October 28 show her tumor en 2.1 without chemo or herceptin. She only changes her diet and take Artemisinin and to me the results have been amazing.",
