Hope this helps. Hello sewwonderfulwoman, When I went back to have the have the excess fluid aspirated, the Dr. said the folds of skin under my incisions was normal and the discomfort was from the fact that the nerves were receiving a fresh blood supply from the healing of my incisions. I will try going back to him again and see if I can receive some help. Thank you so much for your reply. God Bless, waquin  ",

Were you bound tightly during your surgery?  Apparently this is what helps control the swelling.  Mine stayed on 24/7 the entire first week, and now I take it off long enough to shower every second day.  I wonder if you are doing this, or if it would help?  Asperiating sounds like a painful experience, too.  Do hope you get this under control soon, we need to heal, not endure complications.   Good Luck! Martha Hi Martha, Thank you so much  for replying to my message. No, I was not bound at all. When I woke up, all I had on over my incisions were sterile dressings and one strip of adhesive, which he removed the day he took my drains out. They told me I could shower the day after my surgery. I was painted with clear fluid like super glue which he peeled off the day he took my dressings off.  I have huge, large stitches across my incisions, which he said will dissolve in time. My skin is all bunched up with excess folds hanging down which are swelled. (So ugly!)  But now, the swelling is spreading over under my armpits and is very hard. When I asked him about the swelling, the day he aspirated the fluid, he said that was normal. My husband said I should go back and see him. I said what good would it do. The Dr. said this was normal. You're the first person I've been able to talk to about this. I appreciate your concern. I'll be praying that you won't have any swelling after your sutures are removed. God Bless, Jackie",
