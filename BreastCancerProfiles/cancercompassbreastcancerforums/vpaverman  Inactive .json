I was only able to take one IV but from that I had no hair in 3 days and was in pain for over a week.  Then I went through radiation with no problem...things looking up ...enter tamixofen.  From that I had non stop diarrhea until I was taken off and put on aromasin.  Things improved for 7 months, then I began to  have muscle and bone aches, stiff hands and a trigger finger.  Last week I called my clinic and explained my misery  to my onc's nurse.  She advised that I discontinue the aromasin until I heard from them.  One week later...no word.... question..how great is the risk of just doing without further meds?  I am 72 years old and concerned about the quality of what I have left. God bless you.  I was diagnosed 1.5 yrs ago with \"stage 1\" so cruel...people expect you to just bounce back.  The drugs are hell!  I too wish the breasts were gone. Men rule medicine, so the breasts will be spared at the expense of our well being.  I am too embarresed to detail the side effects of Arimidex. I have sterted Femara... trying to be positive, but really waiting for my hair to fall out and worse...l will go back to the \"devil I know\" and deal with the pain inside.  I am so angry! Why is there no support group for us? I am 50 and feel I've so little quality of life left. ",
