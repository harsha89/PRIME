      "Content": "Carolgolf, No, I am taking Myomin in addition to Aromasin. According to the Immunologist, I will have to get off of Aromasin eventually - although I am not sure if he is correct? In other words, he is saying that, like Tamoxofin, all the inhibitors should not be long term. Next time I have tel. consultation with him, will question making the change. Will try to keep you posted, but must confess, I am not always too sure about finding this message board. (This doctor is in Calif., I am in Washington.) When you type in Myomin in Google, can find the distributors. Regards, Joan",

      "Content": "I was diagnozed with Stage 1V invasive breast cancer/estrogen dependant, metastasized to the bone five years ago. Find both arimidex and aromasin to be extremely dibiliting in that, for me, they cause an exhausting fatigue. My immunologist is suggesting that I gradually wean myself from Aromasin and take a natural estrogen depressant= Myomin. (Also, he maintains that, like Tamoxofin, Aromasin can feed the cancer?) Has anyone had experience with Myomin only protocol? Thank you.",
