    "Content": "My mom had breast cancer, went through removal of a lymphnode and some of the caner, chemo, and radiation. She finished 5 years of Femara, and 10 days later, she went in for a scan due to some pain and they found new cancer cells. She has breast cancer cells in her bones, specifically her spine. What kind of life expectancy does this have? What advice can you give me and my family? She was so strong the first time around, and we all thought it was over, so I have no idea what to do now. I am her oldest daughter, and I just had (4 months ago) her first grandchild. I am dealing with some heavy emotions and I am not sure where to go from here.",
