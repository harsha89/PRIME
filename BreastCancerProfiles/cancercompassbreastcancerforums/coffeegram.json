      "Content": "I'm sorry you experienced burning and burning to the back! I had a terrible time with chemo, but no problem at all with radiation.  My radiation onco told me to cream often and I did. I used Alho vera gel as soon as I finished radiation (creamed in the dressing room), creamed several times during the day, immediately after showering and before going to bed.  I don't know if this had anything to do with my not burning, but all of my doctors were quite surprised that my skin did no burn at all. I finished radiation almost two years ago but do get pain in my breast due to tissue damage. I do hope you are feeling better.    ",

      "Content": "I am so sorry for all you have gone through and are going through. In answer to your question, \"Why is there no support group for us?\" There are many support groups for women dealing with breast cancer.  Check with the American Cancer Society in your area (They are in the phone book and they are on the Internet).  They can tell you where support groups are in your area.  Also check with your local hospitals as they may have support groups too.  You do not have to fight this alone, just want you to know that. I did go to a support group for a while, but decided it was time for me to move on.  Some people stay with the group for years.  It all depends on you and how you feel. As for the aromasin side affects, I have a whole list of them: Joint Pain (severe at times) The joints in my fingers lock at times My knees kill me when I go upstairs I have insomnia Fatigue I am also having problems with my teeth, but that may be from the chemo and radiation.  I always took very good care of my teeth and never had a problem with them...but now my teeth are cracking....oh, what is a girl to do? I have gained tons of weight and can't lose it no matter how I try.  It is depressing. I am always hungry and experience cravings.  I never had a weight problem before. I now have a new sympton which developed recently - a burning sensation in my skin.  This is not a chronic problem but occurs every once in a while. I took a mini-vacation this week, from the Aromasin.  I wanted to see how I feel.  I wanted to see if I could lose a pound or two, if I felt hungry all the time, etc. It is only a week so I did not lose a pound.  I am not as hungry, though and I do feel somewhat better, not completely better.  I am scared now and will go back on the pill again as I don't want the cancer to come back.  I was estrogen-positive and I am afraid of the estrogen sneaking back in.  I have 3 more years to go.  I am 64 years old,  but feel like 94 but I am alive...the quality of life may not be what it was before I got BC, but I suppose it beats the pain of cancer.  The best I felt was right after I finished radiation, which I had after the chemo.  I looked great, felt great, was nice and skinny.  I had lost weight on chemo.  My skin looked radiant and then, and then...I started the aromasin and was never the same but I'm here and am trying to enjoy each day as it comes, thanking God for the gift of life.  He never said it would be easy.        ",

      "Content": "I am so glad I found this site where I can relate to everything that is discussed here. I was looking for the pros and cons of taking aromasin and found Cancer Compass. I am 64 years old and was diagnosed with stage onee bc in October of 2010. The diagnosis was followed by tests and needles, lots of needles.  I had a lumpectomy, a month later had surgery to check the lymphnodes.  My lymphnodes, thank God were clear.  The lumpectomy showed I had a soft tumor, which is harder to find.  Mine was discovered through a mammo.  It was an invasive ductal cancer. I was lucky to have found it early. I wish I didn't have to take the hormone therapy but my onco tells me not to fool around with cancer.  I am glad to see that I am not alone in dealing with the side affects of this nasty med.  It is good to be able to \"talk\" about this with others who are experiencing what I am.  People who have not been where we are just do not understand what we are going through. God bless all of you on your journey into healing.        ",

      "Content": "Hi Katsacrow, I saw my oncologist yesterday and told him how I've been feeling.  He does not want me to stop the aromasin, but he said he could change the drug to another one.  I don't know if I want to try another one.  I agreed to give it a little more time and if I continue to feel as bad as I do now, he said to call him, we'll discuss it and go from there. Your doctor said taking the drug doesn't mean the cancer won't come back but stopping it means the cancer will come back?  So, you stopped it knowing that the cancer will come back?  You are brave.. I don't know what I am going to do, just don't know. God bless and may He keep you cancer free. Why do you have a port?    ",

I am impressed with your attitude.  I am going to pray about this decision. Thank you so much for your reply.        ",

My concern is about the side affects I am experiencing.  I find the affects of aromasin unberable at times, most times.  I would love to stop taking it, but my onco will not hear of it. I was just wondering if anyone here stopped taking it and what happened when they did. You are so right about staying in the moment.                ",

      "Content": "Kathy, I had my chemo two years ago.  I lost my hair right after the first treatment. I always wore my hair short so everyone said it would not be a big deal, losing my hair.  Well, short is one thing and bald is another! When my hair started falling out, I asked my husband to buzz it off and he did.  I looked in the mirror and cried.  I was bald and \"looked\" like a cancer patient now. My dear friend came with me to purchase a wig.  It was a nice wig, but made me feel so uncomfortable.  I preferred the pretty hats and scarves.  There are so many beautiful scarves and I loved them all.  Remember that hair grows back. It does and boy does it grow back - thicker and curlier than before. (at least mine did)  It grew back salt & pepper color and everyone loved it, including me.  When I cut it, the curl went away and I was left with my natural wavy hair. The nice s&p went away too and I am back to my brown hair.  I am 64 years old so it was ok for me to have salt & pepper hair.  Your hair will grow back in time, so, for now, have fun with the wig, the hats and the scarves.  If you go to the American Cancer site you will see a website for these things. Let us know how you are doing.  God bless.    ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer (Invasive, ductal) in 2010 - had lumpectomy, followed by chemo and radiation and was cancer free since then, am on Arimosin. I was schocked when I went for a mammor the other day and had a call-back for an ultra sound.  The ultra sound showed a small \"nodule.\"  The radiologist said he does not know for sure if it is a nodule or a tumor so I am scheduled for a biopsy on Feb. 3rd.  and am so scared.  I am trying to stay calm, and positive but the anxiety comes and goes. I had a different surgeon the for the lumpectomy and she did not believe in biopsies.  She just wanted the tumor out.  It was a soft tumor, can't feel those.  I am thinking of calling my surgeon (whom I love) to see what he thinks about just going for the lumpectomy without a biopsy.  I hate the idea of more needles in the breast.... Did you ever hear of cancer coming back while on the anti-estrogen hormone therapy? I saw my oncologist in December and my numbers were excellent and he sent out for markers and I didn't hear anything so assume they were okay too. I just don't know what to think....I read on here several times that it is nothing until it is something and I will keep that in mind.      ",
