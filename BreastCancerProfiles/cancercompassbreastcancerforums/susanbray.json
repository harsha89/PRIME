    "Content": "Arimadex caused muscle aches and pain bad enough that I woke up several times during the night.  I've found Exemestane, an alternative anti-estrogen,  to cause no side effects except hot flashes.  I've also cut the dosage in half and am feeling good enough to bike 60 miles on a regular basis.  leaky bladder has not been a problem.  ",
