My mom has gone through the lumpectomy,(don't worry it's so small), to 1 1/2 yrs later a small(once again don't worry it's so small), to a Mastectomy. Then a couple of years later to her spine & hip. Was some in the sac around her heart. Now they say it's in her spinal fluid, pelvis & will hit her brain soon. She's had lots of Chemo & Radiation, all with suppossedly good results. Now she has bad vision problems, losing more weight, lots of nasuea & starting to lose brain function. It has been 7 LONG years. THey gave her 3-6 months, maybe a month or 2 longer if she had a port in her head. She is tired & doesn't want that. BUT if Cesium-Chloride works, I do it. I just wonder if this is stuff from a quack? Reading from some of the sites on the net, it doesn't look too good. Please let me know if you have heard to the contray. My thoughts & prayers are with you for you & your mom.",
