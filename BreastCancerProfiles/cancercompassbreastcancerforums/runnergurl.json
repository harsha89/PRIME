      "Content": "Hello BC friends,  I have 1.9 REMOVED tumor HER2+ and getting Taxol & Herceptin weekly for 12.  No radiation as of yet.  Found a mass on other breast after 7 treatments.  Anyone have that.  I also implants with reconstruction so I thought possibly I could be feeling something else although it sure feels like the last little monster they removed.  Thank you so much for reading and helping.  It changes lives this website and I thank you for helping.",
