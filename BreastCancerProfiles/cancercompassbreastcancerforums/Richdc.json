    "Content": "My friend had the dye injection and then had the breast tumor removed. The actual scar location is healing but the breast is turning purple and is very tender. She says if feels like it could burst. She's been to the surgeon and the onocolgist and they are puzzled. They think it may be a reaction to the dye. She's three weeks out since the surgery and not is getting better. She's been on two rounds of antibiotics and its not helping.She is suppose to start radiation soon. Has anyone else heard of such a thing? Thanks",
