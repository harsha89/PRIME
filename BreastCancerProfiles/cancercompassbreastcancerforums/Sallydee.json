    "Content": "First of all breast cancer is curable when discovered early enough. I am a breast cancer survivor and I know of no one in my family who has had breast cancer. There have been other cancers but not breast cancer. I suggest you talk to your doctor about it and start to get breast cancer check ups as soon as possible. A mammogram found mine very early and very contained. It is now four years and I am fine. I will keep you in my prayers. Stay on top of your health and don't expect anyone else to do it for you. Don't take no for an answer from your doctor. Have your parent or someone in authority demand that you be checked early on. Sallydee",
