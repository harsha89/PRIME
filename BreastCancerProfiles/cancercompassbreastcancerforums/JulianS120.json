    "Content": "Hey guys,Â  My mom has been diagnosed with breast cancer stage III in November. She has had 4 or 5 chemotherapy treatments and, of course, has had to shave her head. Naturally this is a very tough time for the family. My question is, has anyone tried marijuana butter and making food with it, and was it helpful for them? Would you guys have any recommended recipes? My mom has NEVER done any drug in her life, so for her to request it is a BIG DEAL. Obviously, the nauseous has been horrible towards her. Thanks for replies and thoughts.",
