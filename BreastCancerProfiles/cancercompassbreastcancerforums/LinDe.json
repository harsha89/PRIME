    "Content": "I did a self breast exam around Christmas/New Years and I felt a small lump about the size of a dime or so & by the time I was able to get into do a mammogram done in the beg. of March, they found it to be 3cm big.  They did a biopsy on it and found it to be breast cancer. I panicked and ran from the biggest supporter that I could have.  I had a lumpectomy & the Dr. called back with the news that he didn't get it all.  That got me more scared.  With how fast it grew, I decided to have a mastectomy done on Apr. 10th of this yr.  a few days later after I got home from the hospital it got infected & had to return to the hospital again.  Not fun having a 104 temp.  They gave me lots of antibiotics while there & also when I got home.  I am doing much better and have been  getting a lot of support from the american cancer society.  They are a wonder place to call.  The Susan G. Koman foundation is also great.  I am also scared and needing support so we can have support together.  My name is LinDe D. and I live in Everett, Wa.  I am on line almost all the time.  My email is: --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
