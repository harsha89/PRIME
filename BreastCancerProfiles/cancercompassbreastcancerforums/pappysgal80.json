    "Content": "I think all disease's change a person's chemistry which changes our body odor/pheromones! My husband always had a musty odor especially when he sweat excessive he was diagnosed with Hep C , then once on Interferon treatment the odor disappeared. I can always tell when his liver is acting up and time for him to make a appointment with Infectious disease doctor when he starts to get that musty odor. He has been on 3 year long Interferon Treatments total. My mother when she has Ovarian cancer omitted a odor, kind of hard to describe the smell. Working as a RN it seemed like each disease had its own smell , example Kidney disease and the smell is similiar with every patient that has Kidney disease. I do not understand why doctors do not take strange odors as a concern of a disease process when patients express a concern.",
