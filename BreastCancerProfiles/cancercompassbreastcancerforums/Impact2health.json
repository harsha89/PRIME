    "Content": "Hi I have read your post. I understand the fear and the fact that you feel as nothing would help. I also have learned about mangosteen and Xanthones in pub med and other sites on cancer as well! The power that this fruit is capable of I find stagering. the medical reports are hard for me to understand. And I am no Doctor nor will I say that this works! All I know is what I see in 4 people that have cancer and are going through treatments. I have seen the gray skin and the sickness from chemo in many people that undertake chemo. I do not see this in these 4 people! I am not in this for the money but the hugs I get from those taking Xango. if you want to find out more go to www.kjboyer.com and I hope those of you that know of this product will look at it again with new eyes! This is not just another Juice as I have found out! your friend on the net Ken Boyer",
