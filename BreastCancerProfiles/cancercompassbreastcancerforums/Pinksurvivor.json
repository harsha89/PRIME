    "Content": "I'm a 4 year breast cancer survivor and my husband and I would really like to try to have a baby in the next couple of years.  I'm 28, had triple positive tumor (ER, PR, HER2), am currently on Lupron injections and taking Aromasin.  I did the chemo and radiation also.  My oncologist says that it should be fine for me to get pregnant and that I shouldn't have any problem.  He said the pregnancy can actually protect my body from the cancer coming back.  It's just hard for me to wrap my head around that!  Is there anyone out there in the same boat as me or who has gotten pregnant after this wild cancer rollercoaster???  I've been trying to research this, but am not having much luck....",
