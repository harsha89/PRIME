I have read with enthusiasm the Kelmun protocol and am planning to give it a try. ! was diagnosed last 2011 as having early stage prostate cancer and tried a countless alternative cures but no one seemed to work for me. Do you think this protocol will work for me? What about the coated aspirin? Shud i take it at the same time im doing the kelmun? Thank you! Sincerely, Lito",
