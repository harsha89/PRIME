    "Content": "I had a mastectomy in Sept.  Had temp. implant put in right then. It was nothing but trouble from day 1. Got infected, and had to come out. I still have a big roll under my arm and back and forward.  I had 4 chemo. was to have radiatrion then they found it on my liver and in my bones. so no radiation. Put me on a pill to 'control' it. said there was no cure, just to control. I ask for a Pet scan, so I had that and a cat last fri.  I was getting little bumps on the 'roll', now they have turned white.  I was to the cancer dr. yesterday, and he said they were breast cancer, that the pill was not working. So he's going to give me injections of Faslodex .  I'm to get 1 then in 2 wks andother one, and 2 wks. later another one. After that 1 a mo.  I ask how long that will last and he said some people go for several yrs, but that's what he told me about the pills too.  I'm thinking of getting a 2nd opinion. As I don't know what they are going to do about this 'roll'. I go to the plastic surgeon on Mon. but since he screwed jup on the implant, I don't trust him.  This visit was to discuss taking the 'roll ' off, but now with the cancer there I don't know what he will say. Does anyone else have stage 4 breast cancer and in the liver and bones , with the breast cancer returning?  ",
