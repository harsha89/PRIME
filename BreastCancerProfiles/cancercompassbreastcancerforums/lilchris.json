      "Content": "hi i felt a lump so i called the clinic in town they gave me an appointment a month later the next day i walked into the emergtency room. everything just started happening from there. i am single was broke so i was covered by the breast cervical act or whatever it is called i was put on medicade the social securitty by the way i was at stage 4 w/ mets 2 the liver so time was of the essence. everyone i have met through this has been unbelievably great. there are so many loving caring people out there to bounce things off of. i am 50 now been through this for 1 1/2 years had chemo double masectomy radiation and i'll be on chemo 4 life. i know this is odd but trully everything has been really smooth going for me   only when one chemo stopped working about 2 months ago did i experience pain got nauseous once  i was put on gemzar then and immediatly the liver tumors went down i don't know why i never got super sick i did loose my hair but it has been growing back for a year now i did gain wieght got lazy fatigued or whatever but i consider myself so lucky in the big picture. i don't know what to expect so i just do what my dr. says and go on without much worries as it is in Gods hands  best of luck to you lilchris",

      "Content": "thanks for your encouragement. turns out i was put on jemzar don't really know the spelling sorry. my ecko came back that my heart was too weak for the red stuff. right before chemo started i could literally feel the tumors growing they felt like a baby kicking to me anyway. the pain was atrocious this was the worst thing that has happened to me from the get go. the advocate sped up treatment for me bless her forever, however after 2 sessions my platlets were only 61 so this tuesday i did not recieve treatment. i was taking pain pills, i had lost my appetite, and i even got nauseous in the hosp cafeteria now i feel like one of the gang.  all is better now i am just afraid i won't be good for next tuesday. i do go to support meetings once a week. i am felling some pain though i take pain meds in the am.so afraid of getting hooked on that stuff my dr. says to relax, so i pray.  i am usually an upbeat person so this is not so tragic for me as perhaps it should. let go let god. the jemzar was working i felt better within the first dose. i love my dr. and nurses, i eat good  thanks again for your encouragement bless you  lilchris",
