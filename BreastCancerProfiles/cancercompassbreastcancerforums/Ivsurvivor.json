    "Content": "Hi Monique-- I am a stage IV \"survivor.\"  I was diagnosed almost exactly two years ago, just after my 30th birthday.  I had mets to the lungs, brain, bones and lymph nodes and pelvis.  I had hundreds of tumors from head to crotch, literally. Today, I have NED (no evidence of disease).  I didn't NECESSARILY do anything alternative: I relied on my doctors for chemotherapy and radiation. However, in addition to my traditional therapies, my doctor's said it would be fine if I tried accupuncture, which I did.  It really seemed to help.  Of course, I also took lots of-- what are considered to be- cancer fighting supplements, like fish oil.  However, you must check with your doctor because some vitamins can counteract chemotherapy. I was told that too much Vitamin C could harm the effects of chemo, so be sure to check. I have a blog I keep at www.fighting-breast-cancer.com if you would like to read more about my particular story. Stay well! And feel free to contact me privately. Karen George",
