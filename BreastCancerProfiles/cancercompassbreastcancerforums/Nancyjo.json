      "Content": "Has any one else been told that the pain they have is probably due to the chemo they received.  I have been having pelvic pain for about 5 weeks that has now migrated to my ribs.  I have had an ultrasound, MRI and bone scan with nothing showing up.  I can live with the pain if this is the cause but I just want to make sure it is not cancer.",

      "Content": "  On 10/8/2009 never4get wrote: My mom was dx with stg 2B ductal carcinoma in Sept 07.  After mastectomy and removal of R armpit lymphnodes (she had only 1+ but it was 7cm in size!! That was how we/she found this cancer! the area in her breast was only 2cm in size and mammogram and Ultra sound did not show it- only breast MRI showed the primary breast cancer)...anyhow, after a mastectomy, 8 rounds of ATC chemo, and 36 radiation treatments, she is now on Tamoxifen (her cancer is ER/PR + and herceptin -); she has horrible pain every day!! She is 54 years old, and up until she got cancer was in great health. No smoke/drink, just works a physical job for U.S. Postal Service.  She had \"bad knees\" prior to the chemo/tamoxifen treatment- her Mom had a knee replacement and we figured sometime in her distant future she also would need knee replacements.  Now, she has such bad pain in her knees- just had cortisone shots with no effect, we will try another new, non-invasive shot/treatment, and then the only thing left to do is the knee replacements.  She also has pain in her back, and all her joints-supposedly from Tamoxifen-as that is a major side-effect of the Tamoxifen...But, she also had such bad pain in her R hip and through her lower back that she went over to the Cancer Center, and they did some bloodwork and an MRI of the area, prior to when her next scans/bloodwork were due.  MRI just showed Degenerative joint disease, and a fatty cyst like older tumor or area at her hip...So they referred her to ortho MD and physical therapy and gave her flexeril.  By the time we went to ortho, the pain was that bad she could barely walk/work, was using a cane, and was miserable with her pain! She is only 54 years old, walking with a horrible limp and a cane!!  I was so paranoid/worried sick that this was bone mets.  But, just had a PETS scan that was clear, and also a bone scan that was fine. Ortho said that the pain was from a pinched nerve in her back, and was shooting down her legs.  Said it was mainly from the degenerative joint disease....they referred her to pain mng.-who said it is her knees, and gave the cortisone shots about 3 weeks ago.  that is where we are now....but she is still in constant pain- always her \"bad knees\"- arthritis, but also through her hips, lower back and pelvis on an irregular basis.  2 years ago, prior to the treatment and being on tamoxifen, she had NO PAIN!!  I think it is part the tamoxifen, and part post-chemo.  Are you on tamoxifen, or an aramose-inhibitor?? How much chemo did you have? and whay type? Also, if you don't mind me asking generally what is your age? I pray for you, and hope your pain gets better!  Have you consulted with only one MD, who I guess is the one who told you this pain was/is from chemo.  When did you finish your chemo? I will watch for your message, take care and I will continue to think of you and include you in my thoughts and prayers!! Hang in there!! -DanielleI our rounds of Adromiacin and Cytoxin, 8 round of Pazitaxol and 1 year of Herceptin.  Plus 6 weeks of radiation of left side.  I am on Arimidex.  I also was pain free before all of this, running 3 miles daily.  Now I am inpain with my ribs and pelvis constantly.  I hope your mother finds some relief soom.  Thank you for your post.  ",
