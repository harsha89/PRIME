      "Content": "Good Afternoon, Sorry to hear about your problem. I just happen to visit a website http://www.jlp.org/rummageminisite/dayrum.shtml which refers to mammograms. Now it looks like the date is Feb 25, 2007. Personally I don't think you should wait this long. But they may have some helpful information. Free Mammograms! The Junior League of Phoenix is proud to be in partnership with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation to offer free mammograms to the first 50 uninsured women, ages 35 and older. The mammograms will be offered at the Rummage Sale beginning at 9:00 a.m. on a first come first served basis. keep looking and if I come across anything, I will let you know. Time is very important when dealing with this subject. Is there a clinic in your area? They can sometimes arrange diagnostic testing with certain facilities, but you must have a physician. Hang in there Gail Williams",
