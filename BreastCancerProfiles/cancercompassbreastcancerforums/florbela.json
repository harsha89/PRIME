    "Content": "Hi there I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to advise me on the budwig diet. I have been taking the protocol for about 1 month now, the tumor has not yet shrank, but it feels lumpy and soft in some areas. The tumor is on my sternum connected more to the left breast area. It was orginally hard, but seems to have changed its feel. Has this happened to anyone else? what are the symptoms I should look out for? Is it ok to eat chicken and fish? I dont often eat them, just maybe once a week, is this ok? or would you reccommed going totally vegiterian? I would love to hear from people or anyone with a similar problem Thank you",
