    "Content": "Yes 1 in 200Â  breast cancer diagnoses is in men.The ribbon for this awareness is one side is blue the other is pink.It is known there are 2 genes identified that are related to or cause breast cancer I cannot remember which. Also men can pass this gene on to there offspring both male and female.Also just because it is passed on doesn't mean it will be activated.As far as a five year old getting this I don't see why it couldnt happen, but hopefully it isn't.",
