    "Content": "I finished radiation treatment for Stage 1 Grade 2 breast cancer in March.  I met with my oncologist and she gave me a reprieve until after I returned from a much needed vacation before I needed to begin Arimidex.  She also gave me two sample bottles to see if I could tolerate it before she wrote a prescription.  I've been back from vacation two weeks and still have not started the medication.  I keep looking at the bottles and thinking about all of the side effects.  I'm 68 years old, the tumor was extremely small, no lymph node involvement and wide clear margins.  The only problem was a 21 Oncotype DX score.  My oncologist said I didn't need chemo--which was good.  Has anyone else debated the use of estrogen surpressing drugs for treatment?  The list of side effects is long for every one of these drugs.  To think about these side effects and know that I need to be on them for five years, is almost overwhelming.  Your thoughts.",
