    "Content": "Took Arimidex in 2005-06 due to breast cancer and had chemo and radiation. Heart test before treatment showed a health heart with no problems. No family history of heart problems. Took Arimidex for 2 to 3 months when I experience pressure in my chest. Heart Doctor took me off Arimidex immediately. The cancer has not come back but the chest pressure did. Now my Aortic heart valve is failing and I need it replaced.",
