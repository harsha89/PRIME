    "Content": "I am a little scared but not freaked out scared. I've had a lump near my nipple that I've been watching for 6 weeks or so. I've had many lumps...I'm just sort of lumpy. They always resolve. Well, this one hasn't. I finally did a breadt exam and also noticed some hard spots under my arm. Not lumps but hard grainy spots that are sort of tender sometimes. I made an appointment with my OB and she felt all I felt and sent me straight to diagnostics and said prepare for biopsy as well. She didn't give me the \"I'm not worried but let's get this checked out.\" So I have an hour until I meet my husband. I'm strangely calm but nervous. Anyone else had that armpit description? Just curious? Anyone had a biopsy? Words of wisdom? I have stalked these boards this week but truthfully didn't think I'd post here. Thank you for anything you have to pass along! I'm 44 btw! :)",
