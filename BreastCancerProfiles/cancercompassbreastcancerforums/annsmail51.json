    "Content": "Do Not give up.  Last June I too had a lump in my right breast.  I also had the terrible burning and pain. I went to my gynecologist and she ordered a mammagram.  It showed nothing.  I asked her to order a sonogram, but she said she saw no reason to. Two days I went to a nurse practioner not too far from my home.  She felt the lump and instantly ordered a sonogram.  She called me the next day with an appointment with a surgeon.  He took the lump out.  It was a fatty tumor which was not malignant.  It was wrapped around some nerves which caused the burning. You go to another physician.  I don't know if you have had a mammagram or not.  I do not trust them any more.  Tell your physician to order a sonogram of your breast.  I know from experience that you have to be persistant.  It is your body!!! Let me know how you come out.  By the way, I have NO MORE PAIN  in this breast!!! Blessings, Ann  ",
