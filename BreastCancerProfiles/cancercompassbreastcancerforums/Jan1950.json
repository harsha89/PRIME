    "Content": "I have a dear friend who has been undergoing chemo for the last 6 months. She felt that her hair was one of her best features and when chemo began her hair started falling out on the second treatment. She was heartsick and depressed! She was uncomfortable in wigs - she thought they looked like a wig. She tried scarves and different hats and found them to be uncomfortable and that they wouldn't stay put. I searched the internet - and at www.cozycap.com I found caps that were soft and comfortable. An added benefit is that they come with witty comments on the caps. I bought her a package of 3 caps called the \"hair loss pack\" as a gift. She found that they were not only comfortable but they give her a lift in spirits. I know she really likes them because every time I see her she has one on. She wears them with her baseball caps that she has decorated with beads. She looks really great. While she realizes that hair loss is just a temporary thing and that beating the disease it is what is important, feeling good about your appearance is good for your mental health.",
