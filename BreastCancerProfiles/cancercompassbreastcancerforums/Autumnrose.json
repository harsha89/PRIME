      "Content": "The same thing happened to me when I went off tamoxifen. I think it's from the hormones readjusting. You had NO estrogen on femara, and now all of a sudden, it's being produced again.  Your body's probably just needs to adjust to the change in hormones, before settling down. I remember reading that it may not be lack of estrogen that causes hot flashes,  but fluctuating hormone levels.  Mine settled down after a few more months.  Mine settled down a few months after stopping tamoxifen",

      "Content": "Two major factors for me were the size of the tumor and keeping my own natural breasts. Luckily, the size of the tumor was small enough that the surgery didn't deform me, just left a small dent, and I had A cup breasts to begin with. I like the shape of my breasts, and didn't want to deal with the unknowns of reconstruction. The other factor, which makes me very happy, is having been able to keep my real nipple sensation, important for sex life! I went through menopause recently and one unfortunate side effect is that orgasms are no longer as strong, but the nipple stim does help augment things. If I had lost that as well, I would have been very upset.",
