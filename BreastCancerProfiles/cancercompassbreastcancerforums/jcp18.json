    "Content": "6 months ago I was in the ER and got a chest ct scan which found a mass in my breast. I had actually known about the mass, but I am 27 years old and had it since a teen. A lot of friends have had similar masses and gotten them removed. Long story short, I got an ultrasound on it which the doctor said didn't look cancerous. However, I have had terrible pain and stinging in the breast with the mass. I have noticed a small white spot and I have no idea how to explain it but it really hurts. Here are links to the images. https://imgur.com/b1LhMOg https://imgur.com/lxuKsz6 I honestly cant find ANYTHING like this on the internet, my nipple likes \"normal\" besides this - maybe slightly dry but thats it. Any thoughts would be really appreciated!",
