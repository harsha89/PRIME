I have a friend right now in Mx with 4th stage breast cancer.  Her Dr. gave up but never told her the ending diagnosis. He sent her home with no hope. A nurse found out how terminal she is.  She is in Mx and doing fabulous.

Just like radiation they tell us. I have done a lot of research and there isn't a bunch of info on it that's why i thought i'd give this a try. Thank you and God bless you. ",

The traditional route? as in standard treatments? yes she is. we aren't into the alternative medicines. We have known way to many people who depended on alternative meds who thought they were doing great and every single one of them passed on. I'm sure its good to go the alternative way to a certain point but not all the way. Am i understanding  you right?  ",

      "Content": "Hi, My mom to has metastic breast cancer that went to her bones. And including her spine...spinal cord. but by the grace of God she never did have paralysis. So don't just settle for what the dr's tell you. They are not God!!! are they not going to try her on chemo? or switch her meds? I wouldn't just let the dr's do nothing. Just because your mom is older doesn't mean she doesn't have the right to live until she is in her 90's if you understand what i mean. Get a second opinion!!! Get a fight going!!! Please do. you don't have to sit and let the dr's tell you when you are going to die. because the sad thing is when the dr's says this to people then its in their minds and they go down hill...Get a fight going ok!!!! Let me know how you and your mom are doing please!!!",
