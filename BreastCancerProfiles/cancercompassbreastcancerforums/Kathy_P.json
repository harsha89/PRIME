    "Content": "Hi, my husband has mesothelioma cancer from asbestos and had radiation everyday except weekends and chemo (cisplatin) once a week. He was told the same thing - that he can't take anything because it interferes. We talked to the docter about mgn-3, but he was not open to that. He did not explain why it interferes. I was disappointed too. I've been reading up on natural stuff, just learning, but the doctor is not open to any health stuff so I am just kinda bothered by it. Thank you, maybe I will hear from you and how things turned out. Kathy",
