    "Content": "Aromacin can cause both. I am on it now, but I have been on Chemo, which but me into early menopause--night sweats and chills. I was on Tamoxifin for 5 years after that, which caused tremendous sweats for 5 years. Talk to your mother's doctor about it, but do not let her take any over-the-counter herbs and the like to counteract the side effects. Some of these herbs mimic estrogen, which can increase the risk of cancer. My doctor prescribed a sleeping pill when I was on the Tamoxifin to knock me out. I used them for about a week, but they made me feel like I had no sleep. I was 42 years old when I first had cancer, and I was menstrating every 27 days.The drugs stopped my menstrating. As the years have gone by, I sweat and chill less. Your mother is older, so she may have her side effects subside in a few months. I slept with an electric blanket and a fan in my room all through the spring fall and winter. Your mother could be sweating from pain,fever, infection, inflamation, or any number of things. Take her to an oncologist for tests and blood work. God bless.",
