    "Content": "Hi.  My friend was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. She started with chemo, but they have now stopped the chemo as her liver started giving problems.  They have now inserted an IV line to her liver.  What does this mean?  Does it mean that the cancer has spread to the liver? And if so, does it mean the cancer is terminal? Please advise.",
