    "Content": "Hello.  During a recent mammogram my doctor told me that I have microcalcifications of the left breast.  He told me to come back in six months for another mammogram.  That second mammogram showed no changes in the microcalcifications.  So now I'm supposed to go back in one year to have them checked again. I'm wondering if these calcifications could be related to some carcinoid tumors (neuroendocrine tumors) that were found in my stomach, and to the elevated calcium and gastrin levels that were found during recent bloodwork.  My doctor doesn't think that they're related but I'm not so sure.  Does anyone have experience with microcalcifications and elevated calcium levels?  Thank you, and best of luck to you all.  Kelly",
