      "Content": "I had Bilateral Double Mastectomy w/o Reconstruction on 7/30/2010 & another on 8/23/2010 to remove dead skin, wherein I opted to have expanders removed...since then I do suffer from tightness of chest w/o pain...My concern now is when I was reading some of the blogs in the earlier months..some had describe an uncontrollably itching..Since I have been having this itchiness recently and has been over a month..I looked up this info...and was brought out enlarged lymph nodes can cause itchiness, though my lymph nodes were not removed...could this be a problem???   Have any of you had this post trauma problem? I will be seeing my primary doctor, tomorrow, but would like feedback from you all...Would most appreciate this very much....Thank you and I do hope, you are doing well, as can be...my prayers are with you all....Marty ",
