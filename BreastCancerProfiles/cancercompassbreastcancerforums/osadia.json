Nobody warned me about this. Does it go away in a few months? What have you found that helps? GP suggesting low dose of Tricyclic antidepressant. Does that work? Panadeine etc doesn't. Thanks for your ideas and thoughts - love to hear from people who have overcome this problem!! I have exactly an 8mm tumor two. I also had pre cancer on the right breast but have the same exact symptoms you did in my arm and around excision. I kept asking the doctor if it was normal and they said yes..Then I went to a pain specialist and he told me it was neuropathic pain and gave me two meds.Lyrica and Ultram. I start taking it tomorrow. I pray to God this stuff works. I am scared and want to make sure this goes away in the long run. Let's keep in touch.",
