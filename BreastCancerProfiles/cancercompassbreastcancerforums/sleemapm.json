The only side effect of taking Arimidex that I still have is dizziness. Unfortunately this caused a fall 13th October resulting in a bad concussion, 9 fractured ribs and Vertigo. I had 6 nights in hospital, in a lot of pain. Thankfully, after 3 sessions with a festibular physiotherapist the vertigo has been resolved but I do still have dizziness. I am hopeful the dizziness will go with time but for now I shall be extra careful to avoid falling again. Unfortunately, I fell from a height of 1 1/2 metres onto concrete but as I do not even remember what I was doing before the fall (or after) it is a mystery as to what did cause the fall. The purpose of this post is to warn anyone who does have a side effect of dizziness to take it SERIOUSLY. Other than this mishap I am feeling fantastic again. I will not be going back onto the Arimidex.",

I am so confused.  Can anyone share their experiences with the Arimidex?  I would truly appreciate any advice. I had breast surgery, chemo and then six weeks of radiotherapy.  I was prescribed Arimidex and took it for almost a year before I has a three month rest from it.  Within a month of starting it again I was suffering all the same side effects. Lethergy, muscle pain, bone pain so bad I could no longer play with ny Grandchild. My fingers were so numb I coud no longer do any craft work at all.  After some serious thought I decided to stop taking the Arimidex. It was MY decision made for myself.  I told my family it was MY decision and I would not change my mind because I wanted to LIVE again.  I had been through enough and whatever time I had, be it long or short, I wanted to enjoy it.  I feel so, so much better today.  My husband only said last week that he was thrilled every time he heard me play with our Grandson and laugh again.  I am living now and that is what I want.  I have and will not have any regreats whatever life throws at me now. So long as the decision to stop taking Arimidex is yours it is the correct decision. Enjoy your life as a survivor and enjoy every day of it! ",
