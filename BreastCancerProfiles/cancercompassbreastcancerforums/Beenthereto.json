    "Content": "Six years ago this month, I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer, the rarest form of breast cancer. We had just buried my sister two weeks prior to my diagnosis. She had a different type of breast cancer. I was told life expectancy with inflammatory breast cancer was between 18 - 36 months. Boy was I terrified. I was scared of the cancer, but I was even more afraid of the treatment due to watching what my sister had gone through. However, thanks to treatment and care of a wonderful oncologist, I not only made it through my treatment which included adriamyacin and taxotere, mastectomy and radiation, but lived without further need of treatment until the fall of 2003. During the months and years following my initial treatment, I went for frequent visits to my oncologist which eventually spread out to every six months; I did not have ct scans, mri's or blood work as a matter of routine, as I recall. However, when I present a concern or complaint, my oncologist is quick to respond with the appropriate tests and evalutions. When I discovered a lump on my neck in December 2003, my doctor immediately biopsied the lump and was able to conclude that I had metastatic cancer in my lymph nodes. Despite a dim prognosis, I have done well under a variety of treatments. I have lived past the life expectancy of a patient in my situation. As of six weeks ago, I was able to stop all treatments as my disease has stablized. My doctor listens to me and takes all complaints and concerns seriously. I encourage you to seek out a doctor who will listen to you. I think it's natural to be concerned about cancer returning. If you have access to a support group in your area, you might consider joining it. There's something about associating and talking with other survivors that is comforting and reaffirming. Good luck, Kaddy.",
