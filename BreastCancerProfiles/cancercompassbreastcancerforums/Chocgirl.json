      "Content": "Well, seems like you are forgetting a few steps in between. You write you may have a lump already, please have that checked out first. Then discuss the odds that you have hereditary bc in your family with an expert (several cases of bc in one generation, especially below the age of 50 or in a male would suggest that). Then you may opt to be tested for the most common BRCA1 and 2 gene defects. Whatever the outcome of the above, I would urge you and all women to learn to properly self exam their breasts. Self exams are how most bc is discovered, especially in premenopausal women.",

      "Content": "Maybe my experience can convince you that chemo ain't necessarily all that bad. I recently had the 3rd of 8 chemo's and with modern nausea meds I continue working (after chemo on Friday I was back for a half day on Tuesday), still exercising, going to restaurants. Sure my energy levels are down and I am more susceptible to any common bug, but losing my hair after 2 weeks has really been the worst for me sofar. Especially since your cancer is her2 (tends to spread more easily) and you are so young, please opt for the chemo. I am 32 and had a 1.7 cm tumor (not her2), my doctor calculated my odds for the cancer not to return were halved by chemo. It's only statistics, but still.........  Wishing you good health :-)",
