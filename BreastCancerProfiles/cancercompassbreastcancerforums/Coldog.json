    "Content": "PlainJane,  This is my first time doing this.  I have been on Arimidex for 2 years and over the past few months I have been experiencing problems with the Bottom of my Feet.   It has been making me crazy.  THey feel prickly  and a little numb.  I bought the good shoes, saw my doctor and now I have an appointment with a foot Doctor.  Then I started thinking about the Arimidex and decided to relook at the side effects and here I am.  Your response has eased my mind.  Thank you.  I guess my next move is an appoitment with my oncologist.   coldog",
