    "Content": "Background: 6 years ago, at age 40, I went for my first ever mammogram to learn that I have Breast Cancer . I quickly had a lumpectomy followed by 7 weeks of radiation (did not have time to think or feel really, was all rushed!). I\u2019ve had a lot of reactions from the radiation as the years have gone by. Too many to list. But I just deal with them as they come.   I am luckily in remission now, but frequently wonder what would happen if my breast cancer was to come back- what would I do?   So, what is My Plan when it Recurs?  I have done a lot of research and have found out a lot of information I wish I had known 6 years ago. In short, I would take a more personalized approach to my cancer, and here is here is my plan: First, since tissue is required to personalize a treatment, I would store my tumor tissue. No one knows that once you have your tumor taken out, it is not preserved in a manner to keep the cells alive.  For that, I would call www.storemytumor.com  Second, I would do a genetic test to narrow down the list of drugs that may work on my tumor, and in parallel do a sensitivity assay that tests which drug, experimental drug or combination works best on my tumor.  The results from these tests will help my oncologists pick the right drug or combination that we know has a higher chance of working on my tumor.For Genetic Testing, see OncoDNA, FoundationOne, Caris and the likes\u2026 for Chemo Sensitivity, see Therapy Select, Rational Therapeutics, Mitra Biotech and the likes\u2026 Third, I would seek immunotherapy. There are different kinds, but from what I read, cellular treatment option (vaccines and T-Cell treatments) have promising results and little side effects.  They are experimental, but available in different countries.   The idea behind them is to use elements in my tumor to activate my immune system to fight my cancer. Immunotherapy minimizes the chance of relapse. ** apparently this is one of the best tools to stay in remission longer, and to get rid of \u201cresidual cancer cells in the body that are always the cause of recurrence\u201d **For immunotherapy, see Unifontis, IOZK, Ventus, and the likes\u2026In this day and age there is no reason to settle for standard of care when there are better or supplementary options out there. I want to find all these options and be ready!   Ladies, what else is out there? What else should I research?   Please share feedback on scientific stuff, not yoga, meditation, diet and feel good stuff. I drink enough wine to stay positive ;)",
