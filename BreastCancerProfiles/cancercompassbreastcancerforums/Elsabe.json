      "Content": "I went for my annual routine mammogram  in December 2008 (my GP did not even know I was going) - the mammogram did not reflect anything. The radiographer who did the ultrasound being routine procedure, did the right breast then left breast and for NO reason, but an angels hand guiding him because he admitted that he never goes back to a breast, he returned to the right breast and there it was! He immediately did a needle biopsy, but I think from experience he just knew and he also informed my GP - before I was back at the office, my GP called to inform that she had already made the appointment with the surgeon that afternoon! Following my consultation with the surgeon, I had an lumpectomy in January 2009 and subsequently 31 sessions radiations. I am a very lucky girl as the radiation had no side effects on my. I am now on Arimidex for two weeks and am watching out for the side effects everybody are talking about.  Elsabe L",

      "Content": "Hi, I have the same problem .. very high cholesterol within three months since I started using Arimides (and I never had a cholesterol problem before). I just had my first check-up - mammo, bone density, abdominal x-rays etc the latter which reflected gallstones, this being caused by the cholesterol. I am consulting with my surgeon this morning - the oncologyst has recommended that the gallbladder be removed! ... more surgery within six months of the lympectomy.  Apparently all this kind of medication, i.e. Tamoxifin and others  can cause high cholesterol.",
