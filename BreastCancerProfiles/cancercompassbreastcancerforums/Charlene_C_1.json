    "Content": "I am a BC survivor also and my hot flashes were horrible 5-6 an hour. I would just be in tears every day. My doctor decided to have me try gabapentin. This drug was originally for siezures but they found it to help with nerve pain and it is used for things like shingles. Now they have found it to work on hot flashes and it really does work!. I am down to just a couple a day and most times it is like 'I think I'm having a hot flash' . The capsules are 300mg and I can take up to 3 per day. I take 1 at night and so far I have been fine. The reason I take it at night is because it can make you a little sleepy and it has helped my sleep too. I can sleep for 6-7 hours straight insted of waking up 3 or 4 times a night. In this really hot weather I have tried taking one in the day and haven't had a problem with being sleepy.  So ask your doctor about this medication, gabapentin, it has worked a miracle with me.  Good Luck",
