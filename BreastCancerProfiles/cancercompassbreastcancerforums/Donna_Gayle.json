My oncologist says it is not caused by the medication.  I'm looking for anyone who will agree with me on this problem.",

I was on Aromasin for 10 months.  In the beginning it wasn't bad.  Then after a few months the headaches came, sometimes lasting days until I would skp a pill or two to make it go away.  Then a rash developed which became very bad.  I switched to Femara and felt much better.  Headaches come and go with hot flashes,but not constant. I still have the rash but it is much better.  I have been to 3 Drs. who haven't found anything for the rash.  My next step is to see s dermatologist.  I think my body can stand a certain medication only so long then it lets me know.  I don't know how long I will be able to take Femara, but I find that sometimes if I just skp 1 pill I can break the cycle and feel better.  My oncologist isn't happy with that, but I can't help it.",

Incidently I also have Ovarian cancer and was on Gemzar for that (and breast cancer) but am taking a break from the chemo to see how the Aromasin works. Any comments would be appreciated. Gayle",

I think you should talk to a plastic surgeon and see what they think about getting a reduction on one side and reconstruction on the other so you will feel balanced! Good luck. Deborah I had the left breast removed, right breast reduced, and implant on left all in one operation....not a good idea but it did work., lots of pain for quite a while.   This was 12 years ago.  I had pain every time they added more saline to the implant.   Finally I said enough!  The two breasts don't match, but put a bra on and I'm good to go...much better than a prosthesis.  I still have a tight feeling in the implant, but no pain.  Good luck with your decisions.  ",

      "Content": "A few comments on the implants.  I had a single mastectomy 12 years ago.  My breast were so large -DD - that I asked to have the other breast reduced and an implant for the breast removed.  I had no idea the pain I would have from the implant.  First, I wanted much smaller breasts, but the plastic surgeon convinced me that a \"C\" would be best.  I think if the implant had been smaller I would not have had as much pain.  It has now been in for 12 years with no problems - it is higher than the other breast, but once I get a bra on, things look pretty good.  And, the pain is gone most of the time.  I always feel a tightness there and feel I need to wear a bra while sleeping to keep things where they should be. If you do get implants, keep them small, and I wish I had had a double mastectomy even though there has been no cancer in the good breast.  However there is breast cancer in a lumph node under my sternum which they are treating along with the peritoneal they found 3 years ago.    If I had had a hysterectomy after the breast cancer, I would not have two cancers today. Good luck with you decision.  There are many factors to think about and you are doing the right thing by asking questions.  I should have done a little more research, but at the time I was so worried about the cancer, it was consuming me.  I'm now a well-seasoned cancer patient and research everything and drive everyone nuts asking questions. Let us know what you decide to do. Gayle",
