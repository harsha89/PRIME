    "Content": "Agreed, you are definitely experiencing normal side effects of an extremely stressful task.   I would think the hardest thing is to balance taking care of your mother but also tending to yourself as well.  Maybe try taking a little time out and do something that you enjoy.  It may sound simple, but its bound to do you (and your mother!) a world of good. Try not to make things worse by getting stressed out about BEING stressed out.  Take yourself out of the cycle by paying attention to your body and what is is telling you it needs. You are a blessing for changing your life for your mother!",
