    "Content": " After 3 years of Tamoxifen with very mild side-effects I was put on Aromasin. Four months into it I could not take the increased hot flashes and really painful joints. I am 59 and have always been very active. I continue to walk each day and do some weights, but can no longer do aerobics class. I recently switched to Femara and have noticed that the joint pain has actually decreased - - it's still  there but  after I am up for a short time it seems to lessen. I am also wondering if anyone has experienced some \"spotting\" while on the aromatase inhibitors. I have had this happen 3 times in the last 6 months - - usually after some pretty intense activity like dancing for 4 hours or power walking several miles. The first time it happened I had to have a uterine biopsy - -don't want that again, but also wonder what's going on. Anyone experience this?? thanks   On 5/11/2008 Suzie M wrote: You might be able to figure out if the Femara is causing your pain by stopping for a shorter period of time. I've had a lot of unpleasant side effects on AI drugs since pretty nearly day 1 (I've been on them 2 years now) and twice I decided I needed a break from the hot flashes and the pain. Both times I stopped for just a week and I felt somewhat better while off the meds, but also had it a little easier for a while after I resumed taking them. I don't think anyone knows how long we can stop without endangering our health but I doubt that a week could make that much difference and it may be that a month is not too long either. Most breast cancer is very slow growing, particularly the breast cancers that are usually found in women who are middle aged or older. I hope you get some relief. We've all suffered enough!  ",
