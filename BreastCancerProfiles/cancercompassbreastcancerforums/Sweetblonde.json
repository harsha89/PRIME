      "Content": "Hi Rose, Just wanted to say how sorry I am to hear your news. How are you coping? Amazing to think you had gone 22 years since the initial diagnosis. I suppose it gives one a feeling of safety the further away from it. My surgeon told me last week at my first year check-up that it takes time to feel safe and trust the body, but due to my aggressive cancer, he reminded me it could come back at anytime, even 25 yrs down the road. It seems such a long way off and may never happen, but then I read your story and it made me think how hard it must be after so many years. You are in my prayers Rose.",

      "Content": "Hi Nancy, I have just been taken off Arimidex and Zoladex until my upcoming appt Oct 27th with the oncologist. I have been suffering terrible migraine attacks in which I throw up and often need hospitalization, and in addition, the hot flashes have been so horrible that I am waking up constantly, leaving me exhausted and deeply fatigued as it is clear my body never gets a chance to go into the deep sleep stage in which our body restores and rests. I was taken off the above drugs three weeks ago, and guess what? This week I have slept right through undisturbed all night long, no hot flashes --not one --- and even better...no migraine attacks or vomiting!!! The joint pains have improved too, so this tells me alot about the drugs effect on my body. It will be interesting to see what my onc. decides is in my best interest ...have a feeling he will suggest Tamoxifen..but will keep you posted. Oh yes, also in the daytime, I am clear-headed and no longer seem to be forgetful...It was so terrible, I had to write everything down and keep lists, and could not remember names or anything simple!!! So I do know what you mean Nancy. I hope it improves for you soon, and maybe you need to talk it over with your onc too, if you have not already done so. Jane",

      "Content": "Hi Lori, I am so sorry for what you are going through right now....I know how difficult this path is to travel...having been there myself. My own mother died of bowel cancer, but had suffered from multiple sclerosis for years, and in May 2004 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, and am battling with it as I write. I can understand you not wanting to burden or offload your worries onto your family, as I tended to do the same, but when I finally did open up, the family were wonderful and supportive. My dad who I had feared telling after all he had gone through with his own incurable illness and loss of my mum was marvellous; I did not want to cause more anguish or worry for him, but when I told him this and why I had put off telling him, he told me he would have been upset at me for NOT telling him and that I had done the right thing. He wanted to be part of the process, whatever that meant...and like me, he prayed the tests would be wrong, but when they confirmed what deep inside we already knew....he was absolutely wonderful. Dad lives in England miles away, and I am in Canada far from my family, but I have felt their love cross the miles into my heart and it has given me courage and strength to be brave and keep on fighting. I just want to let you know my prayers and thoughts are with you too, and anytime you feel like writing, do so on this site if it helps you? I have met some lovely ladies on this site, who have been inspirational. We share and learn from each other. Take care Lori. Jane",

      "Content": "Hi Dorothy B. I am 45 yrs old and had a mastectomy last July 2004 with lymph node involvement. I am starting radiation shortly. I have suffered non-stop pain in my surgical site and underneath my arm where the lymph nodes were removed, and have to take oxycodene for pain...I am allergic to ibuprofene. Sometimes the pain is horrendous in this area, and I have been told radiation will likely worsen the pain to both areas, so it is not something I am looking forward to. I had wanted to avoid having radiation but due to lymphatic/vascular invasion, my age at diagnosis and close margins (which pathologist report states cannot be considered clean) the radiologist tells me I must have it because I am at risk 70% of reoccurrence in the primary site. Last appt. she looked me seriously in the eye and asked me if I ever thought about my death?!! I guess she was trying to get her point across that I need this radiation, pain or no pain down the road and she felt more increased pain to this area, plus damage to the lung and heart was a risk worth having to reduce the risk factor I have now! It is compounded by my oncologist and surgeon who do not think it necessary to have radiation, and the latter said I was such a wee thing, he did not want to put me through anymore than was necessary -- the radiologist was furious with them!! It is hard to make the 'right' decision sometimes with so many different opinions from so called professionals who have your best interests at heart...what I have learnt from all of this is to be my best advocate and listen to my intuition more. By the way, in Jan 2004 I was told at an annual physical I had a small cyst which was benign, nothing to worry about, as it was a bit of jelly! If I did not listen to my intuition by April 2004 when the pain increased, the lump increased and the pain under my arm began, along with changes in my breast shape and nipple, I was told by my surgeon due to my aggressive growing cancer I would have been dead within six months!! We all have our own stories don't we? Mine now is to hope this pain lessens and the radiation does not worsen it, or that I do not get lymphedema as a result of the radiation.",

      "Content": "Hi, my pathologist report stated that my margins 'could not be considered to be clear', and the margin was close to the surface. My oncologist and radiologist told me this means there is a high chance of microscopic disease, and higher risk of reoccurence of 75-80% in the left side (had a mastectomy). Because of this, I have to have radiation (which I am waiting for) to the chest, axilla and clavicle. I was told the radiation will not prevent a reoccurence due to being so high-risk, but it will minimize the chance to about 35%. I had lymph node involvement and am age 45 at time of diagnosis. Your age, 45 and under, lymph node involvement, grade of tumour and margins when added up decide your risk factor, and chances of reoccurence. All factors combined make me a high risk for reoccurence. Hope this helps, but maybe you can ask your doctors...I did! Good Luck.",
