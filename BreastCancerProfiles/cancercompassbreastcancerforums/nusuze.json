    "Content": "Hi ladies, I'm in the middle of radiation with another 3 weeks to go. I was diagnosed with triple + in June & I was done with chemo on Dec. 1st. I'll be kept on Herceptin until next August. My oncologist suggests I take taxmoifen for 5 years. After reading all the horror stories about these drugs, there's nothing else on the market with limited side effects? This really is outrageous, and all the problems you ladies are experiencing is crazy. This is the 21st century & we're limited to these drugs. I'm 58 years old & I have been getting my meds from greenlifemedications.com don't want to feel like I'm 85. What to do is the big question & it's very concerning.",
