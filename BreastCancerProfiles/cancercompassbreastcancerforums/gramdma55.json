I was stage 3 2b with node positive.  So keep pushing for answers from your dr.  If you don't get what you like find another Dr.                                          A friend                                           Donna       I just got the results of the remains of my  lumpectomy.  Auxillary sentinal lymph node #1 excision: @lymph nodes neg. for carcinoma Note: Cytokertain stains were performed and  negative. Left breast lumpectomy Infiltrating ductal Carcinoma,poorly differentiated with high nuclear grade, modified Bloom-Richardson grade 3/3, 1.3 cm in maximum size.nuclear grade high in 10-15% of the tumor. In further down in the pathologist report it says changes consistent with prior biopsy site. No evidence of ADH,DCIS or invasive carcinoma.( same thing for posterior margin anterior margin) I am totally confused.  Dr. said good news is cancer has not shown in lymph nodes or in margins around lupectomy, but  because lump was larger than first thought(7-10mm) now was 1.3cm they may want me to go thro chemo first before radiation. Because I have no hormone reactives I cannot get anything to treat this with hormones. Can someone please explain what is ADH DCIS. what is a Bloomfiels- Richardson grade 3/3??",

I lost both my Mom and sister to breast cancer and want to know as much as possible to pass on to my two daughters and niece.

      "Content": "I just started chemo.  I too had no lymph gland involvement but my cancer was hormone negative making chemo not affecting the cancer in breast so I will have radiation after chemo.  The chemo is for any other cancer in my body that might have gone astray. My tumor was 1.3 cm and along with that and the neg hormones the tumor had aggressive characteristics.  So the chemo is just more insurance. Ask your Dr. about the type of cancer tumor and whether it is hormone receptive or negative. That does make a difference. I will be on chemo for 8 weeks in 2 week intervals. the 5x a wk for 5 wks radiation. I have always been very healthy and I am 64yrs old and lost both Mom and sister to breast cancer so at high risk. Tehy both died within 2 yrs of finding the cancer,it was very aggressive. but I didn`t know too much as this was 20yrs ago for my sis and 40 for my Mom, then both in their 40`s   Good luck to you",

      "Content": "I just started chemo today with taxol by IV. I first get benedryl  as a premed and also Steriods. I was told that leg and joint pain would be an issue. If ibprophen doesn`t work then can take percocet or darvocet. I found that having a hot cup of decafe tea with ibprophen gets into your system fast and it helps.  I have two herniated discs in my back and lately hip and leg have been acting up and I take a1/@ of a percocet and then I can go to sleep. As far as the taxol I am in a protolcol treatment to see if more at first try and faster works better than stretching treatment out so I will go evry 2 weeks for treatment  and 4 cycles, with Neulasta 24hrs after each chemo treatment.Neulasta is to build up blood cells so counts don`t go down before I have to have chemo again, I will have radiationon the breast affected  as it cannot be treated with chemo. It was hormone neg and her2neg. So chemo is to proyect the rest of my body from cancer.I had no lymph glands involved(cancer free) and sourrounding tissue samoles around milk gland were clear also. chemo is a precautioary thing. I hope you find my advice will help. If you don`t want drugs like oxyconde/appa then the tylenol extra strenght or IB with hot tea does help.",

      "Content": "Hi,  I too had to have radiation and chemo.  The cancer center I initially went to did the chemo.  I am retired and have Humana for coverage. they pay a certain amount and chemo is alot. They pay ok but not all and I just told the hospital that I would have to make payments. Tell them your situation and a social worker may be able to help you as you are not working. As far as the radiation, I had to pay $30 each time I went because the radiation wasn`t in the hospital. Had it been in the hospital I wouldn`t have had to pay each time. But a 45 minute ride to the hospital and radiation took 10 minutes each time. Your husbands coverage may be different. check it out. but do look into the hospital or cancer center for treatments and the social worker there,they can help you.  Good luck, gramdma55",
