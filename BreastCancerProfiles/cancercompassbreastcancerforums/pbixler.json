      "Content": "Re: Lost and Alone, You are not alone. Look at all the replies. I got on to search for support for myself and I was just diagnosed. But for some reason saw your post and wanted to respond. Sometimes you have to be your own cheerleader. Take each day at a time. Do what you can do and start again each morning. It is ok to cry. Start some kind of project with your Mom. When I knew my Father was in his final stages of Parkisons,Â  I started a notebook. I would ask him questions such as give me advice if I have trouble at work, give me advice if I become sick later in life. Oh his good days I would ask questions and write his replies down. They were valuable to me later and he enjoyed knowing I would have his advise. I even asked him to give me advise for raising my daughter and asked him advise when she married. I will get on later and write more. And most of all you have your Father in Heaven. He never sleeps and is availiable 24/7.",
