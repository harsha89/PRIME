On the oncologist's recomendation she is going to undergo Cytoxan and Taxotere therapy (4 treatments at 3 week intervals). Among other things, she is concerned with hair loss... if she is going to lose it she  wants to act proactively -  cut it off first- donate her hair -  shave her head- have it henna \"tattooed\" and wear it proudly....   This is clearly about her keeping control of her life, her appearance and her femininity. her first choice, of course, is to keep her hair. She asked me to come on line and find out what she should expect as far as hair loss goes... does anyone know what percentage of women on this therapy regime experience hair loss?  Bless you all, a loving husband I am on the exact same regimen.  My hair fell out two weeks to the day after my first treatment.  I have now completed 4  of the 6 cycles and I find that my eyebrows and eyelashes are getting very thin. All my body hair has fallen out... underarm, leg, etc.  I did find a site on ebay that has some quality wigs at very reasonable prices so I can at least have a little fun with the hair.  I bought long and layered, spiked and highlighted and curly and straight.  Try ebay seller jasmine wigs.  Hope this helps.  I hate being bald!!",
