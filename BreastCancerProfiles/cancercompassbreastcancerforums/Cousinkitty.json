I do not remember the details, but I had visited an alternative group where people felt strongly against biopsies. Gather your information first, and don't forget to say your prayers. Proceed when you feel good (enough) about it. As an extra measure, there is evidence that milk thistle is beneficial for the liver. -Kitty",

If you read the various postings on it, most folks, me included, are plagued with a variety of discomforts. If I were cleared and had a low risk for recurrence, there is no way I would be putting up with this medicine. I would exercise and seek nutritional counsel and build up my immune system, and stay close to God. All the best to you, -Kitty",
