If by some chance your symptoms turn out to be IBC, you cannot afford to wait until October to see a surgeon. You need to find out what's going on here, because if (and let's hope not) that this is IBC you need to treated yesterday.  My wife was recently diagnosed with IBC. Her only symptom was a swelling of the left breast. No pain, no lumps, no orange peel, no warm skin, no anything else you normally hear about with this form of cancer. Mammogram and ultrasound were negative. Luckily, the doctor who did the tests suggested seeing a surgeon, and of course he immediately did a skin and core biopsy. The skin biopsy came back questionable, and the core came back positive. There was only a two week period from the day she first visited a doctor about this issue until her first chemo treatment. It's an agressive form of cancer, and you don't have time to sit and wait around if you have the slightest suspicion.  I really hope your issue is not related to IBC, but you cannot gamble here. Get some help now! Let us know how things turn out.",
