    "Content": "Has anyone had any gastro problems with Aromasin?  I am having bad nausea and abdominal cramping and the only thing that has changed in my life is my oncologist switched me from Arimidex to Aromasin in July.  This was because the bone and joint pain from Arimidex was getting hard to live with.  Any input would be appreciated.  I am two years into my Aromatase Inhibitor treatment and its a roller coaster ride.",
