    "Content": " So sorry to hear that you are having this problem.  I also developed peripheral neuropathy in hands and feet towards the last few of my carbo/taxol chemos. This was around april 2007.    Physical therapy helped to reduce the numbness (i rarely had any realy pain) and along with tai chi improved my balance to almost normal.  Still persistent numbness on bottom of toes, balls of feet,, and tips of fingers. I had acupuncture which did not help much at all. in 12/07  a neurolgist prescribed elavil but it made me drugged and did nothing.   The rehab doc at Memorial Sloan Kettering tried me on Lyrica oct 2008l and again last month but it didn't help and just made me very tired.  He said that he would try cymbalta next.  I recommend that if you can you get to a rehab doc who works with cancer patients asap do it.  I f I had gone to this rehab doc almost 2 years ago when the symptoms started, i probably would have been doing alot better.  For now, it's mostly annoying but is not fun when my feet get so cold that they feel like blocks of ice.",
