I'd like to get her an extra special get-well gift. I was thinking of something that will help her through this time but I don't want it to be strictly about the cancer...I'm sure she thinks of it enough. Any ideas?  Steph  Buy her something that she would like but not buy for herself.  Something that is pretty and femine.  Let her know that she is still a beautiful woman and not a disease or breasts.",
