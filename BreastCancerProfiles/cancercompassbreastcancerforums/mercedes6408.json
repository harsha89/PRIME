Just celebrated my 5 year anniversary!!!!!  I know your fear.  I have lymph node involvement.  I had a mastectomy in 2006 followed by chemotherapy followed by reconstruction.  It was a long road.  But I'm okay!  ",

I had the exact same diagnosis 7yrs ago and I chose to have a mastectomy as I am a nurse and beyond child bearing years.  I chose reconstruction also and am very happy with the results. I had a double sentinal node and that was removed and it had not spread anywhere. The reconstruction is time consuming afterwards but worth it. I just wish I could have had both breasts removed but I had just had major back surgery and the neurosurgon said I needed at least one arm to get up out of a chair.  So after the surgery you and your doc choose, you will know what stage you are and whether you may need chemo or radiation. Try to calm down, take someone with you to appts and take a notebook to keep track of what the different docs say. You will get through this.  See if you can find a support group in your area. It will help to hear others stories and see what kind of treatment is available in your area. Expect friends and family to be very upset, my co-workers would come into my office crying.  They were  more upset than I was.  Take one step at a time and feel free to ask questions anytime.... Gayle Good advice, Gayle.  I also got the Susan M. Love, M.D. Breast Book.  It was very helpful.",
