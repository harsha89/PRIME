    "Content": "I have just had a double mastectomy for a second breast cancer (first was 2005, did lumpectomy, radiation, and three rounds of taxotere, carboplatin (could not start herceptin if I did Adriamician) and a year of herceptin - was her2nu positive, ER&PR positive, node negative). It is not a true recurrence, but sort of a \"clone\" of the first one. Barely ER positive this time, but it is her2nu again. Node negative again. I am really on the fence about chemo. The treatment did not work last time, so why should I think it will this time? I did stop the chemo early, however, they wanted me to do six rounds (body aches were horrible and I had just been divorced and unemployed and felt that I needed to get back in the game). But, the recommended protocol now is 4 rounds (so me doing 3 probably was not so far-fetched). My onc says I have a 28% chance of mets in the next ten years without doing anything further (I think these are the general stats for just doing the mastectomy) and it depends on how much risk I am willing to take....but he says I am young (50) and he wants me to do chemo again. With a total of 14 negative nodes it does not seem likely that it has spread. I think I may just really work on my immune system, nutrition, reducing stress, etc. and take my chances. But, I have an 11 yr old son, so it is a tough decision. Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
