    "Content": "Hi, I have also been diagnosed with breast cancer that has metastasized to my bones. This was after almost one year of telling doctors that I was experiencing pain at various points of my body. I have never heard of the drugs you mentioned. I am on six months of chemotherapy, but has not been told what the chances of my surviving this are. The chemo keeps reducing my white blood cell count so much that I have had to put off treatment twice. How did you find out about this stage of the cancer and what are the chances of survival with the drugs you are taking. Fay Gordon",
