    "Content": "Hi! I am 39 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in August.  I have been doing chemo since September.  I will continue my treatments through the winter and then will have surgery in the spring.  I was wondering if anyone could offer any advice as to how they made the decision regarding a lumpectomy vs. a double masectomy.  I have had the genetic testing and I do not have the genetic mutation...so it appears I will have a choice regarding my surgery options.  Any thoughts would be so greatly appreciated!!",
