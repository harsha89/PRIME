But this rash is different from the shingles outbreak. Mary Hi Mary, Thanks for the response.  Does the rash itch?  How long had you been taking the Arimidex before the rash showed up.  I had really severe itching.  Red papular lesions on stomach, back, groin, & chest. I had itching and rash around eyes and face.  I did find one journal article that documented someone having this response from the arimidex.  Here is the name of article if you are interested in reading. \"Drug-induced pruritic micropapular eruption: anastrozole, a commonly used aromatase inhibitor\". If you type it in Google the article will come up. I've discontinued the medication but I will be seeing my oncologist to talk.  She was out of town when all this happened. I know I am suppose to take it for 5 years as I was treated for 3 rd stage breast cancer. I had Bilateral mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation and was told to take Arimidex.",

      "Content": "Has any one had a skin rash since taking arimidex (anastrozole) 1 mg daily e.g. itchy raise patches on abdomen, groin, chest, eyelids, and areas under eyes?  The itching is intense at night.  I have been checked my MD and dermatologist this is not scabies.   Finally had biopsy of one of the patches.  The resuts showed the histopathologic findings are consistent with the clinical impression of a reaction to a medication.  The pathology (lab report) cannot name the drug.  That will take me getting over the terrible skin erruptions and possible trying the Arimidex again.  Was wondering if any one else has had a similiar reaction.",
