Is that mean that I have a Breast Cancer?  My mother died from breast cancer 5 years ago, btw...   I searched some links where I found some informations, but is not much to me...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer  http://www.diseasesarchive.com/Breast+Cancer   Hello I read your post with personal alarm - I was diagnosed with BC in 2001 and had a painful lump too. The funny thing is that before the biopsy the nurses aid brused off my worry saying that canerous tumors usually do not hurt. That is not true in all cases!  Additionally, I would run not walk to get a mamogram and ultrasound - from my experience. My painful lump grew really fast and went from a .5 cm to 2 cm in about a month. That means from early dection to stage 3 with lymph node involvement and surgery/chemo/radiation. Good luck! Stay on the message board so we can get your update!",

Had maste,chemo 6 months, then went on tamox for 3 months, started getting blurred vision, switched to arimidex and then the real pain began..could have used a cane for walking...quit that..My oncolgist is really unhappy, but I dont believe that it is necessary to take those specific drugs to live...am doing alternative medicine for aromatase inhibitors like Dim, melatonin, vitamin d, mangosteen juice, green tea extract, maitake d mushroom extract, fish oils, little to no dairy, organic everything as much as possible walking 30 or more everyday........cant live the other way Hello Diane, How long have you been on your non-chemical regeime? this is very important to me. I quit Arimedex after 6 years of depression, weight gain and lost libido. I told my husband I wanted off the drugs and we would just take our chances. This was April 2008. By December 2008 I had gone through a blood clot relating to a lymph node involvement (cancerous) and diagnosed with BC in my lung. Just finished chemo last month..  my current onc. says that it came back since I quit the aromatase inhibitors. I was doing some organic methods with fish oil, curcumin, mangosteen, etc. but it did not work he says.  Now I am feeling like I will essentially be committing suiside if I stop taking Aromasin and trying to go natural. Very confusing.    ",

      "Content": "I posted above about three months ago and reported few side affects. However I began thinking about what was going on with my body, and I realized that i now had high blood pressure, stubborn weight gain and depression...so it is either take meds to conter the arimidex, or..... After 6 years on Arimidex I took myself off it for a drug holiday. I am sleeping better, only one hot flash a day, my mood is better-brighter, my libido is back and my body doesnt feel old. I am taking Curcumin (tumeric) pills three times a day, and flax seed supplements as well as calcium and multivitamins. I feel really good. Is it worth it???",

      "Content": "I am glad to share my BC scenario, drug program and side effects. Diagnosed summer 2001 at 51 YO, chemo/lumpectomy/chemo/radiation. Kept my day job and stayed in grad school :-) Took tamoxifin for 6 months and hated the side effects - intense hot flashes and a crawly skin sensation. I didnt like the research on blood clots either.  I did my own net surfing and found arimidex and asked my onc. to switch my script. I have been on it pretty regularly for 6 years. Side effects for ME: cannot lose the 25 pounds I gained during chemo. I mean I cannot lose even 5 lbs any way I have tried. I have joint swelling in one finger, and intermetent pain in my right hip which comes and goes. The talk on this board about the joint pain is not significant in my case. I had bad knees pre-BC and had a disc removed 12 years ago so my back is a little stiff from that. I do have elevated BP which worries me, and I have to take lysinipril for that unfortunately since I also like to drink wine which raises the BP anyway. What can you do? Give up a glass of wine? :-) I do feel older, more like 58 that I really am...I used to feel younger than my age, and I also do not have energy for lots of exercise which I used to be regluar with. That is a side effect for me, my energy level is lower and I have to pay attention to that more. I have also had my teeth decline in bone strength, and have to be religious with calcium supplements every day. I notice that when I forget to take all my 1200 mg calcium I do develop some random pains. Those who have pain with arimidex, do you take tons of calcium for bone loss?",
