      "Content": "Hi there Janet Just joined on here, spotted your comment!, I am 38, dx was is Jan 07. Mastectomy, total lymph clearance(axillia r/h). Neoadjuvant chemo, turned down having Rad - i decided agaisnt it! ER+/PR+ grade 3 tumour, which was aggressive! 13 months of Herceptin, ovarian ablation. Is it hardly surprising the things we have been throught o find we are exhausted, aching, struggling through daily life!! We are amazing you know!! I find that as soon as your hair grows back, your 'recovered' fro ops etc, everyone thinks you are back to normal!!! Errrr I dont think so! I was peeling spud for family sunday lunch this week and could of cried from the pains in my hands holding the peeler! I cant open bottles/caps etc without pain. I am so tired ALL THE TIME. Weight is a big issue, whilst trying to loose wewight at slimming world, I amfighting with myself thinkingf.... actually i could be dead/or going to die from cancer... what the hell am I doing thinking I can noit treat myself to something I fancy or 'NO, better have cereal rather than the toast and butter that I would really like'. iT IS JUST PLAIN CRAZY. The only person who i feel understands and really takes time to listen are my Mum, and a good friend I have made who has had exaclty the same treatment, and op as me!! She still have ovaries .... !! I think today I just feel angry with life, people and probably myself!!! My 42 yr old sister died last July, from bowel cancer, we would call each other all the time.. and have a laugh about silly things, butr also have a moan and understand what each of us was going through!!! I miss her so much... this has actually just made me cry thinknig about it! She would be telling me off right now, for even thinking of being on a diet!  She was my inspiration, I was dx with my cancer when she had been told hers was terminal, yet she was amazing, so concerned for me!!! Yet she was the one who knew she was going to die!! I am sorry, I feel I have ranted... you only wanted to know if anyone else felt the same....!!!!! This is to me the hardest bit so far!!! the having to appear to be coping ok, getting on with daily life... to be honest I just want to crawl away and hide from the world. Not all together very positive, sorry Rebecca xx",
