Just keep fighting, and know you are not alone, as all these other messages have indicated.    Jo Ellen  ",

      "Content": "I just gave my experience on another message, but my hot flashes were also unbearable.  Same sleep problems, and I wanted to rip my clothes off in public, I was so hot!  I would also just get feeling sick and nauseated.   My oncologist had me try Effexor XR, which helped only a tiny bit.  I then stopped that and tried Megace.  It also helped a little bit.  The doctor then had me take both Effexor and Megace together, and I finally got some relief.  It doesn't completely eradicate the flashes, but they are much less severe and less frequent.  It had made a big difference in my quality of life.    Hope something works for you.  Good luck,  Jo Ellen",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast(negative nodes), followed by dose dense CAT and then radiation for 7 weeks (finished that 7 weeks ago) and am now on Arimidex. A few days ago I noticed a soreness/tenderness on my left chest wall on the same side as radiation. It does not involve the underarm area, but is about 2 inches lower down. I'm hoping it is just a passing side effect of radiation, and not something more serious (like cancer in my ribs now!) Has anyone else experienced lateral chest discomfort like this? thanks.",
