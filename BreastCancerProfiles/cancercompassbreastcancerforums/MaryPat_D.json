    "Content": "I have recently completed treatment for breast cancer that involved a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. I am now on Arimidex for follow up treatment. My question to my doctor is...shouldn't I have a CT Scan to be certain the cancer is truly gone? Since it did spread to my lymph nodes, I cannot help but feel the need to know that it no longer exists in my body. Someone, other than my oncologist, told me I should have a CT scan just to be certain the cancer is gone. I feel the need for closure here, so I too would like a CT scan. However, my oncologist does not feel it is necessary. Has anyone else experienced this situation or have any advice for me in pursuing this matter further? Thanks... Mary Pat",
