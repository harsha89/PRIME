She previously had breast cancer (21 years ago) and I am also a breast cancer survivor of almost 4 yrs. myself. Best wishes, Angela",

      "Content": "Dionne, I would have to say with my experience YES there CAN BE a link between ovarian and breast cancer. Have you been tested for the BRCA1 or 2 gene? How old are you? Does breast and ovarian cancer run in your family? If so, then you could be at a major risk of getting ovarian cancer even after being treated for breast cancer. Here's my story in a nutshell...my mom was a breast cancer survivor for 22 years. After having mastectomy of both breasts in 1981 (she was only age 35), she was diagnosed with stage 3 ovararian cancer last May 2003.(She is still on chemo. as they have not found one that has put her in remission yet.) In between her diagnosis of breast cancer, her mother (my grandmother) died of ovarian cancer at age 73, her sister (my aunt) was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40, my aunt's daughter (my cousin) was diagnosed at age 31, and then I WAS DIAGNOSED with bc in 2000 at age 29. Thank goodness all of us others have survived the BC. However, I was told by my oncologist that because of the strong family history and likelihood of having the BRCA gene, that he recommends me having my ovaries removed by age 40. At the time of diagnosis, I was single and childless, however I am now expecting my first child this September! Needless to say, I will have my ovaries removed within the next few years. Because of my mom's dx, my aunt and cousin BOTH have had their ovaries removed because of their high risk. My BIG regret and problem with the whole situation is that my mom never had her ovaries removed, and now could be dying from this disease, even after surviving breast cancer so long ago. I wish drs. would have recommended her to do so! I hope my info. has helped you. Like I said, if breast and ovarian cancers run in your family (like mine does...worse than the common cold!) then you could be at a major risk of getting ovarian, even after survivng breast cancer. Best of luck.",
