    "Content": "In December I was diagnosed with Breast cancer following a lumpectomy. I happened to feel a lump on the lateral side of my breast  one day after getting an itch. I hadn't noticed the lump before and it was rather large. The only symptoms I have had for a while prior to finding the lump was a \"burning sensation\" in my breast along with pressure. Occasionally I would get a sharp shooting pain but this was not consistant like the burning and some generalized soreness on the medial side of the breast. I passed it off as Indigestion or anxiety but am wondering if this is a part of the symptoms of cancer. This burning continues even after the lumpectomy. Does anyone have anything like that associated with their cancers? Thanks for your input.",
