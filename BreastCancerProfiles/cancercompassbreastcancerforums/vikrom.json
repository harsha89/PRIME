Dear GLCAC7485, I just want to add on to those who recommended fruit and veggie extract. They work wonders. A year and a half ago ( at the age of 75 ) I was diagnosed with stage 3 CA prostate cancer that spread to my lungs and bones. I had orchidectomy which helped to blunt the spread. I turned vegan on the day of the diagnosis. After surgery I had to take flutamide for 6 months before the second specialist told me to stop.  During all those days until this very day I have been taking multi-fruit (those high in antioxidants) smoothie on an empty stomach for the morning, and multi-veg extract (purple cabbage, beet root, carrot, celery and Ya-nang leaves ( Tiliacora Triandra Diels ) ) for the afternoon everyday. Yes everyday unless something holds me back in the city. Becoming a vegetarian is another blow for the devil. I keep only fish and eggs for flavour. I was also recommended by an Indian ayurvedic doctor through an Indian friend to take turmeric powder ( half measuring teaspoon ) along with black pepper ( same amount ) after breakfast and dinner. I should see no harm thrice a day. I'm not expecting any side effects because these are part of our food ingredients which we eat daily. they are not chemicals which doctors prescribe. My PSA before surgery shot up to 137 and plunged to 55 a week after surgery. Six months later it came down to 0.007 before moving up 0.013 without the pills. I see the doctor every 6 months now and the next visit is day after tomorrow. I don't know if you're on meat diet which is none of my business. Butsince you ask for advice I'd say ditch it. The more one reserches the more one sees poisons in those foods. I used to love lamb, beef, pork, cheese, milk and ice cream. Now they are history. I take soy milk and all plant protein instead. I go to the gym and do progressive weight training thrice a week; walk 2 kms. everday with my dog to improve health. I hope the above helps. Take the fight to the devil and never relent and I'll bet you'll see results. Vikrom/ Bangkok-Thailand",
