    "Content": "Please stop crying. We have to stay positive in our situation. I hope my experience can help you. The scan does not show if it\u2019s cancer or not. It shows enlarged lymph nodes, point. You need to have some kind of biopsy to check them out. I was in similar situation last year (May 08 to be exact). I had chest CT that showed 6 or 7 enlarged nodes (one was almost 7sm), my oncologist said that my BC is coming back, but he was really smart to send me to see chest surgeon, lung doctor, and gastroenterologist before any treatment assigned to discuss biopsy options. They had to decide how to reach one of the enlarged nodes. All three doctors said that they can reach at least one node, but gastroscopy was easier comparing to chest surgery for example. The gastroscopy biopsy showed that it was not cancer. It was sarcoidosis, Sarcoidosis is not a gift too, but everything is better than cancer. So I did not get any additional treatment, visited lung doctor every 2month, had chest XR before I visited him. Nodes were becoming smaller and smaller. After several visits the doctor said that I don\u2019t need to see him anymore. My personal opinion (my oncologist disagrees, but he does not have other answer why) that enlarging of the lymph nodes was my body reaction on chemotherapy. Another oncologist who I saw for a second opinion said that he had a similar case before:  cancer in connection with sarcoidosis. BTW, I have never had any lung problem before. Good luck. Stay positive and enjoy every day of your life. Please let me know what your doctor says. Elena  ",
