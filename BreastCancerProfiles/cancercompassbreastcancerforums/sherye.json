    "Content": "I was 65 when I was told I had BC (stage1).  I had 9weeks of radiation and was put on Arimidex for 5 years.  There were many times during those 5 years I begged my daughter to agree I should stop Armidex.  She continusly encuraged me to continue taken the drug.  I had horrible night sweats, bone & joint pain, thinning hair, extremly dry skin, splitting nails.  I gained almost 50lbs.  I have been off Arimidex for 6years.  I am now 76, cancer free, & misserable.  They are now testing my thyroid.  I am so tired of being tired & fat.  Something has to give.  So is it the Arimidex. the thyroid or just being 76.",
