    "Content": "\"and i dont know whats wrong.\" Hi Sweetie - Those of us with a little more, shall we say \"maturity\" know exactly what is \"wrong\".  You are normal!! For Heaven's sake.  You've postponed schooling, taken a job to get you by, (applause), caring for a sick person, the sick person being your Mother, tending to her as best you can, of course you are tired and stressed.  Your body is giving you the message to take care of your own self the best you can.  I can't say exactly what that is, but you must decide or discover it.  I take a warm bath each night with either Lavender or Vanilla oil drops.  You might like a brisk morning shower each day.  If I read ANYTHING I get sleepy.  You might try reading to send yourself off to sleep when you have the opportunity. In time, all this will be a memory.  So, make it a good memory, as best you can.  Do all your tasks with love.  Clean as best you can.  (You never know who observes this.  This guy had a business.  This guy watched the garbage (young) man each week.  The garbage man petted the Guy's dog each week over the fence.  Talked to the dog, rubbed his ears.  At some point, the Guy had a position, offered it to the garbage man, and it changed his life.  Just for being a good garbage collector, and being nice to a dog). I don't like all the tasks I have to do either right now, but I have a bigger goal.  That goal is to have No Regrets when it's all over.  Make that a goal for yourself too.  Good luck to you, and come to this board when you need to vent.
