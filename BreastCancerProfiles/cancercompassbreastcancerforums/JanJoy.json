I still have 2 treatments left to do following by 5 weeks for radiation every day.  I was stage 1 with a 1.5 cc tumor no lymph node involvement but still needed chemo.  I was really hoping to get out of it. It will reduce my chances of the cancer returning by 10%.  My score on the oncotype test for reaccurance was 20%...that's just too high and I didn't want to take the risk of not having chemo.  I  do not want this cancer to return so I am doing everything in my power to prevent that.  I hope everything is going well with you. Please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing. I'm sure by now you have learned about chemo, hair loss and everything else the doctor may have explained to you. Keep in touch.   Tina Hi Tina, Would you mind sharing your age at diagnosis?  Were you PR + or -?  I'm waiting for my onco dx report.  My tumor sounds similar to yours.  It was 1.4 IDC (1cm was IDC, .4 was DCIS), ER+ PR- Neg nodes.  I'm 59. Mitosis rate of 5.  I, too, am hoping to not need chemo of course but wondering how I will make the decision if the report comes back in the intermediate area.  Did your oncologist go over the report in detail with you or did he/she say the only important part was the score?  I'm wondering what else we learn from the body of the report, not just the overall score, in helping us make an informed decision. Since your chemo was about a year ago, can you give us an update on how well you tolerated it and how you're doing now? Thanks so much for sharing your experience! Jan",

Jan Update:  My Oncotype dx score came back as 32!  Amazing since the pathology reports looked like I'd not need chemo.  Because of the high score, my oncologist wants to start \"aggressive chemo\" TAC as soon as I've completely healed from the surgery.  (Likely right after Thanksgiving).  Has anyone gone through 6 sessions of TAC every 3 weeks?  Would you share how you tolerated it?",
