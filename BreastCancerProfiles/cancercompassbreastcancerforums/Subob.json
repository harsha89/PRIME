    "Content": "Hi BJ, We don't know much about breast cancer but do know about brain mets.  My husband (56) has been fighting renal cell kidney cancer since 2001.  On 9/11/07 he was diagnosed with 2 inoperable RCC brain mets.  He was told he had 3 weeks to live unless he did whole brain radiation.  We were in total fear, prayed and then God led us to a new technology, CYBERKNIFE. (see http://www.rt-image.com/1009Sync for recent news and links)  It was so easy.  Outpatient hour and 1/2 later walked out with no significant side effects.  We are so glad we found this center only 20 mins from our home in TX.  They have centers in most states and also internationally.  We are spreading the word. We hope that your sister never has to deal with brain mets, but just in case she does, you will have something promising to check out. In God's Hands - Susan B",
