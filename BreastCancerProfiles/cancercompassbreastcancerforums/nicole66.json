I was dx w/breast cancer and went through 8 rounds of chemo. 4 adramyacin/cytoxin and 4 taxotere. The adramyacin did zap my counts and I had to get nupagen injections along with procrit injections to keep up my strenth and get through it. My lymph nodes were also involved. It is like an extra step in making sure that if one of those tiny little cancer cells spread it will get it and destroy it. It is tough no doubt about it, but you can and will get through it. It's been 4 years since your chemo.  How are you doing now?  I'm about ready to do exactly what your treatments were and I'm concerned.  I had 1 lymph node that was positive.  What do you think?",
