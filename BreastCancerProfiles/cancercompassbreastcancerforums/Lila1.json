    "Content": "Hello! Jip....also my first time to this site/blog.   So sorry to hear about your mom!!!!! A dear friend of mine is also suffering from cancer at the moment.....and it's also a first \"very close to home\"-experience for me!!!!!  It still feels VERY unreal!!!  Even though she's been suffering from cancer since 2007.  She had a couple of chemo sessions, and in fact was in remission by last year March....but since Sept 2012 it's all back....and spreading.....And yes....the prognosis is NOT good at this stage!  In fact....she's dying slowly....BUT SHE IS SUCH A BRAVE WOMAN!!!!! Currently she is using those pain patches at the moment and is complaining about a (VERY) dry mouth!  Now I'm battling to get those lemon mouth swabs for her....unfortunately no luck as yet (here in SA)....but I'll phone a couple of pharmacies tomorrow and she if we can get hold of some! In any case....good luck to you (and your father).  And yes, sometimes one does just need to \"vent\" somewhere!!!!!   Kind regards, Lila",
