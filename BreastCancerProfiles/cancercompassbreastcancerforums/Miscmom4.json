Try it. I hope it makes a difference for you. Bette",

      "Content": "Brit it seems these shoes are worn by many families.  My diagnosis was about 1 year ago.  I live in Canada so our Cancer treatment might be a bit different due to our health care systems.  However today I was getting treatment and was reading a book exactly about this.  If you can for your mom and your family set up a TEAM approach.  Maybe you can be 'THE COACH'. Get together with family, friends, collegues from work, church etc. and see who would be willing to help with whatever they can.  Some suggestions are cooking, laundry, cutting the grass, cleaning the house, getting kids lunches made, take them to games or whatever. Tell your mom to take notes or maybe she can get her visits taped so she can replay the information given to her.  Most Cancer Care office offer social workers of some kind as well, for the patient and the family.  See what her state offers for support. It's an endless road at the beginning it seems, but slowly the terminology and routine will be understood and life will be a different 'normal' for all of you. Please keep us posted and if you have any questions let them fly there is a lot of information you can gain from sites like this. Bette Winnipeg, Canada",

I pray that God with grant your family strength, safety and health during this journey.
