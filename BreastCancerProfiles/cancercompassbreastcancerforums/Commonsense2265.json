      "Content": " Ann Just before Christmas same scenario for my best friend.  The doc wanted to wait till NY but we got her another appointment.  Her lump turned out to be scar tissue and some inflamation.  She did take a natural supplement while waiting and it reduced the lump 50% and took out most of the inflamation.  Lump is now gone, no inflamation and she has been declared cancer free.  Her breast surgery was 12 years ago..So it is harrowing but could turn out to be nothing.  I hope it is so..Elaine On 3/5/2007 Having Faith wrote: Thanks Wendy, I wrote back to you, but not sure if it was sent. Long story short, Thank you for your support. I will be back on here. I need to talk to other women who are going through the same thing or have already been there. Faith and prayers to all.  Ann  ",
