      "Content": "Thank you all for sharing. I'm currently considering a mastectomy of my unaffected breast. ..Mostly for \"equalizing the sides\". reconstruction isn't an option I chose and never would...but my remaining breast is a large one (42D) and unless i wear a bra with weighted prosthesis, my clothes tend to torque sideways to the remaining breast.. Sister Marie-Angele would definitely be appalled at my fiddling with frequently rearranging my clothes if I was still a schoolgirl! Joking aside, I'm also getting mid-back pain that I never had before and my GP ascribes this to the imbalance and my own body trying to twist to compensate when I don't wear a prosthesis & bra. More reasons to consider my decision: I just spent a few weeks in Mexico, as I do every fall or winter..my first since the mastectomy..and wearing a weighted prosthesis bra was pretty sweaty and uncomfortable every day. My prosthesis almost floated away in the pool one day..thank god I was alone..what a hoot that would have been! My tumour is high risk for recurrence, my family history is really remarkable...all the women for 3 generations on both sides of my family have had breast cancer..yes!, all of them ..I'm the latest ( interestingly though, no one has BRCA markers). I'm not trying to talk myself in or out of this decision....just want to hear from women who are okay or not okay with their decision to go Bilateral even without specific oncology advice.  ",

      "Content": "Thank god for this site! I literally live in the bush  ( yay, satellite technology) in northern Canada. I`m a year into my breast cancer `journey`(..hah! what a `Trip`)...all done the first bits ( surgery, intravenous chemo). Now have recently switched from Arimidex to Aromasin....all joint and muscle pain is the same, but complete relief of carpal tunnel syndrome. The joint pain, especially the ankles and wrists, is really grim some days...as is the muscle & joint stiffness..I call them my Plank Days....I have the flexibility of a wooden board. The hand claw thing is awful..in the morning I can`t hardly wrap my hands around a coffee cup...I mean my `heat therapy mug`..it does help..as does using a wax bath for the morning hand & finger stiffness. These are the wax bath thingys you buy for soft hands, manicures, about $80-100 dollars and worth every cent honestly. My physio has given this suggestion to others with the same problem and thanked me for a relatively cheap and drug free way to get the pain and stiffness under control. Another good heat treatment is those bags filled with grain that you microwave..I think the brand is Magic Bag..but it`s easy to make with a rectangle of cotton fabric, folded in half and loosely fill with rice, split peas or cracked wheat..(no popcorn!!) and sew your own for about $2.00 in total. Microwave on high for 2-3 mins...fast cheap drug free relief of aches & stiffness. I change the shape for different  body sites...my neck pain one looks like a long rectangular sausage, my wrist ones are just mens hankies folded in half and sewn up. My knee one resembles a  2 pound bag of rice. I Hate taking pain meds, but sometimes it`s my new reality. Unrelieved pain increases the inflammatory response, the circle then feeds itself...so don`t hesitate to use whatever pain control you require. This is not being a crybaby, this is managing a new reality. The damned side effects of the AIs are the price we choose to pay for our hope of survival....so if you hesitate because of some false sense of having to be  a tough survivor type , just drop this illusion...no one in their right mind will choose a life of pain and suffering if there is another option that lets a person just get on with it. This is about surviving cancer, and living the best life we can... Hmmm....this is a Plank Day and my response sounds as cranky as I feel...I think I`ll sign off for now and go put a heatbag in the microwave...",

      "Content": "That was my experience with Arimidex too ( the ugly, ugly, painful hand stuff)....it wasn't as bad when I tried Aromasin..and even with that, it improved a little more after I had been on it 4 months..don't drop out until you've tried everything for 6 months each... I too have big losses due to my hands..I'm a nurse practitioner, dual practice in women's health and palliative care..and it's excruciating to use a blood pressure cuff, manipulating the cuff, dials etc., I can't draw blood or do a pelvic exam..due to pain & spasm, my hands won't let me predictably use the tools and instruments I need to. I can offer my palliative patients my Self, but I can't manipulate the tools I need to give relief of their pain, or the strength to turn them and rub their aching bodies..this disease is stealing my beloved career away from me... Some days I'm very, very sad at these losses....",

I have put off test even had an appointment for mammogram and backed out. I'm not brave enough to look up symptoms cause to be honest, I don't want to know if something is wrong with me til later when things calm down. I don't think I could deal with me being sick with everything that is already going on. Not to mention my husband and kids dealing with it. OK my question, I have under my right breast a bump not deep more like a clogged pore that holds infection all the time.  I have had it for well over a year and for a long time now. I see the bump and I will squeeze it like a pimple. It don't look bad no mark or nothing. What comes out is thick white but the smell is what gets me it is the awfullest smell ever. DO you think it is just because it is a old infection? I don't know if it is anything to worry about or not. I don't even think about it much til I see it full again. Sorry if i grossed you out. But don't know how else to explain it. Any one think I should investigate it more? Or nothing to worry about? Go get it checked out..Now...the stress isn't worth it...But, assuming it's nothing..wouldn't the relief of that stress be wonderful?..Just Do It.",
