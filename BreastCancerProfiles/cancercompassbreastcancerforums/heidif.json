      "Content": "thanks for the reply! i was pregnant when originally diagnosed, had chemo with baby. after that, surgery, radition, etc.  (baby is now fine, healthy and 9 years old!)i had a complete hyst/oopharectomy as well, and wow those side effects are tricky!  im estrogen postive, too, and on femarar. new tumor in 2011 led to complete mastectomy and reconstruction.  i speak quite a bit around the country about my experience, and basically to encourage young families with this struggle.  its the whole family that goes on this journey, don't you think?  we've relocted up to canada now, and i'm hoping the medical costs will be vastly different up here.  the financial burden is almost as heavy as the side effects from the meds, i find.  im at @followheidi on twitter and follow heidi on facebook, if you'd like to chat more.  :)",
