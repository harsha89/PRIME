Am I tempting fate. I was lucky first time, the lumpectomy seemed to have gotten it all and I had radiation and no chemo (it had not gotten into my Lymph nodes) but because I was estrogen positve I was told I needed to be on something for 5 years!!!...I feel worse now that before the surgery....any thoughts out there???

Or is it permanent damage?  I know it is better than a reacurrence (my cancer was 99% estrogen receptive) but I am a 43 year old who feels like she is 60! Waiting to hear from someone! Thanks, maggie  My son who is a doctor asked me to check with the doctor to see what the percentage of improvement of my long term health was if I stopped the Aromasin.  Taking Tamoxifin first and then Aromasin later would improve my chances of surviving 5 years by 15 percent.  The Tamoxifin made me miserable and I gained a lot of weight so he switched me to Aromasin earlier than usual.  The Aromasin really made my joints hurt, or so I thought.  My doctor said that I could go off it for a month and see what the results were.  Because I had been on the first medication as long as I was, I had reduced my chances to 8 percent and then with the time on Aromasin, it had been reduced to 4 percent.  That 4 percent balanced against the pain seemed like a reasonable choice.  Now I am going on vacation for a month to a very dry climate and I want to see if that will ease the pain in my joints.  If so, I think I will just go back on the Aromasin and put up with it.  I'll do something else to attach the arthritis.  Hope this helps.  Know what you mean about the belly fat!",
