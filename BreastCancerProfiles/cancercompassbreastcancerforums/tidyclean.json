    "Content": "Hi Bobbi, Just wondering where your having radiation for your cancer.  My brother also had radiation on his brain and also the pelvic area for prostate cancer.  He was having headaches and found out the cancer had spread to the brain.  He's been dizzy ever since the tumor was found on his brain.  Don't mean to scare you any but are you having any headaches at all ??",
