      "Content": "Went to a podiatrist last week due to foot pain and found out I have a heel spur related to plantar fasciitis.  So, will be riding my bike in lieu of the walks I had hoped to take.  How dumb I was to think the surgery, chemo and radiation would end all of this.  The aromosin is a long term aide to deal with now.",

      "Content": "I think there are more than the 3 to 4% of women who have side effects. I picked up a flyer on Aromosin and they didn't mention alot of the bad side effects I am now experiencing.  Was healthy until I got breast cancer.  Am 59 and feel so old.  My right hip is so sore, head ache all the time, my right foot is so sore (it feels like it is in the bone but also the tendons) and of course the hot flashes and joint pains.  I was on Femara and switched to Aromosin, in the end those little bitty pills are really taking a toll on our bodies, aren't they.",
