      "Content": "Hi, I had this done & I don't think it was that bad. The dye is usually injected the day before surgery and the wire the day of. The dye injection was like a bee sting to me. I am sure it all depends on the radiologist who does it to. I had a good one. The guide wire was not bad, leaving your breast in the mammo is true too, but you have probably had several mammos by now! I hope all goes well. I am sure you will do fine. Go in there with a positive attititude that it won't be bad. Maybe that will help. Stay in touch. i am new to this board, so I will be looking on here and i am sure i will be asking many questions also!",

      "Content": "Hi, I start chemo next week for breeast cancer. My Oncologist told me I would lose my hair. Then I went to the ACS and got a wig there. The girl said your hair starts falling out about 2 weeks after the first treatment. well, I keep hearing from a few people that THEIR hair never fell out with chemo and mine probably will not. I thought maybe it is the chemo drugs directed towards breast cancer that makes your hair fall out. honestly, I thought everyone's fell out! I am going to be on: 5-FU,Epirubicin and Cytoxan. Anyone out there who has had these grugs and could shed some lite on this? I feel much more at ease just knowing what to expect. Thanks so much!",

      "Content": "Teresa, thanks so much for the info. I am not really all freaked out like most would think either. My family is suprised. I have lived with Lupus for the last 5 years. With that I have bad joint , muscle, neck pain and a lot of other stuff thrown in there......esp. fatigue. I feel like I can handle this. The hair thing i just want to know about. My hair is already short, so when it starts falling out......I will buzz it! I did get a wig from the ACS. I am afraid to go buy wraps & hats now since I keep hearing people say it won't fall out. I did buy silk pillowcases. i heard that helps with the tenderness. How long after your first tx. did it take for your hair to fall out? One person told me 2 weeks. Whitchdoctor, thanks for your advice, but with Lupus, scleroderma & Sjogrens I cant use ice. Thanks!",
