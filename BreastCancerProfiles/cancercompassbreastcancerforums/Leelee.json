      "Content": "Dear Hadia: I'm so sorry I haven't written back. I just read your message today and it is March 5, 2006. I enjoyed your letter. I'm so sorry you feel so awful taking Femara. I know exactly how you feel. It isn't fun. I'm trying to wash clothes right now and running up and down stairs to my basement. My legs feel the worst when I go up and down stairs. My oncologist told me at my last visit he would see me in a year. That was good news. My mammogram was also OK which doesn't mean much to me since my one 6 years ago did too. I'm going to go on two cruises this year and I've been going gambling with my sister quite a bit which keeps my mind occupied. I've also worked some lately which makes me feel better. I also have two children, a daughter 29 and a son 27. My daughter lives at home with me and my husband and my son lives in San Diego. He just got his masters in Business and they both got degrees at UCSB. You made me laugh when you talked about dating and the lack of estrogen. Isn't that the truth about no estrogen. I hope you will write back and let me know how you are doing. If you or anyone has any questions please feel to write me. You are in my prayers. Love Leila",

      "Content": "Hi: I got breast cancer in October, 1999. I had a breast exam a month or so before and a mammogram which showed everything was fine a month before. I found a lump the size of a rock in my left breast and went to see my breast doctor the next day. I had a lumpectomy and a week later found out it had spread to 8 of my lymph nodes out of 19. They were hormone related since I was on HRT pills for 10 years. I had chemo, radiation and knock on wood I'm still alive and kicking. I was put on tamoxifen for 4 and a half years and now I'm on Femara. I have been on it for a year or so. I'm 65 and was in a tap dance group up till a few years ago. I think my tapping days are over. My legs hurt so bad everynight and when I stand to long or walk up stairs they feel awful. I also have TMJ which is a jaw problem. I just thought I had arthritis but the more I read about femara I know it is from this drug. I just wonder if these pains are going to get worse. I take vicodin, one or two when needed everyday and that seems to help. I walk like a real old lady. My husband and I have been traveling quite a bit and I stay real busy so I'm happy how that I'm retired. My hair came in awful after the chemo and I've been wearing wigs for almost 6 years. That bothers me the most. I used to have long, curly hair and it came back in looking thin and horrible. Is anyone else having this problem? I lost some weight when I went off the tamoxifen and I don't have to wear panty liners anymore. Two positive things! As long as we are all alive and enjoying life what more can we ask for. I do alot with my church and that really makes me feel good and close to God. I'd like to hear how other people are doing. Bless all of you. Love Leila",
