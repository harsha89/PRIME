    "Content": "I too, have this very strong chemical type smell. Read that ezcema also has a smell, and I do have a bad case of that on my hand. I also have these clear fluid filled bumps all over my face every day that go away just by scratching them off. Â There's also something similar to those bumps, but very hard in my eyelids. I know some of these symptoms go along with cancer but I wont go be diagnosed. Does anyone relate to these symptoms?",
