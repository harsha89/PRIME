    "Content": "Hi Amy My wife Sylvia has a recurring brain tumour. Her tumour was a met from a colon cancer, it was found in March (do not when it started growing) and for which she received a craniotomy with WBRT, That was back in March, then last month it recurred. Doctors where not sure if it was radiation necrosis or a tumour or both. It was described as a cystic met. Recent scans show it to have grown to over 3cm and likely to be a recurring tumour. Now too big for radio surgery so a second craniotomy will be performed on 30th July followed by a boost radiation to the tumour bed. We had hoped that the first operation would have gotton rid of it completely, sadly it has returned and has left us in terrible fear. Sylvia has had mini seizures due to where it is and is now on medication. We are hopefull that it dosn't give any more symtoms but we have to take each day in turn. We hope you are able to get a treatment plan and that your treatment is successful. We pray for you all and trust the Lord to bring a healing hand. Message back if you want to share information. Kindest regards  Keith & Sylvia",
