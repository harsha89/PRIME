I'd like to get her an extra special get-well gift. I was thinking of something that will help her through this time but I don't want it to be strictly about the cancer...I'm sure she thinks of it enough. Any ideas?  Steph Hi Steph,  Your just being with her is a gift in itself.  She's lucky to have you so close by.  When I was first diagnosed (lung cancer), I started a collection of angels.  I have big ones, little ones, ones that light up, magnet ones..... and every one is special.  My family and friends have given me many different ones over the last 15 months along with many of their prayers.  Maybe your Mom would like an angel \"for her shoulder\".  I wish you well and please keep us posted.  God Bless you both. ",
