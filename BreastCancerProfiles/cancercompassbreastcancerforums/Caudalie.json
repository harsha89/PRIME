    "Content": "My friend has been diagnosed with BC and will undergo a lumpectomy. Is this the correct forum to inquire about anyone's experience with a particular dr.?  If not, please recommend a board/chat where this can be done. We have already looked into the state health dept. and medical board sites .  We are looking to learn about patient's personal experiences with a particular surgeon. ",
