I can tell you that I have known four people including myself whose hair did return very similar to their hair pre treatment.  However, in my case the hair that began growing was wiry, grey and patchy when it first came in.  It did not grow uniformly on my head.  The front was more wiry than other areas.  I did go have it cut after 3 months of slow growth and that seemed to help start the process of new hair.  It did take almost a year for my hair to look good again,.  One other thing that happened is that I developed three centers where my hair grew in.  three cowlicks at the back of my head!  one area in the back came back curly,.  the rest of my hair is straight but a little thicker,  I did wear my wig until about 7 months post treatment.  Then it was summer and I just wore my hair very short.  I have always had short hair cuts so it wasn't a big deal for me.  One other item of note.  When I started treatment I made the decision to have my head shaved when the first clump of hair fell out.  I just couldn't handle dealing with that every day.  It may have helped  or not, but it made me feel like I was in control.  I think it took so long because I did have radiation after chemo.  Here's a hug (  )  and a prayer that all goes well for you.",
