    "Content": "I would like to invite anyone, that is needing spiritual support, to please visit our Prayer board, we have many survivors, and some, like me, that have cancer, it is a wonderful site to get the the support you need, one on one, we will pray with you, or if you just feel like venting, we listen, I don't think I could have made it the past 3 years without these folks, we are from all over the US, and they have helped me so much! I encourage anyone, that needs prayer, to please come visit us! The address is www.allin1accord.com, you will meet some very loving and understanding prayer warrors there, I pray they will find a cure one day for all of us! God bless you all, as you walk this road, Love in Him, Pat",
