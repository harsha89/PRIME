    "Content": "Last July, I had a wire guided excisional biopsy surgery of my left breast after mammograms, ultrasounds and a core needle biopsy revealed a 3.9cm mass containing a radial scar and a large amount of calcification. After the lab biopsied the entire mass removed from surgery, ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia) was found. We set up a 6 month post op MRI appointment to see where I'm at. The reason for the MRI and not a mammogram for my 6 month check up is my age-I'm currently 25 years old, and my surgeon does not want to expose to me to any more radiation than I already have been. Upon getting the results of my MRI, I am told there is a 1cm mass showing on the left breast again. I have an appointment this Friday for an ultrasound and mammogram to cross reference the images, which will lead to another core needle biopsy. Has anyone had experience with ADH removal, and then another mass coming back less than a year later? Could it be that they didn't get everything the first time and these are residual cells from the original mass that was found? What does it mean if it's a new mass that has already formed within months of surgery? I appreciate anyone's feedback or experience with this topic, the waiting game feels like the worst part of all of this.",
