      "Content": "Thank you very much for your replies.  My biopsy is tomorrow & of course, I am nervous.  I'm very anxious for the results.  I am glad the radiologist is moving my testing along swiftly.  I believe even if the cells are found to be benign, I'll still be wondering what's forming in my breast.  I expect more frequent mammos will be required at the very least.  It feels like deja vu with my ovarian cancer where I went through many problems for years before the cancer really showed up. I have had health problems throughout most of my life.  I had seizures & psoriasis as a child.  Out grew that when puberty hit, very late puberty by the way, & then all my reproductive system problems began.  I had irregular periods, had to have a D&C for hemorrhaging, had to have my fallopian tubes removed due to a rare infection of an unknown source, I had a polycystic ovary, etc., etc.  I dreaded going to the gyno as to what would be found next.  I also tried invitro fertilization when it was very new & it failed.  Finally, I had an enlarged uterus & upon surgery the encapsulated granulosa cell tumor was found on my ovary.  What was left of my reproductive system was removed as this was the most likely place for the cancer to return.  That type of ovarian cancer is rare & I was told it was unlikely to return in my case.  No chemo or radiation required.  However, when it does return the recurrence often is years or decades later.  The lung is the most likely place, not the breast.  Yet, there is a slight increase in breast cancer after having this type tumor. I have been well for 20 years now.  I believed removing my faulty repro system was the answer.  I was well over the worrying about it.  I have been taking estrogen (only) all that time to ward off osteoporosis.  That was the standard until just the last few years -- too late for me to reconsider that option.  I do believe the estrogen was a benefit to me in some ways, but now wonder if my breast changes are not a result of that.  Possibly. My mom took anti-miscarriage drugs when pregnant with me.  She took them for 3 out of 4 children.  Thank goodness she did or we most likely wouldn't be here at all.  She had many miscarriages prior.  My sister has had a few repro problems too.  Only my oldest bro, her first child, was not exposed to these drugs.  This could have led to my health problems.  Again, possibly. That oldest bro (no drugs during Mom's pregnancy) had 4 children with his first wife & 2 had cancer under age 5.  Their cancers of the sphincter muscle were identical.  He had 2 children with his second wife & 1 child had a brain tumor under age 5.  My bro really went through the wringer.  Ironically, he is a doctor so that helped his knowledge base.  All those kids underwent chemo & radiation.  SO THANKFULLY, all those children survived & are now in their 20's.  Only one has lingering health problems due to the radiation aimed at his head.  He's had the roughest time out of all of us.  So yes, I do believe something genetically has gone wrong.  None of us have had genetic testing for insurance reasons.  If you test positive for mutations, it can be considered a pre-existing condition & future cancer conditions may not be covered.  My bro the doc suspects mutations in the p-53 gene, but we prefer not to risk the testing. Odd, I had the very first cancer in my family history followed by my bro's kids.  Just recently, my aunt had invasive breast cancer & died at age 77.  Her younger sister had a lumpectomy, but it was benign.  Mom, Dad, grandparents never had cancer.  Mom died at age 80 from other causes.  Dad is 86 & extremely healthy.  His mom lived into her 90's.  So, who knows what's really going on here?  I drive myself crazy thinking about it sometimes, but in the end just chalk it up to fate.  I can't change it no matter what the cause. One more thought, once cancer is found, I am a believer of surgery to completely remove the organs that can be invaded by cancer if at all possible.  If cancer is found in one of my breasts, I very possibly will have both breasts removed if insurance will allow.  My breasts are not necessary for living & why take a chance for future invasion in the most likely place.  Any thoughts on this?  I hope to avoid chemo & radiation if at all possible. Sending good vibes to all you cancer survivors & care takers.  May we all find success with our treatments & continued research.  My sister participates in the 3 Day Walk for a Cure.",

Thanks to all that replied & gave me info & support.  May all that visit this forum find the support they need as well.  I'll be praying for all of you & your health.",

      "Content": "I've always had yearly mammogram results that were normal, nothing suspicious.  Microcalcifications in a cluster were found on my most recent mammogram.  I was called back in a few days later for a diagnostic mammogram.  The radiologist met with me , discussed the mammos & set me up for a stereotactic core needle biopsy scheduled a couple days from now.  The radiologist said that his findings thus far indicate a 30% chance of breast cancer.  My questions are, if this is not an indication of breast cancer, then what else could it be?  The radiologist hasn't taken a wait & see in 6 months approach, but has jumped straight to the biopsy.  Moving so fast has me frightened.  Does this pace seem usual?  I am a 20 year ovarian cancer survivor.",

      "Content": "Well, I spoke too soon.  The day after I wrote about my benign preliminary biopsy report, my final report came back the with precancerous ADH.  Yes, it's benign for now, but treatment will be needed to ward off invasive cancer.  The pathology report starts off with \"This is an interesting case ...\" -- not what I wanted to read.  I'm scheduled for a sectional biopsy in a week for a golf ball sized tissue sample.  Went to the gyno, went to the surgeon & a swollen lymph node was found too.  Now I'm scheduled for an MRI before the biopsy for a better look at the node & the breast.  Hopefully, the lymph node is inflammed from my first biopsy.  Hopefully the second biopsy will show nothing more than ADH.  If the next pathology report comes back with only ADH, I'll probably be put on the medication Evista & can forego radiation.  I'm thankful there is a new alternative.  If the path report shows something worse, well, ...!  I'll see a gyno/oncologist when I get the results.  This sure is a roller coaster ride!  I've learned a lot online, but reading about personal experiences here has also helped me.  Thanks!",

      "Content": "I had a good friend die of skin cancer in his 40's.  He used to go to the tanning beds all the time.  My mom had all kinds of skin problems due to playing too much golf without the proper protection.  After watching the skin treatments she had to endure -- long, painful & very unattractive, I've protected myself in the sun.   I saw a tv special with Dr. Oz (he's a regular on Oprah).  He said tanning is not the problem, but burning is.  The problem is that it's hard to know when it's too much or not.  He also mentioned that tanning beds are like concentrated sunshine & our skins are not accustomed to that.  Instant tan in a bottle can be a good alternative.  I personally don't mind being lily white, but I have found the combo of a little instant tan & a little outdoor sunshine tan can look very natural.  I wear sunscreen mostly.",

      "Content": "My mom was kinda the same way.  She wouldn't give me all the facts of her medical condition over the phone.  Very stubborn woman.  I also lived far away from her.  One day I just showed up with no warning on her door step & told her I was going to her doctor's appointment with her.  To my surprise she didn't balk & was glad to see me.  My father was relieved.  Along with the doctor, we were able to get her to go to the hospital for treatment & tests, something she had been refusing to do.  Eventually, she did pass on, but she got better for awhile & the treatment helped her not to suffer as much.  We had plenty of bad days with her bad attitude, but they were worth it.  I have the satisfaction of knowing that I did everything within my power to help her. Your mom may not respond the same way, but knowing you tried, spending time with her even if she has a bad attitude, comforting your father is worth considering.  Whatever you decide, I hope you can find peace during this difficult time.",
