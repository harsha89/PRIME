    "Content": "Five years ago I had a lumpectomy and thank god since then I have been cancer free.  My breast have become somewhat softer than immediately after the treatments, but will it ever be the same or is this one of the downsides.  My breast and underarm is very hard and quite uncomfortable at times, I have pains at times and I also get cramps if I stretch my arm or turn around etc.  I guess my question is, is this normal or should I go see my doctor?  If anyone else has this problem will you please let me know.  Thanks",
