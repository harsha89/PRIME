    "Content": "Hi My Mom has breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy and radiation almost five years ago. Since then she has also been diagnosed with skin melanoma and had two removed from her face inthe last year. She is currently doing well and not on any meds for the cancer. She tried tamoxifin but had to have a hysterectomy due to strange cells, but not cancer. She also tried Arimidix but had hot flashes and joint pain and stopped. Last week she noticed her breast was bleeding, at the base of the nipple. Not out of the nipple. At 1st she freaked, then thought she just scratched it with the nylon bath thing. She says it is OK now and no longer bleeding. Is this something we should be concerned about? She is seeing her regular dr. today and promices to mention it. I am far away from her and want to be sure she has this checked out by her oncologist if necessary. Thanks, Charlene",
