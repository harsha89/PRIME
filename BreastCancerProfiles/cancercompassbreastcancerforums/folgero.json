      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy after finding I had breast cancer in my RT breast and in 3 lymph nodes. I under went a double mastectomy on 9/24/10, and had started breast reconstruction with the expanders. After a year I finally had the implants put in, and then came the nipple reconstruction. Now the Rt nipple turned black, they said sometimes because of the radiation the nipple won't take. I had to have it removed, now faced with only having one nipple and dr says can't redo the RT side. I want to seek 2nd opinion to see what my option's are has I'm told this happens alot. Has anyone had this happen and if so did you do a 2nd surgery or what follow up did you do??",

      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy on 9/24/10, I had chose to have reconstruction with tissue expansion and Breast implants down the road. I just never relized how painful these tissue expansions are, you just feel like you almost can't breath sometimes because they hurt so much. Does anyone who has had the expansions have any sugestions that would make this process less painful. I didn't know if there was something I could buy for support ( because now back hurts so bad) or creams to helps lessen pain around the breast under the skin. I would love to be able just to be comfortable or sleep for the next year !!",
