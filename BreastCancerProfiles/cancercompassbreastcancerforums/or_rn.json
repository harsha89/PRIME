I have rib and spine pain every day. It is a constant aching like you described. I had a neg bone scan in Dec and neg labs in March. My oncologist says this is due to the Tamoxifen. I take Celebrex but only with minimal relief. I can see why some choose to discontinue therapy. Has anyone else had these symptoms? I think your pain could be from the Tamoxifen also. However, I would want a scan if it persisted. Thanks!!",

      "Content": "My pain varies from side to side too and moves around daily from my ribs to my spine. My Dr. spends enough time with me. However, I wonder about the new treatment guidelines that recommend scans etc. only if you are symptomatic. I would rather be scanned to look for problems. My Dr. is the same one that Elizabeth Edwards has. I did not know this until I saw her on TV with her a couple of wks ago. Being a nurse, I know that if you are not satisfied with your Dr, you should switch. I am sure you can find one that meets your needs. Thanks and hang in there!",
