I was operated in January 2016 for breast cancer: Lumpectomy, radiotherapy and then Letrozole treatment. In my case, Letrozole is the only available and suitable for me because of my previous medical history. I took Letrozole for 8 months. My life turned  into a nightmare: not sleeping properly, hot flushes, awful mood swings, dry mouth, joint pains, stiffness, memory loss, gaining weight etc. etc. possibly all listed side effects. Decided to stop taking Letrozole one month ago and feel much better. I am not trying to tell anybody else or agitate to do the same, but just tell that this medication can put one´s life into a different light and cause not only personal but other difficulties with mood swings and even break your life. I took this risk of stopping and enjoy my days without those bad side effects. Risky, but life as such is risky and rather only one or two years ahead instead of 5-10 horribly side-effected years. Anybody else done this?I recently been switched demo Armidex to letrozole and the horrible side effects have not diminished as I had hoped. The joint pains, moodiness and more importantly, the horrible weight gain was too much for me. The weight gain made be prediabetic and increased the leakage in. My mitral vale wore, I had once been diabetic and worked really hard to lose 30 pounds. I was no longer diabetic (no more metformin)!!! I keep my weight off for 3.5 years. Then the breast cancer happened. The estrogen blockers were horrible and because of the more pressing health issues, I chose to stop the Letrozole. Even my oncologist said that quality of life is important too. Since i\u2019ve Stopped the drug, I\u2019ve gone on a serious diet )no sugars or starches of any kind, and started working out 5 days a week. I\u2019ve lost 5 pounds but i\u2019m Worried that the \u201cinner tube\u201d around my middle never go away. I will continue my regimen and pray i get the shape back I had before.. I\u2019m 64 and i realize it\u2019s harder to lose weight but i\u2019m determined to put all this behind me and move on. I\u2019m worried about my breast cancer returning but my cancer was the size of a grain of salt, stage 0, so I\u2019m going to pray it never comes back.",
