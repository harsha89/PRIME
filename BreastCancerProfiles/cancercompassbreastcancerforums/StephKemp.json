    "Content": "Hi, I\u2019m 38 years old. My husband found something that felt weird in my left breast and I went last week and had a mammogram and ultrasound. The dr ordered a biopsy for the following Monday. I was already scheduled for a hysterectomy this past Tuesday which went well! My Dr called me yesterday and gave me biopsy results. Invasive lobular carcinoma. Sounds like an alien invader. I\u2019m just trying to get answers. I meet with surgeon in one week. Wow. This is going to be a long week. Especially since I\u2019m stuck at home recovering from the hysterectomy! Any advice or knowledge would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks, Steph Kemp",
