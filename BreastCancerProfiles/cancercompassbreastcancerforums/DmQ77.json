      "Content": "I am still on chemo I have one more treatment but yes I am having pain in my butt, legs all the way down to my feet. It feels like my legs are numb at times- if I have it itch I can\u2019t feel my self scratching it. I can\u2019t sleep on my left side or right side so I am tossing and turning all night long I hope this goes away after my last treatment if that point I will start radiation so hoping it will not continue. I feel better when I\u2019m walking then sitting or laying down. Ugh!",
