      "Content": "Hi, I was just diagnosed with DCIS in both left and right breasts.  However, DCIS is in 2 different quartdrants of one breast.  I'm trying to decide which approach is best for the long term.  Lumpectomry/radiation + tamoxifen or simple mastectomy.  I'm afraid of the side effects of radition such as damages to lungs, hearts and ribs.  For those of you who have a similar case like me, would you please share your experience with me?  BTW, my HER-2 is negative. Thanks in advance NL    ",

      "Content": "Hi, Has anyone heard of \"lymphoid infiltrate\" from the pathology report?  Is this related to lymph node? Currently, we're doing a study using \"immunohistochemical stains\" to further evaluate what that is.  This worries me as i heard this not a breast cancer.  It's some other cancer according to a pathologist.  Has anyone experienced this?  Pls help. Thanks,",
