      "Content": "Hello I have been taking the Femara since2-2007 the side effects are the same with other anti cancer drugs just like Aromasin,Tomoxofin,Arimidex,some of the other is worse than the Femara.So even though the Femara has caused side effects I have been able to control them to a point and the others  have not.I just know that you cant take asprin products,nsaids with the Femara especially if  you are a bleeder.Talk to your doctor.Take care and God bless, Linda",

      "Content": "In 12-2005 I was diagnosed with DCIS stage 1 they did a lumpectomy,in 1-2006 they Did a PET SCAN it showed that I had colon cancer on the right side.After this my dr removed my lymph nodes out from my left axillae they turned out benign I  work in a Dr office so I had some one to converse with after visiting with other doctors I decided to have a bilateral masectomy in 5-2006 after this I had several colonoscopies done and one of my mosted trusted Dr chayne Fisher in Seminole Ok he told me that I might need a big slug of chemo and that I needed a colon resection rhis was 2-2006 I went on to get a second opinion in 8-2006 the Adenoma's had quadrupled I had Doctors calling me telling me that I needed to get the cancer out ASAP so I made another appt with a GI doc and he told me that I needed to get to a surgeon to get this taken care of before it decided to go through the wall of my colon.So on 11-02-2006 Dr thomas removed 18 inches of my colon.I will say that I have the best Dr's and have the best care.I started taking Femara on 02-2007 about 2 months into taking this I was so sick on my stomach and I hurt all over my feet and legs felt like they had been beat I would wake up into the night crying but I had a cousin die from her cancer because she didnt stay with her plan of action and stay on her medication the Doctors told her that she really didnt need to be on her medication so she stopped we buried her 04-2007.So my oncologist has told me that my breast cancer and the metasis to the colon since it was not in my lymph nodes I can stop the Femara,I do not trust that I will be okay.From the beginning I have used my gut instinct on everything and god has told me everytime that he gave me my medical knowledge for a reason.So I just bought 500.00 worth of my medication and my Dr refuses to give me anymore medication for my sick stomach and my pain medication for what the Femara is doing to me.So ladies how do you handle this I do not understand why he did this I do not seek medications from other doctors I stick to the plan.So since he has decided to abandon me with the meds that help me take the Femara what do I do? Your opinion is very much needed. Thanks Linda  ",
