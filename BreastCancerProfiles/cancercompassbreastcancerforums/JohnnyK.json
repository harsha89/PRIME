      "Content": "Being a caregiver for a spouse is difficult enough but to do it for a parent when you are still in high school must be very overwhelming. Are there no others that can be part of the support team, i.e. siblings, parents, adult friends, local church, etc? I would also recommend checking to see if there are support groups for caregivers in your area. I agree that you need your positive distractions, school studies, friends, physical activity can be a great stress reliever, etc. I think you sometimes hit these low points and then you come back stronger again...I hope that this is what will happen for you.",

      "Content": "I'm glad that you intend to ask more. People often don't know how to help but if you can be specific (cleaning, driving, food, etc.), then that will help them to know what you need. I think this is something you would do for someone you cared about and this gives them an opportunity to provide tangible help and support. In the last few months as I've gone through my cancer experience, I am amazed at how some people really step up when you give them that opportunity. Good luck.",
