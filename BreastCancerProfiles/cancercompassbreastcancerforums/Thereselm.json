      "Content": "Hello, I've been using Letrozole for a year and a half. Aside from muscle and joint pain, it's been going okay. Some fatique as well. However, lately my hair has really thinned out - to the point that I can't put it in a ponytail anymore. My scalp isn't showing....yet but I'm afraid I'm headed there. How's anyone else been having this problem? Any suggestions? I'm taking Biotin (even doubled the dose). I also (out of desperation) started using an off brand of romaine for women. Would love to hear if anyone has ideas.",
