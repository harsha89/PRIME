      "Content": "Hi Britt - I'm sorry for your mom's recent diagnosis and I know how frightening this can be. I'm enclosing a link to a web page of personal breast cancer stories, as I know it includes suggestions of how family can support the person diagnosed. Many of the stories are inspirational and hopfully the titles will indicate which ones you would want to read. I wish you and your family the best! http://www.navigatingcancer.com/cancer/breast/experiences",
