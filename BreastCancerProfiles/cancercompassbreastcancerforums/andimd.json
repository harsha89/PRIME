    "Content": "I am 37 years old and was just told after 2 mammograms that I have micro calcifications that they want to watch in one breast.  The radiologist is sure it is benign and said he is comfortable with me waiting 6 months to get another mammogram.  My doctor said it is up to me, my mom had breast cancer when she was 42.  I said I would wait but my husband and mom are not happy with that.  Has anyone dealt with a situation like this before, I'm not sure what I should do?!",
