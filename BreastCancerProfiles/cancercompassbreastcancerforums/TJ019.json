      "Content": "My mom has been taking xeloda she actually has head and neck cancer that has metasisised to a lymphnode behind her liver.  The doctor has put her on this Xeloda and the reason i posted on this cancer is because the oncologist said that it is mostly a chemo used for metastic breast and colon cancer. She has been having horrible side effects for the xeloda she was down to taking one pill in the morning and one at night and still getting headaches and an upset stomach so the doctor had her stop and she is even more sick now..... we go back on thursday so hopefully we can find a good maintenance chemo to get her on.",
