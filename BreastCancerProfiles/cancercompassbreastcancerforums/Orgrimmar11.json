    "Content": "\"Forever Mom\", which just came out earlier this week, has proven to be one of the most inspirational books i've ever read. I just had to share it with you all. It's basically about a woman diagnosed with breast cancer that deals with the struggle of leaving her children while still being their \"Forever Mom\". Please pick it up!!!!! It will most certainly help with any hard time you're going through. Here is the link I found: http://www.washingtonpublishers.com/ForeverMom/index.htm",
