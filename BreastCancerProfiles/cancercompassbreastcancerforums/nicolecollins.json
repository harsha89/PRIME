      "Content": "Advice PLEASE! Strong family history of breast cancer.  GG grandmother, grandmother, mom, and now older sister (stage 3--had breast removed). Last year my breast MRI showed 3 spots, 6 months later, same.  I was told they were going to \"watch\" them.  I, gathered ALL of my previous records (mammo's since 2012, ultrasound, 3 MRI) the difference in my mammo from 2013 and last week are dramatically different (a lot of spiculated bright white sections--it litterally looks like a web.  Was called back 2 days later for \"spot\" mammo pictures since the last one also showed microcalcifications clustered. The tech spent about 10 minutes focused on my nipple only (right)--came back and told me Radiologist said I'm good for another year!!  According to my records--They also noted I have had a previous biopsy--I HAVE NEVER HAD A BIOPSY.  I am very worried, and no one will listen --I want a biopsy and they all act is if I am wasting their time.  I was actually told--\"we have run all the tests--your fine\"  They told my sister the same thing--she got the biopsy and was stage 3 with lymphnodes included.  Please if anyone else has had a similar experience let me know.  Thank you so very much,",
