    "Content": "My mother had her second masectomy on May 5, 2008 which is 12 years after a lumpectomy in the same breast. She had her first masectomy 25 years ago. The cancer had spread to her chest wall, neck and  lymphatic skin tissue on her breast. She is experiencing abscess like symptoms on the newest scar site. First one, now a second one. The very small site first gets red, leaks some redish fluid and then crusts up. The rest of her scar looks fine. She has made an appointment to see her oncologist and perhaps surgeon this Friday. Would anyone have experience with these symptoms? Could it be more cancer? She has been taking Arimidex since mid May, and like many of you is complaining of lower back pain, more swelling in her legs. Thanks for being a resource for me.",
