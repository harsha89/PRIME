    "Content": "Hi, I'm 17, going to be 18 on sunday, and my surgery to have a mysterious lump removed is the next morning. I don't know what to expect, the lump is very painful, wich i know is not supposed to be cancer but on my ultrasound it showed a mass that looked half solid and half liquid. I really don't know what to think, the doctor says there is a small chance of it being cancer but that doesn't make me feel any better, the last time someone told me it wasn't something, it was. I knew I had appendicitis, they said I probably didn't, but I did, same with a fractured pelvis! and that was all last year! (not including a knee surgery last year as well) Can someone just help me with what I should expect of my surgery and maybe even the results, the lump has been there for nearly 3 months now and it is being completely removed next monday! thanks everyone!!!",
