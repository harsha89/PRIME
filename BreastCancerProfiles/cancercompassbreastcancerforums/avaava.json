The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G I was diagnosed with breast cancer; had a masectomy, and breat reconstruction.  My oncologist prescribed Arimidex for my cancer treatment.  I advised him I was taking Black Cohosh to help with hot flashes.  Seven months after my breat cancer surgery & treatment, I decided to get a second opinion which turned out to be one of the best things I have done for myself since being diagnosed with breast cancer.  The second opinion dr. was very concerned that I was taking Black Cohosh.  Her response was something very similar to:  \"I know you are here for a second opinion and I will be happy to take you as a patient, but whatever you decide, I beg of you to stop taking black cohash.  You are taking medication to take the estrogen out of your body and then you are putting it right back into your body by taking the black cohosh which is a natural form of estrogen.\"  Needless to say, I stopped taking the black cohosh and I did change drs.  I am very glad I went for the second opinion.  She is a wonderful dr.  So, I would ask you to please stop taking the black cohosh.",
