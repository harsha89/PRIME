      "Content": "Don't panic! I also have extremely dense breast. I've been called back for ultrasound & mammograms almost yearly. It always scared me to death. I've had many needle biopsies & one surgical biopsy. I'm still breast cancer free. It doesn't always mean cancer. Just go back to make sure & ask for a written report from your doctor.",

      "Content": "My daughter had stage 2b triple positive breast cancer. She also had lymph cells test positive. She had chemo first then double mastectomy. At surgery no cancer was found. She opted not to have radiation. All this was done at MD Anderson in Houston. But, she would have had radiation before the breast implant surgery. She\u2019s had the implant surgery and all is well with her. Hope this may help.",
