    "Content": "My name is Sandy H. and I am a survivor!! I survived the poison, cut and burn, and have been taking Tamoxifen for 2 years. After my treatment ended I expected pure euphoria, absolute relief and bliss. I was dead wrong. I was anxious, I cried, I was depressed, I had major insomnia, I was an emotional trainwreck. Can anybody relate to that?! Thankfully I found natural, gentle healing and wrote a book about my extraordinary healing journey. If you can relate to those emotions,or just need inspiration or encouragement during or after your cancer journey check out our website at Lifeafterchemo.com, , send me your mailing address at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.

My dream is to help others who are needlessly suffering as I was. God Bless You All!!",
