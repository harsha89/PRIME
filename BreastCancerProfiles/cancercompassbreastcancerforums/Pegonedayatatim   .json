    "Content": "I am looking to see the best ways to help my friend who was just dx 2 weeks ago.  She had her surgery tuesday to remove the lumps....and some lymph nodes if i understand correctly.  She sees the oncologist this wednesday and has a port.  She says that she was told she will need 4 treatments of chemo and that they should not be too bad for her. I only have info on my MIL who has brain cancer but i think we should bring my friend dinners when her chemo starts in case it does make her pretty sick.  She tells me she thinks her family will be fine but i am going to tell her we are just bringing the dinners anyway.  HOw do breast cancer chemo's affect people? Any thoughts or advice would be great. Peggy",
