    "Content": "Only Christ can help you and He says, \"Anybody who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.\"  Saved from what?  Does salvation only mean from sin.  No, not only does He mean from sin but He also means from everything that is trying to destroy you and depression does just that.  The Lord showed me something that changed my life one day in regards to depression.  He showed me that depression and gratitude can not exsist in a person at the same time and that the cure for depression is gratitude.  Depression is the name of an evil wicked spirit that hammers down upon people.  Gratitude, kicks it's ass right bell to the pit of hell from which it came.  Pick something---anything you can be grateful for, like your mom.  Now thank God for her everyday.  Daily, add something else to the list and you will see a dramatic change in your emotional state of mind.  Expect resistance from your thought life (which is where the evil spirit attacks you) but make a conscious choice to resist back and verbally say, \"Thank You Lord for my mother\", or the day, your children, pets, job, or the fact that you don't have cancer or that you weren't born in a third world nation where you had to draw water five miles away from home and walk it back in a tin pail on your head daily.  Gratitude destroys depression and only Jesus Christ destroys the works of the devil in a person's life.  You need Jesus Connie.  An honest prayer to Him for help, gets an instant answer.  God bless you, Marion",
