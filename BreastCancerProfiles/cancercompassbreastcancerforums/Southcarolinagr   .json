      "Content": "I am a bone mets patient of 5 years now.  All I can tell you is to take one day at a time.  What treatments are you on?  I had rads 2 different courses.....first round to shrink the tumor and the second round a year later for pain control.  I still have pain in the area even though no signs of lesions in that area at this time according to bone scans and CT scans.  I am also on Femara 2.5MG because I am ER/PR+  am not her+ enough for the other good drug.  I take Lortab 7.5/500 as needed for pain every 6 hours.   ",

      "Content": "I too was dx with this very same type of cancer back in 2000.  My surgeon pretty much made the decision for me as we talked about what needed to be done.....where the tumor was located had a lot to do with me having a MRM (Modified Radical Ma.)  I had a very deep sunken in place high on the chest wall so mastecomy was my best option and reconstruction has made me look pretty normal again.  I did not have to have rads but did have 6 months of CMF chemo due to being ER/PR+ and the size of the tumor and my age at the time....the tumor was 2.5cm and I was 41 at the time of my dx.  I would talk this over with the surgeon, maybe even get a second opinion and talk to other breast cancer survivors.  FriendsInTouchCareTeam is a great group of breast cancer survivors if you'd like to join us.

      "Content": "I am a 6 year survivor of breast cancer/5 year bone mets patient.  Before I had the mastectomy to remove my right breast, my surgeon told me I would have a bone scan, CT and other tests before I would even leave the hospital.  I am grateful for such a throual surgeon.  There were no signs of cancer in any of the lymp nodes (22 were removed) no signs of cancer with the scans.  I did 6 months of CMF chemo and was put on Tamoxifen right after I finished the chemo.  I did this for precaution as I am ER/PR+.....9 months after the chemo I am dx with bone mets in my left si joint and sacroam.  I underwent rads two different courses and was put on Femara.  I have been stable for about 2 years.  I would demand scans and I recommend any cancer patient demand scans.  SouthCarolina_Grandma",
