    "Content": "Good to hear that others experience this bone or joint pain.  I feel like I'm 80 years old when I get out of bed in the morning, or out of my car after driving to work (1/2 hour 1 way)  I have not seen a doctor- and nothing is listed on any of the websites showing this as one of the side effects of Tamoxifen.  My sister experienced terrible leg pain while she was on Tamoxifen for 2 years, then it went away when she started Arimidex (sp?) Do any doctors chat on these to comment?",
