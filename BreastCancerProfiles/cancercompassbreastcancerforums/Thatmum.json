    "Content": "I can tell you from working in the morgue that the smell of decomp (someone dead for days) has no \"sickly sweet\" characteristic. Dead people don't smell like road kill. It is a very distinct smell and almost impossible to describe. Learn to breathe through your mouth when around those with the odor. It's easy. Just pretend to yourself that your nose is clogged. Also an open container of baking soda mixed with water can absorb the odor once the source is removed.",
