A   I found a lump in August, the following mammogram showed up calcifications aswell. Had a mastectomy 16th August. Fortunately not travelled to lymph nodes. Told I didn't need further treatment. Since then they had more results back and I am HER2positive. Now I''ve been told I need Herceptin and chemo. I don't understand why I need chemo now if they got all the cancer. I think they are just being cautious. You mention a blood test to see if there are any HER2+ cancer cells in the body - do you know any more about this? I would rather not have chemo unless I actually need to! The consultant says the chemo is of no benefit to me whatsoever, but they don't give Herceptin on its own. I need to decide whether to go ahead with chemo + herceptin. Any thoughts anyone?",
