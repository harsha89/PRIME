      "Content": "I was diagnosed in May 2001, Ovarian cancer stage 3. After my operation my first thought was to build myself up for chemo treatment and at the same time learn more about cancer. I wanted to give up on my cancer treatment because it was so hard, but managed to complete it. I knew I wouldn't want to do it again, but the statistic shows that recurrence is very common within the first 3-4 years. So I started to read up on Alternative ways to fight cancer. The book that taught me the most is A woman's guide to Breast cancer by Nan Lu. From him I learn about nutrition, herbs, taking care of the immune system, losing extra weight, exercise and best of all, Qigong, something like Taichi. I took it up a year after my chemo treatment. At that time I was still very afraid and was suffering from fatigue. A week after I took up Qigong with my husband, my fatigue was gone and so was my fear. My husband's eyestrain and headaches were gone. A few months later, we realised that a small lump on his chest that had been there for years was gone too. We have not missed a single day of practice since taking it up in Sep. 2002. As for nutrition I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and very little white flour/ dairy products. I also make it a point to eat more of the food that is known to be anti-cancer, like garlic, onions, flax seeds, soy products, pomegranates and berries, ginger, turmeric, dandelion. I also supplement with multivitamin, zinc, magnesium, calcium. I take an enzyme pill to help with digestion. I exercise (slow walking) on my treadmill almost everyday for 45 mins. Qigong (chilel.com) takes up about half an hour a day. When I first learn that I had cancer, I thought I was going to die. Now I feel that I have a real chance of regaining my health.",

Maitake mushroom with D-fraction, IP6, Flor-Essence tea(original form of Essiac), a probiotic, a B-complex vitamin and a stool softener. Systemic enzymes (Mega-Zyme) because her nutritionist said that the liver's function, and particularly digestion, affects so many areas of a person's health. Rgds, Joanna",

The one thing I want to share with you and your husband is to stop taking diary products - I read that in Jane Plant's book, YOur life in your hands. She is a Professor from Britain, a researcher. The other book that might help is A woman's guide to healing from breast cancer by Nan Lu. I learn a lot from this book. Take care, Joanna",
