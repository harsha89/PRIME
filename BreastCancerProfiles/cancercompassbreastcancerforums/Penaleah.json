    "Content": "I was diagnosised with ductile cancer today.  I'm really scared as I am a single parent of a 12 year old daughter.  I have survived cancer twice already.  At age 27 I had cervical cancer and at 57 I had melanomia but having just turning 60, this really has me scared.  I can't see a surgeon until July 15th and I don't want to tell my daughter until I have more information.  I need all the encouragement I can get.  Both of my parents are dead and I have no real family left.  Just a few good friends who are like family to us. ",
