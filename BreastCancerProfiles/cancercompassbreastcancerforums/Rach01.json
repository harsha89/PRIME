      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply. I have been very strong throughout this whole process however got a little scared when my surgeon explained that it may come back due to how agressive it was. I have always remained possitive however I think I got a bit of a scared as I was really expecting him to say it is all good and will never return. Reality kicked in, he,he. I just have to do as you say and live life not spend each day wondering when it will end. How are you going with your cancer. Are you cancer free and those scans are just check ups or do you have cancer still? I wish you all the best with it. I think all need to just enjoy the holidays and drinks some wine and wait for Santa, he,he. Take care and thanks for your support.",

      "Content": "Hi there, i live in Australia, am 35yrs old and was diagnosed with Metaplastic breast cancer earlier this year. I had a full mastectomy and axillery clearance. I have finished chemo and have to have follow up breast scans every 3 mths. I had the highest level of the metaplastic cancers. My concern now is that I am wanting to know if anyone has this cancer and if they have remained cancer free since operation. Or is recurrance has happened, how far between was it. I would love to talk to someone who had this type of cancer as it is different to normal breast cancers. cheers",
