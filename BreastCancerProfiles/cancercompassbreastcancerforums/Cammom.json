I also had a lump in my right breast and found out I had lobular breast cancer. Lobular mirrors itself in the other breast in about 5 years. (thank god my husband found out that info for me). I decided to have a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction. I was told it was not in my lymph nodes and decided upon cmf chemo. (I went to the \"best breast surgeon,Dr. Axelrod in New York) Four years later I found a lump under my right arm and found out that my original cancer was in it and had to undergo chem caf with total hair loss and unbelievable sickness. Had I been told they werent sure rather than it is not in my lymph nodes, I might have decided on the stronger treatment. Anyway my original point was that even though you have a mastectomy, it can come back under your arm (in a lymph node) or in the chest wall. I am now receiving chemo again because this cancer which I was told was in remission is now in my liver. All because a lymph node was left in. I am feeling fine and plan to live a long life. You need to do a little reading and decide for yourself. If you do decide to have a bilateral my suggestion is not to have a tram flat. It is painful and having your breasts removed and stomach surgery at the same time is not a good idea. Have an expander put in and implants. Good luck to you and keep a sense of humor and be surrounded by people who love you and you will be fine. I find that intriguing that you mentioned the 5 year mirror.  I did have a minor surgical procedure with my right breast a number of years ago.  I had a different medical group that treated me at the time and they determined that I had an intraductal papiloma which they removed.  Everything was benign back then.  Nothing was found elsewhere and on any mammograms as well.  It was only this last fall that I had this problem with my left breast.  Also, the biopsy indicated it to be hormone receptor positive both estrogen and progesterone.  This condition currently is only in the breast area and not spread anywhere else. Will plan on having regular checks and followups. I teach and stay active and feel pretty good.  Hope to keep that up indefinitely. ",

In answer to your question, vitamins and minerals can be sold over the counter (OTC) in combinations, or alone and in varying amounts.I am not recommending any particular source, I am not in the vitamin business. I suggest that you find the cheapest place possible to buy them in high doses as that is what it takes. When one has cancer, their entire body is sick, not just the place where the tumor is.If left alone, cancers can metasticize (spread and grow) because the \"ground\" or tissue where the cancer grows is \"sick.\" In fact, the tissue area where the cancer grows, has to be prepared first by various chemical actions and breakdowns, to \"prepare\" the site for a tumor to grow. Diabolical isn't it. Tumors just don't show up one day, and say to themselves, \"OK, I think I will create a breast cancer tumor here.\" It doesn't work that way. Cancer begins to grow, when there has been a long-term \"inflammation\" that is system, or body wide. Therefore, the entire body has to be treated. To treat inflammations, or a cancer, one has to take larger doses than what are usually recommended by the FDA. For example: the amino acid L-glutamine is sucked up like a sponge in a tumor when there are high doses of L-Glutamine taken in by the person, which then overdoses on L-glutamine, and then signals the body's own natural cancer fighters, the white blood cells to attack and kill the tumor. Study after study, now show that L-Glutamine all by its self, can kill a tumor. Too much L-glutamine in a cancerous tumor, of any size, in any place in the body...is an abnormal condition in your body. No, too much L-Glutamine in your cancer cells do not make you sick. Just the opposite. Although your normal cells know how to regulate correct amounts of L-glutamine, your cancer cells or tumor does not. That is why tumors are called \"L-glutamine sponges.\" L-glutamine is also an anti-inflammatory agent, which then reduces greatly your chances of getting cancer again in the future. Read the research, when I started there was just a little research on L-glutamine, now there is a lot...because laboratory studies show it works. There are testimonials also from HIV/AIDs victims, who say that L-Glutamine cleared their livers of toxins, allowed them to have a normal \"gut\" and eat and absorb food so they could recover, and healed their \"mouth sores\" which are so prevalent in both radiation and HIV patients. In fact, L-glutamine is routinely given in hospitals for mouth sores, and to persons who have perforated intestines caused by radiation or other factors. L-glutamine is also highly recommended for spastic colon and Chrone's disease, and given to people with cancer who have no appetites (called cachexia). 60% of the human body's amino acids are made up of L-glutamine. What does that tell you? L-glutamine is taken like a powder, one to two big heaping tablespoons in the drink of your choice. It is tasteless, dissolves easily, and your body loves it! When one has cancer, it is recommended that a person take from 10,000 mg to 60,000 mg a day. One large heaping tablespoon equals about 5,000 mg. As I said, L-Glutamine is tasteless, odorless, and a white powder and easy to take mixed with any liquid. Reishi mushrooms also come in a capsule form. A related mushroom \"Shitakii,\" can be eaten as a food. I ate about 5-6 Shitakii mushrooms a day, fried, grilled, raw in salads. It is a pleasing taste, and you have eaten Shitakiis or black mushrooms almost every time you have eaten Chinese food. Both mushrooms (Reishi is more potent) increase your white blood cells, who then eat up cancer cells. Shitakii or black mushrooms can be found in your local grocery story. However, they are cheaper in bulk, about $3.00 for a very large bag, if you buy Shitakii mushrooms from your local oriental grocery store. They are dried and can be reconstituted by soaking them in water for a few minutes. I mixed my shitakii mushrooms in everything, including grounding them up in the food processor and putting them in ground beef, meat loaf, hamburger helper, etc. If you don't want to eat them...you can take capsules labeled \"beta-glucans\" the activce ingredient, or \"Reishi\" mushrooms. While actively ill with cancer, I took from 6 to 8 a day. Vitamin C, Lysine, Proline, Arganine and copper can be bought in one pill from Dr Rath's web site, or other websites that sell \"Epican Forte.\" Read Dr Rath's articles on cancer as well. His research has been duplicated by other research institutes not related to Dr Rath. I stumbled upon Dr Rath's Epican Forte after reading other research studies on cancer. I would say it works, or at least worked for me. The more individuals do basic web searches, of good, published, peer-reviewed cancer studies, and what works...the quicker deadly chemotherapy, and radiation will become a dinosaur of the past. As I have stated before, both my aunts and mother died of breast cancer. They took extensive chemotherapy and radiation. Not only did it not work, but it made them sicker. My attitude is: \"If it makes you sick...it makes you sick.\" Chemotherapy, etc. should make a person \"well\" not sick. This is just common sense, duh! Just yesterday, I talked with a friend, whose neighbor was put on Tamoxafen. She became paralysed due to \"blood clots\" caused by Tamoxefen. Tamoxefen's studies are that it is suppose to reduce future breast cancers by 20-60%. What Tamoxefen's laboratories don't tell the public in their press releases, is that more people get heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and liver cancer by taking Tamoxefen...than would have gotten a secondary cancer IF THEY DID NOTHING! This is just outrageous, and I wish I could go to congress, or somewhere to pass laws, to make such drug makers as Tamoxefen, and other chemotherapies tell the truth to the public. I watch TV advertisements selling drugs. After the nice looking guy says to take say \"Luvoxcin\" an anti-cholesterol drug, he then says quickly, with a smile on his face...such-and-such drug will cause heart palpitations, muscle weakness and pain, diarrhea, astham, abnormal blood clots, blah blah blah. Why then...do they allow this drug to be marketed on TV or even sold? Because it means big bucks for the drug companies, marketers, public relations firms, TV ad sellers, packagers, and so on. Our cancer and other illnesses, many of which are the result of long-term poor food intake, lacking nutrition, smoking, alcohol, toxic environments, and genetics, or all of the above, can be remedied by \"normal\" methods and pathways in the body. Chemotherapy and radiation are not \"normal.\" They are poisons. Worse yet, since 1955, the studies of chemotherapy and radiation show that it does not do any good, or achieve higher cure rates in most cancers, than if someone did nothing! I am hopeful that some of the newer chemotherapy drugs can be beneficial, as some of the newer ones work on a molecular level. However, the conditions for getting cancer in the first place, chronic inflammation, are not being addressed. One can forget about radiation. Radiation, as everyone knows from the atomic bomb studies of populations who were subjected to \"radiation,\" cause cancers. This is established fact. Also, one must take therapeutic doses of vitamins and minerals. I have talked with people who say they are talking vitamins and minerals, and I ask then \"how much,\" or in what quantity. Most people are taking such supplements as Vitamin C in such small doses, that it would not help a mouse. When one is ill with cancer or other nutrition-related illnesses, one's body has been depleted for a long, long time. Therefore, one has to take huge doses to catch up, and also defeat the cancer. If you are interested in dosages, or the amounts of each vitamin to take, email me, I will be glad to give you my personal opinion, based on research, on what dosages were effective. By the way, RDAs, (the FDA's Recommended Daily Amounts) of many vitamin and mineral supplements were based on a) rat studies (such as how much of a depletion can make a rat sick), and b) clinical and observable studies whereby, they study how much depleting a person of a certain Vitamin, such as vitamin C, causes that person to become sick. This is just ridiculous. RDAs are not based on supervised, clinical trials at the intra cellular level...but by such criteria as\" at which dosage of vitamin C does a person's tongue turn red, indicating an insufficiency.\" I want to slap these people. There are some larger population studies that show better information, such as: \"Populations who eat \"selenium-depleted\" foods, have X-amounts of higher rates of cancer...than populations who eat \"selenium-rich\" foods, grown in soil where there is an abundance of seleniu. Populations studies also show that Orientals, who have been eating mushrooms of certain types an varieties have about 60-80% cancers than other populations who do not eat cancer. Both mushrooms (Reishi and Shitakii) as well as Shark Fin soup (shark fin is shark cartilage) has been known for its cancer killing, or curing properties for about 2000 to 3000 years. I have another bone to pick. The medical establishment who studies cancer and what makes it grow, \"knows\" that cancer requires 5 times more sugar, or glucose than normal cells. Therefore, one should eat no sugar, or any sugar-producing foods, such as anything white, such as bread, rice, potatoes, or any refined carbohydrates that turn into sugar. When you eat sugar, you are feeding your cancer cells or tumor. One can help to starve a cancer to death, by not eating any sugar. I did this before I was operated on, and remain on a near sugar-free diet. I learned this from a woman weight lifter, who is also an attorney. From their studies, they found that women who had had breast cancer, who later became weight lifters...and so ate no sugar in order to get a lean body mass...had as much as an 80-90% reduction in secondary or return cancers than the rest of the breast cancer population. Women weight lifers do their homework and know what happens to their body with every spoon full of food they eat. Most women who are weight lifters, or the one's I know, are professional woman, including nutritionists, physical education instructors, researchers, attorneys, etc. They are not dumb by any means. I would rather try their approach than any oncologist. Don't believe me? Then I highly recommend you do your own research...I am not pulling this information out of my hat, nor am I selling anything. Good luck, I certainly hope that if you or a loved one is afflicted, you will get well. My best, Diana W. PhD Hello, I am new to this website but appreciate your input and insight.  I am currently using Dr. Rath's Vitacor and Epican Forte as a supplement to treat my recently diagnosed cancer left breast - they call it DCIS.  The Kaiser Med group who I see don't have much of a clue of what's out there nutritionally or with alternatives or at least they don't let on.  Anyway, I'm not very good at taking pills and capsules so, I am using the supplements with meals which is recommended but I am trying different ways and means to use them in my food.  Just this morning I put the Epican Forte dose into my bowl of Campbell's \"Soup At Hand\" Vegetable Medley.  I guess I could call it Fortefied Vegetable Medley soup.  Oh, I also added a couple scoops of my leftover Boston Market Squash Casserole into the Mix.  From reading your email, I bet that those luscious mushrooms would go nicely too.  I don't have any yet but I'm thinking about putting together some recipes as CAM - friendly foods.  Any suggestions?  I also heard that Eggplant is supposed to be a powerful Anti-Cancer food. Blessings! Melanie J. Molle'    ",
