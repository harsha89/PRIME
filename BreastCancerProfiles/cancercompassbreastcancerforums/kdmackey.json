Someone told me if they hurt its may just be cist not cancer.  If any- one has any information about this I would like to hear it.  Thanks kd ",

      "Content": "Thank you Juanaboo for your respond to my message.  I guess I'm just scared.  What did you do when you found out it was cancer.  I don't have a family history of cancer either, but I guess the risk is still there. I really have tried to take care of myself ever since I was young. I've never been in the hospital except to have my children.  I know I need to see a doctor.  I didn't know if a cancer center would help me since I don't have insurance.  Your information has been helpful,  thanks again.  kd",

A support group can really help-a cancer center or medical facility in your town shoul be able to put you in touch with one.  They aren't all the same, so if you don't care for a group after the first 2-3 times, try a different groups, until you find one where you are understood and supported.  Also, find a good counselor who's experienced with cancer issues.  When I got my diagnosis, I was in shock and denial, and for a while just drifted through treatment.  Then I read Peace, love and Healing (I think that's the title) by Bernie Siegal, and it made me do an about face.  I realized I'd been waiting around to die, instead of taking action to live.  I highly recommend the book. Finally, since I don't want to overwhelm you, be aware that there are lots of complementary treatments that help with side effects and increase positive outcomes of traditional medicine.  Reiki, herbs, meditation and visualization, and nutritional therapy have all helped me a lot.  Everyone's different, so try things out and see what helps you. You sound like a great person who's had an unusually rough time-I hope it gets better for you.  Write back and let me know how you're doing, starshine   Thank you starshine for all your information.  Its so good to hear from people who are well educated in this field.  I am at this time getting a second appenion at a cancer center.  I still waiting on them to recieve the slide from the pathologist.  I'm hoping to get to see the doctor at the cancer by next week.  I'm experiencing breast pain most of the time and I feel the cancer in my breast is growing and just want to scream \"SOMEONE GET THIS CANCER OUT OF ME NOW!\" but I know I have to wait on the doctors to view all reports.  So I pray for patients and hope all will turn out for the good.  Thank again KD",

Thanks Leemg for responding to my message. Wow sound like you've been through a lot, but I'm glad you've come out a stronger person.  This is so incouraging.  I'm tring to look at this in a positive way, like what doesn't kill you will make you stronger.  I am reading a lot of information from book to learn all I can and also getting a second opinion from a cancer center pathologist and doctors.  I'm still waiting on them to call me.  I have my daughter here with me who is my glue thats holding me together and God is my superglue.  Thank you again and may God bless you for tring to help others.",

They tell me they found somthing that didn't look right so they need to do a biopsy.  They did this while I was awake which was very scary.  I had to wait a week, well I called the doctor to find out if the results was in and the nurse said \"no one has called you to make an app. to come in, can you come in today at 3:30.\" I didn't have time to call my daughter, she lived 2hrs away and I couldn't get ahold of my boyfriend so I had to go by myself.  I was along when the doctor told me I had breast cancer.  I'm scared, I know theres a lot of women who have and are going through the same thing I am.  Just need to talk to someone and hear there story and experiences.  I think there should be faster ways to get things done so you don't have to wait so long to find out your results. 10-23-07 has changed my life.   kd, I had a situation like yours Sept 2005 I went for annual mamogram about 6 months late since I had never had a problem I didn't worry when I didn't hear anything assuming everything was norma as usual.  A month later they called me for a sonigram seemed they needed to verify a change from previous mamo 18 months earlier at a different lab.  I had changed doctors and it took them a month to get previous xray to compare. The day they did sonigram they made appt for biopsy the next day on what was caused possible cyst.  I did not get the results until a week later they called me on the phone at work (my oldest sons 34th birthday)advised it was cancer - who was my breast surgeon.  Needless to say I fell apart and cried for 2 days but started on anxiety meds which help tremondously and after talking to surgeon and my family knew I was going to fight and be a survivor.  The result was stage IIb, grade 3 HR/PR neg but HER2+++ with 1 positive sentinel node but clear margins. They gave me a unfavorable prognosis but I went through 6 months of Chemo, 33 days of radiation and 8 months of Herceptin completed 12/4/06. Today was my annual mamo which is clear with no sign of cancer. Although I suffer form side effects from Chemo and am no longer able to work. I am glad I did the lumpectomy plus all the other meds.  Just be strong, have a positive attitude and strong faith and you will get through this stronger than ever.  Good Luck and God Bless.     Thank you so much for sharing your experience with me.  These are the thing that will help me through this breast cancer .  I'm so glad you are free from cancer, Thand God.  I believe I will be to someday.  I've been told I will have to have my right breast removed.  I am only 48 so this was very shocking.  I always tried to take care of my body by exercising,  eating right, drinking lots of water, take vitimans so this is very hard.  I know they can do breast reconstruction but the main thing at this time is getting this cancer out of my body.  I don't know what kind of Chemo I will be getting at this time but I 'll do what ever it take to beat this cancer.  Thanks again for sharing with me what you've been though.  May God bless you for helping others.   ",
