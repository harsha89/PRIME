    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with stage 2B breast cancer in August 2014.  I was 37 years old and the mother to a 19 month old son.  I start a blog about my experience just 2 weeks after my diagnosis.  My goal has always been to strengthen our community through story and shared experience.  If you think you might benefit from reading my story or know someone who would, I invite you to take a look. Thank you! Carrie https://littlebsbigc.wordpress.com",
