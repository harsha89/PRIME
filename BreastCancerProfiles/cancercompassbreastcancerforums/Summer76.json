      "Content": "Thank-god I am not the only one who is gaining weight with the aromasin. When I was on Tamoxifin I was actually losing weight slowly, but since he switched me to the aromasin, I have noticed my tummy is getting bigger. I would rather be on the tamoxifin but it was iritating my liver and causing my liver enzymes to elevate. Plus I dont think I had as much pain in my joints than I do now. Especially my feet and hands. I am glad I found this site because it makes me feel better about these things. But I want to know will the weight come off after we quit this medication. Does anyone know this answer. Plus I have steattle hepatitis caused by the tamoxifin and cannot crash diet because it will affect my liver, can you tell me what kind of diet I could be on without damaging my liver furter.",

      "Content": "I have been on the Zoldadex for a year and a half. My husband gives them to me each month. I think it is more painful for him than me. I also take aromasin. Yes I do have alot of joint pain especially in my feet and hands. Also I have gained weight and cant stand it. I to get tired of all the pain and weight gain and just want to say the heck with it, but I keep taking it for my family so I can be around when my children get married and have kids. All I can say is hang in there, our families need us.",

      "Content": "I had stage 1 breast cancer, with lumpectomy and radiation.  I then was started on Tamoxifen which caused my liver function tests to sky rocket. I was tested periodically and they continued to stay elevated and so I had a abdominal scan which showed some spots on my liver.  My oncologist had ordered a ultasound of my liver which showed 3-4 small spots on my liver, since they were small and difficult to biopsy we decided to watch them and so a couple months later I had another ultasound and they appeared to not have changed since the last time.  My oncologist changed me to aromasin after almost 2 yrs and the liver function test seem to be normal now.  He checks my lfts each time I go to see him. ",

      "Content": "Dear Jomar, I had the same kind of breast cancer as you did. I opted for the lumpectomy with the radiation. If I had to do it all over again I would do the same thing. I have never regreted the choice I made. I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years but the tamoxifen was causing my liver enzymes to elevate, so I had a ultrasound of my liver and it showed some spots on my liver but it is not cancer. So now I am on Aromasin and my liver enzymes are back to normal, but have experienced the joint pain, some days are worse than others, but I can deal with it. Good luck with your decision and if you need to talk further, I will be here.",
