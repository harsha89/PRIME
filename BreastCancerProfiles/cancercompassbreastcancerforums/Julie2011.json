      "Content": "I have always questioned everything since I was a child.  The Pharmacuticals run the show, they tell the doctors what to prescribe, the Pharmacuticals tell the researchers what they can and cannot do. Same thing with diabetes.  There is a cure - but too much money would be lost!  There have been a ton of donations for the \"cancer cure\" and it has not done any of us any good.  The researchers get more money, the people who run the donation centers have a great paying job, (job security for all these folks as long as there is no cure)  and 50 years later and zillons of dollars later - there is still NO cure!  Can you imagine how much the drug companies and cancer centers would lose if we were to actually have a cure in place!  Too bad money rules!  Glad you have found something that is workling for you (CesiumChloride).  Bless you!",

      "Content": "I have a family member who had a lump at a young age either 18 or 19.  They did a needle biopsy on it in her 30's and told her it was not cancer.  Then at around 56 years old she was told the same lump was malignant.  I do not know if a malignancy started later in the same lump or what.  Why don't you see your doctor regarding the lump.  Your young and it may be just a breasts cyst.  Why do you think you have breast cancer? ",

      "Content": "So sorry to her that your mom is on a waiting list.  I would of thought with breast cancer she would get immediate attention.  Hope she is able to see the doctor soon.  They will probably check her lymph nodes during the breast surgery.  And yes, do stay strong for your mother.  How is she doing?  How old is your mom?  With the way our health system is going in the USA we may have a waiting list here too with the insurance overhaul we will be getting in 2014.  Does sound like your grandmother is an inspiration for you.  Best wishes, Julie.",

You being there for her I am sure means alot to her.  God bless. Julie",
