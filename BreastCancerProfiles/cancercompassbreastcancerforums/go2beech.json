    "Content": "Hello,  had a Dbl masectomy 1 1/2 yrs ago, lifting 2 lb weights give me alot of pain the next day, just yesterday I had to scrape the ice off my windshield.......today I hurt and feel short of breath. If it is something I know i can work through I might be able to push thru it but it certainly makes me feel like I have the flu.  I tried push ups, just not worth it.  I'm pretty active and P90 is something I used to work out too but doing jumping jacks would be torture. Sounds like your doing well!",
