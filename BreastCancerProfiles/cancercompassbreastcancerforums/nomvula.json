She felt it and was startled at the size, so she started trying to capture it - at one point she said got it - but then moved and it was lost - she brought in the radiologist who then felt the lump, looked puzzled and attempted to find it.. no luck - so i was sent home with an ALL CLEAR come back in a year and a pamplet on dense breast tissue. Is there a chance that this was not picked up on the ultrasound because it is hidden under the muscle? or just a phantom lump that can be felt not seen? no one seems to be worried but me. Since finding it, i am now having pains which shoot from the area of the lump into the breast and nipple area, over the last week i have started to feel extremely tired, edgy due to the pain just below my left shoulder blade and wraping around the left rib cage to just under my breast and as of today .. i have this nagging uncomfortable pain between the shoulder blades...my husband has even started asking me if i am ok inside. Am i just being paranoid - i do not wanna go for more tests and made to feel like i am being a hypochondriac. i cannot see a specialist unless my primary refers me - so how do i get him to send me to specialist when he states..  the radiologist says you are clear for another year. please help In fact iam not replying to a message.  Kindly give advice my 17 year old daughter phoned me this morning.  she said she has a thick hard bone that have developed betweeen her armpits and breast.  i read about about types of lumps and which of those can be cancerous.  after reading i discovered that the hard ones are prone to have cancer cells. She is at the bording school and iam waiting for the school to take her to the doctor tomorrow.  iam nervous and scared.  is it possible that the typoe of lumb can have a cancer cells on it.  nobody in the family has been diagnosed with cance and this is killing me.     ",
