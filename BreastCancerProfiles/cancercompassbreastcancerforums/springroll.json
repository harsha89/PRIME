    "Content": "After bilateral mastectomy I was prescibed Anastrzole. I took it for about a month and wound up with severe rash and itching that drove me crazy. This rash was across my upper chest and neck and down my arms, especially bad on the inner elbow. I stopped taking it per my dr and at the next appointment she switched me to Letrazole. After 2 weeks I again developed severe itching and the rash was now around my waist, rear and thighs. I immediately stopped taking it. My oncologist stated she had not seen that reaction in anyone before but changed my medication to Tamoxifen. You are not alone in your discomfort. It was unbelievably annoying. I discovered if I rubbed it instead of scratching, I got some relief. Hope you are better.",
