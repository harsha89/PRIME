      "Content": "Ann: I have stage 4 breast cancer which has spread to my liver and my lungs. I doubted anything except my oncologist, but was told about 714X from Canada. Have you ever heard of it? Have you heard of Billie Best? My CEA (tumor marker) went from 8.6 to 1 and anything under 3 is normal. Please let me know if you would like any further information. Karen",

      "Content": "Judy: Please see the reply I just sent to Seth about 714x. I would be happy to talk to you and share any information you would like. I would have NEVER believed it would work especially since it is not recognized in the U.S. yet. They are working on it, however. Have a happy holiday. Love, Karen",
