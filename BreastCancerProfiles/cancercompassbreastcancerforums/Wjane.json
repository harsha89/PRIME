I recently found a small nodule (pea size) in my left breast just under the nipple area.  I keep putting off seeing a doctor due to the small size of the nodule.  It's not hard nor is it painful.  I do have a strong family history of breast cancer however.  My mother was around my age when she discovered a nodule in her left breast.  I'm not sure of the size.  She didn't see a doctor for at least five more years concerning this lump.  When she finally did go to her doctor, she had to have a mastectomy and chemo.  She did really well for about 4 years but the cancer came back and she then passed away at age 53.  Since then she's had a sister to also die with breast cancer and another sister has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  I'm not really dumb enough to think that this nodule in my breast couldn't be cancer, I know it could.  But it's so tiny, I almost feel ridiculous seeing a doctor over this.  And I know that ultimately I'll go in and get checked out.  But I keep putting it off and chances are (knowing me) I'll let months or even years (like my mother) go by without having it checked.  VERY DUMB, I know...  And maybe a little of it is denial or fear.  But I just can't seem to make myself go get checked... (please don't anyone jump on me here, I just need some support and prompting maybe, I don't know...)  Thanks...Megan Please get an appointment today and see what this lump is. Most breast cancer is pea sized when discovered. The sooner you address this the less chance  it has to metastasize (travel to other sites in your body),and the better your chances are for a full recovery.",
