      "Content": "Hello all of you reading!  This is my first post.  I am not new to the realm of cancer; my mother has had lymphoma of the stomach twice and has survived.  However, I am new to the realm of breast cancer; no one I know no one if my family has ever been diagnosed.   I will briefly update you on my journey.  I had my annual mammogram in November 2008.  I was asked to come back for a more extensive one and ultrasound becuase calcifications were seen.  This further led to a biopsy on December 22.  On December 29, I got the call that I have ductal carcinoma in situ that is estrogen and progesterone +.  A lumpectomy was scheduled for January 6.  The lumpectomy showed 1/2 cm tumor in situ with 5 mm pushing through the duct wall, thus putting me in the category of invasive also.  Lymph nodes are negative.  I was told my treatment would be radiation with mammosite for 5 days and then Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I have completed the radiation.   Then, an oncologist wanted to do the oncotype dx testing.  My score came back a 26...high gray area.  The nurse said the doctor will recommend chemotherapy.   I am very confused.  What is the chemotherapy for?  Are the side effects of chemo a smaller risk that a 17% chance I might get the cancer again in 10 years?  Have any of you had the oncotype dx with a reuslt in the mid-range and chosen not to receive chemothereapy?   If I choose chemotherapy, are their any regimens that do not cause hair loss?   Thanks for listening and replying.   Tigger1",
