      "Content": "Well not just a single fight but her new personality led to several squabbles. She wanted to go back to college but didn't do well. She wanted to go out and party but that didn't sit well with me. She started buying crazy expensive cloths and purses. I thought maybe a phase from what she had endured.. But never in a million years would I have thought this...thanks for the response I appreciate it..",

      "Content": "Well I am new to this discussion forum.  Most people I know are sick of listeneing to me about my life's turn of events.  My wife and I had been together since we were extremely young.  We had been together for twelve years married for five and in love.  She was twenty eight years old when she was diagnosed with Stage one Breast Cancer.  She had a lumpectamy chemo/radiation.  It wasn't easy for either of us.  After everything I noticed a change in her personality, then one day I came home from work after an argument to find that he had left me.  She will not see me or speak to me just random texts bringing up past arguments or mistakes I had made years ago.  She says her eyes were opened from her experience and she is no longer in love with me.  She refuses couceling and demands that I take the action of filing for a dissolution.  I really don't know what to say... Anybody out there that can help a guy get his head around this...   Sincerely Mr. Confused",

      "Content": "    Thanks for the response. I understand that it can change people, but to walk away from everything you know.  Your home, pets, friends and family (my side) without a peep or anything is just extremely difficult for me to accept.  Even her family has reached out to me...I don't know if I should move on or fight to get her back..",
