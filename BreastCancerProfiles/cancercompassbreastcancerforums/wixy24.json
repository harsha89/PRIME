      "Content": "Hello ladies, I, too, had the oncotype testing and my insurance did approve it upon one denial...the dr told them it will decide between my taking chemo/radiation or not which, in turn, would save them money...seems like that's all they are worried about anyway. But the test came back as a 10 so the chemo would only buy me 2 more points down to an 8 so we decided to not go that route and watch my markers for a bit...he said we could always start it if something comes up but so far, so good. And they were adamant that they would take payments we could afford because they really want us to do what we have to do and nothing more. Good people... good luck to you all!...Riesa  ",

      "Content": "I, too, have had the joint pains from Arimidex, a common ailment. My orthopedist suggested taking osteo-biflex, for joint care tho it didn't do much for the pain, so he shot me with cortisone in my hands, the worst places for me. Drastic but it helps, and I am changing to Tamoxifen. He is suggesting I try a medrol pack for systemic cortisone relief of overall pain and swelling...I intend to ask my doctor about that regimen next month...I also was diagnosed with atrophic vaginosis, NO symptoms, at my annual  pap smear which my gyn said is also a side effect of the Arimidex. I have ulcers from it and had nose bleeds and vaginal bleeding, too, even tho I had a hysterectomy years ago...seems like too much for one person to take on at once...wish they could find something better as I have 4 1/2 MORE years to go!",

      "Content": "I, too, quit taking Arimidex just 3 weeks ago. I am happy to say that my joints feel like new again...or at least like they did before I started it. I am hoping the Tamoxifen doesn't hurt me in the same way but I know everyone is different. I tried the osteo-biflex, the gym, the calcium, etc nothing worked for either the pain or sleeplessness...I also have RLS which I take nothing for...I wasn't about to add another med to my regimen now...I kept the attitude that and take joy in each day, at least I am here to feel the pain...WHEN I was hurting...it still takes prayer and hope to see this through to the end.",

      "Content": "Susan, I felt some of the emotion you are feeling now when I had my bilat mast last May, my daughter was due to graduate that month from college, my son from high school 2 weeks later and my daughter was also set to be married on June 1st. I lived day to day and set little goals for myself each day, then week, then month...while I do not know the tremendous challenges you have faced, mine seemed unsurmountable to me then andI could face them only one day at a time, one smell, one taste, one scene at a time...get all the info you can get both from here, the net, books and call your local community cancer assistance for whatever they can do for you. Mine sent a past patient to me to show me how to do the exercises and talk about life afterwards. She was my first support bridge outside of my family, faith and friends. Try this website, too, there are SO many wonderful women there just reading their past posts made me see I am as normal and wonderful as any of them...we are many...and if you want to talk more please e-mail me any time...--Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

      "Content": "  On 3/1/2008 JewellRice wrote: I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2005 and had my mastectomy the end of the month. I started my chemo ( 6 treatments )  and went through 36 radiation treatments finishing in March 2006. I had my other breast removed in May 2006, my cancer was stage 3-B so my doctor thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and have the right breast removed. I started Arimidex in April 2006 and have had joint pain especially in my upper arms. I have also had a couple of bouts with sciatica. One of my biggest concerns is my weight gain, When I was going through chemo I ended up with burning mouth syndrome and lost 20 lbs because I couldn't eat. I was on morphine for over 2 months. Now that I have gotten over the burning mouth the weight has really started to pile on. We live in the Midwest where you can't really do much walking in the winter, so I got a treadmill hoping that would help. I am taking a generic sleeping pill Zolpidem and it really helps although I wake up a couple of times in the night. I was diagnosed in April 2007 and have been on Arimidex since July. I am currently involved in changing my med to Tamoxifen. My mom had to change due to the pain in her joints after 1.5 years, it only took me 6 ms to get to such pain levels I had cortisone injections yesterday in my hands. I am fed up with living half a life from the pain. It also causd me to gain 10 lbs even while going to the gym and sweating like crazy! Mom said it took only days for the pain to subside, I am so looking forward to that!",
