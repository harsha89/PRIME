    "Content": "Hi , I have suffered with pain since I woke up from surgery 20 months ago. I have tried a lot of types of treatments. I had nerve blocks, thorasic anethestia, and a spinal cord stimulator trial, for a grand total of 28 procedures. I have tried a lot of meds. I am currently on Butrans. I have been through 3 rounds of PT, yoga, massages, and chiropratic care. I am so frustrated that nothing will take it away. I really want to get on with my life. This was my second round of breast cancer in a 2 year period. Has anyone found something that works? Has anyone tried a pain pump for this injury? Any advice my fellow suffers?",
