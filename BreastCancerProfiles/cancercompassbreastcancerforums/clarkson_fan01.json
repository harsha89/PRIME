    "Content": "My mom has breast cancer, i gave up school to move back to the home town I hate, to take a job i am not proud of (cleaning) and dont make much money. I love my mom to bits and dont regret moving for her, but the stress is huge. My mom has chemo every 2 weeks and I have to drive her almost 3 hours one wayÂ to her appointments. I take care of her all the time, and honestly, IM STRESSED! Typically I can handle it, but in the last week, ive become so tired that I will sleep for 12+ hours and be up for like 6-8 hours then go back to sleep for 12+ hours again. I cant seem to keep a normal sleep schedual. I cant get up when i set alarms, and i dont know whats wrong.",
