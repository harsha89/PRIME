      "Content": "Hi I have been helping a friend of mine to with Hotchkins increase his pH. When we checked his pH it was found to be very acidic. In my search to help him I found Kangen water. It is a device that hooks upto your kitchen faucet. It produces what is called Kangen water and can be set with the touch of a button to a pH of 7.4, 8.5, 9.0 or 9.5. It also ionizes the water, producing a negative ORP (oxidation reduction potential)- meaning it is an antoxidant. By producing ionized and alkaline water, you are getting the water requirements that you need while alkalizing the body and drinking water with an antioxidizing effect. I think that this is a very important step in assisting the body to correct itself. You can find more information on Kangen water at www.kangenwaterreport.com I hope that you find this information helpful. If anyone else has heard of Kangen water and its uses, have you had any luck with it?",
