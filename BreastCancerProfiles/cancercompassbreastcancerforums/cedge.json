      "Content": "I had early stage breast cancer last year and mastectomy and was put onto anastrazole.  No node involvement and so no chemo etc  Side effects not too bad but my consultant decided I could try giving it up for a while to see if fatigue and general feeling of flu disappeared.  But after 2 weeks off the pill I feel even worse which is most worrying.  Lots of aches - though not really pain.  Anyone else come off this med and had a bad time??",

      "Content": "Thanks for your concern.  My symptoms are worse it seems HAVING BEEN OFF THE DRUG  for nearly 3 weeks and I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience.  My BC was stage 1 with no node involvement so my consultant is hjappy to let me stop it but WHY do I feel so poorly still and achey and such tension round neck and shoulders it is like burning pain at times though does not stop me sleeping (Only anxiety does that).  Not taking any painkillers or anything. ",
