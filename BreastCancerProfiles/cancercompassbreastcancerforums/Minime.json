      "Content": "Hi there I (38yrs) was wondering if anyone has a similar diagnoses like mine and what treatment/chemo they have received: pt1 n0 m0 1,2 cm. G-2 E+ 90%  P+ 90%  HERneu negativ. Ki-67 = 10% My GYN said that I probably will have FEC (CEF) chemo, but I'm really trying to avoid this one. Tomorrow I'll see the oncologist for the first time and than I guess I'll decide. I would rather do the CMF, because I hear it is not as harsh. Jen",

      "Content": " Hi I've had an infiltrating ductal tumor. And lumpectomy surgery. I've been told many times that I was very lucky that they have found it when they did. And if I had G1 instead of G2 I'd probably wouldn't need chemo. Since this is not the case, I guess chemo is the best option? I'm just curious, since I live in Germany and they recommend FEC, what treatment women in the states would get. I've heard many times, that your survival rate in the states is much higher than here. Guess one reason is, that breast cancer screening here starts at 50 :-(  Jen",
