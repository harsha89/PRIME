    "Content": "I was put on Aromasin after four years on Tamoxifen. After about 3 weeks I experienced very bad bone pain. I was taken off it and returned to Tamoxifen. I had a recurrence of Breast Cancer after four and a half years and again tried another aromatase inhibitor - with the same result. I was told it may be because I am peri menopausal, i.e have not fully gone through the menopause, which is why these drugs are not suitable. Hope this helps good luck",
