All was caught very early. Uterus I needed a total hysterectomy and Breast it was a 2.1mm had a lumpectomy and some radiation no big deal! The problem is I cant get cancer off my mind!! I now have to go for my first mammo since it all began! I still have to go for the colon test which I never had yet. The tests itself dont scare me its the results. I now think every test I have will turn out to be cancer!!! I know bad attitude!! I wish I can just be happy and not think my life is now shortened because all thats happened.  Mammograms are a waste of time and are dangerous. Here is a quote from a famous doctor who has cured over 30,000 cancer patients naturally: \"Every compression during a mammogram leads to microscopic ruptures of tissue, including the tumor tissue. This spreads the cancer and can lead to an early death. When the doctor manhandles a woman's breasts with hard pressure it can spread the cancer! The technician squeezes the woman's breast between the photographic plates with maximum compression that equals the weight of a 50 pound sandbag.....One animal study showed that manipulating a tumor increases the number of metastases by 80%, while a human study showed that women that had a mammogram have a 29% increase chance of dying of breast cancer than women who had never had one.\" (Dr. Leonard Coldwell) Mammograms have never been proven to prevent cancer or death, and each x-ray you have done increases your risk of abnormal cell growth. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reports that among women under 35, mammograms could cause far more cases of breast cancer than it identifies. A Canadian study found a 52 percent increase in breast cancer mortality in young women who had received annual mammograms. \"Mammograms are literally squeezing the life out of women\" (Dr. Leonard Coldwell)",

In many cases it's the minority who are right and the majority who are wrong. Mammograms make money off women, and they increase the risk of breast cancer.",

I tried going on another forum and asking this question but no one answered me....so I found this website and I'm hoping someone will have some insight!   Anways...My mom is 53 years old and she recently had her yearly mammogram and they called her back for more pictures because there was a small area that was suspicious. So she got her other pictures done and the radiologist ended up talking to her and basically just saying \"I'm 95% sure this is benign but the other 5%...I'm not sure about. So I want you to get a biopsy.\" She then talked to the doctor performing the biopsy and she said she felt strongly that this was benign, which is good and then what they were seeing on the mammogram is calcifications. She ended up getting her biopsy last week and she forgot to stop taking advil (you're not supposed to take it 5 days before a procedure like that because it can make you bleed) and ended up bleeding a lot because of not stopping the advil and the doctor doing the procedure knicked an artery or something like that. She ended up having to go to the hospital to stop the bleeding but knock on wood everything's been fine after that. Kind of one of those weird rare things. I'm a constant worrier. Two of her friends actually had the same thing happen to them and their doctors both told them they were 80% sure that it was benign and both ended up being fine. I'm just nervous because everyones different. I worry about everything. And this is no exception. I'm really nervous my mom has breast cancer and something horrible is gonna happen. Basically what I'm trying to get at here is...should I be this worried about it? I understand it's normal to be a little worried...but I'm really a wreck here. I also see that she's a little nervous and that makes me nervous but the only reason she's super nervous is that she has a ton going on (she's getting a divorce). She gets her results tomorrow but the waiting is killing both of us...but once again...am I worrying too much? Mammograms are a waste of time. Here is a quote from a famous doctor: \"Every compression during a mammogram leads to microscopic ruptures of tissue, including the tumor tissue.

      "Content": "It's predicted that cancer will strike 1 in 2 men and over 1 in 3 women around the world in their lifetime. Although these statistics are shocking, the fact is that many doctors and hospitals, and all pharmaceutical companies, would lose hundreds of billions of dollars each and every year if they found a cure for cancer. (Dr. Leonard Coldwell) The governments and drug companies have known about natural cancer cures for a very long time. However, in medical school, doctors are taught to believe that natural cures are quackery. So even doctors are being brainwashed. The real criminals are the governments and drug companies who are deliberately hiding the truth about natural cancer cures and are harming people with chemo and radiation for financial gain. Most people are not aware of this, but every time a doctor or scientist successfully cured their cancer patients using natural treatments, the drug companies and medical profession did all in their power to destroy the doctor's reputation by labelling him a quack or a fraud. And some of these doctors have even been jailed. If you find this hard to believe, watch a video on YouTube called \"A World Without Cancer.\" Because of the internet, the big-wigs, governments, and drug companies know the word is spreading about the wonders of natural cures. So they are now trying to pass laws to make these natural cures illegal. They know that if they do nothing, eventually the majority of people will discover the truth. Their goal is to basically get these natural cancer cures out of the market before the truth becomes widespread. I urge you to look up Dr. Leonard Coldwell on YouTube and watch his videos. He will give you free information on all these natural cures that are cheap and effective. At least hear him out before you make a judgment. He has saved thousands of lives. I am sharing this information so that more lives can be saved. Good luck, and may the God of heaven be praised for his natural cures.",
