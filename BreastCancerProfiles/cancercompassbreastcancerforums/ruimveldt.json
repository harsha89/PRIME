      "Content": "My 78 year old mom was diagnosed in 2007 with ER/PR, HER-2/neu negative left breast cancer. Left masectomy, chemo and radiation was done. 2013 she came down with a cough and shortness of breath. Lung fluid resulted in cancer cells which showed a reversal of former test, ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu positive. She now has recurrent breast cancer in bones, lung and liver. If this is recurrent, why is it a reversal, could there have been a mistake somewhere, even doctor finds this interesting?",
