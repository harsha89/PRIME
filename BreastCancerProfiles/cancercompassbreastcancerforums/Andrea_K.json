      "Content": "Hi my name is Andrea in 2002 I had a double mastectomy by choice and had cancer in 5 lymph nodes. It would be Breast cancer in the lymphnodes not lymphoma. Find out what stage your cancer was and how many nodes were positive then sign up for your course of chemo. I have 8 months chemo and 7 weeks of radiation. Breast cancer can metastisize to other areas that is why chemo is important. Get a book on helping you through this process so you can be well educated in your treatment options. I'm still well and healthy it has been 2 years. Andrea",
