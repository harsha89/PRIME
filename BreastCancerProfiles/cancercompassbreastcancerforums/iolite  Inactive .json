      "Content": "My sister is on the drugs and I will talk to her and find out exactly which ones she is on.  She has yet to tell me what kind of cancer she has but I do know that the drs. beleive it was brought on by the radiation she received when she was 14 & 16 yrs old due to her having hodgkins desease and the cancer is aggressive.  She is a 34yr survival story.  30 yrs ago the radiation was not what it is today.  She was diagnosed with the breast cancer 2 yrs. ago and underwent a mastectomy of the left breast and the cancer came back in her scar and she also has another small lump that has surfaced.  Her petscans are all clear with the exception of her left chest.  Yet the combo of the drugs she is taking seems to be working.  We are keeping the faith.  I will get back to you with the combo she is on.  Helene",

      "Content": "Hi, just to let you know that you are not alone in this matter.  My younger sister was diagnosed at 14 with Hodkins and received cobalt at 14 & 16 yrs. She was caught at a later stage and the drs. said they would not be able to cure it but possibaly put it to \"Sleep\", well they did and it slept for 24 yrs.  She is now 46yrs. old and fighting breast cancer with oral chemo since the drs do not want to give her more chemo.  She had chemo at the age of 18 for a reacurance of hodgkins, and that put it to sleep for 24 yrs.  It awoke at 42 yrs.  She proceeded to have more chemo, and it was good for a year and then popped up again....another round of chemo again...clear for a year and then the breast cancer was diagnosed a being cause by having had the massive radiation treatments done to her at the age of 14 & 16 yrs old.  They did not want to give more chemo via the port, due to the face that she is now also a cardiac patient due to the chemo.  She had a mastectomy on the one breast and the cancer came back in her scar and there was another lump as well, they decided to do oral chemo as a last ditch effort, it is working, the scar has completely healed and the other lump is almost gone.  She is going to be taking updated radiation after the 6 units of the oral treatments in hopes of kicking the cancer out of her.  Your stories sounded so alike I wanted to let you know you were not alone with this.  If I can answer any questions just let me know.  I too am fighting lobular BC, was diagnosed last June and had only a lumpectomy since I was only a stage 1.  All is good, taking tomaxafin for the next 5 yrs.  Have a very blessed day.",
