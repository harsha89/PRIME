      "Content": "Hey everyone, I've posted once already about my mom having breast cancer. We don't know how far along she is, but two things are for sure: 1) she will need surgery to remove the cancer (obviously) and 2) she will need chemo afterward because of the large size of the lump. She is quite upset about the prospect of losing her hair. She says she just grew it out long enough to \"play with\" and now she's going to lose it all. I know the chemo is at least 2 months away (possibly more, depending on how long the wait for surgery will be), but I'm already thinking of ways to support her. I figured that we could lose our hair together. When she shaves her head (which she will probably do or else her hair will come out in clumps from what I've read), I want to do that with her. What does everyone think of this? Do you think this is a good way to show my support for her and to convince her that she'll be beautiful in my eyes whether she has hair or not?",

      "Content": "I am not in the USA, but Canada, so waiting lists are a mainstay. Now that I have more information, I know my mother is either in stage 2 or 3 of her cancer. She has yet to get her limphnodes checked to see if it is present there. I am staying strong for her. As for my grandmother, she is no longer with us, but she didÂ  manage to survive 20 years more than the doctors said she would, so she's a source of inspiration.",

      "Content": "Yeah, waiting lists are terrible. I'm sure that she will be on a high priority list because of the cancerous nature of the tumour, but who knows? Usually the people with more advanced cancers have priority, so we'll see. She is dealing with the news very well and is set to meet a doctor on Wednesday to book a potential surgery date and make a plan of attack (dealing with whether or not she'll get chemo and radiation afterward, how the surgery will proceed, etc.). She is almost 50 (49 this year) and I hope she can beat this. She's strong and has a good support system too. All I can do is be there for her.",

      "Content": "My mom has recently been diagnosed with cancer. We don't know what stage it is yet, but we know that the lump is 3.5cm and my mom's family has a terrible track record with breast cancer. Her grandmother died from it, my grandma (her mom) nearly did too. I'm worried. Is 3.5cm large for a tumour? And, more importantly, how long are the waiting lists for operations? I just don't want to sit around twiddling my thumbs waiting for her cancer to get worse...",
