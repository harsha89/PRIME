      "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after i was born about 21 years ago. She went in and out of remission and in the meantime it has spread to her lungs. She has several tumors there, that she is currently undergoing chemo therapy for. The doctor has said she will be doing chemo the rest of her life, recently we found out there is 3 spots in her bones. How serious is this, what kind of effect will this have on her. She is a strong woman and a fighter, and seems to be doing fine, other than dealing with being tired. Her cancer is at the latest stage and has been for a number of years now. I am scared I dont know what to expect? We know it is slow spreading but the tumors are remaining about the same size do to her chemo treatment. What does the bone cancer mean now? Any insight would be appreciated. ",

      "Content": "There is hope, my mom has had cancer for 21 years now. It has been stage 4 for around 10 years now, I am not exactly sure. Her breast cancer spread to her lungs, and we recently found it in her bones. She has been in and out of remission 4 times. She is currently undergoing chemo on and off, and is still going strong. Its hard to figure out how long one may have. 10-15  years ago her doctor told her she had a few years maybe...now look shes still alive and strong. ",

      "Content": "Hey, yeah I am not sure what my mom is on, I cant remember, I know she has been on pretty much every chemo there is, the doctor said if this stops working then hes not sure what he will do, its kinda working the tumors arent getting smaller but they arent getting a lot bigger either, I like this site, its hard to talk about this with my family, for a lot of reasons. My mom is still wroking but having a hard time, she has a hard time breathing and is really tired, shes been on this round of chemo for like 7 or 8 months now which is the longest she has ever been on it. We just now know its spreading and im not sure what kind of effect it will have on her since its in her bones now, we know that she has a lot of cracked ribs for just doing simple stuff. Im only 21 and im just scared to lose her, but i dont know when or how or what. Everything she has is inoperable cuase there are so many of them in her lungs. What is the survival rate at this point any idea? ",

      "Content": "Hey Amy,      You asked about my what my mom was on. She is taking Taxol and Gensar, ( I think thats how you spell it, taxol is short for something) not sure which one but one is a lung cancer chemo, but its supposed to work well when mixed to help breastcancer. They doctor called my mom the other day, and they are going to start these injections in her when she does chemo to help her bones. They are doing a tumor marker next week to see what the tumors are doing. Keep us in your prayers.  Ryan  ",

      "Content": "Hey, I have never talk to her doctor, my mom has invited me to go with her to chemo and talk to him but I cant do it, too hard, and im only home twice a year to see her, so i dont have a lot of opportunites, I will find out what she is taking, I know shes taking a breast/lung cancer chemo, its like 2 different kinds where she goes one week and takes the two and goes back next week and takes the second does of the other. She has been to a few other specialist but her Dr is using the latest stuff, most of the stuff is pretty new, since in the 21 years she has gone through most everything else. Its hard to talk to her because she will have a hard time breathing because of the tumors. Her doctor is supposed to call today to let her know what the gameplan is now that he knows its spreading, slowly but still spreading. Thank you for talking with me this is helping a lot. ",
