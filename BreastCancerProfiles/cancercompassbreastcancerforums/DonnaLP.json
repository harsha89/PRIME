Thanks, worry wort? Please, please, push for more tests.  There is a breast cancer that presents with the symptoms that you just described.  It is called Inflammatory Breast Cancer, it is aggressive and often misdiagnosed.  This cancer presents with changes in your nipple and skin, redness and swelling in the breast.  Very difficult to diagnose with Mammogram.  I am very familiar with the symtoms of this cancer because I was diagnosed with it March 2007,  It could very well be nothing, I finished radiation 5 months ago and I am still having issues, mine tend to be more itching and redness, but it can be annoying. Thanks Donna LP",
