    "Content": "I'm going in for my lumpectomy and possible lymph node removal on Friday, October 2.    After healing, I'll probably start chemo and radiation.   Starting to think about bras, hair loss, etc.   My cancer is triple negative, and I feel there's less written about it than other types.     Any advice you offer on the following issues is greatly appreciated. ~ If you had triple negative, what was your chemo/radiation plan (medicines, timing of chemo, etc.)? ~ What type of bra worked best with the port and lumpectomy?  Should I buy a size larger? ~ My career is in training.  I'm in front of others often...and those who know what I look like.    I need to create a plan to tranistion into a wig so that I have less drama/staring/fewer noticing.  How did you transition into wig? ~ Do you have suggestions on wigs?  Natural, remy, synthetic?  Type of cap?  Other necessary special supplies (brush, etc.)?    How many wigs did you have?  What did you sleep in?   How did you still feel pretty? Thanks for your help.",
