      "Content": "Hi - I just had the implant exchange after tissue expanders.. it's been 6 weeks. For the most part they look good, but my skin is thin and there is rippling.  My surgeon said that there's nothing much I can do because I am petite and my skin is thin.  Has anyone had this, and is there a way to fix it?   I think I may be overreacting, but maybe now everything is starting to hit me.. I have been very positive during the whole experience of double mastecomy and chemo. I am 37 yr old. Thanks, Julie  ",
