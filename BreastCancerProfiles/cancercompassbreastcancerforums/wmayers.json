I have gained 30 lbs I have now been dx with Fibromyalgia and the pain is very extreme to which I can barely walk at the end of the day. I am having trouble getting the weight off with the medication I am on. I do go swimming but not much strength for any thing else. Can you suggest any thing to help me. They told me Chemo fried my nerve endings and I have no cartlege left in my knee I am a 43 yr old female. and really just want my life back, I used to bike 15 miles a week and go to the gym twice a week, and now I can barely make it thru a 8 hr shift at work.
