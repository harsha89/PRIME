I cannot believe that this drug could be good for those who have osteoarthritis and I also have lichens sclerosis which has flared 3 times in 6 months.  Had not had flares for over a year prior to Femara.  Is it worth it?  I am thinking it isn't. Long term effects are not known on any of the aromatase inhibitors so another drug company money maker but not knowing what happens after your 5-10 year dosage.",
