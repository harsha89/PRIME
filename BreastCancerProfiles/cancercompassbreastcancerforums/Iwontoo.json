    "Content": "I had DCIS and had 40+ radiation treatments.  I remember them telling me that a possible side effect from all the radiation was more brittle bones/ribs.  They said I was more prone to breaking them...My head was spinning at the time with tons of worries but I do recall thinking my football playing days were over!  Take care.  It all gets better.  I've been free and clear for 5 years.",
