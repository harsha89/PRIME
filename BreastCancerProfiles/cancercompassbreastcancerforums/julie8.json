      "Content": "Thanks ... I appreciate your response.  I know that Arimidex is the best for HER/2 positive cancer so I am trying to stick with it ... but will ask Dr. when I see him next week.  Is your physical therapy helping?  I hope so.  I maybe going that route too - Dr. mentioned it - but wanted to run the MRI and bone scans first.  I get those results back next week. Was your breast cancer HER/2 positive?  Has yours metastasized? Mine was very small 8mm,  but invasive ... but nothing in lymph nodes and clear margins on lumpectomy site but grade 3, onco  med was a 32 and my HER/2 is also a grade 3 ... nasty little thing and I don't want it back!! I also did mamo-site radiation. I am so on the fence of whether I really need the  Arimidex. Again - thanks for your reply.",

      "Content": "I have been taking Arimidex for 11 months - the joint and bone pain is getting worse.  My question for any of you out there who have had joint / bone pain from Arimidex and have stopped taking Arimidex -  has your joint and bone pain improved or has the damage been done and you are still experiencing the same difficulties with the pain as you were when you stopped taking it?  I am trying to stick it out - I am HER/2 positive and really want to take it for the full 5 years,  and will for a while longer  IF when I so stop  the symptoms will reverse.  If they don't reverse I am not sure how much  more I want to take before I switch to something else.  Thanks!",

      "Content": "A big factor in my decision would be based on the fact of whether you are HER/2 positive or not. If it were me - which it was 2 years ago - I was onco dx 32, estrogen postitive, AND HER/2 positive(nasty thing to be) I did go through chemo and 52 weeks of Herceptin... and am taking Arimidex for 5 years. My tumor (no family hist.) was 8mm - part invasive - lumpectomy, mammo-site radiation - clear margins. If you are Her/2 negative, that would be a harder decision. Have you read Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book? A helpful source ... especially when it comes to calculating \"absolute benefit.\" Although chemo was extremely difficult for me I am sure glad being HER/2 positive I hit it hard a fast. I don't want the stuff back ... If you trust your Dr. I'd go with his advise - he sees more of it than we do! ... and good luck!",
