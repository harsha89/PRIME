      "Content": "Davina, You are in my prayers.  I am 39 and a mother of 4, youngest is 9.  I don't have cancer but my mom might have a recurrence.  Biopsy tomorrow.  I can imagine how scared you are right now being diagnosed with stage VI.  I never heard of that.  Thought there was only I, II, III and IV.  You sound like you've been through a lot in your life.  Honestly, going through this with my mom right now is the first \"BIG\" thing I've ever had to deal with.  You sound scared but your outlook on the situation and your trust in the Lord is inspiring.  Believing that if He brings you to it HE will bring you through it.  No matter what happens He has you in His hands and has ultimately only the best in store for you and your family. Keep faith.  Try to stay positive. I'll be praying for you. Tracy        ",

      "Content": "  Oh Hana, Please know I will be praying for you and your mom.  I'm praying so much now and I'm happy to add you in.  I may be a stranger to you but I'm always hearing how every bit of prayer helps no matter where it comes from.  My mom was here yesterday and about four times she got a stabbing pain in her left knee that made her yell out OW!  I got scared because I had the same thought you did about it coming in to her bone or joint.  I'm going with her wednesday for the biopsy of the mass below her collar bone.  I shake too, every morning before I take the anti depressant my dr prescribed.  I went to her a few days after my mom showed me the lump.  (Because I was becoming a wreck and I have my 4 kids to take care of - I also wanted to ask her questions about stage III cancer.)  Never been on medication before but that, and the sleeping pills she prescribed, have been a godsend. (even though the sleeping pills took many days to start working).  I need to be strong for my mom whatever it takes.  She doesn't even know the details I know or that I know them.  I want her to just see me smiling and acting normal because if she see's how concerned I really am she will get upset and more scared.    If you get a minute please let me know what the oncologist recommended.  Stay strong. You're in my prayers. Tracy    ",

      "Content": "Michelle and Hana, I am so sorry that you are going through this also.  My mom will be having a biopsy soon on a mass in her pectoral muscle area above where she had a lumpectomy just over 10 years ago.  She was stage III then (4 lymph nodes found positive for cancer) and had 9 months of chemo and radiation.  I've got a really bad feeling.  My research and a talk with my doctor has made me aware that for the stage she was at ten years ago it's incredible that she's still around this long.   I wasn't (and I know she isn't) aware of that fact so this is kind of surreal  We had been thinking that because it had been so long she was hopefully cured, not that her time, her \"lucky streak\" was running out.  I don't want to tell her what I've learned and I feel helpless as I wait for her to find out from her doctors too. She showed me the lump 1/3.  I can't believe this is happening. Best wishes to you and your moms.  ",
