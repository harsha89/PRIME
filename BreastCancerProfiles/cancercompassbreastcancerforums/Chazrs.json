    "Content": "Hello.  I would like to have a somewhat specific answer to an annoying question:  I am 48, non-smoker, I have Paget's Disease: an agressive type of Breast Cancer, 2 cm, mastecomy of left breast 3/13/08, removing 18 lymph nodes; chemo finished in April 08, began 6 wks radiation 2 weeks ago and ct scan indicated a 1.4 cm hypodense structure adjacent to the distal ascending aorta and esophagus which may represent an enlarged lymph node.  Images of the mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. I asked my oncologist what that would be and how we can \"fix\" it and he recommended a pet scan (whole body). The results came back normal.  Yeah!  BUT, scan also indicated a hypodensity near the distal esophagus and aorta noted on CT study is not metabolically active.  I inquired both oncologists for further information concerning the hypodensity and 1st treating my cancer w/ chemo said it's nothing.  2nd treating my cancer w/ radiation said it was a grandular.  That his whole body has them.  My question is:  What is a hypodensity near the distal esophagus and aorta and is there a cause for alarm?  Please note:  If I hadn't of pushed the unanswered question concerning my breast nipple leaking last June 07 and pushed why I wasn't healing w/ my primary after the mammo in Sept. 07 came back normal ... I, my family wouldn't have discovered the Stage 2 cancer in Nov. 07 after another mammo/ultrasound was performed. So you can see the reason for my insistance! Any information will be helpful and appreciated. Thank you.",
