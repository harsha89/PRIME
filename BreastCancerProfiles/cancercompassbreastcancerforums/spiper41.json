I have estrogen positive breast cancer being treated now with hormone therapy, just started, its my fifth day on Tamoxafin and Zoladex injection. It seems like every one has had surgery, any one in the same boat as me? The doctors say this treatment is very successful.I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast CA 2 years ago with mets to liver and surface of one lung. Surgery wasn't an option for me either. I have been on Arimidex ever sincev with relatively few side effects and really good results. One of the liver tumors has disappeared, another is barely visiblen and the largest one has shrunk dramatically. The surface of my lung appeared quite lumpyn and that has smoothed out quite a bit. My tumor markers, never very much above normal came down immrdiately and have stayed there. My oncologist tells me that he thinks the Arimidex will work for me for many years. The worst part has been really horrible hot flashes. He put me on a clonidine patch 3 months ago, and that has brought the hot flashes down to a tolerable level. I feel very lucky not to have the extreme side effects that some people get, as well as lucky to be getting such good results. I hope you will do as well as I have.",
