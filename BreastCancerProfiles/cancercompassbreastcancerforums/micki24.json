      "Content": "My mom died three months ago. Should I be OK? Should I be acting like nothing happen, that I didn't lose the person who gave life to me, the person who made me who I am today, the person who was a strong presence in my life. I am not sure what I am looking for, comfort, sympathy or just some understanding of how to handel the greiving process. My mom lived with me for over 19 years in her own living quarters. She was independent and strong.  Even though I was married and lived in the same house, she was my best friend. When the doctors gave up on her because of her age and cancer stage, I refuse to give up on finding a way to extend her life. I feel that the doctors gave up on her. In my heart I know they did, she had stage four cancer and the chemo did not stop the tumors from growing and eventually her body started shutting down and there was nothing I could of done to prevent that from happening. I remember  her crying when she was told that surgery and radiation was not an option. And my mom never cried, she was tough and when I saw her cry, it broke my heart and I waned so bad to do something to make her crying stop and to ease her pain. I would of change places with her just so she can be happy. I would of gave my life for my mom. I miss my mom every day.  But lately I can not seem to control when the tears will flow, I can be on the bus, train, in a store in my house, at work, and I get this overwhelming sense of sadness and with that comes the tears, and I feel terrible and hollow. My mom would not want me to be emotional, she would want me to be strong and I am strong. But lately my heart hurts when I realized that she is truely gone. I know she lives in my heart but it dosen;t ease the pain of missing her, of coming home every night and seeing her sitting at the window porthole waiting for for me, or leaving the front porch light for me. i miss calling her everyday and letting her know my whereabouts, so she won;t not worry about me. I miss shopping for food and items with her. I miss talking to her every day about anything and everything.  She was the ancor in my life and I will be OK cause that is what she taught me to be and I so grateful for that because It will makes me a survivor no mater what, but the lost of her not being in my life is gut wretching. My mom died 10 days before her 80th birthday, I have past good friday, easter, mothers day, my older brother's birthday, memorial day and fourth of july, there are still other special day to come, I am so terrified of thanksgiving and christmas and how I will feel. I know I will be Ok but the thought of those days to come still scared me.",
