    "Content": "Hi Larry, Thanks for sharing your story and I am really sorry to hear about your wife. Although my mom is a bit older at age 60, her story seems so similar to that of your wives. She was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer a couple/few years ago and since it has metast. to several places including bone, liver, brain. A couple of weeks ago they did another brain MRI because of my mom's complaints that she was dizzy and her walking was getting worse. The MRI report (that I read) indicated meningeal carcin... but her oncologist seems to think that because those reports are so hard to read as someone here indicated, he needs to diagnose based on her symptoms, which lead him to believe she probably does not have this. I just don't understand. The frustrating thing for me is that if she only has a few months to live I want to be with her (I live in another state). But her onc. gives me little information. He also says that treatment is not worth it and does not recommend finding out via spinal tap if it is or it isn't because the treatment for it is not worth it. But I listen to some of the stories and think he might be wrong... J",
