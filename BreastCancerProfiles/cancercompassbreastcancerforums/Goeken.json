      "Content": "Hello Liz p, Thank you so much for the great information about your breast abscess. Mine has been draining since April 5, 2006 and I am having home health care come in to repack and redress my wound each day. You said that at first you had a surgery to clean out the infection. I never had that. My surgeon came to the emergency room and did a minor surgery there - cut open the break through more so he could remove a lot of the infection, then he left it open, packed it with packing gauze, covered it with a gauze pad, and sent me home. I am also intrigued about your \"VAC\". My wound is still draining, but not as much as before. They are now placing some ointment in my wound to help dry up the secretions, so the good breast tissue can come through. I have an appointment with my radiologist in May,but he is aware of what happened because I called and told him. I was never told that radiation could have caused this. If you don't mind, I would like to keep in contact with you about this. It just makes me feel so much better to know that I have a friend that understands what I am going through. Thank you so much!! Love ya Goeken",

      "Content": "So glad to hear that I am not alone with this breast abscess. How long did it actually take for yours to heal. Mine also broke through my incision site and am now having home health care come in daily to clean and repack my wound. How awful! Did you see a specialist about your abscess? I know this happened over a year ago for you, but hopefully you will still get my message. Thanks, Goeken",
