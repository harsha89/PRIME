      "Content": "My wife has also been operated for breast cancer and she had to pass to chemo therapy as well. It was a worst condition as chemo has many side effects but it is unavoidable to complete. With the proper foodI started giving her hemp oil which is a great source of high-quality nutrients. This is not an alternative for chemo or any other cancer surgery. This will help her recover fast after treatment without any side effects. I found CW hemp oil effective for my wife.",
