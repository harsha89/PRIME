    "Content": "This is a video of an flash mob dance we organized at my hospital to celebrate survivorship. It was so inspiring to be there and I wanted to share it with all of you. The dance was a surprise that a group of survivors and caregivers planned and practiced, and lots of people who were at the event were really surprised when we just busted out dancing. Several women who danced are stage 4, and some are still in primary treatment. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETiL4NPJE-g",
