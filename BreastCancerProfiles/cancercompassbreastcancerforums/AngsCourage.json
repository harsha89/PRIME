My hips and legs have hurt for weeks now I thought it was the Neaulasta I have been off of that for 3 weeks. I just started my Taxal last Thursday was my first I will be going weekly until April 19, so 11 more treatments. I will ask my doctor on Thursday she is awesome and will tell me exactly whats going on.Â ",

      "Content": "I was wondering if anyone else finished with chemo then their hair started growing back it's been 4 months my hairs about 2.5 inches.. Now I have a bald spot? Back of my head. Is it from chemo?(residual) is it like a newborn they go bald from rubbing? Is it possibly a whole new issue? I called my family doc. I can't seem to get in there! Do I call my onc? Do I let it go wait it out? I am emotionally wrecked about it. So thank you for thoughts and opinions:)",
