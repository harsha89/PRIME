      "Content": "Hi I am going through the same stuff but what i have inderstood from my surgery was,,,, I had a double masectomy which they took all the nodes on the right and one on the left and 3 were positive out of the 8 that were tested, so they wanted to do chemo for precaution due to the nodes invloved and radiation due to the size of the cancer in the tumor which was 4 cm so the critiria I have been told for chemo and radiation is if there is more that 4 nodes involved and the cancer in the tumor is 5 cm or bigger. I hope this helps tammy",

      "Content": "Hi Elaine, I had a double masectomy on April 28th and I have been doing great. I have not had much pain for 5 days now I havent even taken my tylenol so I think I am doing well, the first week after surgery I was driving and drove myself down to Mexico and stayed there for 5 days and drove back, I had done a little to much in Mexico and was a little tired for a few days after, since then I have drove back to Mexico again and done very well i do get tired easy but the pain has been getting better everyday. I empty the dishwasher for my theropy and make sure I use both arms as the right one they took all the lymph nodes out of so that really is where most of the pain is the left one is doing great. Today for the first time I vacumed and have been feeling great since. I make myself do stuff do to the muscles need to be moved or it will hurt more trying to get them to move later. Well I pray everyday and know that God is right by my side and helping me out, I have a great attitude and am truley loving life even though I have cancer I cant let it get me down.. You can do it Elaine and you are going to be feeling better everyday!! I know it. Take care and God Bless you Tammy",
