      "Content": "Sue, I went ahead with the surgrey this morning. I really home i did the right thing. After doing hours of reseach last night i found out that lymph nodes fight off infection and swell when they are trying to fight off the infection. i talked to the surgeon about it and he told me that he aleady decided he was going to remove the lump behind my nipple before deciding whether or not to remove the lymph node as well. From what i do remember after talking to him he didnt remove the lymph node. i pray that is a good sign. I was so out of it when i came to i dont remember half of what he said. Befor having the surgrey he did explain to me that if it ws filled with pus thn it meant it was just an infection, he would drain and clean it without removing. As crazy as this sounds i was praying for pus, however the bad news is there wasnt any and he removed the lump. Now i get to sit and wait. My poor son cried his eyes out today thinking the doctors were taking his mommy away. I should have never brought him there. I have prepared myself for the worse. After all the reseach i did i spent another hour reading about reconstruction surgrey and had a conversation with my finace about getting married as soon as possible if the results come back with nothing but bad news. Maybe he is right and i shouldnt be thinking the way i am or worrying about the worse case scenerio but i cant help it. I have always thought it was rediculous and never understood why people get married for insurance purposes up until now. To top it all off i live upstairs from a very young couple who knows what i am going through, knew i had surgrey today and has spent the entire day making as much noise as they can making it impossible for me to rest. They are two of the most spitefull people i have ever met in my life. This town is full of them. I had to call the police 3 times and landlord 4 with the end result being There is no law against spitefullness. I live in Jamestown, NY. It's the worst part of New York. Most of the population is full of young thugs who either sell or do drugs and have a nasty attitude. My landlord told us he will move us to a new place if thats what we want but i dont understand why he doesnt just get rid of them. The entire neighborhood wants them out but there is nothing we can do.  Thank you very much for all your kind words. It really does help to have other people to talk to who know exactly what you are going through. Best of Luck to you, Noel    ",

      "Content": "Sue,  We met with the landlord Saturday and talked to him about it. He left us the keys to go look at the place so hopefully tomorrow. Sunday night i got my son back, when we got home it was pretty late. We played with him for bit before going to bed and the scumbags downstairs had the nerve to start pounding on the walls because we were being too loud for them. I couldnt believe it, all weekend they did everything they could to prevent me from being able to rest. I used the opportunity to give them a taste of there own medicine. I started slamming the doors and jumping on the floor and being as loud as i could. Sure enough the police came, i told them what was going on, what they did to me and how i was told by the police that spitefullnes is not against the law so the cop said as long as it cant be heard outside where its bothering others have at it i dont blame you a bit. For the next hour or so i started slamming every door in my house every few minutes making it impossible for them to sleep. Serves them right. To think i am also telling my son not to run or jump on the floor, that wont ever happen again. In any case, Monday i made an appointment to go back to the surgeon. They set it up for the 17th so i thought everything must be ok or they wouldnt wait so long. Today the surgeon called me personally asking me to come in to his office as soon as possible. Obviously it cant be good news. I dont understand why he couldnt just tell me over the phone. He must know he already has me thinking the worst. Well i guess i will have to just wait till tomorrow to find out. I will not be sleeping tonight. I thought after the surgrey all the symptoms i was having would have gone away because he removed the lump. Last night i started experiencing the same itching, burning, and pins and needles feeling i was having before the surgrey. I took the bandage off today to take a shower and there was a bunch of pus coming out of my nipple and the wound is either still bleeding or its coming from my nipple. It's been 5 days since the surgrey and its stitched up so how can it still be bleeding? Another thing that has me worried is that i am now experiencing alot of itching on my right breast as well. I looked at it today and my entire breast is nothing but dry and scally skin. I am sure its nothing and i am worrying to much. Its just weird because i dont have dry skin anywhere but my right breast. In any case i am going to bring that up to him tomorrow as well. Have a great night! Best wishes, Noel",
