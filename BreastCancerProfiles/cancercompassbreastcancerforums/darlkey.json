    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with Breast Cancer already in stage 3. The core biopsy results say invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 3 with no definite lymphovascular invasion seen. That was 3 months ago. My doctor sent me to an oncologist and I was recommended for neo-adjuvant chemo treatment to reduce the size of the already 8 cm lump before surgery. The doctor said he has to remove both breast even if the other breast is not affected yet. Then radio therapy for a month after surgery. I have no medicare, no medical insurance, and I live in the Philippines where cancer treatment is very expensive. The bottom line is I can't afford the suggested treatments and I'm looking into alternative remedies which I have been reading about a lot. I sometimes get into awful depressions and the doctor said it's quite natural. I look healthy and feel okay most times, but I have aches and pains on my shoulder, my arm down to my elbow and midway to my wrist. I bleed a lot, after I shower, and when my clothes rub into my breast, and when I'm sleeping when I accidentally lie on the side of the affected breast. I can handle the pain better than I can handle the bleeding. I will appreciate suggestions, informations on how to cope with my condition, and input about alternative cancer treatment. I have read a lot about the Budwig Protocol, so has anyone tried that?",
