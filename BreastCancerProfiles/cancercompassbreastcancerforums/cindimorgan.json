    "Content": "My 70 year old grandmother was diagnosed with lung and breast cancer a couple of months ago. She does not want any treatment and she was given 3 months to live which she has surpassed. But, still my mom and I really worried about her condition, so we contacted one of the staff of the placidway and they already set an appointment to our doctor. She had upped her pain meds quite a bit since she has been in palliative care, but we have not seen a physical decline in her health. Obviously it is specific to the individual, but how long can someone live in this condition? I have never had a relative get cancer before, so I do not know what to expect.",
