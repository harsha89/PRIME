    "Content": "My husband has cancer in his chest that spread to his spine. His white blood count was low due to the chemo and I started him on MGN-3. I have to admit that while taking this vitamin he did not have to take the recommended shots to build up his white cell count. When we ran out of the MGN-3, he did have to go back on the shots between chemo sessions. Our Dr. doesn't think that these products are any better than regular over the counter vitamins. My opinion is that they are better and I have reordered them. My daughter told me about MGN-3 when a friend of hers took them while under treatment for an inoperable tumor attached to her aorta. They helped her and I decided it was worth it to give them a try. It was a good decision as far as I am concerned. They gave my husband 6 to 8 weeks to live. It is now 8 months later and he is better than ever.",
