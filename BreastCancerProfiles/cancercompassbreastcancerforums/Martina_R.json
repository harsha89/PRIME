      "Content": "I am a 4 year breast cancer survivor. The best way to prevent lymphedema is to avoid salty foods including junk food, try to eat a low sodium diet, and exercise regularly. By following these priniciples they have prevented me from expereincing lymphedema. Also, it is a good idea to get a custom made compression glove and sleeve. The best exercise that seems to do the trick of keeping lymphedema at bay is an ellipitcal machine (ellipitical cross trainer). Whenever I use it, I noticed a reduction in any edema in a matter of one hour after use this machine. Also, it helps to tone the arms much better than any treadmill. You can by an ellipitical machine at Sears for about 500 or less at Sears. If there is a sale, then you can get one for as little as $300.00.",
