My breast cancer went to my lungs and mediastinal glands Oct 07. I had radiation to the lungs and hormonal treatment.I am oest+ and prog + but hercepton -.Originally I had invasive ductal carcenoma grade 3 to my left btrteast. My CT scans have been clear all 2008. I am wondering how long the hormonal treatment is effective for? Was on Zolodex before I had an oopherectomy and now only on Arimidex. Would love to hear from someone with similar situation. I was diagnosed in Feb.2007 with stage four breast cancer. I had never had abnormal mammograms or ultra sounds. It took awhile to figure out that is was even breast cancer, since the MRI'S showed only normal breast tissue. I had \"Indian File\" breast cancer cells in my stomach and in the bones, where bone marrow had previously been. My spine and sternum were badly affected also. I did not need any breast surgery, but had rapidly become more and more ill in the month of tests to try to diagnose the cancer type. (The scope of the stomach and the biopsy's finally gave us a certain diagnosis. First I had radiation on the spine and sternum. Then I began Femara and Arredia infusions. For the past 10 months my bones have shown no cancer, and my stomach scope's and biopsy's are completely normal. I live in Atlanta, and went to M.D. Anderson for my 2nd opinion, and they agreed totally with my doctor's here. This treatment plan has certainly produced great results for me. The Femara cause fatigue and joint pain, but it is working! I had a scope on the stomach in December, it was all fine, and will have a nuclear scan on the bones in one month to see if they are still clear. I had adjusted to having chronic cancer, and was stunned to hear I was in complete remission. Like you, I wonder how long the Femara will work. My doctor has one woman who has been on it for 9 years! We must stay positive, and really take care of ourselves. I exercise, and have reduced as much stress as I can. Good Luck, and God Bless you Barb!",
