      "Content": "My sister just had this test done and it indicated that radiation alone would be enough for treatment.  However, the test is so new, there is a little trepidation about trusting the results.   From my understanding, this test has only JUST become available so nothing on the message boards about how comfortable people are with the results.  Anyone out there had this test?  What do you think?",

      "Content": "  Hi, She had a lumpectomy - 3 small areas were removed--Just a couple of breast lymph nodes involved but none under the arm.  She has had her annual mammogram every year.  However, she found a lump in the left breast that led her Dr to order further tests on both breasts which uncovered the lumps in the right breast.  Pretty scary how fast that was growing.  My husband is also fighting renal cancer so waiting for everything is pretty common.  Just put it aside in your mind for now and await the results and deal with it then.  Best of luck to you!  If you are a reader, I highly recommend The Shack.  I would never have read it if someone hadn't recommended it to me--didn't look like my kind of book but it's pretty awesome.

Do you know what kind of breast cancer she has?  On me they removed two tumors, no lymph nodes involved, which is a good sign.  A am just so nervouse about the waiting all the time.  Now I have to wait another two weeks to hear whether I need chemo or not.   Good luck to your sister and god bless.        ",
