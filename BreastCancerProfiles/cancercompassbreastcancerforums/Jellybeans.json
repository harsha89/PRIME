It's a heavy combination (one week in the hospital and one week as an outpatient) and is wreaking havoc on her platelet count.  Any suggestions? Hello I was reading your post and was wondering how your mom is doing now. Any information is appreciated as I too am fighting stage 4 colon cancer. Thank you, Linda",
