    "Content": "Hi, my name is Tracey and I am 43 years old. I had a routine checkup on Tuesday and my Dr. discovered a lump in my left breast close to my breast bone it is about 3 fingers wide. I feel so dumb, I do self exams regularly however I guess I have been doing them wrong as I never felt this. Anyway am going for a mammo and ultrasound next tuesday and have anÂ appointment with a surgeon on Friday. We lost our youngest son almost 2 years ago so I was not looking forward to January anyway. I have just a numb feeling at this time, I have not cryed or screamed or anything, I am just numb. Any support would be greatly appreciated. I am praying very hard that it is not cancer, however cancer does run in our family and I'm not exactly sure how I feel. I think I would have been better if my Dr. would have just ordered a mammo and ultrasound but having an appointment with a surgeon it what has me scared wittless. Thanks so much for letting me ramble. I look forward to hearing from anyone with any feedback. Thank you so much Tracey",
