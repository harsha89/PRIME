I read that once the cancer metastasized there's a high chance that it's already spread all over the body. Also I read that early detection of other locations of metastasis will  increase survival rate. We live in a small city in Indonesia, and I think cancer treatment in our country is not as advance as other country. So I want to know how does the location of metastasis detected ? Is there any specific tests/machine to scan cancer ? What should I ask my mom's doctor about this ? I would suggest that you take your mother to Siloam Semanggi Hospital Jakarta. They have good PET/CT scan and MRI contrast to detect metastasis. I was diagnosed there. I hope this helps.",
