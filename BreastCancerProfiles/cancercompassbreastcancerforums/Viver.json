    "Content": "Hi, I am very sorry to hear about your mum. You have not filed her. Have you heard of Protocell?' Some cancer patients have and are using it with sucess. There is a book called: How to outsmart your cancer. http://outsmartyourcancer.com/ I had a mastectomy and after my first chemeotherapy session I decided to not go ahead with chemeotherapy, I just do not believe in it and do not want to poison my body, make it weak and damage my imune system. I am looking for different aproaches. Please have a look at the book, there is a lot about this method (protocel), Protocel can be purched online, it is legal. The force be with you, ot God. Viver ",
