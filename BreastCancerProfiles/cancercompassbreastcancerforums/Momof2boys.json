    "Content": "this exact thing happened to my brother in law and he passed away on 3-9-07.  it's terrrible to think that such a awful thing can happen and can be prevented but is not a \"standard practice of care\".  how many people have to react this way or die before it becomes a \"standard practice\"??  On 9/7/2005 Maryl wrote: I was diagnosed with breast cancer and received my first dose of 5 FU on July 15th, 11 days later I was admitted to the hospital due to severe toxic reaction to the 5 FU, I was diagnosed with grade 4 (4 being the most severe level) - grade 4 leukopenia, thrombocytopemia, stomasitis, mucocitis, and diarrhea. I was in the hospital for 13-days, do not remember anything of the first week. My family was told I may not make it and supportive care was offered. Needless to say I did make it, however 4-weeks later I am still unable to what I had done prior to chemo due to fatigue. I was informed following this episode that it is very rare and they had never seen this type of reaction, and that I apparently had a deficiency in an enzyme called DPD which makes my body unable to metabolize the 5FU. Upon further research I found that approx. less than 5% of the population has this deficiency and those that do have had toxic reactions to 5FU, including death. I also found out there is a test for this enzyme, but was told by my oncologist it is not the standard of practice to test for DPD? I do highly recommed anyone who is about to recieve 5FU discuss with your physician the effects of DPD and 5FU, the odds are in your favor you will not have this deficiency since less than 5% of the population does, but I can assure you if you are in that 5% you do not want to have 5FU, I am truely very lucky to be alive today. I would be very interested in hearing from anyone who has had or knows someone who has had this reaction to 5FU.  ",
