      "Content": "Have you had a hysterectomy?  What if you did that?  I chose to have the hysterectomy for 2 reasons.  One is that my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and even though both our gene tests were negative, my doc and I  felt there was some coorlation to our cancers.  2nd is that I didn't want to take the tamoxifen.  Too many other side effects.   I am surprised your doctor gave you tamoxifen. I thought it was for pre menapausal  women?   I had the lumpectomy too.  I didn't want to take the aromatase inhibitors so I didn't. I did, however, change my lifestyle - I eat healthy, exercise and such so to avoid a recurrence.  THere are no studies out there for women who choose to take aromatase inhibitors and those who don't so why take them if there are no studies to tell me it works?   Good luck.  ",

Don't bottle up those feelings. It will eat at you and isn't healthy.  Reach out to others.  Again, a support group would be the best thing for you.   It is hard I know.  I am betting it felt better just to type out how you feel. Feel free to continue. You need to get that all out.  Much love and hugs to you.  Oh do you have facebook?  check out facebook/Mojo.  He brings smiles to those who are going through treatment.  ",

One was DCIS  and the other LDC.  The doc will have the lymph nodes checked right away with pathology so you know right after surgery.  From then it was getting a few opinions to see if i needed chemotherapy. I also took the onco type DX testing which is typically done if NO lymph nodes were involved but I did it anyway. The test will tell you if chemo would even be necessary.  It came back low but with the lymph node being involved, I had chemo. Oh , I did have the IORT at CTCA so i didn't have to have the radiation afterwards.  ",
