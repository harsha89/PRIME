    "Content": "I finished chemo (Taxol & Carboplatin) last Sept. and the sharp lower back pain began about a month later along with neuropathy in my toes. I understand it's nerve damage from chemo and could last a long time. I plan to discuss this with my gyn/oncologist this month when I visit him. I can live with it if it means the cancer is gone,Â and the CT scan shows it is.",
