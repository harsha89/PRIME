    "Content": "Hello everyone. This is my 1st time here. A bit of history 1st. After finding a lump on my throat last Oct I was eventually diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had the surgery to remove thyroid in Aug/12 and have just went thru Radioactive iodine treatment and had a Whole Body Scan done. Well to my and my Dr's surprise an area \"lit up\" on my left breast and turns out I have a 1.5cm lump there. I had a mammogram and ultrasound a few days later and was totally caught off guard 3 days later when I got a call for ultrasound dept saying they had a cancellation and could do my biopsy that day. My obvious response was What biopsy??? I haven't got my results abck from Dr yet, so they checked and confirmed that my Dr did order a biopsy done for as soon as possible......Not good as far as I'm concerned! So I had an ultrasound guided biopsy 3 days ago and have been a nervous wreck since! All this on top of trying to recover from thyroid cancer treatment less than a month ago. I'm trying to be positive but based on the fact that the lump was found on a test that will specifically \"light up\" cancer and that another known cyst that I have didn't \"light up\", I'm just trying to be more realistic and prepare myself for the worst. I can't believe this is my life right now!!!! If anyone has had a similar story I'd be very glad to hear from you....Thanks.",
