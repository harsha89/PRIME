      "Content": "Dear Ella, It is good to hear your attitude of hope. I had Breast Cancer in 2000, Mastectomy and chemo. At the end of 2004 it was discovered that my cancer had returned. It metastisized to my liver, lungs, and bones. I just turned 42 this week. I have been looking for more information and experiences from people about living with Mets. I do have hope and continue to keep on kicking. I have been in treatment at CTCA for just over a year now. The treatment does get old and I want a normal life back. Would like to hear more about how other patients deal with Mets. God Bless, In the barn.",

      "Content": "Dear Beth, When I read your response, you and I sound alot alike. I to find myself doing alot one day and flat on my back the next day. Oddly enough, I had an extremely good week this past week. I was able to get up early and be productive the entire day all week long. So keep up a positive attitude and good nutrition. I pray that you will be able to experience a week like I had. Mets is an ongoing battle. I myself am only 42 and I want to get this portion of treatment overwith so I can get fully back into the stream of life. I have always been very active, and to have to sit and watch life go by sometimes is very difficult, as well as having to learn to ask for help. I prefer to help others. Take care of yourself. God Bless, Alicia, (inthebarn)",
