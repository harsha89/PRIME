      "Content": "Hi All,  In 2005 I was diagnosed with DCIS and was told it was controlable with Tamoxofen. I took it for three years and for 2 years after I was clear. In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer in the other breast. I still did not want surgery as it was a small tumor. The docs put me on Arimadex. I had bone pain and hot flashes all the time, but I still took it for 3 years. This year after being scanned the docs found that my tumor had grown, The Arimedex hadn't done anything to slow the spread.  In July I had a bi-lateral mastectomy. They took 4 nodes which were positive. The onco told me I needed Chemo and radiation. I went and had a medi-port put in and I had my first Chemo last week. It was horrible. I was nauseous, even with all the anti-nausea drugs they gave me, I got constipated and my head felt like it was full of cotton. I couldn't even think. I want to go off this stuff.  I am 65 years old, lived a good life and don't want to spend the next 6 to 8 months being sick. Not to mention that these drugs kill your immune system. I have always had a good immune system, hardly ever get sick.  So I have talked it over with my family and I am telling my doc that I am saying no to Chemo. If she can offer me something that I can take that will not compromise me then I would be willing to do it.  ANyone out there made this decision too? I would rather live my life for however long it is going to be and enjoy it.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much. I will check out the book. I talked with my onco this morning and told her I just could not do the chemotherapy. I did agree to go ahead with radiation because after the bilateral mastectomy I did have 4 lymph nodes that were cancerous, so I agreed to that and hormone therapy. For me, it was the best decision. She was wonderful and understanding of my situation and how I felt. She is willing to help me in anyway.",

Such nice people with this terrible plight we share. I will be here for you. Sending positive energy your way. Carol   Thank you Carol. This makes me feel so much better just to share things with people that are in the same club as I am now. I`m just ready to get this show on the road so that I can start to be healthy again. Excellet news that your lymp node was clear. I do hope and pray that I can come back here and report a good report as well. Good luck with your surgeon tomorrow and a Happy Belated (not by much) Birthday to you. Bobbie Hello Ladies, Being diagnosed with breast cancer is the scariest thing I ever had to deal with. I understand your anxiety and fears.  In 2005 I went for a routine Mammogram and it showed something in my left breast. I had a biopsy done which came back as Stage 1 DCIS and LCIS. I was sent to an oncologist that did more testing and found the type of cancer I had was estrogen sensitive, which actually turned out to be a good thing. After talking to 2 surgeons, I decided to not have any surgery. I started taking Tamoxifen. I had some side effects from the drug, but they were minor. I still kept up with my regular mammograms and was monitored by my oncologist. I stopped Tamoxifen after 4 years because they could find no evidence of disease. I was clear for 2 1/2 years. In 2013 my mammogram showed 2 tumors in my right side and a metastisis to my chest wall. Well, I felt like I had been hit by a brick. But again, I was lucky because it was still the  estrogen sensitive invasive carcinoma. After this new diagnosis I was put on Arimidex which I consider a miracle pill. It has shrunk the tumors.  I have had breast cancer for 10 years and I am still going strong. I figure if it can happen to me it can happen to anyone. The one thing I try to do is STAY POSITIVE and ARM yourself with all the information you can. I found that by doing research on the different types of cancer and the treatment methods on reputable websites, such as Susan G Koman and the Mayo clinic sites, I was able to discuss and understand what my oncologist was talking about.  I found out that there are a lot of treatments out there depending on the Type of cancer you have.  It is definately a scarey path to have to travel down. When I went to appointments, especially when I was first diagnosed, I always took someone with me, usually my husband. If I got upset he was there to support me and also he was able to ask questions that I may not have thought of. Two heads are definately better than one. My last bit of advice to you is: If you do not feel comfortable with any of your  doctors, find one you are comfortable with and that you feel you can ask anything of. That has made a huge difference in my treatment. I had one surgeon that did a stereo-tatic biopsy on me and he wasn't very skilled at it. I told my PCP that under no circumstances was that doctor to come near me. My PCP set me up with another surgeon who is absolutely wonderful. I wish you ladies all good diagnosis and treatments that are manageable to you. I will pray for all of you. Take heart, there are new developments and treatment all the time. Hopefully, they will develop a blood test to determine if you have cancer and vaccine to kill it. That would save a lot of women all this anguish.  Let me know how everything turns out for you.. D",

I have an appointment with a surgeon on Tuesday for a consulte and the onacolioist on Sept 30th. I am glad you were able to get help with not being able to sleep. Getting proper rest is very important when you are stressed and worried about what is going to happen.  Before you meet with your surgeon make a list of questions or concerns you have. I always did this whenever I met with the surgeon or the oncologist. I would make a list in my head and forget it, so I learned to write it down! I also would take a pad of paper and write down the anwers he gave me. My docs were pretty good and took the time to explain things thoroughly so that I understood. I hope yours are the same. Good luck with your appointments, stay strong. D.",

I will bwe starting radiation therapy pretty soon. I will have to go EVERDAY for a MONTH! Wow. I was considering the new braca radiation but Im not too crazy about haveing a tube left inside my breast for two or even one week. It is a faster path to walk but too invasive for me personaly. Also I met my oncologist today. Nice lady. She wqants to start me on a medication called Firma or it may be Arimidex. I guess Im too old for the Tameren (spelling). Im almost done with menapuse ,that is why. I will be reasearching these two drugs . I know not much about them yet. Just that they block estrogen. They also will be looking at my biopsy lumpectomy tisue again to see my rate of duplicity. How fast the cancer cell are dulpicating. If its LOW no chemo for me. If to the high end I guess I may have to think about it, oh crap. I dont want that. Nobody does. So now I have more restless  nights worrying about that. I find out in about three weeks from now. How do you guys get sleep ? Im taking tylenal PM now. Hugs ,Carol Hi Carol, What stage are you? After my lumpectomy I was diagnosed  as DCIS and LCIS but I was a 0. I was put on Tamoxifen after deciding that I did not want  surgery. The tamoxifen worked really well. I was on it for four years. I got off it and was cancer free for 2 years. I was diagnosed again in 2013 as stage 4. The cancer decided to find a home in my other breast and migrated to my chest wall. I had a discussion with my oncologist about radiation, chemo, surgery. After much thought I decided to go on the Arimidex. It has worked very well for me. I had a few side effects such as being tired and weight gain, but I am really glad this drug was available. I had a PET scan done recently and although I still have 2 tumors, the Arimidex has shrunk them considerably. My oncologist couldn't even feel them when he examined me. Both tamoxifen and Arimidex block estrogen, which slows or stops the growth of the tumors. I have lived with breast cancer for 10 years now. I am 64 and I feel pretty good. I haven't had any surgery except a lumpectomy, no radiation or chemo. I may have to if the Arimidex stops working, but so far it's been my life saver. I wish you the best. And yes it is very tough to sleep because your mind doesn't shut off. You spend your days and nights wondering about the \"What If's\" . As far as sleep goes I would do all the research I could so that I would be able to arm myself with knowledge and so that I could understand what my docs were talking about. That helped to ease a little of my anxiety. I don't like taking sleep meds so I would warm a little milk up before bed and have that. I also like to read so I got books to read in bed. Between the milk and books to get my mind off things it seemed to work to relax me enough to sleep. Also, you might want to try melatonin. That also worked.  The hardest part of being diagnosed with cancer is waiting for results of scans and tests. I wanted to get my answers quickly so I could decide how to proceed instead of worrying for three weeks. Once you have a plan of action and YOU have made informed decisions it will help. Onnce I knew what I was doing it was still scarey but I felt better because I knew my docs had my best interest at heart and it was my best chance to get on with my life. I don't know if you are religious at all, but I found praying every once in awhile helped too!  Take care and I hope that you get all your answers soon and you are on your way beating the beast!",

Not sure about the LCIS part. I think I have that too.  Im HER negative. A good thing. Thank you for telling am about how well you did on the meds. Helps me allot to know this. Really ! As for the sleep ,I have tried the melatonin , warm milk , teas, and on and on. I wake up in the middle of the night is the problem. and the thoughts start going around and around. Yes I am  BIG prayer. I pray for not just my self. I have a long list. I pray for anyone and everyone who needs it. So you did gain weight on the arimidex hu? Not good. I weigh now at about 120. Before diagnosis I was at 130. But I surely do not want to gain weight. This is one of the good things cancer did give me. The other good thing I recieved from cancer was a heart opening experiance. I have always been a loner. I like to keep to myself. A real hermit. I have recieved such an out pouring of support from within our neighborhood. We actually recieved 7 cooked meals deliverd to our door from 7 diffrent familys. I was just over welmed with tears. These people would only see me when I took our two dogs for a walk. I would wave and keep going. But they all know my husband. He works a full time job and in the summers he likes to seal coat driveways and parking lots.He \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lots.He \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lots.He has a truck and trailer with all the equipment for this.  He knows the neighborhood this way. They all just love him. I told one neighbor of my plight and it went out to all. Thats how it started. Its one of the best things to have done for you when going through this . We have not had to cook hardly at all. And the feeling of love and support is truelly amazing. it will be hard to change who I am but I cant stay a hermit like I was any more. This is what I ment by heart opening . The love I felt was so great. The tears and hugs from folks I hardly knew. My family is not living close by me. One sister her husband is going though renal failer. She has much on her plate now. They are at the top of my prayer list as he has less then a year left. This is getting too long. Sorry. Thank you all for the support. And good advise. Hugs,Carol Hi Carol, It sounds like you have a lot of wonderful neighbors!! Support is very important...sometimes just having someone you can trust and express your fears to if the best medicine to help you deal with things. Yes, I did gain weight on the Arimidex, but I don't think it was all because of the Arimidex. I had lost my job and got diagnosed with the cancer for the second time so I got depressed and lazy.  The Arimidex did give me hot flashes and it made me tired, but compared to other things they could do to me I figured I could live with the side effects.  I wish you the best in your journey. By the way, I am also a hermit, I don't socialize alot and my husband and I live a pretty quiet life. It is a bit overwhelming when all of a sudden everyone is paying attention to you and trying to help you through. It's great to know that there are people who truly care.  ",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your Mom. When your doctor does the blood test part of that test looks for \"tumor Markers\" which would indicate cancer cells somewhere else. Ask your Mom's doc to go over the meaning of the different tests. I always get a copy of my results, then I looked up the tests online so I had some idea of what each code meant. If you feel the doctor is not answering your questions or being dismissive then you may want to look for another oncologist. Also remember that everyone's cancer is different, your friends may have been a different type than your Mom's.  As far as the nosebleeds go that could be environmental. If your house is too dry that will cause it. Getting a humidifier helps. ",

I had some minor side effects from the Arimidex, it does make you tired and may give your Mom hot flashes but I feel it is a little miracle pill. The docs feel that the tumors have shrunk enough that I can have surgery and radiation. I talk to a surgeon tommorow. I read all the stuff that was said about Arimidex too. It is pretty scary. But this drug has been on the market for quite awhile and many women are put on it. Of course, everyone's body reacts differently to medication. If your Mom went through what she has already been through, taking that little pill may be her best bet to stay cancer free. My docs are going to continue my treatment with it after my surgery.  Good luck to you and your Mom. She sounds like a real trooper!!",
