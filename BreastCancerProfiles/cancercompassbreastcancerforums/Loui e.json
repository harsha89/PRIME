Reach out, keep communicating and live the life that you presently have with her. There will be time to grieve, but while she is alive, share the moments, make memories and love each other abundantly. It is a sad journey and I am so very sorry. Keep the faith and know that I and many others care about your situation and possible loss. Karen",

      "Content": "I'd like to discuss how my husband reacted to the news of breast cancer and would be interested in other views. Monday, 4/8/13, I have surgery for DCIS and I am okay with getting the procedure done and hopefully moving past the diagnosis, but what really changed my life was my relationship with my husband when I was diagnosed with cancer. I think he felt threatened by the possibility of losing me. He needed me to support him and reassure him that we will be okay. To be honest, somedays I was able and other days, I quietly cried in the corner. It has been difficult trying to support him emotionally and myself. I don't believe this journey is all about me, but I feel as though I am a vortex and my breath is being sucked out of me. A 42 year marriage being redefined... ",

I agree with your friends about your husband stressing cause I have one of those! They can't help themselves, they kind of like or liked us. As you stated, \"no guarantees for tomorrow\", I am very aware. This moment is all we have and I know it. Please let me know how you are today. Karen",

Then they were concerned about my right and they see calcium forming in a spot and did the Stero something... After they got the results, they sent it out for a second opinion  at Boston medical. Now that came back inconclusive and they wanted to do another Biospy with more tissue, Guess I am seeing New surgeons, Radioloist etc, on the 15th, I think they will be offering it to all get done in one surgery, if Postive, a bilateril masectomy, reconstrutive surgery etc... and the lump out of the right side.... from what all these Doctors are leaning towards and saying, right now my head is spinning ..... I laughed when I read your thread because I am headed for surgery on the 8th of April and I don't know what to expect either, lol. I just know I want it out, no lump for me, just a bunch of salty looking dots that collected like the milky way. I guess the doctor will be removing some breast and reconstructing, that's where I headed after the biopsies on the stero table. Your comment about people looking at you like you were death is spot on. I think that is more difficult than the diagnosis! ",

Ok, so surgery was cancelled March 26, did a Stero biopsy on right side, results still not 100% - sending me now to special Breast Cancer hospital to talk to new surgeons about a new Biospy to remove a chunk of tissue and possibly a Bi lateral Mastecomy....still have not been told what stage, my boobs feel like utters LOl ....Been a great few weeks!!! \"My breast feel like utters\", that's just great, thanks for the laughter.
