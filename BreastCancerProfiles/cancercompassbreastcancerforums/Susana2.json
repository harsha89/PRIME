    "Content": "Thank you Moonwalker for sharing your experience. I am 64 and was put on Aromasin for the 5 year thing. Within 3 weeks, I had unbearable pain in my legs. So, I have stopped and now after reading your account, I am not going to take anymore. I was already thinking about the quality of life being more important than length. You have strengthed my resolve. Thank you again.",
