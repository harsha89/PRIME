Any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you!     ",

      "Content": "  On 5/9/2009 Bonniee wrote: Hello to the Sisterhood! I am the one that was terrified of chemo. Well, I have two more to go, so I think I'm going to make it. Very brutal five months. I have 3 positive nodes, no \"detectable\" breast tumor per mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI. Estrogen +, Hers 2u - neg. The physicians I have seen recommend radiation - full breast, axilliary and super-clavicular. I was more comfortable with a double mastectomy and just axilliary and super -clavicular radiation, (they wouldn't do breast, if removed) They will do whatever I decide. Now I am re-thinking the double mastectomies. Has anyone else had to make such a difficult decision? Help! I would appreciate your coments. PS - My biggest worry is how to find future breast cancers if breasts are too dense nothing can find it before going to nodes again! Thanks, Bonnie Hi Bonnie, I know what you are going thru trying to make that decision.  I had 4 positive lymph nodes.  I had a double mastectomy along with 14 nodes removed, three phases of chemo and was on herceptin for a year, now I am on Zometa every 6 months.  I chose not to have radiation.  It was a very hard decision because with my whole team of doctors, some said I should and some said it was my decision.  I was told the rule of thumb was 3 positive nodes or less, you don't need radiation.  I had 4 but still decided against radiation.  My mastectomy was necessary, though, my tumors were in several places.  I was just very nervous about radiation.  I never felt it was right for me from the beginning.  I understand radiation when you have a nonoperable tumor that you need to shrink but I just kept asking what if you are just radiating good tissue since my tumors were removed with surgery and anything left was hit with chemo.  I wish you the best!  Stay positive, it helps.
