      "Content": "Merry Christmas! I am in the resting week of my third cycle of Zeloda. I am also very anxious to know what is to come and have asked my onc. his response was very depressing so I took matters into my own hands and am a lot happier with my plan. That plan is to fight like heck and hopefully win!!! I have bcmet in my liver, nodes in stomach and bone.And have three wonderful children ( 11, 18 and 20 yrs old) that I think about all the time. The better my outlook is, the better I can help them deal with this incredibly selfish disease.  You are in my thoughts and prayers! Lori",

      "Content": "I just found out that my breast cancer came back also in my back, liver and nodes in my stomach. This recurrence happened least than a year after my orginal treatment ended. I am on my second rcycle of Xeloda/Avastin. I feel really good but am scared that it is a false feeling of security. I've been reading about others in my position, How much pain are you in? And are you able to continue your regular routine?",

      "Content": "I too went to Shands and was very impressed. But the second time around, now, I am at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando, Fl. I am on Xeloda/Avastin/Zometa. Has anyone heard of this combo? Avastin seems easy on my body but Zometa is taking longer to recup each time. Xeloda has given me mouth sores. Has anyone else had to deal with this?",
