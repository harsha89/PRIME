So please let her know that she's not alone either. I think there's a boatload of us out here! But at least we're HERE, right? Take care, OKnow. I had Cobalt radiation at the age of 16 to treat Hodgekins Disease. Then at age 24 I got Breast Cancer & had a double masectomy & reconstruction. I took chemo with both but couldn't have any more radiation with the BC. Other side effects from the Cobalt that I have are tight, atrophied muscles in neck & shoulders, many basel skin cancers removed & keep cropping up, and recently a mole removed that was the step before melonoma. I have lymphedema in my right arm as a result of the lymph node removal to test them when I had breast cancer. Thankfully none had cancer but now I deal with the lymphedema daily. Good luck to you!",
