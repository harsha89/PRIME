Having cancer is depressing enough without the added stress of not feeling like you are wanted in your grandchilds life.  Well anyway, I just needed to vent today and get some of this depressing stuff out of my mind....not that anyone can actually help me with advice, but I just needed to share my hurt with someone else who may understand.  When things are going good, and I am getting to see my grandson I am the happiest person alive, but when there are days I dont see him and would love to be able to take him out to lunch or to the park and cant, well my joy quickly turns to dispair and I dont want to feel this hurt anymore. Sometimes I would just like to stop trying so hard to stay alive..for what, I ask myself all the time?  I'm just a babysitter..I am being used!  There is no regard for my or my husbands feelings as grandparents.  I was able to take him one day to the local discount store by myself and you know what, that was the best day I have spent in that store in a long time..we took our time and walked around the store, and we looked at the toys and we just had the best time..I would like to have more good times like that..but oh well, I guess I will have to be happy with what a good time I did have with him.  This little grandson of mine is the best cancer medicine I could ever be given..so much better than chemo!  I appologize if I sound like a whiner!  I know I have alot to be thankful for compared to someone else..like I said I just needed to vent..and figured this was as good a place as any... God's blessings to you all for listening..... Jodie Hi to you Jodie what a wonderful gift you have in that your grandson. There are people you can talk to in the family courts to get grandparental visitation to see and spend more time with your grandson. I am shocked that  your son wouldn't take a firmer step and let his wife know that he will be spending more time with you and as well taking your grandson to see you as well. I wish you luck with getting to spend more time with your grandson and your son. I don't know what i would do if I couldn't see my four beautiful granddaughters. But I do know one thing i wouldn't I would fight to the end to be with them. At any rate don't give up the battle and lots of luck. I don't know if I was much help but I'm rooting for you. God Bless Gleeo",
