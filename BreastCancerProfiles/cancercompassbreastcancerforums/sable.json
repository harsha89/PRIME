I have been on aromasin for about three months now, after rejecting Femara as impossible. I feel I am slowly sinking, and believe that it is the drug, not ordinary depression. I know these are listed side effects, but would like to hear if you have had this experience and what you have done. Thanks. ceegee I've been diagnosed with lobular carcinoma, metastatic breast cancer of the bone invasive to the stomach with gastric cancer.  Onc. prescribed femara and I have been taking since May 7, 2008.  I was told this would have little or no side affects.  With all my aches and pains at night I was just thinking maybe my bone cancer was getting worse.  Now after reading the numerous emails concerning femara and aromasin, it fits.  My depression on femara is not ordinary, I'm laughing one minute and crying the next.  I ache all over especially at night.  I'm not one to take medication but for the last two nights I have taken loracet just to be able to get comfortable enough to go to sleep. I don't sleep well at all.  I'm trying to walk everyday.  Thanks Sable",

The name sable was my pet's name.  I just feel Like I need someone to talk to that is going through the same thing I'm going through.  Take care and may God bless you.  Sable",

      "Content": "On April 21, 2008 I was diagnosed with Gastric Cancer but later after a certain stain was performed and 2nd diagnoses of Metastized Breast Cancer to the bones, (slow growing for 19 years and showing up in my stomach)  inerable.  Metastasized from my lower spine to my stomach.  I had breast cancer in 1989 at the age of forty with both breast removed.  Cancers were Lobular Carcinom insitu and invasive, ductal and pagets disease.  Went through six rounds of chemo,  pretty tough stuff back then, have had pretty good health since then until this.  I started gaining weight.  My stomach would ache or hurt and to get it to stop I would take over the counter anti-acids, purple pill, and etc.  I found if I kept something in my stomach the pain wasn't so severe.  Doc thought I was feeding an ulcer.  But no lab reports say it is metastic breast cancer estrogen receptor positive.  I'm told I'm to be greatful for this.  I am on the drug Femara daily (oral chemo-hormonal therapy) and  zometa infusions for the bones.  Onc. will monitor.  if my cancer does not react this medication then regular chemo is in store.  Has anyone else had this thing.  Good bless everyone.
