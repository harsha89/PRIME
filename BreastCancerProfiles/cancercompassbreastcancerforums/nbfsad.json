Hi my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer metastatic to the stomach 9/2007... no breast primary.  This was picked up after years of gastritis with multiple normal biopsies... finally they biopsied the was of the stomach and found the cancer.  She then had a laparoscopy and found cancer all around her stomach and ometum.  She had 5 cylces chemo adriamyacin/taxotere and went into remission with femara.  2010 the markers started to creep up, ct scan showed no progression ... but they continued to go up, she was switched to tamoxifen and they continued to go up, so she is on her 4th cycle of chemo again.  It seemed to work, but during chemo ... they went down for two cycles, and then suddenly went back up ???  Will try one more cycle, if no improvement she will need to try something new. CANCER SUCKS !!  I hate it for her and for everyone else suffering through this... however I am forever grateful for modern medicine .. without it she would have passed away 3 yrs ago... and everyday counts...",
