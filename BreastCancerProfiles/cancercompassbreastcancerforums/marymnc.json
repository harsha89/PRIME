      "Content": "Just know that there is a lot of help out there. Your mom needs to become an advocate for herself. I know. I've been down the same road. I have made it my mission to find out everything I can about WHY I got cancer in the first place. There is a reason your mom got cancer. There is much she can do to find out her options. Chemo and radiation are not the only options. She needs to work on her immune system. You can help her by finding the resources to help her. You and your mom need to empower yourselves. KNOWLEDGE is the key. And don't panic. There is time to sort this out.  And stay positive for your mom. That is how you can help her.  All the best.",

      "Content": "Hi - I've been down that road too. Diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 2011.. had a biopsy, stage 1... had a lumpectomy... no cancer for 2 years, then another tumor formed in same breast...I am seeking out alternative medicine doctors for advice. I know I can heal by body from this like so many others before me have done. Yes, it's a scary place to be...but never give up hope of beating your cancer. And don't let the medical profession use scare tactics on you. I haven't.  They wanted me to have a double masectomy. I will resort to all other health alternatives before consenting to a masectomy. Cancer happens because you're immune system broke down. You have to work on getting a strong immune system again. The medical profession will never tell you that..",

      "Content": "Three out of 4 people who refuse treatment die??? Where did you get that info?? That is so not true!!! When you do your research and study WHY people get cancer, only then can you understand the medical community. Getting your breasts hacked off is no guarantee you won't get it again. It will come back, just in another place in your body. Chemo and radiation both break down your immune system and doesn't always work. Cancer is big business. Look up people like Chris Wark. He got colon cancer at 26 years old.  There are many more survivors like him.",
