I have enough muscle that when I go swimming I cannot float I sink in the pool. I think pain may be a cause because all though I have had to keep on working the system really cares little about chronic conditions I have Migraine almost daily so I believe mine was caused by inflamation. I had to live and work almost every day in pain. I have had migraines since I was eighteen and they got really bad when I turned forty. I think diet can be one of the factors but not the only one for cancer.  Inflammation is also the cause of mine.  I have a very good diet, exercise, am 62 but have a multitude of permanent back conditions not treatable by surgery.  I have been prescribed anti-inflammatories which barely touch the pain.  I'm positive that inflammation is a much greater cause of breast cancer than people think.  Inflammation is also a huge problem for weight gain, which exercise does not address, since the inflammatory response makes the body hold water.",
