      "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed in 1996 had chemo and then took tomoxifen  for 5 years. I was given nothing for the next four years at whcih time I had a reoccurence. I was then put back on chemo and then arimidex after two years of that I was taken off of Arimidex because I then had another  baby tumor grow up they then put me on avastin and now just aromasin.  So, the best I can tell you is they do what they can but I would make sure you engage in learning how to live with it not die with it.   The side effects of arimidex are not fun and no one  seems to get that it is not just pain...it is PAIN. I am doing better on aromasin. The pain is less.   I hope this helps in some small way. Hang in there.  I do not have mets anyhere but one small spot on the lining of my lung.  B  ",

It seems to be controling the growth of my tumours as my blood test are getting better and better and my last scans showed a dramatic decrease in the tomour size.  It is your call but I would rather live in minmal pain than shoot the dice.   Becky",

I have stage four cancer I have one lone star tumor on the lining of my left lung, the doctor is trying to kill the little bugger and not me. Is anyone out there doing this besides me? I cannot even find women in my shoes. I was 9 years clean and was struck again two years ago, so 11 years  fighting thus far. I have had chemo twice once in 1996 and again in 2005. I am now 48 years old. Becky    ",

Chemo and Armidex was working it killied the tumours so it seemed but another spot appeared on the lining of my lung so they put me on Avastin and Aromasin and I have been getting Avastin every two weeks since January of this year. I am due for new scans soon to see if it is working. Ask your doctor about Avastin treatment it is supposed to be a very good new drug.",
