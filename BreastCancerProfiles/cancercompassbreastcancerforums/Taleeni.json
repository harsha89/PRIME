      "Content": "Hi Diva, Please stay strong and keep yourself as positive as you possibly can.  I was diagnosed with BC@ 34 in 2008 and just finally completed treatment in Nov.  I did one year of Herceptin that's why it took so long.  If you are the praying type be prayerful and pray without ceasing.  You will go through every possible emotion, if you need to scream, scream; if you need to cry, cry.  But whatever you do always remember you may have cancer, but cancer does not have to have you. The biopsy is painless until the anesthesia wears off, you may have to do an MRI too, this will probably be the most painful test as u are in an uncomfortable position for about 45 mins.  Surgery day will be the most nervous you have ever been.  Keep the faith through it all and stay positive.  Attitude is everything in this journey. As far as alternative options, many good things have been said about Dr. Johanna Budwig's protocol of Organic cottage cheese and Organic Flaxseed oil.  You may want to google her protocol.  Many ppl also talk highly of drinking vegetable juices and going the greens route.  This didn't work for me, because chemo made me ravenous and I craved flesh.  You will be in my prayers and I know you are surrounded by love, cloak yourself in that love and all will be well.  ",

      "Content": "Hey Diva, I forgot one critical element here.  You have not yet done the biopsy so we don't know for sure it's even cancerous.  Could be two benign tumours in which case you wouldn't need a mastectomy.  Don't stress too much until you have that pathology report from the biopsy. Will still be keeping you in my prayers.    ",
