      "Content": "Many people who have used oleander based extracts and supplements have had great success in treating breast cancer (and many other forms of cancer as well).  One such product is known as OPC, which was formulated by a cancer and HIV researcher in South Africa.  The product contains 80% oleander extract and the extracts of three other rain forest botanicals, Agaricus Blazei Murill (ABM) mushroom, Cat's Claw and Pau D'Arco.  So far, in three years of use OPC has proven to be almost 100% successful (72 out of 80 patients who were given OPC are alive and well - of the other 8, 5 were in their final days and unable to hold down the supplement and 3 succumbed to organ failure as a result of prior chemo).  A couple of examples of those who used the product for breast cancer, as reported by the researcher and OPC patent holder: \"One breast cancer patient who was given a few months to live eventually became the patient of the oncologist who is now also using the mix. She was declared free of cancer by the oncologist approximately 1 year ago and is still doing well. (A) doctor in Cape Town whose own wife had metastasized cancer to the bones, is now cancer free. She has been on overseas trips and lives a normal life.\" Here is a link that shows photos of the progress of one breast cancer patient who used the OPC supplement (warning, the photos are pretty graphic): http://www.rose-laurel.com/BA_Can_Side.pdf It should be noted that oleander is highly toxic in raw form.  No one should ingest even the smallest amount of raw oleander and no one should attempt to make their own oleander extract or remedy without carefully following the directions for \"oleander soup\" as freely posted on the internet and in the group I moderate. The OPC product is available commercially at a couple of sites on the internet; however, it can also be obtained directly from the patent holder and researcher in South Africa at a much reduced price (he does not advertise and sells only by referral and word of mouth) Live long, live healthy, live happy!

      "Content": "Thanks for the reminder about the raw plant - we surely don't want anyone trying to make their own without knowing what they are doing! You are quite correct - the RAW oleander plant is highly toxic.  However, a properly made extract made the same way that Doctor Ozel in Turkey devised in the early 1960's (when he re-discovered the centuries old remedy) and went on to patent as the medicine Anvirzel is something entirely different.  The boiling and straining process removes the toxins, as was verified by FDA phase I toxicity trials for Anvirzel which found NO toxic limit, but rather a limit in which it was impractical to give larger doses (it was tested as an injectible). So far, thousands of people have used Aniverzel, the dietary supplement known as Sutherlandia OPC (their latest production run is for 50,000 bottles) and the homemade extract known as oleander soup, which can be made at home about as easily as a large pot of beans, though you have to follow directions and exercise caution in handling the raw plant material.  All three versions are made essentially the same way. Now here is the kicker - after thousands and thousands of users, not one single confirmed death or life threatening side effect has been attributed to properly made oleander taken in the correct dosage. Not one!  Compare that to any known chemo drug.  Heck, compare it to aspirin and NSAIDS, which kill thousands each year. You are quite right about raw oleander, but when it comes to the properly made extract I believe I will keep my hair.  I take it every day, have researched it for years and have written a book about it.  I also host a group at Yahoo called \"oleandersoup\" where no one has been harmed by oleander, but more importantly, in over three years, no one has died either, and virtually every member who came to the group, many after mainstream medicine failed them, are now cancer free or improving. Here are the instructions for making proper oleander extract: The Reciipe for Olender Soup Part 1 http://www.tbyil.com/oleandersoup.htm The Reciipe for Olender Soup Part 2 - Tips and Advice http://www.tbyil.com/tips.htm And while you are at the website, I would recommend reading the entire series of articles on oleader which can be found at http://www.tbyil.com/articles.htm Thanks again for pointing out the toxicity of raw oleander. One final note - although the toxins have been removed in oleander extract, it does contain cardiac glycosides (including the main active ingredient oleandrin) which cross assay with digoxin/digitalis.  It IS therefore important to follow directions and stay within recommended dosage amounts (which beginn at half a teaspoon and work up to a tablespoon three times daily).  Those amounts are way, way within the safety range, but a person could get in trouble if for some crazy reason they decided to drink it by the glass. The same thing would likely be true for a great many medicines whose dosage was exceeded by that degree. Live long, live healthy, live happy!",

      "Content": "Most mainstream treatment centers are not aware of the use of oleander extract as a stand alone or complimentary medicine for cancer treatment, with a notable exception being MD Anderson in Houston where one of their most respected researchers, Doctor Robert Newman has led and participated in many studies of oleander and it's cardiac glycosides and long chain polysacharrides. A medicine made from oleander, now patented and known as Anvirzel, has been used successfully for thousands of cancer patients outside the US for over 40 years now.  In the US, it is available via FDA exception rule from the Salud Integral clinic in Honduras.  It is also available as a dietary supplement named Sutherlandia OPC from South Africa (which actually contains 80% oleander extract and 20% extract of the South Africa Cancer Bush, aka sutherlandia frutescens). When used as complementary medicine with chemo, oleander either eliminates or greatly lessens all known side effects, including hair loss.  The sole exception I am aware of is that it does not eliminate hair loss when the chemo drug of choice is Cisplatin. Another feature of oleander is that it is almost unheard of for cancer to ever return for those who have beaten cancer and take it as a preventive.  I have no doubt that the fact an aqueous extract of oleander was found in European studies in 1986-87 to have fully six times the immune stimulating activity of the most potent patented immune stimulators known to man. If that sounds too good to be true, that is exactly what I thought a few years and thousands of hours of research ago.  I found out that it is even more impressive than I have indicated here.  In fact, I was so impressed that I ended up writing a book about it (I am a natural health author, advocate and researcher) and, for the past three plus years I have also hosted a non-commercial Yahoo informational health group about it where we have hundreds of members and every one is still alive and doing well. I am not trying to sell my book or solicit new group members, but I do suggest that you do some research and educate yourself about it - it is one of the many wonders that nature has to offer for cancer and other serious illness.  Your hair may thank you for it!",
