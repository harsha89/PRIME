There is a 6-8% risk of permanent hair loss when taxotere is the chemo regimen. It's unfortunate the doctors gloss over that fact. Especially so when hair loss can be prevented entirely by using a cold cap during chemo. Penguin cold caps and Elastogel caps are what is available to the public. THIS IS NOT FAIR THAT WE ARE NOT TOLD A LOT OF THINGS THAT MAY HELP US AND HURT THE CHANCE OF THEM...MAKE MONEY OR SEEM TO BE HEROS. IM SO SORRY IT HAPPEN TO ANY OF US. NOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO BE HELPED WITH THESE SIDE EFFECTS? AND WEIGHT GAIN FROM THE FERMARA AND OTHERS, ALONG WITH THE PAIN IN MY ARM AND SHOULDER WHERE I HAD THE LUMP ADN LYNODES REMOVED....HURTING MOST OF THE TIME, LIVINGLARGE I totally agree with you ! Patients should be informed by their oncologist also about the side effects of any cancer treatment and prevention or solutions ans especially when it concerns physical appearance. At Esperity you can find your \"medical twin\" someone with the same treatment as yours and or the same side effectsand share your experience,your feelings,the way you manage your cancer;it is really helpful when you find a \"twin\";you may also wait a while till someone in the world connect so this is why it is important to me to spread the word overwww.esperity.com Do you recognize yourself in this video ?? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzhttNCIulA",
