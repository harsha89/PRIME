I just miss the way it was....",

My doctor told me that suppressing the estrogen(which is what we want to do) causes the hair thinning. It is just like when a women go thru menapause same thing pretty much. Your estrogen level goes down then too and you get the male pattern balding. ",

A feeling of tired that you really cannot describe utill you have experienced it. I had bad night sweats (still do). Just make sure to protect yourself every way that you can for your own health. I bought and wore mask from the time I started chemo till I was done with radiation. That was from september 2006 till april 2007. I went thru treatment during flu season too the mask seemed to help. This was the toughest thngs I have ever been thru and hope it is the last.  Gather the friends and family around you that really care about you and what is going on with you. Let people know what they can do for you and your family.  ",

I would just go outside one day when you see her outside and ask her if there is anything you can do for her and her family. You do not have to tell her anyone told you anything. Just by her wearing scarves and looking weak she will kno w you obviously know something is going on. When I was going thru treatment the best thing was when people ask me what they could do. You could get the family a grocery gift card, offer to take her to appointments or just ask her if she wants to talk to call or walk across the steet and you will be there for her. I am sure you know all this anyway having dealt with cancer recently with your family. Good luck and make a move to her.... Jennifer",

I keep telling my onc. that as time goes by my side effects are getting worse. They say in time you will get use to it. Well... guess what? You do not get use to it. It is something you just learn to deal with day in and day out. My bones hurt, Joints hurt, mood swings are horrible, trouble sleeping, energy level bad(even though I work out 4 days a week and push myself to do that), Hair thinning getting worse, bottoms of feet kill me, blah blah..... I tried getting some info from Novartis to see if this was common for side effects to get worse but they will not talk to the person (patient) that is taking the medication they want to talk with the Doctor that you see. The doc will not call them because they are too busy and I cannot get any answers. Seems like they want you to take it and oh well with you. ",
