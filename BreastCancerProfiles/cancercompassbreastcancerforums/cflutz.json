      "Content": "Yes, I am a patient of PRMA. In 2010 I was diagnosed with breast cancer. By the grace of god I found PRMA. I know that to be true as I had never heard of PRMA or the DIEP flap and given that I had done extensive research and talk to everyone it was a nurse of a friend who told me about PRMA. Dr. Pisano was my doctor and I respect his honesty, attention to detail, and his passion to do everything possible to make a horrible situation easier and better for me! The nurses and staff at PRMA and Methodist Hospital geniunely care and are sensitive to your needs! What I think is important is that women learn about all their options so they can make the decision that best meets their needs. I 'm sure their are wonderful doctors all over but my experience is with Dr Pisano and PRMA. There were many days I wished PRMA was in the same city vs 2 hours away but looking back at my journey and the results today, 2 hours is nothing for what I received! Peace, CFL",
