    "Content": "I can understand what you are saying about your children. I have a son who is 4 years old and it took me 7 pregnancies, yes I had seven miscarriages, to have him. I can't imagine not being here for him. I have colon cancer stage 4. I'm still receiving chemo treatment, I still feel good about myself. I do lots of praying and I know god will answer my prayer. My doctor is only a man who god gave knowledge to be a doctor. So there is only one man who knows when I will die. At first I was afraid to die, now I really don't know. I do know I am not ready to leave this world, I have a child and so much more to live for. Sincerely, Betty",
