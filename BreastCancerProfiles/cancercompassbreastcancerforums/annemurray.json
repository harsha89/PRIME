      "Content": "I am curious why you think you might have ibc. I had tumor in chest wall and tumor in lymph nodes, mri showed I had IBC and I had physical symptoms eventually show up as well. I did not have biopsy. Biopsies do not always give accuracy of IBC. I got 5 opinions and 3 agreed without biopsy. IBC is not something to wait around for. I immediately started 4 months of chemo before surgery and radiation.",

      "Content": "I have had neuropathy since the end of my chemo treatments in June.  I have been receiving weekly treatments of acupuncture instead of al of the drugs out there.  It has helped me tremendously.  I also have found that when I get a lot of rest it does not act up as much.  Good luck to you.  It is hard to live with the reminders of the past.",
