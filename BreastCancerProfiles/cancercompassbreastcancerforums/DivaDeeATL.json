      "Content": "I came 2 this site seeking advice from those who have been where I was going, mammo & needle guided biopsies. Finding 2 tumors 1 in each breast @ my 1st EVER MAMMO was shocking! Thanks my sisters 4 coming 2 my rescue & answering my question & concerns! When ppl/strangers reach out & understand, listen suggest & offer prayers it almost brings me 2 tears...THANKS AGAIN! Now that I have a lil experience when it comes 2 mammo's & needle biopsy proceedures, the next young woman who comes here seeking experienced advice, I can share mine! The needle biopsy wasn't painful, thanks 2 Lydocaine, but seeing the process WAS! *the entry cut w/scalpel, needle inserted, watching the needle extract samples from tumor on ultrasound screen, the loud noise from extraction machine, the smell, then actually viewing the removed tissue/tumor samples...just looked like red jello! I know some might think TMI-(too much info) but 4 some1 who has never experienced what I have & is here seeking answers about what 2 expect when they do...this is 4 U!  The day after is a little painful, my entry cuts are starting 2 itch already! (thats a good sign of healing) I have a sports bra on, i'd suggest the same & ice pack 20min on 30min off thru out the day. Other than that, it is not as scary or painful as it seems!! Feel free 2 contact me :)     ",
