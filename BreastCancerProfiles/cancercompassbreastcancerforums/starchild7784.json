    "Content": "I have been going through chemotherapy since March of 2011. Also did 7 weeks pelvic radiation that ended in June. For Cervical Cancer.Going through my second round with Taxotere and Carboplatin with a follow up Neulasta shot,every three weeks. At first I would have lower back pain for just a few days after the shot. My last treatment was over a little over a month ago due to low blood count. My back has been hurting constantly for the last three weeks.I know have to do a MRI on wedesday, already had a CT,X-Rays, and a bone scan and everything came back clear,no new cancer. Pain pills barely help now. I am starting physical therapy this week,hope it helps. Relieved to know that other people have the reaction to the shot to.",
