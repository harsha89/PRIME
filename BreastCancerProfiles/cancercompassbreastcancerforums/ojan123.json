      "Content": "Hi All, I am another breast cancer survivor who has had trouble with hair growing back.  Diagnosed in 2006 and after 4 and a half months of TAC, and 5 weeks of radiation, and 2years of tamoxifen, then ovaries removed prophylactically and placed on aromasin for remaining 3 years.  Just finished in October 2011, but my hair is still sparse on top, and very grey.   So I definantly can relate to those of you out there with the same issue...my doctor thought once I had completed the aromasin I might see a change, but there is no difference.  Are any of you out there also hypothyroid, because I think that also might have a contributing factor. I think wigs will be my best friends now, because nothing else seems to be working.  If anyone finds an answer out there let us know.  Take care All.",
