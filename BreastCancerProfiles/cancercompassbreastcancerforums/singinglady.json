Fasting sounds dangerous to me, especially when on chemo, unless maybe it's more of a veg/fruit juice only fast. forgive me, but i still have not figured out which post i'm responding to, but since i spoke of fasting, it is a water fast; i have coffee (i know, i know and i once spent 10 yrs w no caffeine and none of the 15 or so foods i tested sensitive to via the alyssa and another test -- i regularly flew clients blood to a lab in california for 2 tests more sensitive to our responses than mainstream allergy tests) that i tested positive to, but i have not yet gone back to that     because as i'm sure you know, chris, whatever we are 'allergic' to, we are addicted to and i have been so busy trying to keep our wonderful doctors from killing me.  it's an interesting razor's edge that some of us dance on lol       if you look at the original lab animal tests on fasting     no chemo involved      and then the later work such as valter longo, whom i'm sure i've mentioned........ok, now i'm simply blahblah ing be well",
