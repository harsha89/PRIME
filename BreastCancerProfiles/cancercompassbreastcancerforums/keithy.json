      "Content": "My oncologist for some reason does not feel the need to examine me when I go in for visits.  She seems to use whatever reason she can.  Like \"Did I examine you last time\" or \"Have you seen any other doctors recently\".  I would like to know if I am wrong to think what does that matter.  I should be examined every time.  If you are watching a patient that is trying to reach a 3 or 5 year mark just asking them how they are doing is not doing the job to me.  Why should I have to pay to sit in a chair and say I doing good and then its lets make the next appointment.  Am I wrong for feeling this way?",
