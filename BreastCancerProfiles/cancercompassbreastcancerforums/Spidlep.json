Quit radiation after 9 (of 30) sessions, no chemo.  I've been on Arimidex at a half-dose level for 4 years now.  I have very few side-effects, mostly dry skin and some bone-thinning.  I work with a distant oncology-trained acupuncturist.  I've never met him as we talk on the phone and he order comprehensive lab-work to look deeply at my 'terrain', i.e. my body that allowed the cancer to grow. He presented the option of using a half-dose in order to receive the benefits with fewer drawbacks.  We do lab-work a couple of times a year to verify that my estrogen levels are undetectable.  I asked my oncologist about this option and he said only \"it doesn't work that way!\"  I think that meant that standard cancer treatment is not yet actually customizable for different bodies.  But the acupuncturist made clear to me that the point of aromatase inhibitors is to drive estrogen levels to zero.  So, I feel confident that I am doing that with less medicine onboard.  Of course, the acupuncturist is extremely careful to present options without advice.  We're all doing the best we can with this situation.  Just wanted to note an 'outside the box' option that I've never seen on any of these boards.  My approach is a bit of a hybrid. Outside of 1/2 dose arimidex, I rely on enormous immune boosting 'alternative' therapies for now.  Fingers crossed.I was on Arimidex for 2 1/2 years. Before the Arimidex I took 33 rounds of Radiation.I had severe hot flashes.. Joint pain along with night sweats. I was tired all the time. The pill didn\u2019t work my breast cancer returned. And in February of this year 2018 I had a double Mastectomy. Tomorrow I go for my 6 mth check up at the Oncologist. Fingers are crossed that all is good.. two times with cancer is to many. I\u2019ve noticed that my hair has been coming out pretty much everyday when I brush it. And I have very long hair. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s normal but it is. I hope that stops soon. I\u2019m not on the Arimidex now I guess I will know more about that tomorrow. Time will tell...",
