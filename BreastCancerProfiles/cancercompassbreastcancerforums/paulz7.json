    "Content": "I have been diagnosed with breast cancer 7 years ago. I had undergone mastectomy surgery two years ago. Currently, I'm under complete remission of cancer. I'm happy with the result. My oncologist said that I have been strong throughout the whole procedure. He advised me to take proper rest for a while.  Last day, I went for a shopping with my mom and everyone was staring at my boobs. It's very obvious that I had breast cancer. I hate the stares. I have heard that people who had breast cancer consider breast implant to regain the boobs. One of my cousins suggested undergoing saline breast implants from a clinic in London, Ontario ( http://www.breastandtummytuck.com/procedures/saline-filled-b ). But I have heard that a rare type of cancer is linked to breast implants. It's not similar to breast implants but it is known as lymphoma, which is the cancer of immune system. According to the latest survey, the number of women asking for breast implant removal has increased. Is that true? What might be the main cause of this lymphoma? I have just recovered from breast cancer and I don't want to take any risks. Is it safe to undergo breast implant procedure? How was your experience after the complete remission of cancer? Are you able to enjoy your life like others? Any advice is highly appreciated. Thanks!  ",
