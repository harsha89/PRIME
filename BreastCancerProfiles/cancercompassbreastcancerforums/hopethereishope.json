Maybe just check if this is still the case as I had chemo some years ago. I am on my 4 th round of cancer. I exercise like a demon and dont drink and have never smoked but I have never used supplements or alternative medicines. I am Stage 4 and in remission after 8 months. Best of luck Paula. I do have the opposite experience. I nearly died for my severe cancer case but recovered in a miracle way. My doctor & medical team have the credit, but I do believe in God to grant my turn-around health, and actually I have been taking lots of supplements which help me to maintain a good shape. It's only my experience, and perhaps it does not apply to you, just want to share. Hope it helps.",
