AddiebelleMy mother has been on a variety of treatments including arimidex.  She tonight told me she just can't take the joint pain from them anymore.  She is starting back on Tamoxafin tomorrow.  I am of course so worried for her for a number of reasons.  I was wondering if anyone has tried hypnosis or acupuncture.  While my mom was having chemo, she went to regular sessions of acupuncture, and always said she couldn't have gone through chemo without it.  I hope someone out there has some insight that I can pass on to my mother.  Thanks.    ",
