      "Content": "Hello, I am a 30 year old breast cancer patient. It is not unheard of to wait this length of time, but don't let them play the age card with you. They did with me over and over and I ended up having cancer and it was brushed under the rug a few times because they thouhgt the chance was so low. I would force my way into an earlier appnt. But if it is impossible, don't worry too much because cancer isn't known to grow or spread that quickly. But, again, I would get in ASAP just to be safe. Good luck.",

It seems odd they'd have missed it since it is right beside the other one they removed...",
