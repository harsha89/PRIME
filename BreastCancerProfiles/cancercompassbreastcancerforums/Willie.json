    "Content": "My husband and my mother both have cancer. My husband has colon ca with mets to the liver and bone. He is in stage IV. My mother was diagnosed with stage III lung ca in December, 2004 and then my mother in law was diagnosed with uterine ca in January, 2005 not to mention my father has dementia. I am the caregiver to my husband, mother and father. It is very challenging, but I always remember God does not put nothing on you you can't bear. This is a test of your faith. This is a time for you to grow closer to God and your church family. We are all put here for a purpose. Your burden seems hard know but the Lord is preparing you to help someone else down the road. Do the best you can. Remember, you can't do everything. Take time out for yourself regardless of how bad you think things are. You can't take of your love ones if you don't take care of yourself. Everything we go through in life is a blessing. See the blessing in your situation. Thank God you are able to care for your parents. Thank God for CTCA. Cydney B.",
