    "Content": "Hi, I've been on Tamoxifen for 2 years and 3 month now. Had recurrent breastcancer to the pleura. I have cut the dose that the docotor told me to take, 2omg, to only about 5, or 3 mg/s. I cut the tabletts with a knife. I've read a scientific report that said 1 mg of Tamoxifen does the same job. That's why i took the risk, and so far it seems to work. My X-rays are clear. With the higher dose, i got belly cramps and felt very unwell. The lower dose feels much more comfortable. I think my weight would be much higher with the higher dose too.  Isn't that interesting. best wishes, Benne      ",
