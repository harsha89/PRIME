      "Content": "Hi all, I am new here. Obviously. I am 39 years old and I found a lump last night. We just relocated to the Phoenix area and have no insurance. I am trying like heck to get a mammogram and no one seems to be able to help me. I have literally called 14 places. Left messages or gotten \"we can't help you\". I am trying to avoid seeing a regular physcian because I know I have a lump and I would like to go in and get it looked at and that be that. I did call one regular family Dr. who said that they don't take self-pay patients. We aren't low income so we can't get help in that sense. We certainly are not wealthy enough to fork out thousands for health care. We are right in the middle. Not a bad place to be unless something goes wrong. Like now. A little background may insight you into my urgency to get this taken care of. Maternal Grandmother had her first breast cancer at 31 second at 51 and died secondary to breast cancer with bone and brain cancer. Paternal Grandmother died of her second breast cancer at 52. My Mother had her first breast cancer at 32 and second at 42. She is living at 59. Lastly, I went onto hormone treatments to get pregnant. I know, not the smartest but I could not get pregnant without Invitro Fertilization. My son is now 7 months old so I have been off of hormones since August 2005. I am terribly frustrated. You hear all the time, \"find a lump get in immediately\" I am trying like mad to do just that but to no avail. Can anyone recommend anything I haven't tried yet? Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for all the great info! So here is where I stand thus far. My neighbor is a surgical tech. She got me into a surgeon that looked at it today. They are going to remove it on Friday and send it out. The night I found my lump, I immediately wrote to the Komen Foundation asking them for referrals. They never got back to me. I am hoping that is was just either my email for them got lost or their response was lost. The Dr. said today with my familial history that I must be terrified. To say the least. Sadly, I will never be able to relax. Looks like I have passed this hurdle though. Thank you all again so very much!!",
