      "Content": "I have had mammograms done since I was 34 because of fibroid cysts. I thought I was being really responsible and taking care of myself.  After 8 yrs. of getting mammo's, I found my own tumor at 41,  three months after a mammo. I now feel like all the radiation from them may have caused the breast cancer to form.   I finished my treatments in April of 07 and  had my first mammo follow up 6 months later.  The radiologist recommended that I get MRI's also. I did, and now I would like to just get the MRI instead of both every year, but CHP won't allow me to.  They are going to make me get a mammogram and then 6 months later they say I can  schedule an MRI.   Everything in me is saying not to get another mammo, but what do I do for follow up and peace of mind??    ",
