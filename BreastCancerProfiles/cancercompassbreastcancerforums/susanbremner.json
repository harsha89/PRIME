    "Content": "you are the best mother and grandmother, you fought cancer 25 years ago . we were blessed when you became cancer free, At 80 years old cancer came back you did well for a good 2years , now it's taking over your body. But not your spirit. You still have your beautiful smile and great humour. I know things are ending but not our love for you, itÂ  will NEVER end. love you mommy",
