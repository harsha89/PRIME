It seems to me that after prolonged use both create the same joint and bone stiffness, swelling and pain. Recently, I have been experiencing pain on the bottom of my leg so that it is hard for me wear shoes. I also get cramping in my toes at night. I really don't know what to do as I don't want to get used to pain killers. I took Darvocet for a while, but one of my doctors told me that 'it is a bad drug,\" so i stopped. In addition, I am also taking Lexapro for depression and clonazepam for anxiety. I wonder if any one else experienced these side effects. Before my breast cancer the only medication I took was Darvocet, as i have spinal stenosis. Now, I have a medicine cabinet full of drugs and i still can't sleep at night. I need help!!!!  ",
