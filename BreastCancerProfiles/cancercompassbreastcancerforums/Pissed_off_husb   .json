    "Content": "I am a breast cancer husband two weeks post op. Yesterday my wife had severe burning under her left arm... and I mean severe! We had just left our plastic surgeons office and were at the pharmacy when it started. I called our surgeon and she said to bring her right back. She acted as if she had no clue as to what was causing the pain... but after everything i have just read, i have my doubts to this! My question is this... Isn't it a little suspicious that not a single surgeon will admit that this pain is for real! After yesterday, I know it's real. I challenge any surgeon who reads this to tell me different! And, if any surgeon or pain specialist is reading this, there are obviously millions of women... and husbands out there that could use your help. So speak up. For all the women who have shared their knowledge on this subject, I truly thank you. I wish someone,(one of her surgeons) had mentioned this possibility before sugery so that we could have been more prepared. I pray for an answer for my wifes, and anyone else who suffers from this pain.",
