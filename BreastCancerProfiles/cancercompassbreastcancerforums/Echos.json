    "Content": "Hi everyone... I know I'm new here and I hope i'm not being intrusive, but I heard about this movie, Living Proof, that will be on lifetime tv tomorrow night (the 18th) at 9pm. It\u2019s a real touching true story based on the book Her-2, which if you don\u2019t know is about the oncologist and researcher Dr. Dennis Slamon, and his struggle behind developing the drug Herceptin and getting it approved. As a result of his efforts thousands of lives have been saved. I think it will be a touching movie and I wanted to share it with everyone here. There is more information right here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0F__IfeUXg God Bless",
