    "Content": "Hi, First time on here and not sure what to say. I am a breast cancer survivor of 2 yrs and in the last couple of days under breast where I had half removed is swelling and there is some pain. Refuse to go through chemo and radiation again so have not been to doctor or told anyone. Is this how your problem started or was it different? Do not know too many technical terms so need just a plainspoken person to answer me. If you could help any way please contact me.",
