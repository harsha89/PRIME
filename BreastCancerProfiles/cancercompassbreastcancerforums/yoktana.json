      "Content": "My beloved friend, only 40 years old, two beautiful little kids, got breast cancer stage 4 :( I want to do what's best for her, but it's hard! My way is to search and ask, but since it all started, they (my friend and her husband) kind of shut down and overwellmed (i hope i get my english right) after just 2 opinions they got :( What should I do? I dont want to push her, but I want them to have more information! She started chimo, and plan to do the surgery and hormonal treatment later, and didnt know to tell me why! They first found the cancer in her lymph, but I don't know if it's in other places, after they scanned. please advice me wether I should push her, and what's the best way :( I want to remember that it's their story and choice, and not mine, but it's so hard...",
