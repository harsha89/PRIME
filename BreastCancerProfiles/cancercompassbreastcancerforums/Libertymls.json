    "Content": "My brother in law has just been diagnosed with stage 3 prostate cancer. He does not have Internet. The doctors are giving him hormone shots and starting radiation next wk. He is interested in alternate treatment. I said I'd try to find info for him. I am totally overwhelmed by the different options. The building up the immune system sounds like the key... if anyone has info on this please send it to me. He has a terrible diet. He eats fast foods and sugar and fried food and lots of meats. I did tell him to stop eating sugar and processed food. I looked at the cottage cheese flax oil diet, the entire thing is very complicated. So I got him some flax oil capsules, vitamin E (natural) and selenium. Any other suggestions would be very welcome. (Oh, he doesnt read much either. I said I'd try to sort out info to send him)",
