      "Content": "This thread is pretty old but it seems I'm one of the 'victims' of the itchy rash due to taking Anastrozole.  I began taking the pill post radiation in April 2015.  Within a week I developed an itchy rash.  When I discussed with my radiation oncologist and my regular oncologist they both thought I was crazy.  After 16 months of dermatologist and allergist visits, changing products and laundry detergents I still couldn't get relief.  I finally decided to discontinue all my meds (except the anastrazole).  Mostly because another call to my oncologist said that itchy patchy skin isn't even listed as a rare side effect.  In June I had enough!  Quit the arimidex and seemed to get better.  Not knowing if it was the only culprit I began to reintroduce other products (laundry detergent, etc), foods, etc and still had the rash under control.  At last, I reintroduced the anastrazole and within one week I was itching and scratching like a mad woman.  This has been so debilitating!  So after two weeks, this monday I quit using the anastrazole again.  The very first day I was no longer itching.  Next step will be to contact the oncologist to try a different med. I can't believe how much money and time I've wasted on trying to figure this out! ",
