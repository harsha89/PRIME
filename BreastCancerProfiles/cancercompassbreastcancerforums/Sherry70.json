      "Content": "Hi I am 54 and was dx in May 2007 and have just finished tmt.  I too keep hearing it is rare. I have seen others on this site with this type so it can't be that rare. I think it is seen less than an  estrogen driven type. I hope we see more information regarding this type. Hangin there and Good luck to you.  Let us see a cure for this disease.",
