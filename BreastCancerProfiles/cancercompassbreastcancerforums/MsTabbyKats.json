      "Content": "Long story short....doctor wants me on arimidex.  Medically speaking, I am inclined to agree. However...statistically it improves my life expectancy by 6 months and reduces the chance of recurrance from 18% to 10%. Side effects of arimidex are significantly higher. I'm into quality of life...not quantity.  And it seems everyone has some side effect. Is there anyone who just takes the pill....without side effects?",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October . I am er/pr positive and her2 negative. Perhaps a month or 2 before the diagnosis I smelled a \"sweet cream corn\" scent when I took off my underpants. Since it wasn't unpleasant I didn't pay much attention. But, it hasn't recurred since the lumpectomy. I never mentioned it to anyone.",
