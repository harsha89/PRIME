    "Content": "For anyone who has this specific cancer, did you have a lumpectomy done, or a mastectomy? It seems to me that if you have a mastectomy that your chances of cancer not coming back would be increased. I'd like to hear from women who opted for the lumpectomy, telling me if their cancer ever came back, and how long it's been from when the lumpectomy was done and when, if ever, the cancer ever came back.",
