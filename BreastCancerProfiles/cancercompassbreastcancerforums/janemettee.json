      "Content": "My oncologist said to take fish oil not flax seed since flax is a phytoestrogin, and since we are trying to reduce the estrogen in our system. I gave away the flax seed oil to a friend who does not have our problem.  I dont know if all MDs agree with this but I am doing what she reccomeded.  I have stiff joints all over until I move around and lots of wrist pain. I just went from Arimidex to Aromasin to see if this helps.  I also am taking Naproxin twice a day. I want to stay on the AIs since I know they are an important treatment.  Hope you are well. Jane",

(I only stopped going due to an accident whereby I am recovering from a severely broken leg.)  Anyway, I would highly recommend accupuncture for pain relief.  It is so much better than taking yet another chemical medicine that you don't know what new side affects will result. Good luck to all. Accupuncture, a great idea. I have used it and it does work.",

I've been eating them daily for nutritional purposes along with Dr. Barlean's Omega fish oil but will now only take the latter.   I am 56, have stage 1 ER positive breast cancer, had 2 surgeries to remove the tumor, none in the lymph node, 7 weeks of daily radiation, and after a lot of deliberation, as of Dec.7th 2011, have been on Aromasin. I have knee pain which is so far bearable but now I have shoulder pain and lower back pain. I want to attribute it to my weekly yoga and zumba workouts but after reading all the posts I'm sure it's from the medication. Has anyone taken less of a dose and been successful? And/or has anyone found natural alternatives that have kept them cancer free? Unfortunately, we are all just guinea pigs for Dr's and gold mines for the pharmaceutical companies. I wish you all a long and healthy life! Aromasin gives me stiffness in all joints even my back and bearable pain in some joints. I do yoga and a stretching and toning class. If I did not do this I think the joints would solidify. I do have to be careful not to strain the joints or I will have increased pain. Arimidex was much worse.  My tumor was similar to yours stage 1 with negative nodes. However I was also HER2 pos. which is more agressive. I am \"cancer free\" now and want to stay that way so I put up with it. I think a lower dose would block the estrogen less and not be as effective. There have been studies that prove Aromasin prevents reoccurance compared to not taking it. I see on this blog women who chose not to take it. It is a very personal decision. You might want to get online the Breast Cancer Advisor by Dr. Sylvano Martino a newsletter from the Angeles Clinic Foundation. She is a breast cancer specialist and a wonderful woman. It is very informative. Wishing you the best, Jane",

She wants me to wait 2 weeks and then try femara.  i am enjoying the 2 week wait, as the pain is subsiding a bit.  My feet ankles and knees were the worst.  At times my thumb will not even bend unless i use my other h and and bend it, which is very painful. Wow!  I think of Aromasin as my second menopause. Joint pain, memory loss, brain fog...I have friends with arthritis who said it developed or became worse after menopause. My joints were very painful on Arimidex and better on Aromasin. Hopefully the Femara will work better for you. Jane",

      "Content": "I began with Arimidex in May 2009. After 6 months I had such severe pain in my wrists I had to hold a cup with both hands. I went off it 3 weeks and got better (not good but better).  I started Aromisin Nov 2009 and began taking Aleve 800mg in the AM and PM. Gradually I just took Aleve just at night to sleep because all my joints hurt when I did not move around. After 6 months of Aleve the pain gradually was mostly gone.  I am still taking aromisin and I am very stiff in all joints and have to treat my wrists with care. I take a stretching and toning class and a gentle yoga at the gym. This keeps my joints more flexible.  With out movement it feels like my joints want to solidify. Hopefully your pain will resolve in time like mine did. Jane",

I have just completed my first year of daily anastrozole (arimidex) and am having a lot of problem with trigger thumb.I had tendinitis in both thumbs and pain in both wrists and carpal tunnel I had joint pain all over but so bad in my wrists I needed to use two hands to pick up a cup of coffee. After going to my primary MD and an orthopedist I realized it was from the Arimidex and I went to my oncologist who took me off the med for 3 weeks. He then put me on Aromisin which has been easier to tolerate. It works a little different. I still had joint pain and stiffness for 31/2 years. About 2 months ago the pain went away leaving me with only stiffness. ....I will be finished with it in 14 months. I wonder if the stiffness will go away or if this is the new me. My joints feel older than the rest of my body. I used Naprosin for pain relief. I am happy to have good treatments and glad to be alive but it is at best annoying. Jane",
