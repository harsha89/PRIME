There are so many family friends our paster and people we dont even know praying me you and that is why i am doing everythng i can to make sure i do stay right here with all of you so i can see my son get done with college and watch my daugther go to college and one of them to give me my first grand babys. Watch them get married . And my 4 year old i beg god not to let him grow up with out a mom . I try not to cry in front of them so i go to the bathroom and my bebroom or when my husband and i are all alone those are the times i cry.i am going throught the treat meant i have three more to go then 5 years of the chemo pill and i pray to god it works .i am only 42 years old my babys cant grow up without there mom and my husband and i have plans to grow old together and watch are grand babies grow .my family is my life body heart and soul . I just dont know what i would do if i knew i was going to lose them all. Knowing my husband would be all alone trying to caring on with out me by his side.
