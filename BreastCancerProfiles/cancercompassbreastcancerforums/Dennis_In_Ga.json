      "Content": "I took immunocal and it along with an alkaline diet,alkaline water and avoiding sugar (Use stevia) My cancer is gone. Immunocal. In Dr's PDR under Immunotec FDA Approved to build Gluththione and some insurance co's and medicare,medicaid pay for it in SOME STATES. PEMF machine and Rife Machine. But the Immunocal is FDA approved to build glutathione . I have quite a few research pdf papers on it if you email and request it , I will forward to you. It has helped 8 other locally to reverse their different type cancers.. It is the kind of thing that you have to try it yourself for 90 days and then you will likely be like me and want everyone to try it. But don't forget the other things. Alkaline diet (most alternative and some Dr's say cancer thrives in an acid body. Avoid sugar like the plague (more Dr's are also telling patients this also. Cola's are heavy in acid and sugar and sugarless or artificial sweeteners are even worse. ANYWAYÂ  \"IT WORKED FOR ME!\" Dennis",
