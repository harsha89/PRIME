Do you have cancer; do you have any clue what it is like to be diagnosed? What are you selling? motherofpatient,     I don't believe he was selling anything. What is your (your daughters) doctor/oncologist selling you? And how is that working for you? Can I ask you, How much of \"the tons of information they dump on you\" do you really understand? Or,If you leave the doctors office confused and unsure,what does that tell you? Maybe you just need some good (helpful) information that won't leave you confused and or scared...I don't have cancer and I don't know what it's like to be diagnosed, but I do know what fear is...A better understanding of cancer and what's actually available to heal it, leaves little room for fear....I wish you,and your daughter the best outcome.   Sincerely dave You apparently assume I am an idiot. I dare say I am very educated in teh medical field and do understant all the BS you are peddling so stop trying to intimiated patients with your \"big\" words and stop acting like an expert. I'll put my degrees up against your any day. I do not leave confused - you are trying to frighten patients into thinking you are some kind of an expert. Post your education credentials and let us see where you got your \"training.\"",

And your (attitude) does determine your altitude. Arimidex, in case you were wondering,inhibits the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogen. But the body requires estrogen. Blocking it's normal synthesis in the body seems foolish,to me, and results in osteoporosis, osteonecrosis (bone death),heart disease and who knows what else...I'm just saying.  The better way to go is (putting) natural estrogens,plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) into the body to competitively inhibit the synthetic estrogens and other estrogenic chemicals (found in everything from plastics to perfumes), and which are the real culprits in breast and other cancers, because they cause unregulated/accelerated cellular proliferation and tumor growth. Natural estrogens don't do that! I wouldn't use soy, probably the most genetically modified plant on the planet.I'd go with Red clover, which actually has more phytoestrogens than soy. In fact, as you may or may not know, ALL green plants contain phytoestrogens, so juicing greens is excellent for breast cancer. Oatmeal, flaxseed, turmeric, fish oil all have their place, and are good choices.I'd put yogurt and yeast with the oatmeal. All excellent healers of the GI tract. 60 percent, it is said, of your immune system is in your bowls. Healthy, functioning bowls dramatically boost your immune system...Co-enzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) is made in the body from amino acids, B vitamins (yeast being one of the richest sources of B-vitamins and amino acids),and vitamin E. In fact CoQ10 is similar in structure to Vit E. CoQ10 is found in high amounts in fish oils, which you use, Olive oil (up to 160mg/kg, which might be the highest),meats, and greens like broccoli and spinach, both very good for breast cancer. CoQ10 the \"supplement\" may or may not work, in my opinion. I hope some of this was helpful. Successfully treating breast cancer is simple. A well-rounded plan, is the key. I'd be glad (honoured) to help you in any way I can... I wish you the best outcome.  And if it's ok with you, I want to pray for you. You need the prayers and I need the practice.        Sincerely       Dave Telling cancer patients to take estrogen of any kind is dangerous - ER cancers feed off estrogen. Your information is dangerous becasue you do not understand breast cancer in all its forms. Estrogne must be blocke in ER positive cancers.",
