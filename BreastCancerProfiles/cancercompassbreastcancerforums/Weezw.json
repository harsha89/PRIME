    "Content": "Your post was interesting to read; I don't feel alone now knowing that you and others experience the same physical symptoms and also share similar thoughts. Mentally I too have my bad days and do at times struggle ; I try and have a positive mental attitude. It is 2 yrs 4 months and 20 days since completing all of my treatment and I am learning to adjust to the side effects. This is not easily done. I feel there does need to be more information about radiotherapy and the side effects; but with advances in treatment and delivery of more targeted radiotherapy in the future maybe with less treatment sessions patients may not experience the discomforts that we endure. I am grateful for supportive sights such as this.",
