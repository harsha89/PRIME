      "Content": "Breastcancer.org is a great site for info and I hope the moderator is not offended but the women there are a fountain of knowledge and long term survivors some of them.  Best advice also from John Hopkins asktheexpert.com as she is a two time BC survivor.  I know they will include \"get a 2nd and 3rd opinion\" in their responses, preferably at a center that is renowned for their work with BC patients.    www.breastcancer.org  ",

      "Content": "I had to tear off my HRT patch after my dx and OMG the hot flashes were brutal.  Along with the withdrawal from the general well being of estrogen in my system, I might add.  Tried Tamoxifen, Evista and now Femera.  A year and two months later, hot flashes have gone from one every 20 minutes to one every hour.  I will retry Femara one more time; I had to quit it for a time as my job performance suffered to the point it was noticeable :(...  I have noticed taking in plenty of fluid (water, jello, melons) seems to decrease the intensity of the Hot Flashes noticeably.  And when I am dehydrated (drank too much coffee is more like it), the hot flashes are more debilitating (in that I sit up, say \"WTH????\", then \"oh, a hot flash\" then tingling, the heat, the abundant perspiration (and my standing in front of the nearest fan or freezer) and then finally, the end of it, feeling like I had been hit in the head by a 2 x 4, every 20 minutes.  Sleeping was a feat, I felt sleep med addiction was preferable to my walking around like an ill-kempt, sleep-deprived aging woman for a while. Keeping busy also helps :) and keeping a sense of humor or rather a sense of the ridiculous.  I have so many things to do and now they don't even matter anymore.  Who'd've thunk it would turn out like this.",
