      "Content": "My mother is suffering from Breast Cancer stage 4. She has already undergone 6 Chemotherapies. Her cancer has spread to the Bone. We are looking for treatement options and came across HIFU. Does this work for Breast cancer? She is currently in India. Are there any treatement centres in Asia? She can get treatement in USA but she won't be covered by insurance. Any idea on the expenses if it is in US? Any information is highly appreciated. Sincerly, Srini",
