      "Content": "I'm 52 and have been having mammograms since I was 37 due to my mother having breast cancer. Just had my last one 3 weeks ago and as usual it came back clear. For the last 4-5 months my right breast has felt uncomfortable. Not sure how to describe it as it's not a throbbing pain and only comes and goes. I have really large dense breasts with lots of lumps and bumps so I'm never even sure if I felt a cancerous lump if I would even know what it was. If the mammo was clear should I just write the pain off as part of menopause? It just bothers me because I only feel it in one breast.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I am wondering if it is hormonal as I just stopped my periods about 7 months ago. I very rarely drink caffeine. No coffee no tea. Maybe 1 soda a month. I'll talk to my doctor about it soon. It's bothering enough that I just feel I need to have it checked even if it is only to put my mind at ease.",

I would feel better with some type of ultrasound or MRI. I have an appt scheduled in Sept with my doctor. He's pretty good about ordering tests if I have a concern. I have not heard of the PEM but it sounds like what I need. My mothers cancer was estrogen fed. I'm not sure what that means?!?! I hope you are doing well. :)",
