My husband found something that felt weird in my left breast and I went last week and had a mammogram and ultrasound. The dr ordered a biopsy for the following Monday. I was already scheduled for a hysterectomy this past Tuesday which went well! My Dr called me yesterday and gave me biopsy results. Invasive lobular carcinoma. Sounds like an alien invader. I\u2019m just trying to get answers. I meet with surgeon in one week. Wow. This is going to be a long week. Especially since I\u2019m stuck at home recovering from the hysterectomy! Any advice or knowledge would be greatly appreciated :) Thanks, Steph KempSorry so long and no one responded. I just joined this site. I was dx 2009 at age 38 also with 2 types of cancer. DIC & DCIS. I had radial double mastectomy, chemo, radiation, a year of herceptin through my port, then a 1/day tamoxifen for 5 years. You CAN overcome this!! I found out that 90% of the fight is your attitude toward it. Try to stay positive! Always smile! Try to laugh a lot! (Sounds crazy, but it truly helps.) I found that video recording my Dr appointments helped because I could go back and listen again because I had such an overload of information I couldn't take it all in at my appointments. I also kept a journal. That helps tramendously! I'll be praying for you! Chin up!! You WILL overcome this!! Keep me informed. Love and hugs??",
