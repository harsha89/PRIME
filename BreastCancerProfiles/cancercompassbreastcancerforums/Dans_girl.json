    "Content": "Hi, I, too, have fibrocystic breasts but have also developed fibroadenoma tumors--3 to be exact.  All benign. I would seek out the opinion of a surgeon that has alot of experience with diseases of the breast.  Technicians are not doctors and unless they have M.D. after their name I wouldn't listen to them.  They're your breasts.  To ease your mind, seek out a surgeon who specializes in breast surgery. Good luck. Dan's girl",
