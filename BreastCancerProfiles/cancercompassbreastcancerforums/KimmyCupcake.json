I was told I simply have dense breasts and don't worry. Fast forward one year, started having breast pain in Dec. Waited two months, made appt wit doc, had another mammo, US and nothing once again. Four weeks ago, started having armpit pain and arm pain on same side as lump/breast pain. Went back to primary doc and was told I had a swollen lymph node and was referred to surgeon. Had appt. with surgeon, she said all diagnostic tests showed nothing, lymph node no longer swollenÂ and the lump feels like just dense breast tissue. Said she could not explain armpit and arm pain. Recommended I take a gamma linolenci acid for 4 weeks and if pain persists to return and have possile MRI on shoulder to find out about armpit/arm pain. Surgeon said she would biopsy lump if I wanted but did not recommend a biopsy at this point. Has anyone here that has been diagnosed had these symptoms? Should I wait or go ahead and have the biopsy?I had a hysterectomy 7 weeks ago and complications after led to a second surgery the morning of the surgery I told the nurses I had a horrible sharp pain in my left breast. They said I probably just pulled a muscle. Fast forward 2 weeks there is a distinct lump and a sharp stabbing pain still in the same spot hot compresses down work, topic creams don't work... Dr says to give myself a little time to heal. Fast forward again to my 6 week checks up to clear me from surgery. I tell her the lump seems bigger and I can no longer go at all without a bra my left breast (on the upper edge closest to my underarm) hurts all the time and now I also feel these jolts of pain that seem to shoot out from the lump to my nipple. It's to the point if do more then brush up against something it really hurts! I think I must have an infection or a nasty cyst. I went in today for a mammogram and they did an ultrasound also. Right breast Mamo was only slightly uncomfortable left breast ... I wanted to scream. But the Dr said both mammogram and ultrasound only showed normal breast tissue .... But she said she could feel a \"substantial\" lump in the side of my breasts and her ultrasound wand rolled over it like it rolled over a log. She is now sending me to a suergeon that is a breast specialist. I have alway been BIG chested but don't know about density. She said infection is not a possibility and a cyst would show up on both tests pretty easily. It never even crossed my mind this could be cancer until the Dr said that some breast cancer doesn't appear on these tests and the pain I described was \"concerning and specific\" ... Does anyone know if there is anything else other then cancer that could cause this... I have looked online and everything I found said : infection, cyst, or cancer I am only 38 so this was my first mammogram ever.",
