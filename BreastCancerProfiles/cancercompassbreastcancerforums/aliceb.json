Thank you all for your input.  It really helps, as I do have a decision to make.  I truly hope they can find a resolution. I've suddenly had severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.  It started when I had an extreme case of cellulitis in my breast in Oct, which ultimately led to my diagnosis.  After mastectomy and reconstruction, they tried a different med, and about a week later another reaction.  So, I can sympathize with the skin rashes and itches.  I hope they can find a compromise for you.  Maybe a different, similar drug.  Does anyone have sore mouth from taking arimidex?",
