He was advised 3-6 months best case scenario. He passed away March 1. He went peacefully. I'm sorry for all of you going through this with people you love. It's the hardest to watch someone slip away each day. I pray they find ways To detect this earlier and better treatment plan. Lauren",

      "Content": "My Stepdad was diagnosed with cancer in his spinal fluid today. He has battled lung cancer and then a brain tumor for the last 4 1/2 years. He recently was declared cancer free after many CT scans. But in the Last 4 weeks developed vertigo, double vision, trouble with balance, hearing loss, And sciatic nerve pain. They have been treating him for just the vertigo for 2 weeks And he has since developed other symptoms that made his neurologist consider an LC diagnosis. He was admitted for lumbar puncture yesterday and received the results today. They advised he had 2-4 weeks without treatment. I am devastated. Lauren",
