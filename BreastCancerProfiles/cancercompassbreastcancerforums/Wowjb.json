    "Content": "Gina, I know what you are going through. I am in my early twenties, and my mom has been battling with cancer for 13 years. She has been battling stage IV for the past year now, and she doesn't have much time left. She is extremely independent and is my idol much like your mom is yours. I live at college about an hour away from home, and don't get to see her much. She has been bed ridden for weeks, so she doesn't leave the house, but I call her often and we have long talks. Over the summer I moved home and spent days just sitting with her. I recommend just talking with her like you normally would. Let the conversation flow where it needs to, but if you need to tell her how scared for her and proud of her strength or things like that tell her. She may not want someone hovering, and yes she will get frustrated at not being able to do certain things, but she loves you, as my mom loves me, and my mom may get snippy but we say what we need to, have our cries and know that if we take it a day at a time it will be ok. My mom and I have covered things from wills, to treatments, to me leaving for school worried I am going to abandon her, and it never gets easier, but I would rather tell her, than never get the chance. I am so sorry about your sister. I had a cancer scare myself this year and my mom freaked. I hope I helped, even in a tiny way. I guess with not being able to help my mom I feel like if I try to help other people who have mothers dying of cancer then in a way my mom won't die in vain.",
