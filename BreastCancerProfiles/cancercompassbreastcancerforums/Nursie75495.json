    "Content": "My mammogram was 3D and showed one tumor, but the breast MRI turned up three more.  There is also something called PEM (proton emission mammography, like a PET scan for breasts) which is better for dense breasts.  That your mother had breast cancer (do you know if she had any of the gene mutations?) and you only feel this in one breast SHOULD bother you.  Get it followed up on.  If need help finding providers, holler at me.  Good luck--",
