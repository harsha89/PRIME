    "Content": "Hello everyone..my Name is Laurel. I have a 33 yr. old sister who has battled breast cancer for the last year. I am sorry, but I do not know the specific mm of the tumors or all the lingo you all seem to know. I do know that my sister Heather had three positive nodes and has had a radical masectomy of her left breast. Tonight I got a phone call from sissy. Friday she is scheduled to have her Ovaries removed. She is scared to death that her voice will change, grow facial hair, and have sexual side effects. I need to add..her husband found another women during her chemo treatment and has since left her with two children. Can anyone shed light into the side effects of this procedure and, will this change her dramitically for the dating/physicall experiences she will have in the future? I would love to have comments as soon as possible. Please helpp...Friday is coming soon. I must add too..If this has been a successful procedure for many women/ no reoccurence could you also respond.Thank you ahead for all that respond...My prayers and thoughts go out to all of you..May God give you strength and endurance Laurel",
