I am sorry that it's taken me so long to reply.  I completely understand your feeling of fear.  I have what I believe to be an excellent oncologist after seeing two that I was completely uncomfortable and unhappy with.  I live in the Denver, Colorado area.  Where are you located?  Can you share with me what happened at your visit and maybe we can go from there with what I have experienced so far and what you might expect?  Is this feeling too personal for you?  The reason I'm asking is because quite honestly I don't know exactly where to begin in telling you what to expect.  I am willing to tell you anything and everything I can to help you.  If this forum is too public for you, perhaps there's a way to communicate via email.  Otherwise, this is fine with me.  Are you feeling as scared as you were, or was your oncologist able to explain things and give you some reassurance?  How are you doing emotionally?  I am a Christian and believe fully in God's presence, power to heal, and ability to give us peace.  The bible says Jesus is the Prince of Peace.  I will be praying for you.  Even though God knows who you are, I wish I could pray for you by name.  None the less, you are now in my prayers!  God Bless You!  Michelle  ",
