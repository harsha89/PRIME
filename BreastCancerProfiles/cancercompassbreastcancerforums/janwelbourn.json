So now they think that might of rebroke them.   The radiation stays in your body.  It's something I have to live with.  My muscles between the ribs knot up and all the nerves are exposed and nerves can really hurt.   First find out if they are fractured or broken.  Don't wrap them.  That causes pneumonia they say. Good luck. Thank you for your comments.  My thought exactly about the physical therapy.  I went without the X-ray and I was sure it hurt me more.  So I stopped.  Just gotX-rays last week so we shall see, but no more physical therapy until I find out what is happening.  I will keep you posted.  The side effects from radiation are forever it seems.",

      "Content": "Hi:  Thank you for your honest assessment of what radiation can cause that is not completely disclosed to us before undergoing the treatment.  My oncologist acted like it was nothing and I should just suck it up when I started having burning pain from the terrible burns under my breasts and refused to give me pain meds.  My Primary care saw the condition I was in with open sores and she prescribed some medication that got me through the worst of it.  About half way through my treatment I started having severe pain when I bent over.  Just on the side that was being radiated.  It has continued when I bend or twist.  I do need to try and get some myofacial release done, but have not found anyone where I live that is good.  Just touching my rib area causes such pain I know that would really be excruciating, but I would take it if I could find someone that knew what they were doing.  I have fibromyalgia so any pain is compounded so I have to be careful about making already painful areas worse.  Many people, in the medical field, told me that I should sue my radiation oncologist for over radiating me and causing all these problems, but I did not want to do it.  They know now that they should only give about 1/2 of the radiation that I got to someone with DCIS cancer.   I am sorry you are going through so much and hope you get better.  The lung situation sounds really bad.  I have had some really bad coughs since my cancer treatment, but thank God I got over it.   Once again, thank you for telling your story it makes me feel like I am not alone.  All the ladies I know that have had radiation have not experienced what I have.  So I guess we are the unlucky ones. Take Care",

So sorry for your broken ribs. At least my dr acknowledged that it was the radiation that did it.  But, she did not offer any treatment except physical therapy which is kind of scary with broken ribs.  Some days I cant do much because of the pain.  I definitely would have stopped a week or two sooner with the radiation after then had burned me up.  I should have just quit then, but after a week off I went back for 7 days of the big bomb the called it.  I don't think I would have gone for it if I had known.   Sure would like to know if there is another treatment for the broken ribs and adhesions.",
