    "Content": "In January 2007 I sought medical help for a growth on my breast. I was diagnosed with an infection and given antibiotics. The growth shrunk significately but never went away completely. On a Friday I finally decided to seek my family doctor's opion. At first look he said he'd bet me 99% I had IBC. Within an hour I had a mammogram, the doctor that read the xray said he had not seen a growth like that but said I needed to see an oncologist immediately. The only biopsy the doctors in my area wanted to perform was a needle biopsy and thank goodness my family doctor had talked with some colleagues and they said a punch biopsy should be done. That sent me looking for a competent hospital. Thanks to CTCA I decided on Monday to go to Zion and within a week I started treatment. I wish I could say I'm cancer free, matastized to my lung in June of 2010, but with all the help of the Dietitian and Naturopathic doctor I have been able to have a good quality of life.",
