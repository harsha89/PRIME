    "Content": "My friend has a pretty aggressive breast cancer. Had surgery (double mastectomy) 2X radiation, 3X chemotherapy. Now has her 5th recurrence is to the chest skin. Her blood counts have been very low and may not tolerate another round of chemo. Any ideas? There's a treatment being used in Europe successfully for skin mets \"Meltrex\" I think. Anyone hear of this? Please help with any suggestions. Thank you",
