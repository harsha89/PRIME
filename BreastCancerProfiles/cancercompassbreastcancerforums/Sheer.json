      "Content": "Hi I don't know how I ended up on this message board but I guess I'm meant to help you ladies! I lost a friend to breast cancer last year and she was on Tamoxifen. I had read an article on the side effects of this drug and kept asking her to speak to her doctor but she thought that she was under the best doctors! The cancer returned on her Liver. I have the article \"Tamoxifen Dangers\" in a PDF Format and would be happy to forward it you if you email me. This article is by Sherrill Sellman:  Book \"Hormone Heresy - What Women MUST Know About Their Hormones\"  http://www.ssellman.com/ I hope this will help.     ",
