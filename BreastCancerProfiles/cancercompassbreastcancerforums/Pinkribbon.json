      "Content": "I just found this site. I am sorry to read about the pain you are having. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer almost 3 years ago. Had the masectomy, TAC chemo, and 6 weeks of radiation. It was found in my sternum and breast area 3-06. Inoperable and did 12 treatments of chemo -Gemzar and Taxotre along with 6 more weeks of radiation. Finished radiation in October, had a CT to find out the cancer has spread into the lungs and liver. I have been told it is aggresive because the lesions are innumerable and resistant to the chemo I just completed. Now I have Completed 2 weeks of Xyloda pill form of chemo.1500mg 2 times a day. I need to know what is in store for me. Please anyone who has been through this let me know what to expect. I have an 8 year old whom I am trying to prepare about death. Pain was something I did not think about and I am now questioning, quality of life issues. Most Sincere.Bette",

My grandma is 81 and was diagnosed first with liver cancer by one doctor, this was on Wed, May 23, 2007. Lesions were found on and ultrasound. Understandably, my mom is freaking out. I am 30, also the oldest \"kid\" and \"grandkid.\" So then grandma says her breast looks \"different\" like a day later. She sees another doctor and sure enough breast cancer into the gland. Here's where it gets confusing..she gets a MRI, X-ray and all of this liver function tests and breast biopsey.The two drs. aren't communicating and they are each telling her different things. One says she has cancer, the other says she's fine. She was even set up for a surgery that she didn't know was a masectomy!! Thank God my Mom had figured all of this out when she realized grandma had two surgery appointments on the same day. My Mom ended up somehow getting a head of staff-lady to interviene.  Finally, last friday she saw a specialist (at a different place) and he re-did the MRI cuz the other one was \"nonconclusive\" aka LOST!! So this specialist said \"yes, she has liver cancer, but not sure how bad cuz we don't know how long it's been there. But, she does have a growth on her hip bone\" so, now grandma is to see a cardiologist next week??? what??? Has anyone else experienced such a fiasco?? Grandma says she feels fine (except she sleeps all the time) and she has all this confused, but I guess I'm not 80 and I'm confused. Oh, and my grandpa also found out last week he has a \"spot\" on his lungs  Why is it that when other people aren't going through rough times they act as if it's \"no big deal\"..I actually had a \"friend\" that I was there for 2years ago when her dad died tell me last night that I was \"selfish and I had a pathetic life\" because I wouldn't go out to a stupid bar with her..She had gotten ready and then I told her my headache was too bad to leave the house...I really don't understand people. Xoxo    I am very sorry to hear all that you are going through. You are a fine woman to be there for your family! You are very fortunate to have family. I have terminal met's breast cancer. I am married with a son 22 daughter 21 and a boy who will be 9. You find out very quickly who your real friends are in a moment of crisis. Some do not know how to handle it so they disappear. It is so unfortunate you have all of this going on. Talk with your grandmother and find out all you can about her and her life- same with your grandfather. The time you spend with them will mean alot in the future, so you can pass the stories down to your children. My mother died while I was 19. I have no idea who she really was. My children KNOW who I am because any chance I get I talk with them about my childhood ect... The reason I have no family is because after my father's death- my siblings tore me apart with bickering ect over the estate.I have not spoken to them in years. It is not Christian, but it helps my family and my sanity. Do what you need to- and thoughts are with you.  ",

But with that said, we found out last week that it is now on the liver.  Found through a CAT scan .  I have been on a blinded trial for \"avistan\" and so they (the docs.) are going to find out if I was actually getting the drug or not...  If not, I will immediatly start gettting it. Will be getting a PET scan on Thursday and am terrified that things really will be as bad as they are.  Is there anyone out there going thru anything like me??? I am trying not to think about it being on an organ, but I know nobody in my area with anything like this.  Even at the clinic, I am the youngest person usually there (am 39).  Not too many people with mets breast cancer stage IV. Yancy Hi Yancy, Yes I am going through the same thing. I had stage two right side breast cancer.Jan. of 04. I asked for the most aggresive treatment. I had a complete masectomy, 6 cycles of the T.A.C. protocol, and 6 weeks of radiation, daily. Was finished with 4 surgeries to reconstruct the breast. I had a GAM flap done. The saline was finished stretching the expanders and I was to have the surgery in March. All the while seeing the oncologist who never ordered blood work. I complained of pain in the sternum and was told it was the expanders presssing on the sternum. I finally went to a pain clinic. I was diagnosed March of 06 with Stage 4 non operable metasized cancer measuring 5cm x 6cm. The cancer had invaded the sternum. Cancer was also found in my nodes on the neck. I went to a University who told me to get my affairs in order. The next appointment I was told I would have 9 treatments of Gem. and Taxol. I went back the following  week for the taxol.12 treatments in all, it was to be 18. 2 weeks on, one weeek off. I was told they could do no more and to get radiation. I went back to my original radiologist, who later read my University report that stated the cancer was now in the liver and the lungs. I was never told this. I was treated with 6 more weeks of radiation. I have reached the max. amount allowed. I found a new Dr. and am on xeloda. I find out Friday how far the cancer has spread. This Dr. DOES do blood work!  A CT was ordered. My red cell count was low and the cancer is active once again. Triple negative means you do not have other drug options. 15% of us are triple negative, while the majority are HR Positive. That is where all the research dollars go. We have a survival rate of two to five years after diagnosis. I have come to accept my fate. I may try CCofA. I am wondering about the radiation where they do an incision and radiate the tumors from inside. I asked the University Dr. about this and the Avastin. Concerning the lung radiation, her words,\"if they shrink all the tumors you will have no lungs left\" .This coming from the University Dr. who never told me about the spread. When I mentioned the Avastin I could see the surprized look on her face. Obviously she took me for a complete idiot. Her response was, \"hmm, that is a thought.\" Needless to say I did my own research and found a Dr. who was recruiting and taking part in the Avastin research. This new oncologist  has been wonderful. He answers my questions honestly. I told him upfront all I had been through. I only wish I knew of him sooner. So yes, you are not the only one. I have an 8 year old and have already started to explain that I am sick and may die soon. We wrote a book together explaining the cancer. My heart goes out to you. This is a very difficult path we have to take. My prayers and thoughts are with you. May you find a cure and strength to carry you for many, many, many more years of life. Bette",

Her hands and feet haven't been effected and there aren't any other side effects except this awful fatigue. She also has Parkinson's disease and the Xeloda seems to be effecting her temors as well. She doesn't want to continue until she gets blood work and scans done to see if it's working. No one has told us that she has experienced more mets, just that her bloodwork is edging to the \"top normal range\" indicating that if we do nothing, something is going to \"come back\". She had a rod put in her femur in Nov 2006 but the lab results taken from the 10cm lesion were negative for malignancy. She had radiaiton on that area. Her latest bone scan showed three \"suspicious\" areas-one in her sternum and two in her pelvic bones. An orthopedic oncologist said that the pelvic ones were not cancer spots (he called them osteitis condensans ilii) but couldn't comment on the sternum because of the technoligist's technique. her liver showed mild heterogenous changes but with no lesion. That's why her oncologist put her on Xeloda. This treatment is being called \"preventative\". Can you expect any signifcant results after just two courses? She's taking 2 500 mg pills twice a day. Her doctor did cut her back to 1 500 mg twice a day just to get her to keep taking it. They said she needs to take it until her \"disease\" progresses. Has anyone else gotten so fatigued that they want to stop and what did you do about it? Is 150 mg of any benefit in our situation? Has Xeloda caused anyone to die?  We have an appt this Thursday and I want to ask the right questions. Any answers to this rambling would be greatly appreciated.     Dear Redpen, My pyschatrist prescribed Adderall to help me with the fatigue. It is a little known treatment that oncologost over look.  They are not trying to care for an 8 year old special needs child. I certainly understand how your Mom feels. There have been times, even on the Adderall, that I want to give up and stop taking it. I have severe hand and foot syndrome. It hurts my hands and feet alot. I have medicine now prescribed to numb the nerves on the tips of the fingers and soles of my feet. It is a lotion. Do not let her give up. Research and find a Dr. who will listen, and tell him or her EXACTLY what you want, do not wait for them to offer. They just may not know about or think about different treatment options. I take 1500mg 2X a day. If you want more info or just to talk about side effects feel free to contact me privately. Bette, Chicago Area",

      "Content": "Linda Lou, Thank you for all of your information. I do have the blisters, my skin cracks at the joints, I can not turn on or off anything in early morning or late evening. I also noticed that my hip hurts. I think it must be the med because when I went back to the web-site it did say joint and muscle pain. No- I have not told the doctor, I do see him Tuesday so I am sure he will notice my hands. My  feet are red, and the skin has peeled off a couple of times. I wear cushion socks and slippers around the house. I do use the udder cream and any other product people recommend. It is starting to embaress me  when I am out in public. My young son will hit me or bump my hand and feet and he is always apologizing. I know it is an accident, but he feels bad because he can see how bad it hurts. I really have not  told the Dr. because this  is one of the last drugs I can use. I have used all the aggresive one's. I am receptor 3 negative so I am unable to use alot of the meds that are for estrogen positive cancer. I also am having an ultrasound to see if the cancer has spread to the ovary on the left side. During an exam she could tell something was not right and said it was very enlarged. So it is wait and see until I get the results. Sometimes I do not really believe how my life has changed in three years. Thank you for all the advice, I do appreciate the fact that people understand. This is very hard to deal with because I have always been very independent and did things myself. Take care , Bette",

      "Content": "Tinkerbell, Thank you for the reply, I did not see your first message. This is my 6th cycle. Last week my legs and feet were so swollen I could hardly walk. If touched the top of my feet it hurt. I have been elevating them high when I go to bed and this helped dramatically. The skin on my hands has peeled off many times and the skin by each joint is open and split, some more than others. I keep neosporin on them and cover my hands with gloves so that I can do my every day chores. I was able to get 2 scripts to rub on my hands and am now taking pain medication to prevent the nerve endings from causing the pain. I also have a deep faith that God has a reason for all that has happened in my life. It is hard because my youngest is 8 whom we adopted at birth but also has special needs. I worry most for him. Take care and have a Blessed Easter. Bette",

I am going for an ultra sound-- already went for the CT, they think now my left ovary has something. Recent exam was very painful on left side but originally went in because of pain on the right side. I can barely use my hands and it is hurting to walk. This is only my fifth treatment and I have read people are on it for years. I wear tons of creme on my hands and feet. I even bought gloves to wear during the day and driving. Any suggestions are welcome, I have been on all the strongest chemo dr;ugs and can no longer have radiation because I reached the maximum dosage, at least for the chest area. Thank you, Bette",
