      "Content": "I really hope you receive good news. When people say \"stay positive\" I sometime feel like throwing something at them. However, its the way to be. Keep positive for your son. There is only you knows whether to share this with your mum or not. My sister currently has lung cancer, and i remember my mum saying to her once.....\"you dont ever need to cry in private, because i will be here for you\". Confide in someone, and cry when you want to. I wish you the very best. Good luck ",

      "Content": "This is the first time i have visited the message board. I logged onto the site to find out more information about cancer in general. My sister has terminal lung cancer and my aunt has recently been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I logged onto this site tonight as today i found a lump in my breast. I am worried because so many people in my family have died of cancer. Im not feeling doom and gloom its just that i am concerned about my unborn child (im 20 weeks pregnant). Yours was the first message i read on the site and i cried. Im sure you miss your mum terrible. I cried because i know my world would fall apart if my mum died. I honestly dont know if you will ever get over losing your mother, but you will learn to deal with it. You will smile and laugh again. Perhaps what will keep you going right now is your own children. Be the best mum to them just as your mum was.  I wish you the very best.",
