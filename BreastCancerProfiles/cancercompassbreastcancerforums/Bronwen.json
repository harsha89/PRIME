    "Content": "I see this is all from a couple years ago. But it has relieved me. My mom just started chemo about 8 days ago. She had the nuelasta shot the day after chemo. She hasn't experienced any side effects until today. She is having a spasm in her lower back. I gave her a muscle relaxer and a heating pad. She's feeling better, napping, but the pain is not completely gone. I thought it might be from the neulasta but wasn't sure. From reading this thread, I think my initial instict was right and that it's from the shot. Thanks. This website is going to be of great use to me!",
