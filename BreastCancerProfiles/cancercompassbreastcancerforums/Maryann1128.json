      "Content": "I have been given different answers to this question.  I believe that since everything is gone, a mammogram is not needed.  My surgeon says to get one but I feel they just want to cover themselves.  It is upsetting to me to even think about going to a center, explaining I had breast cancer, and knowing the technician may not know how to react. I appreciate your support and feedback :)",

      "Content": "I am three years out now and understand what you are going through right now.  I found a small lump in 2006 which ended up being stage 1 estrogen positive cancer with DCIS.  My lumpectomy had a clean margin however the surgeon took out more than generally recommended and found 5 more spots.  I was devastated.  It seems forever waiting for results of all of the tests to the final diagnosis.  I remember being so scared I was frozen.  I couldn't remember what the doctors were saying - thankfully someone was with me each time.  I ended up with double mastectomy with lat dorsi reconstruction.  If not for the woman who showed me her own recontruction I would not have had hope. Most important right now is that you have support.  You will get through this - I did!  Do you have someone close to lean on?   I am here for you as are all of these wonderful women. ",

Hi!  I had bi-lateral mast w/lat dorsi reconstruction in 2006.  I did have the nipple reconstruction and am very happy with it.  The tatooing was done in the surgeons office and I am pleased with that as well.  The scars do fade and sometimes you will actually forget that you had cancer.  The men in my life do not mind at all so I am trying not to be so hung up about the reconstruction. ",

      "Content": "Count me in as one who stopped Arimidex!  I took it for two years and finally could not stand the joint pain any longer. First it was just my ankles stiff, then they began to ache as well as my wrists.  I felt like I was 80 getting out of bed every moring, or getting out of the car after a long ride.  Then the bones on the inside of my foot just under the big toe started aching and bothered me constantly.  In addition to that I was diagnosed with osteoporisis which really blew my mind.  It is a difficult decision to make when your oncologist and primary care doctors advise that you stay on it.  Once I received the osteo diag. I made my decision to stop Arimidex and emailed all of my family to explain that I am choosing quality of life and if the cancer should re-occur, it does not mean that it wouldn't have anyway!",
