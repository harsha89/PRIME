    "Content": "This is my first visit to this site, and am happy I made it here. I am taking femara and have been experiencing severe bone pain, legs, etc., thought it was my arthritis. I thought my arthritis pills were no longer working. Swelling in between fingers on top of hand also. I have also been experiencing hair loss, which is very disturbing. I see in this area all of the other messages are about the same. I am more hopeful that femera is going to do the trick for the cancer. But such bad side effect. Liver, too? --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
