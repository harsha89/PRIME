      "Content": "Thanks for sharing such wonderful news! My husband is having his first chemo infusion (Cisplatin) and radiation treatment in a few hours.  It's SO good to hear your news! We have a miserable, painful, debilitating road to go down, but we've been told, and believe, there is no other medical choice. The people on these boards are absolutely wonderful. They, like you, have been encouraging, loving, compassionate, and very importantly, truthful. I, as my dear husband's caregiver, have a tendency to sink to the depths of despair and worry....but then I read a post like yours. Thanks so much! diane",

She had attributed her back pain and everything else to the MS. Was taken to the hospital when pain got unbearable, which we later found was because there were two fractures in a bone in her back. Breast ca was discovered, a biopsy taken (we're waiting for results). She's on heavy pain meds. HELP, please!",

      "Content": "It turned out, after both a needle and surgical biopsy, that she doesn't have breast cancer after all. Now one oncologist wanted to check some apparent lung nodules for ca, but was over-ridden, Thank God, by the surgeon, who then took a biopsy of her cancerous hip. We don't have the results yet.  She didn't bother with mammograms, smoked big time but gave it up when cigarettes became so costly. She's back to smoking now. Your reply is extremely encouraging! We just thought she was a goner, which is what she believes also. She's home now, on heavy meds for pain, but is awake much of the time. She's supposed to have a PET scan, but the hospital she was at didn't have a PET scanner. She's got doc appointments Fri, so we'll know more then. How did you get rid of the soft tumors, BTW, what are soft tumors anyway. What is DMSO? Thanks for your thoughts and prayers. You've given us hope. ",

Lois, my sis with both cancer & MS feels that the cancer is so widespread, that her only option is to finish the radiation (4 more treatments) to try to stop the pain. Her PET showed lung cancer already, but she doesn't cough, so the docs disbelieve the PET. Problem is, I don't believe she has the best docs, but she can't afford to go anywhere else. Alice, the breast cancer survivor had a \"good news PET\" The cancer hasn't spread, so all she needs is surgery. She's fighting with her insurance co. about going to MD Andersen for the surgery.  ",
