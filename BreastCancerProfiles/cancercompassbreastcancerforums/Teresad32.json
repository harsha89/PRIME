      "Content": "Boosting the immune system BEFORE may be a good idea, but my oncologist specifically told me not to use vitamins and herbs, DURING my chemotherapy, since this interfers with the effectiveness of the treatment. I am about to celebrate the 6th anniversary of my mastectomy/chemo. The years of taking Femara were difficult, but I dealt with the side-effects, feeling the drug was an important part of my treatment. I do agree that exercise really is important. My mental attitude is much better if I get a 30 minute walk in daily, though that doesn't always happen. Family support is good. I especially appreciated having my husband with me at appointments, so that he could help me remember the answers the Dr. gave. Sometimes when your under the pressure of worrying about treatment and perhaps \"chemo-brain\", you just need someone to be your backup! Going through breast cancer has helped me to focus on what is important in life!! There are no guarantees in life, but sometimes we live like there were. I know that God is there with me no matter what, so I guess he is my guarantee! God Bless,  Teresa",

      "Content": "Though those of us who have had breast cancer have a unique perspective, I feel very strongly after reading your message, that you need more than a cancer survivor can offer here on this site. The issues you outlined and uniqueness of your situation really could benefit from professional counseling. They should be able to deal with the specifics of you situation. Going together as a couple would be helpful, but I'd encourage you to go on your own even if your spouse doesn't want to go. I know breast cancer is difficult for all of us who have been though it and our loved ones. We each have ways we have coped, but I doubt any of our experiences can adequately cover all of your issues. Please seek out a professional counselor. Good luck to you both. ",

      "Content": "You can probably just relax, but look for a way to not let it happen again. I have a pill container that I got at the pharmacy with a compartment for each day of the week. I fill in a whole week's supply and then I can tell if I've take the pill for that particular day. Give your Dr. a call. He'll probably reassure you that it isn't a problem. I also sometimes call my pharmacist about medication questions.  He know pills! Good luck! Teresa",

      "Content": "Whew, you have a lot to consider right now! First, the dogs, have you considered having a dog sitting service come in to your home? This would be less disruptive to the dogs, but give Barb the help she needs to take care of them. I'm not sure how the cost compares to kennel. Second, you are a caregiver! I can see that being a \"care receiver\" is foreign to you. I really understand this. When I went through my mastectomy and chemo 7 years ago, it just felt so strange to let others help me, but do let people \"care\".  Later, there will be time to give back. Third, yup, it's all overwhelming! It is so important that you have an oncologist that you trust and with whom you can really communicate. So many factors come in to play. I see you are having tests. That will help determine the best course of action, which might include double mastectomy. However, resist the urge to go overboard. Your age and the cancer's specific characteristics will guide your Dr. in her recommendations for you specifically. Your cancer might be very unlikely to move to the other breast. I'm glad you have reached out to this community. I have found much good information and support here, but I have also seen some information I think might be less helpful and unsupported by sound medical research. Approach all advice with good critical eye. Your professional background tells me you will do that, but just wanted to give you a \"heads up\" about that. Good luck on your journey! Teresa  ",

      "Content": "Of course there is hope!! Please concentrate on helping your sister with whatever practical things you can. Don't worry about \"if only she had gone sooner\". I had a mastectomy 5 years ago. The tumor was walnut size and  had spread into 4 nodes. I had 3 months of chemotherapy and have been on Femara for the last 5 years. It is not a perfect drug, but I have learned to work around the side effects. I had a bone scan before the mastectomy to check for any spreading to the bones. There was none!  Every case is different, but as you can see from my case, do not look on the dark side. There is plenty of hope!! I hope she has a doctor she has confidence in. I saw my oncologist every 3 months for several years. At first I hated going so often, keeping the cancer on my mind, but a friend pointed out that what it really was was a great reassurance every 3 months that everything was ok. I now go twice a year. I have blood tests and have had an additional bone scan. So far all remains clear.  I'm here enjoying my life and thankful for every day!! I pray that all goes well with your sister's surgery and that you can relax and help her take this whole process a day-at-a-time!! Teresa",

      "Content": "Not every symptom is a sign the cancer has spread or is even related to cancer!  Perhaps your sister is just under too much stress from all that is going on.  If you are worried about how to treat the dizziness, call her Dr. There are medications, some even available over the counter. When I asked my Dr. about some symptoms, he replied \"Not everything is related to your cancer. Remember non-cancer patients have symptoms of things too.\" I think it was his way of saying, relax. Every ache, pain and twinge is not necessarily a symptom of cancer. These next few days before her mastectomy will be tense. The waiting is the hardest. She wants it over and the cancer out of her body! Be sure she eats properly and gets a good nights sleep, if possible. Being tense and tired isn't going to help. As I said before just help her out and both of you take a deep breath and try to relax. Worrying isn't going to do anything but stress you both out. Teresa",

The suggested reason was the estrogenic effects of the lavender. You might Google \"lavender oil effect\" or something like that to find the actual study, if you are interested.",
