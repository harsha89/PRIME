I had a full mastectomy and axillery clearance. I have finished chemo and have to have follow up breast scans every 3 mths. I had the highest level of the metaplastic cancers. My concern now is that I am wanting to know if anyone has this cancer and if they have remained cancer free since operation. Or is recurrance has happened, how far between was it. I would love to talk to someone who had this type of cancer as it is different to normal breast cancers. cheers You have to try to go on and live your life without looking over your shoulder.  Try not to waste time worrying about what might happen and have fun.  Those quarterly tests work against that but don't look beyond next Sat. night.  Plan some fun for then.  I'm 12 years out and it took me a long time to stop worrying.  I'm not in the clear but I now see the docs every 6 months and go for the chest, abdomen & pelvic scans every 2 years.  Every case is different -- try not to stop living because you fear what could go wrong.",
