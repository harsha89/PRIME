    "Content": "I was diagnosed and treated for stage III breast cancer in 2004. I went to CTCA in Zion, Ill. for my chemo. On my last check-up - in Nov. of 2004 I got an all-clear. I have to go back in a year for follow-up. My cancer is estrogen negative, also negative for the other component - HRT. Can you tell me if your cancer was estrogen-negative or positive? I have much concern that my cancer will re-appear and I want to do whatever possible to keep it from happening. (my dear sister died of this cancer in 1997 - her's came back on her after 4 1/2 years.) The supplement regime you did sounds good to me, but I wonder if it will work in my particular case. Any advice will be appreciate. Thanks, --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
