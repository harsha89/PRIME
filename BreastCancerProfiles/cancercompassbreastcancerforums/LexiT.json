    "Content": "Hi Kelley, You are not alone.  I had DCIS in my right breast a little over a year ago.  Two lumpectomies and 33 radiation treatments and now my breast is completely different from my left and it is hard as a rock, has gone very high and it has affected how I use my right arm.  Never mind that I have developed a complex about the way I look which in turn affects me emotionally.  No one told me this could happen and no one seems to know how to fix it.  I am furious because I had a mild cancer and had I know this would happen I probably would have not gone for radiation as this is a dangerous treatment in and of itself.  If I find out anything to remedy this I will post it.  Good luck.
