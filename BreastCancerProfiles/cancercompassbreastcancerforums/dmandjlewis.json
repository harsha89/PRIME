Hope u are doing better. I call it the \"beautifully brave\" syndrome. I have been sliced, diced , fried and filled with chemicals. I think its ok to be a little unhappy about it. I hear often that it is important to stay positive. That is a bunch of malarkey. It has been proven that the suppression of feelings causes stress which in turn causes all kinds health issues.  So if you miss  how your hair was, just say so. Missing what you lost does not mean you are ungrateful for your life. It means you had to endure a great deal of changes for the sake of life and those changes are difficult. I cry alone for a few minutes everyday. Then I force myself to shake it off and move on but I AM going to cry. I have good reason, so much is changed and I miss the old me. I wish you the best. Thank you for being \"real\"  I am kinda tired of hearing so many people say \"be happy you're alive\"  I am, believe me!  But, 2 years later (triple negative breast cancer) I have super fragile, grey/brown thin, straight hair.  I had beautiful strawberry blonde-ish very vurly thick hair.  I am so sad all the time now.  I don't wash my hair very often at all because it still falls out more than it used to before cancer.  I add a little product to it to give it \"lift\" and an hour later it is flat as a pancake.  It looks greasy, thin, has uncontrollable cowlicks.  I never was told this would happen; I just was told my hair would come back after about 18 months or so.  Now, i wonder if I'll ever have \"normal\" hair again.  I suppose I could live with skimpier hair if I could get some of my curl back.  This group helps.",
