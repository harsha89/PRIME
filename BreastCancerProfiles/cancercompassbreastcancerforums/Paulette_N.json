    "Content": "I initially discovered an enlarged (2.5x2.5x1.5 cm) in late June, which was removed within 3 weeks of discovery and diagnosed as a result of Breast Primary (Lobular) Adenocarcinoma. Mammography and Ultrasound showed no breast involvement, however MRI and PET scan did discover additional Lymph nodes and spot behind left nipple. Modified radical mastectomy of the left breast was performed on 8/29, during which time 20 additional lymph nodes were removed. An unusually large number (10-12) showed positive for cancer, however...and here is my big concern...NO CANCER was found in the breast tissue...not even from the left nipple area, as previously evident from the PET scan. Oncologist tells me that often, the primary tumor dissipates when cancer cells move into the lymphatic system\u2026though I can tell (admittedly from my surgeon and oncologist) that they are a bit 'puzzled'...(their words). Has anyone else experienced this type of diagnosis after mastectomy? It's hard to imagine that NO sign of cancer was found in the breast when so much evidence of \"breast primary\" tissue is in the lymph nodes. I've begun chemo (day before yesterday) and will be scheduled for radiation (axilla) followed by another course of chemo, so I'm convinced that the course of action is aggressive. I'm still concerned about the 'questions' that seem to remain, both in my mind and that of my professional team.... Thanks for any input that can be offered...Paulette",
