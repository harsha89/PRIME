    "Content": "Hi - I had a lumpectomy in July, followed by 7 weeks of radiation. 1 week after completion of my radiation, I began running a high fever. Went to ER - an ultrasound revealed an abscess. Was admitted, had surgery to drain, and the wound was left open. Went daily for dressing changes for 1 week then got the wound vac. Had it for 2 weeks but skin breaking down and wound actually got deeper so they removed it. Now will have to return for twice weekly dressing changes. Wound not as red inside as they would like... Impaired blood flow due to,radiation damage. I too am overweight but otherwise healthy other than the breast cancer. Would be interested to know the outcome of your journey. The dressing changes are excruciating for me but fortunately have little pain the rest of the time. Would also like to heR of others experience with this... My surgeon, rad onc, and med onc all said this was pretty rare and this message board is the only place that I have found anything about it.",
