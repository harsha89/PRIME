    "Content": "Hello, I am wanting to write a book on breast cancer. First of all I would stop shaving your underarms and applying deodorant. This is getting into your pores of your underarms and getting into your system. Many believe that this is causing Breast Cancer. I use Tom's. it is all natural. Secondly, Essiac tea is great for your lungs, hopefully what you have is nothing. I am surprised this gene was not found earlier, I was under the impression it is linked to an immediate relative. I would go in the direction of taking some herbal remedies, like mushrooms, the tea, flaxseed oil and cottage cheese is another one. The best of luck to you. I know many that follow this path",
