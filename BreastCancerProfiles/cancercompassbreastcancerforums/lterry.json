    "Content": "I was typing then my computer crashed so I will start again.  I had my mestectomy two years ago.  the Right breast showed concern on mammogram...the left Nothing.  so when I found out the right was cancer, i elected to have both my breast removed....and to my surprise and to my doctor's surprise, they were both cancerous.....even after I had MRI and Pet scan....so that was alarming.....    I am telling people to never have just one breast removed....never.....   do both.....   and I did not do chemo or radiation or pills of any kind.  I changed my diet.  My cancer was estrogen fed and therefore I went on anti cancer diet...lost 73 pounds.....because cancer driven by sugar an estrogen stays in fat cells....  I feel great.  I would never want that poisen from chemo in my body or the side affects from all of it including the 5 year pills.   get your ommune system healthy and it will take care of you",
