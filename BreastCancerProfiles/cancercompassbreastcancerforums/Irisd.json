      "Content": "In the last few months, I've read & heard numerous doctors state that they feel \"unopposed estrogen\" is one of the contributors to breast cancer and prostate cancer. Basically, women should have a particular balance of progesterone and estrogen, while the male body requires a particular balance of testosterone and estrogen. Obviously, women start producing less progesterone as they age and men produce less testosterone. However, we are keeping the estrogen levels sky high by consuming dairy products (and boy does the dairy industry have us brainwashed to think that we need massive amounts of it when we get more than the daily required amount of calcium through vegetables). Sufficient studies haven't been done yet, but plenty of doctors are on board with the whole estrogen theory, and are suggesting that people not consume ANY dairy products. Here are three websites which have been incredibly helpful to me personally, just a few years older than you with stage IV breast cancer metastasized to the liver, lung, bone, and lymph nodes: www.HAcres.com www.VegSource.com and www.Dr.McDougall.com All the best to you. Consider picking up A Cancer Battle Plan by David and Ann Frahme, as well as the second book, A Cancer Battle Plan Sourcebook. It gave me so much hope and I now buy it for everyone who gets diagnosed with cancer. Make 2006 the best year ever! Iris D.",

      "Content": "Hi Mary: It's now more than a month after you left your message. What did you decide about having the liver biopsied? A great book which gave me a lot of hope and will help you know more ways to detox the body is A Cancer Battle Plan Sourcebook by Ann & David Frahme. If you have not done organic coffee enemas before, go to www.SAWilsons.com and click on the right side at the top where it says something about cleansing the liver. I order coffee through them, as it is specially grown for enema use. Unlike all other enemas, the caffeine causes the bile ducts to open and toxins are dumped out. The website has provided me with a lot of other useful information as well, as I have breast cancer metastasized to the liver, lung, bone, and lymph nodes. Take care, and make it a great year in 2006! Iris D.",

The website that they gave is www.pub-med.org God bless you and your mom as you're going through this very difficult trial. iris",

      "Content": "Hi Carlenne: I just read your reply to one of the other gals. I'm interested because you stated that you refused chemo. While I've always thought that I wouldn't ever undergo chemo or radiation, now that I'm 37 and have just been diagnosed with breast cancer, I feel as though I'm willing to do anything that my oncologist suggests. Do you feel that you somehow made up for the chemo with something else, or by doing certain things? If there's a fabulous holistic website that you've discovered out there, I'd love to know the name of it. Thanks so much, and may the Lord continue to bless you with excellent health, Carlenne.

Like yourself, I'm quite baffled that I was diagnosed with breast cancer yesterday since I'm only 37, small breasts, small body, very healthy, lots of exercise and healthy diet. Like Michael J. Fox and numerous people who have gone through tremendous health obstacles, I know that you will be able to look back on your situation, thanking God that He brought you through it. Everyone says that you become a better person from going through something like this, and I believe it. It's only natural for all of us to pray for the easiest way out. If you are still terribly depressed, please don't hesitate to talk to a counselor.
