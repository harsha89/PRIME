My sis is a doc we are trying our best but we know there is not much time left. I live oversease i am planning to visit her and stay with her for couple of months. last two years was horrible for us. i was pregnant with my first baby after trying for 8 long years when the news came that my moms cancer has spread to liver. i waited to give birth and fly to her with my 3 month old daughter. My father died just before the day i arrived. I didnt see him for 3 years and i saw his cold dead face. It was hard to hard to touch him and say good bye. And now its time for my mom. I dont know why some people have to have all the pain. My mom is everthing to me. Every day i call her and i cant believe i cant here this voice anymore. I know there are people how has much pain than me but i cant bear it any more. Everything seems empty to me.I pray for your mom. But i know how hard it is.
