      "Content": "Greetings all, I have been on aromosin for six months; at the 3 month mark, I developed a yeast infection for which I have gone through various treatments. Currently, the NP who is treating me has prescribed Vagifem and Estrace; the former is a vaginal insert and the latter is a cream.  I developed a reaction to the estrace and stopped using it after several days (increased redness and itching).  Intermittently, I've used cholbatazol and diflucan. I'm at the point of not knowing where to turn for a remedy for my itchiness and soreness.  I've contacted my oncologist about switching to another medication (I used tamoxiphen for a year and wasn't thrilled with its side effects) I'm seeking information from ANYONE who has had similar experiences (yeast infections, vaginitis, etc) and the plans of treatment that they followed. I look forward to hearing from you...... Candygirl",

      "Content": "Hello, I had been on tamoxiphen for 1 year and didn't like the way I felt on it.  After a 3 month hiatus, taking no medications, my dr. prescribed aromosin.  At the 3 month mark, I began with a series of yeast infections and irritations, which still haven't cleared up.  I have been seeing a NP who has given me vagifem and estrace cream, but I had a negative reaction to the latter.   I'm anxious to hear if others are having similar reactions; if so, what course of treatment have you been following.  Needless to say, I am uncomfortable and sitting is challenging. Thanks",
