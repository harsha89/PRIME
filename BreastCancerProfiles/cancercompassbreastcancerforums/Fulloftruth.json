    "Content": "I am sick and tired of hearing about good people getting sick.  It is time a human stood up and made a stand against the monsters we find ourselves controlled by, and I am no longer going to be silent to the tyranny and corruption so prevalent that I can no longer see straight. If you have breast cancer and you want to live do these three things immediately. #1.  Go see Dr. Brownstein here: http://www.centerforholisticmedicine.com/ #2.  Do not drink, eat, wash, do laundry, brush teeth, drink coffee etc. etc.  without knowing that what you are using is natural.  100% no cheating.  #3.  Use iodine to cure your glandular disease. I don't have cancer but I sympathize and I wish with all of the energy of the universe I could take it away for you.  You don't deserve it, and if you learn how to heal your body it will, but I assure you of this, putting your faith in a conventional doctor under conventional rules is suicide.  Unless of course you were going to be alright anyway, which happens occasionally, someone will survive chemo and they will say, \"See, it works!\" Well, no, it's that the person who survived the chemo was going to survive anyway.  That is not working.  That is slowing healing.   What works is a hollistic doctor that utilizes nature to cure. Do it.  Live.",
