    "Content": "Hello everyone, I have a heavy heart while i write this. Four years ago when my mom went through her Stage IIIB breast cancer treatment, we had all moved on with our lives thinking that we have beat the beast. But it has sprung it's ugly head again and this time it is stage IV as the doctors have found a 2.5x2.5 cm spot in liver which is ER/PR positive metastasic cancer The doctors have included Avastin in her treatment this time. Several articles on the web talk about the serious side effects and that it has no affect on breast cancer cells. It is discouraging that FDA has not approved it either. If someone has gone through an Avastin treatment for Breast cancer, please share your experience with me. She starts her treatment tomorrow and we would like to be more educated. She will go through 6 cycles of chemo, will she need to take avastin for al 6 cycles? what side effects should we prepare ourselves for? Please respond - enlighten us, we need help/support. God bless everyone except CANCER",
