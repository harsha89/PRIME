    "Content": "Hi, my name is Rachel and i'm 22 years old. I was just reading your message and it immediately hit close to home. My mother also passed away this past March 9th from breast cancer. She was diagnosed the year I went into highschool in 1997. She fought very hard, and the cancer was sometimes worse than others. In september of 2005, after a lot of physio she was able to return to teaching, she worked so hard to be able to get back to work. During the christmas holidays she became ill once again and was in the hospital for two weeks. I had a flight booked for vancouver as i was moving htere, and she told me to go, that she would be fine. But when i found out in early march that things weren't going so well i returned home. It all seemed to happen so quickly, my sisters and I had all returned home, and we all went on a little holiday to a resort for two days and then the day we back home she passed away. Her cancer had apparently moved to her brain. Even though it happened in March, i feel like it wasn't nearly 5 months ago. It seems like it happened so recently. And i am having trouble, most of the time i am fine. But i find that when i am alone i get very sad. I just wish there was a way to know that she will always be with me. And i feel like many of my memories are going to be lost, and this scares me. Have you found any good ways of dealing with this? Rachel",
