      "Content": "No you are not nuts.  I have read many stories of people feeling a little bereft after finishing their chemo treatments.  You are made to feel very special and cared for.  The nurses have time for you.  You are perfectly normal.  You obviously miss social time with other adults.  Joining any kind of club is a good idea, if not a support group at your hospital.  It will boost your morale, helping to keep you positive and healthy. I too had my treatment with three young children, 7 years ago. What I would say to you is that while you are having your chemo you really must (if you are not already) make sure you take a very good quality - 30 billion strength probiotic.  This will replace the good immune-boosing gut bacteria that is vital for good health and which is being destroyed by the chemo.  This way you will not be as susceptible to any illnesses going around.  Some chemos can also be damaging to the heart, so taking ubiquinol CQ-10 also helps with cell health as well as heart health, it will also give you loads more energy.  This will also help stop the damage by the treatment to your healthy cells, preventing the cancer coming back more aggressively years later. This is my story I have already put under some other headings which you may find helpful. I had breast cancer 7 years ago - mastectomy, chemo, radiotherapy, Herceptin and Tamoxifen. Waited 7 weeks from diagnosis to surgery. Had time to do lots of research.  Find a nutritional therapist / naturapath while you wait.  I read some reports of 30 women who refused to have mastectomies many years ago.  They had advanced breast cancers.  They were offered to go on a programme of taking Coenzyme-10, 200 mg per day for several weeks, after which time their tumours were tested and were found to have stopped growing.  Two women took 350 mg and 450 mg respectively (one can take a lot more) - their tumours had vanished.  As CQ-10 cannot be patented, the results were filed away. Kylie Minogue is said to have claimed that she believes drinking broccoli smoothes helped get her through her treatment (juiced whole head of broccoli, apple and carrot).  Raw carrot was reported not long ago to stop breast tumours in their tracks.  I read of another chap in the papers whose wife gave him broccoli smoothies for his terminal cancer.  His doctor was amazed and reported it to the Cancer Reserach UK who approached the wife for the exact recipe. The book Your Life in Your Hands by Prof Jane Plant (who suffered five times - the last time supposedly terminal) has written and updated this book.  She has also written The Plant Programme full of anti-cancer recipes written with the help of a top nutritionist.  Basically avoid all dairy, alcohol, caffeine, meat.  Go vegan whilst suffering cancer (organic if possible).  Cancer cannot thrive in an alkaline body - print off alkaline / acid food charts.  All cooked food will become acidic.  Cooked foods lose their enzymes which are necessary for digestion, causing us to pull enzymes from our pancreas to help digest.  Eat only fresh, raw or juiced foods.  Check out Jason Vale Juicemaster who has a website with an A-Z of ailments you can juice for, with anti-cancer juices.  Seephkillscancer.comfor inspired story.  Get the book The PH Miracle by Dr Robert Young, explaining how getting our bodies back to ph neutral brings health back to our bodies.  PH measuring sticks can be bought on line. Get out in the sunshine without sunscreen.  Taking Curcumin 4000 will help stop you burning in the sun.  Also great for stopping / reversing DNA damage during / after radiotherapy.  Lots of illnesses are due to lack of sunshine (vitamin D3).  Caffiene stops our bodies absorbing Vitamin D.  Avoid alcohol, coffee, tea (except green tea) and sodas (coca-cola / pepsi needs 32 glasses of water to neutralize the acids from them). Find a fully qualified Naturapath / Nutritional Therapist to help you select the food programme / supplements you will need to get you through any treatment.  A powerful, good quality probiotic is necessary from now and all the way through treatment.  Chemo will destroy your immune boosting good bacteria, so you need to replenish them daily.  I had time to do my research before my treatment and flew through it - no sickness, no burning, no pain, no tiredness. By boosting your immune system before treatment, you are more likely to protect your healthy cells from long term damage by the treatment, greatly lessening your chances of getting it back later more aggressively. The one thing I was not told by my Naturapath was not to cook my food.  I put all the good things in a pot and made soup from it every day, but my tumours still grew.  I was feeding them acidic food which they thrived on.  I should have eaten it raw.  Check outEarthclinic.comfor more self help stories.  Also a great site -goodhealthnaturally.com, with helpful health advisers and supplements. If you can afford to buy a Far Infrared Sauna, that would greatly help to.  As the gentle deep heat weakens cancer cells.  Check out Far Infrared Saunas + cancer.  Also Curcumin + Cancer / bitter apricot kernels + cancer / cayenne pepper capsules + cancer. Hope this helps a little.  Good Luck.",

      "Content": "Are there no other adults (from where you are studying) or friends who can support you at this time, and also help you fight the insurance company?  You are obviously in the right.  There must be some lawyers that do a no win no fee type thing who deal with medical issues.  Try and get an adult on board from school / college and speak to them. Even though it may be lung cancer, all the natural juicing etc I mentioned in my last post is still relevant.  With lung cancer, also, try buying some large watercress leaves, rinse, and put in a blender until fine (with some cool pre- boiled water to get rid of any chlorine), add a little sea salt and some freshly ground black pepper (which contains pepperine - greatly helps absorbability) and feed to your mother as a cold soup.  If she can take it with a little bit of \" bite / heat\" to it, you can add a little fresh chilli, which will give the soup more power.  The soup will be very rich in Vitamin C and the capsicum from the chilli is a powerful anti-cancer food.  Google both. Also, make sure you give your mum lots of warm, hard, hugs everyday.  The power of hugs is well known.  You know yourself if you've been given a big hug how powerful it feels.  This will help get her own immune system strong to help with the fight There was a story, not long ago, over here in the UK where a mother was preparing to die from stage four breast cancer.  But she was going to make the most of it and make it happy for her two young daughters.  The eldest daughter, about 9, wrote her mother a little card each day saying how much she loved her and how she mustn't give up etc.  The mum loved receiving these notes everyday and was very touched.  When the mum was checked by doctors not too many months later, she was found to be totally free of cancer. So if your mum accepts the situation, decides to make the most of every day and see the joy in everything, and you, but still eats the right foods / supplements, relieving any stress, her body will end up fighting for her rather than against her.  Maybe get her to look at some nice things she can aim to do in the future with the definite belief that she will be there to do it.  She must let go of all her fears and worries. However hard life gets, with money worries etc., I don't let it phase me - I plan to be around in the long term and have lots of plans for the future, when money gets better, like cruises, holidays, children graduating and starting to make their own way in life and helping them achieve their aims. Try googling \"foods that fight cancer\" etc - there is so much information out there which I found really helped me, and have them raw / juiced.  Make sure you also eat these, it is a great way to restore your own health if you are lowering your own immune system with all the worry. Keep positive and cheerful in front of your mum and also try to be when you are alone.  And remember, lots of daily, warm, long hugs, just because they are so therapeutic. Much love, Genevieve",

      "Content": "You shouldn't worry about imposing on the people offering a helping hand - most times people like to feel needed and generally would not offer help if they were not prepared to be there for you.  When you're a mom you tend to feel quite protective of your children's friends as well, and I am sure your best friend's mom would like to think that you could go to her if things were getting on top of you and you needed a little bit of emotional support, as well as help in doing any research etc which you don't have the time to do with your studies. It's great that the insurance company did a U-turn on their decision, but make sure you are in at all the appointments with your mom and don't feel awkward about asking questions about anything or the treatment that you are unsure about.  Do take the time also to google alternative cancer clinics in the USA, or fully qualified alternative health practitioners who know what they are talking about and see if they can help you make the most of any treatment on offer, using alternative treatments alongside any conventional treatment. Give your mom my love and tell her I am thinking of her and I hope she feels / gets better soon.  Also, find out if there are any support groups near you, of people who have been through similar treatments and have come out the other side.  The main thing is boosting her immune system so that she can take the treatment without it causing damaging side-effects and keeping her as stress free as possible.

Get out in the sunshine without sunscreen.  Taking Curcumin 4000 will help stop you burning in the sun.  Also great for stopping / reversing DNA damage during / after radiotherapy.  Lots of illnesses are due to lack of sunshine (vitamin D3).  Caffiene stops our bodies absorbing Vitamin D.  Avoid alcohol, coffee, tea (except green tea) and sodas (coca-cola / pepsi needs 32 glasses of water to neutralize the acids from them).  Note: Curcumin should not be taken during chemo, as that is when you do feel like you have been poisoned - it doesn't mix well with chemo. But is great any other time. Find a fully qualified Naturapath / Nutritional Therapist to help you select the food programme / supplements you will need to get you through any treatment.  A powerful, good quality probiotic is necessary from now and all the way through treatment.  Chemo will destroy your immune boosting good bacteria, so you need to replenish them daily.  I had time to do my research before my treatment and flew through it - no sickness, no burning, no pain, no tiredness. By boosting your immune system before treatment, you are more likely to protect your healthy cells from long term damage by the treatment, greatly lessening your chances of getting it back later more aggressively. The one thing I was not told by my Naturapath was not to cook my food.  I put all the good things in a pot and made soup from it every day, but my tumours still grew.  I was feeding them acidic food which they thrived on.  I should have eaten it raw.  Check outEarthclinic.comfor more self help stories.  Also a great site -goodhealthnaturally.com, with helpful health advisers and supplements.

      "Content": "I forgot to mention that I did take Tamoxifen for four years despite my real concerns about the side effects.  Although apart from initial hot flushes, I didn't notice any other side effects probably due to the fact that I had changed my diet drastically and was more aware of eating whole foods and the right whole foods rather than processed foods etc.  I only stopped when I found I had thinning of the spine and was advised to eat lots of calcium-rich greens instead of being given medication with its own side effects.  No trouble since. The only thing I found was that one is not told about the bone thinning side effects of Tamoxifen and also not told that it is essential to get a bone scan to see the extent of the thinning.  My spine was 10% - 15% less dense than it should have been and was at risk of fracture.  So my friend who advised that I ask for one to be done (which I had not been aware of) saved me in that respect.  Funnily enough I had just started to feel severe lower back pain which I suffered from for about 3-4 weeks, then it got better (after I stopped the Tamoxifen).",

      "Content": "I had a mastectomy 7 years ago (four tumours - largest almost grade 3), followed by chemo, radiotherapy, Herceptin and then Tamoxifen.  I wasn't happy taking Tamoxifen due to the multitude of possible side effects, but did continue for almost four years until I had a bone scan.  (A friend of mine who'd had breast cancer several years before asked if I'd been offered one. I said no and she told me to ask for one (as Tamoxifen causes thinning of the bones). My scan showed Osteopenia - a 10% / 15% less density in my spine than I should have had for a 48 year old, so at risk of fracture. Thankfully I wasn't offered medication but it was suggested I eat lots of calcium rich greens (calcium from dairy is difficult for humans to absorb).  I am fine now.  I decided from that point to stop taking Tamoxifen, much to the dismay of my pharmacist. My back is stronger and I go back to have another scan in a few months time. A great book for breast / prostate cancer sufferers is Your Life in Your Hands by Prof Jane Plant (who suffered 5 times - terminal final time, but 25 years later still alive). Also her anti-cancer recipe book The Plant Programme.  Avoid dairy / alcohol (very rarely a glass of red wine), as these raise oestrogen levels as does grapefruit.  Curcumin 4000 (goodhealthnaturally.com - 0800-015-1580) helps to reverse DNA damage caused by radiotherapy.  See Curcumin + Cancer.  Also green tea very healthful.  High strength probiotics necessary for restoring healthful gut bacteria.  The PH Miracle by Dr Robert Young gives advice on restoring our ph levels for optimum health also with recipes.  Check out alkaline / acid food charts on line.  Check out phkillscancer.com .  Great self help website is Earthclinic.com .  Jason Vale Juicemaster also offers lots of ideas for anti-cancer healthful green juicing.  Also Bobbys Healthy Shop in Exeter, Devon, where all profits go to help children with cancers like this chap's son, who he helped cure of stage IV brain cancer, when doctors had given up.  Cancer is always more likely to come back if one doesn't change one's lifestyle.  Lack of vitamin D (sunshine) also linked to lots of cancers and other illnesses.  At least 15 mins per day without sunscreen (otherwise only natural sunscreen).  Execise adds oxygen to body and cancer cannot survive in oxygen rich body.  But if exercising need to take good dose of vitamin C, as exercise causes free radical damage to DNA, as proved in Food Hospital programme (good reason to take Curcumin which is rich in A, C, E and Selenium). Hope some of the above helps.",

      "Content": "I am doing really well and pleased that the above information helped you a little.  When I was first diagnosed I was amazed when I asked the oncologist and his nurse if they could direct me to a nutritional therapist to help me boost my immune system and they said they could not.  They just gave me a MacMillan Breast Care Nurses card (which I took as a death sentence as they help towards end of life care, so I thought).  So as soon as I got home I got onto the computer to search my diagnosis and see if there was any help / advice as to what I could do. I was staggered by so much information and didn't know where to start and what to believe. Then my eldest sister told me of a friend whose husband was suffering a second more aggressive prostate cancer. They decided to get some natural help and found the Naturapath I subsequently used.  Very informative and ordered lots of supplements for me i.e. B12, B6, CQ-10, Zinc, Probiotics and some more. They also recommended to me the book Your Life in Your Hands, and that's when the panic subsided and I felt there was something I could do for myself to help boost my immune system to take on the treatment - I felt empowered by this knowledge. Because it took the seven weeks before surgery took place, I had time to change my diet and benefit from my supplements. I had no pain from surgery at all, and did not need to use the morphine they put beside me to use as and when I needed it.  I did initially use some because I was worried that I might be in severe pain, but all it gave me was terrible nightmares that first night. Other patients were so dosed up with morphine that some of the screamed all night with their nightmares.  After that I didn't take any more and felt no pain. When I started my first chemo treatment several weeks after the surgery, I was given anti-sickness tablets to take. I took them because I hate being sick, but just for that first session, as I found that apart from feeling slightly over-hungry, when you feel slightly sicky, I felt okay, so I didn't take them any more.  What I did find thought, was that I had had a very painful tennis elbow from a couple of months before diagnosis which had still been ongoing, and after taking the initial does of anti-sickness tablets, it completely healed my elbow.  That was the only thing I did differently. When I mentioned this miracle to my doctor (who had only offered steriod injections if necessary, which she admitted probably would not help), she didn't seem surprised at all.  The problem is that when a medication is tried and tested for a particular illness, I don't think they are just allowed to prescribe it to people with other illnesses, even though it may do the job. I continued on for five years without having any dairy and very little alcohol.  Now I just have the odd red wine.  I do cheat occasionally and have some dairy and milk chocolate, but I am aware that I am risking it coming back if I do it too much. Before I was diagnosed I did drink a bit of alcohol, did not get enough sunshine (vit. D), no exercise apart from pottering around the house, stress with my partner, and not eating fruit and vegetables enough.  Two years before I also knocked the area of my breast very hard on the sharp corner of a tall piece of furniture, which I cursed at at the time.  My thinking is that because of my lack of eating properly etc (as above) my immune system was to weak to repair any damaged cells.  The increased alcohol intake in the couple of months before and over Christmas, must have been what made it so much more aggressive (plus I had spent 10 days before Christmas in Las Vegas, where all they seemed to serve was beef, and if there were any growth hormones in that, then I believe that would not have helped.  But now I have knowledge about the importance of the right food and drink and enough sunshine and know what I can do to avoid it coming back.  And - I refuse to stress about anything - it all goes over my head.  Stress also lowers one's immune system. Best of luck.",

Other patients were so dosed up with morphine that some of the screamed all night with their nightmares.  After that I didn't take any more and felt no pain. When I started my first chemo treatment several weeks after the surgery, I was given anti-sickness tablets to take. I took them because I hate being sick, but just for that first session, as I found that apart from feeling slightly over-hungry, when you feel slightly sicky, I felt okay, so I didn't take them any more.  What I did find thought, was that I had had a very painful tennis elbow from a couple of months before diagnosis which had still been ongoing, and after taking the initial does of anti-sickness tablets, it completely healed my elbow.  That was the only thing I did differently. When I mentioned this miracle to my doctor (who had only offered steriod injections if necessary, which she admitted probably would not help), she didn't seem surprised at all.  The problem is that when a medication is tried and tested for a particular illness, I don't think they are just allowed to prescribe it to people with other illnesses, even though it may do the job. I continued on for five years without having any dairy and very little alcohol.  Now I just have the odd red wine.  I do cheat occasionally and have some dairy and milk chocolate, but I am aware that I am risking it coming back if I do it too much. Before I was diagnosed I did drink a bit of alcohol, did not get enough sunshine (vit. D), no exercise apart from pottering around the house, stress with my partner, and not eating fruit and vegetables enough.  Two years before I also knocked the area of my breast very hard on the sharp corner of a tall piece of furniture, which I cursed at at the time.  My thinking is that because of my lack of eating properly etc (as above) my immune system was to weak to repair any damaged cells.  The increased alcohol intake in the couple of months before and over Christmas, must have been what made it so much more aggressive (plus I had spent 10 days before Christmas in Las Vegas, where all they seemed to serve was beef, and if there were any growth hormones in that, then I believe that would not have helped.  But now I have knowledge about the importance of the right food and drink and enough sunshine and know what I can do to avoid it coming back.  And - I refuse to stress about anything - it all goes over my head.  Stress also lowers one's immune system. Best of luck.",
