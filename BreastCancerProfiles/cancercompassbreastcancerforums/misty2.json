    "Content": "I have also had upper and lower back pain since after my first chemo. They finally figured it was also from the shot that I would get the day after my chemo to bring my white blood cells up. But it never went away after I was cancer free. My last chemo was the end of December and I still have back pain. I'm now going to a chiropractor and therapy which does seem like it is getting better. The stretch exercises do really help. I also have a real ishy feeling in my legs that my chiropractor told me was neuropathy. I get it if I wait too long to before I take my Tamadol. My oncologist didn't seem to know why I was having back pain earlier or now. Googling has help me find some answers.",
