    "Content": "my 28 yr old daughter is now on zolodex implants after a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation 3 years ago. she is supposed to stay on it till she is 30 & she is over the side effects. i.e hot flushes, depression and lack of hormones. (she is just getting into a new relationship after the breakdown of her marriage). cause she has no health cover most times when she sees the doctor they are usually training and don't know a great deal!  (she thinks). i worry what will happen if and when she stops her treatment. anyone have any ideas/suggestions? i would appreciate everything! she has never been to support groups (she thinks they are all older!) so we really don't know much!her cancer was estrogen positive.  thanks  ",
