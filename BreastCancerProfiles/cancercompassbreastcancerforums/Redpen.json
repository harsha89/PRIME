      "Content": "My mother finished two courses of Xeloda. She complains that she is so tired that the most she can do is go from her bed to her chair. Her hands and feet haven't been effected and there aren't any other side effects except this awful fatigue. She also has Parkinson's disease and the Xeloda seems to be effecting her temors as well. She doesn't want to continue until she gets blood work and scans done to see if it's working. No one has told us that she has experienced more mets, just that her bloodwork is edging to the \"top normal range\" indicating that if we do nothing, something is going to \"come back\". She had a rod put in her femur in Nov 2006 but the lab results taken from the 10cm lesion were negative for malignancy. She had radiaiton on that area. Her latest bone scan showed three \"suspicious\" areas-one in her sternum and two in her pelvic bones. An orthopedic oncologist said that the pelvic ones were not cancer spots (he called them osteitis condensans ilii) but couldn't comment on the sternum because of the technoligist's technique. her liver showed mild heterogenous changes but with no lesion. That's why her oncologist put her on Xeloda. This treatment is being called \"preventative\". Can you expect any signifcant results after just two courses? She's taking 2 500 mg pills twice a day. Her doctor did cut her back to 1 500 mg twice a day just to get her to keep taking it. They said she needs to take it until her \"disease\" progresses. Has anyone else gotten so fatigued that they want to stop and what did you do about it? Is 150 mg of any benefit in our situation? Has Xeloda caused anyone to die?  We have an appt this Thursday and I want to ask the right questions. Any answers to this rambling would be greatly appreciated.  ",

      "Content": "She's Her2 negative if that's what you mean. Tow different oncologoists said that if your tumor marker numbers double by more than 50% in 3 months you'd have to think that something is happening. That's happened the last two blood tests in a 6 month period.  We're trying to be proactive, but don't want to make her feel awful for no measurable reason. Are you saying that you would wait for a definite tumor somewhere?",

      "Content": "Is 5fu the iv equivalent to Xeloda? I thought that's what it becomes once you get it into your system. We didn't do well on iv therapies.My mother has Parkinson's too. All of this chemo is interfereing with her Parkinson's meds so the most she does (she's 76) is shake from her Parkinson's or sleep from the xeloda. She's on her thrid hormone therapy drug (arimidex, aromasin and now femara). Her blood work is in the normal range but the tumor markers keep going up. They told me 0-38 is considered \"normal'\" She's at 32. Her doctor said if you do nothing the cancer will come back. I guess I want to know how out of the \"normal range\" you have to be before mets occurs to make her keep taking something that she says is killing her. Aredia was also a disaster so she refuses more of those treeatments. She had the whole list of \"rare\" side effects from that.",

      "Content": "I appreciate your message and the fact that you took the time to write. I hope you're right about God protecting her. The Xeloda made her so sick and weak that her doctor and she decided that it was time to stop taking chemo and to go and live her life. i hope she has some quality time left.........a lot of it. Like I said, her tumor markers increased from 32 to 51. Does anyone know what it reaches when you start to feel sick? Right now, her blood work is completely normal besides this tumor marker going up. i pray everyday that God will spare her any pain and suffering and let her live her life. Thanks for writing and I'll pray for you as well. He suggested that she try alternative therapies as long as they weren't ridiculously expensive. Any suggestions? I found bovine cartilage, something called PSK and CoQ10. He didn't advocate them but said that maybe she should give it a whirl",

I mostly seem to have a day or two that all I can do is sleep.  May I ask why the rod had to be put into the femur??? I have mets breast cancer to the bones... My bones include the entire pelvic area, sternum, ribs, femurs, scapulas, entire spine and illalic bones, and the skull.... I have been experiencing lots of pain in my right leg.  I do have a pain pump inplanted in my right hip that runs a cath to my spine.  It constantly feeds pain meds to my nerves, so that I can walk and lead a pretty normal life.  I am also doing a \"trial\" at the same time for a drug called \"avastin\".  It has been approved for colon cancer, but not for breast cancer.... It is a blinded test and is supposed to be real close to fda approval.... I hope I am actually getting the drug.... I am only 39 and am terrified what my scans will show when I get them at the first of May.  So, I also have been taking some \"B\" complex to help with the fatigue and mostly I just push myself.  I am also anemic, since the cancer is in my bones..... I am on aranesip and zometa, the ararensip is suppose to help with the anemia, and the zometa with the strengthening of the bones..... Maybe your mom could do some of those things.  The rod was put in her femur because the found a 10 cm lesion by accident when she was getting her scans. They said that it should be put in in case her leg was weakened by the lesion and could break. They said it was better to get it done before it could break. The lab results, however, showed no evidence of malignancy. The oncologist wanted it to be radiated anyway.",
