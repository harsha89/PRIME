    "Content": "It has now been two years after my mastectomy and extensive dissection.  I exercised and massaged my arm daily for over a year.  I used Arnca (spelling?) cream and it really helped me deal with the pain and healing of the scar.  I have full use of my harm but still feel a bit numb under the harm.  I hope it helps!  Best of luck!
