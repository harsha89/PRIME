    "Content": "I am a stage IV bc survivor that was diagnosed in 1998 and in 2000 it became stage IV after the mascetomy, radiation to the chest and 4 rounds of A/C.   Again the cancer recurred under my arm that I had had the mascetomy so I had radiation.   Two yrs later I was treated for a parasite as my immune sys was so low and then had to have a stint put in my bile duct/pancreas/gallbladder.  This started about a five year battle with different chemos =taxotere/taxol, CMF, Avastin,Gemzar, Zeloda and a couple others I can't remember.  I was on male hormones, arimedex, tamoxifen and a couple others I can't remember.  I also have skin mets so I had 5FU ointment which really did a good job.   Now I am on Magace which is progsteren.    My point is that you do what you have to do to stay alive.  Yes, there are ton of side effect that may or may not effect you.  The way I look at it is I have nothing to loose by continuing treatment as the cancer may kill me sooner than my liver fails.   Next April will be my thirteen year anniversary and I still work part-time.",
