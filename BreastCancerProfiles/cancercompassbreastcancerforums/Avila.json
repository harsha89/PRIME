      "Content": "Hello Leslie, I Know what it feels like to loose your mother. My name is Cindy I am 29 and I too have lost my mother to breast cancer. She fought Cancer back in 1994-2001 she had her left breast removed and was cancer free. On April 21st 2006 we found out it was back in her bones, skull, and liver. We got her started on radiation right away. She got phnemonia and becasue her immune system was so week due to her treatments and medications she was unable to fight back. My mother passed on May 26th, 2006, she was 61. It's been the most devestating time of my life and I know what you mean about other people telling you that it's going to be ok but if they haven't lost their mother they don't know what it's like. My mother prayed alot and that is what I do to get through my days. Every morning when I wake up first thing I do is ask God to help my dad, my brother 36rys, my brother of 31yrs, my sister of 21yrs, and me to get through another day with out mom. I pray for stength and for him to remind me that mom is ok that she is with him and we will see her again. At night I thank him for getting us all through another day and I pray that I dream of her. I miss her very much and we all have are good days and then we have our days when I just cry. I carry a recent picture of my mom in my purse and when I miss her, It doesn't matter were I'm at I pull it out. I also have a box of little things that she would carry in her purse and stuff that was hers. When I miss her I go though that box. People say that time will heal the emptyness I feel in my heart but to me it sometimes feels like I miss her more than ever. I am just taking it one day at a time. I will keep you in my prayers. Take Care and God Bless.",

      "Content": "Leslie, I am glad I was able to help you in some way. It gives me comfort to hear from people who know what it is like to loose a mother. There is no way to explain what it feels like, yet when I hear or read a story of someone loosing their mother I know I can relate and they can relate to me without having to say too much. Thank You for your prayers. Take it one day at time. God Bless. Cindy",
