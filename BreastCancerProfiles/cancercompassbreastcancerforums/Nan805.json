    "Content": "Hello. I am 18 days post-op lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy. I bought some men's 100% cotton sleeveless tee-shirts before my surgery. They kind that are ribbed. I bought a size smaller for closeer fit to my body. I too was concerned about 14 days straight in a supportive brassiere being an \"H\" cup. I wore the cotton tee-shirt and put the brassiere on OVER it. It allowed for less chafing and the cotton wicked away moisture from my skin. I could never had made it 14 days 24/7 hours a day otherwise. My brassieres are feats of engineering at \"H\" cup, trust me! I wish you good luck.",
