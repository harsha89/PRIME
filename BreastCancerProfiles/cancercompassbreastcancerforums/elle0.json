      "Content": "Hi I'm new to this site as well and am a 2x survivor. I have only been on Arimidex for a few weeks. I had been on Femerra (l'etrazole) but the side effects, nausea, diarhea, and joint and muscle pain were debilitating. I certainly don't have the nausea and diareah with A but I am tired and seem to feel quite down. I am experiencing some pain in arms and hands. It seems by reading through the messages my symptoms aren't that uncommon but I am so reticent to complain again to the doctors. I suppose I think I should feel lucky to be alive.  As anyone tried acupuncture or other non-drug interventions to handle the side effects?  elle0 ",

      "Content": "And to add to all the discomfort from aromataze inhibitors.... I have been prescribed Actonel to try and mitigate the bone loss caused by Arimidex.  OMG I't like my first go round with L'etrazol.  I have stiff joints, nausea and bone pain. I asked if I will be able to stop taking the Actonel when I finish with the Arimidex and the answer is probably not.  Definitiely have to find something other than Actonel.  The joint pain and fatigue from the Arimidex is quite enough with which to live.",

      "Content": "Hi I paddle with Abreast In A Boat and we have a complementary fitness program (which includes weight lifting) we are supposed to do (some do some don't) This program was initiated by Dr. Don MacKenzie for Breast Cancer survivors.  He does recommend compression sleeves for those who may experience some lymphodemia and some of the women will wear them.  The oncologist I see has also started a trial study for women who are going through chemo to see if exercise helps them to cope better as well as another study for those of us on Arimidex to see if exercise will mitigate some of the side effects. I don't think I have ever been more fit and though I experience side effects from Arimidex, they do not worsen from exercise and emotionally I think I am better off.  Take care as you would starting on any exerice program and good for you for getting out there.  You might want to see if there is a paddling program in your community.  ",
