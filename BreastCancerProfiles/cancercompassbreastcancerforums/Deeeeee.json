    "Content": "I would like to know the prognosis of having this oncogene in 100% of tumor. I was estrogen positive, progesterone negative and Her 2 NU positive confirmed by FISH. Had invasive ductal cancer with two positive nodes. Surgery included a lumpectomy with node removal (13). It is difficult getting the truth from health care providers. I have had wonderful care but have been left with lots of questions. From what I read, long-term prognosis is poor. I have had 8 chemo treatments and 36 radiation. Thanks for input",
