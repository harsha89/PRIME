It continues, in an abated, come and go way, ever since. I have done acupuncture and massage, but it still hangs on. Stretching and advil help. Drs say it is muscle pain, not a sign of cancer. Has anyone else had this lingering pain? I finished chemo in April. Hi, I had back pain 1/2 way through the first time I had chemo and could hardly walk. It continued after chemo. The neurosurgeon had me on muscle relaxants and narcs but nothing worked. I went to several docs but they couldn't figure out why I was in such pain. One of them told me to take glocosamine & chondroitin daily but it would take 2 weeks to kick in. It did, 2 weeks to the day & I have not had another back problem in the last 4 years.",
