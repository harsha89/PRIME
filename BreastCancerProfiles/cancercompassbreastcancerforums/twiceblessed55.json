I made an appointment to see a Doctor but I was told it was very common, I shouldn't be concerned, and I should return in one YEAR for a follow up! Right!!!! So, instead, I immediatly scheduled a consultation with a surgeon at a different hospital. The surgeon did an exploration of the breast and - whatdoya know - she found stage 1 breast cancer! We had recently lost my Aunt to BC, so I decided to be as pro-active as possible and have a double mascectomy. Good thing, as once the \"Tram Flap\" operation was over, the Doctor informed my family that it was stage 3a! Oh, and I had two types of BC - One that had the tendancy to spread and one that did not! I had complications and infections following surgery, and was hospitalized more than 15 times in the last 3 years. Because of this, I spend most of the time in bed in pain, take pain meds, and by the time I have recouperated from surgery and/or the infections cleared up, I'm back in the hospital! OK, I'll end this with good news: I am still in remission. I realize that is a blessing and I should be grateful. I just wish I could enjoy this time instead of spending most of it either in the hospital or in bed. I have one last operation in a few months. Hopefully, since I changed surgeons, there will be NO crazy complications * :0) * God Bless. ~Ljo *   I was first diagnosed with DCIS Stage0, Oct. 2006, had mastectomy with immediate reconstruction(tramflap). No treatments needed, no lymph nodes involved. Diagnosed April 2010 with suspicious mass in left breast high grade Invasive DCIS grade 3 stage 2a, triple negative. Had second mastectomy with expander for implant, had lymph node taken, but was neg. also all marginal areas neg. but due to the aggressiveness as preventive measures, taking 8 rounds of chemo treatments spaced every other week. Very aggressive treatment, effecting my fibromyalgia/IBS problems. The first known in my family with this, so was not considered at risk. Go for second treatment next week. Getting Neulasta shots the day after treatment. Severe pain from this shot. If not for my faith in God, I could not make it! I can understand at least in part your pain and weariness.  I never thought this would be the result of my annual exam with my gyn.  Even my surgeon from my previous surgeries was like \"in shock\".  He said he never expected it to be invasive.  I also had 2 hernia repairs in 2008(May & Oct) (incisional).  I helped take care of my daddy shortly after my tramflap, he had CLL(leukemia) and was terminal.  I had to pull on him at times.  Then in Nov 2009 I fell in the laundry room and broke my right wrist.   Had to have 4 pins put in.  But God has been good and there is a reason for all things, and one day maybe I'll know why.  TwiceBlessed in Ga",
