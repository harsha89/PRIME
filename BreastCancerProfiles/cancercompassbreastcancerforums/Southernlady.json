It is hard now to spend 20 miles on a bike let alone 75.  So I tried to take up running.  That is going pretty good but amazingly, I find that even by just running 10 miles, my vaginal skin gets aggravated.  I haven't had a mate for years  but am sure that when I am lucky enough to be blessed with one, sex will be painful.  A lttle rubbing in that area puts holes and tears in the skin that hurt for a week or two.  Yadda, yadda, you get the idea.  My gyn is aware of the problem and a few years ago she cut the skin where the clitoris is because it was fusing over.  The skin just fused together again.  I am not even sure what I am supposed to lok like down there anymore but I am sure it is all out of whack.  I now see ads for labia surgery.  Most of it is meant to be cosmetic but I am hoping there will be some available to me that will give me comfort.  Does anyone know if this condition will improve when I stop taking the Femara?  Right now, my gyn says there is nothing she can give me to treat it while I am on the drug.  So what can happen surgically and medication-wise when I am done with the Femara.  I can't wait. Woozz I know there are many ladies with this same problem.  I am trying to find a doctor that maybe performs a surgey for this.  Anyone ever heard of one?   I am a breast cancer survivor for over 16 years now.   I need to talk with some of you about this awful condition!",
