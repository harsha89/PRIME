      "Content": "No, Missy, I did not have chemo before the mastectomy.  They didn't diagnose the tumor as metaplastic until after the mastectomy.  One lymph node was involved, so Sloan Kettering recommended that I have more lymph nodes removed, which I did, and, thank God, they were negative.  Missy, how large is your tumor?  My neighbor had stage 4 breast cancer, had chemo before the mastectomy, the tumor shrunk, and five years later, she is fine.  Let me know how you make out.  Maryelsa",

      "Content": "Yes, I have metaplastic breast cancer.  I was diagnosed a year ago, had a mastectomy in December, and underwent CMF chemo for eight months.  I went to Sloan Kettering for a CAT scan on Aug. 2nd and, thank God, everything was clear.  I have to go for a mammography and a CAT scan on Feb. 7th.  My tumor was very small - less than 1 cm.  I am so thrilled that someone is looking into this cancer.  You have no idea how few people, including doctors, have never heard of it.",
