      "Content": "So, I went in for a routine mammogram. Hadn't gone in a few years even still I was not concerned in the least. I just wanted to check the box! They said they would mail results within 3 weeks and I never thought about it again.Until , I received a letter that noted a disclosure about dense breast and then noted that my left breast was asymmetry and they wanted me to come back for further testing. Sigh! My first thought was, I don't even have time to deal with the prospect of this. I just left one job started Real Estate on my own and I have a million fish to fry just like everyone else I'm sure. So I copartmentalized things for a few days but here comes a call from Rose following up on the letter and seeing when I could get the referral in. yep a dose of reality that really scared me. I was grateful yet really worried at the level of urgency. I just wanted to get thru my 46th Birthday stress free, I just needed to be in denial 3 more days. so I became proactive reached out to my primary in another state, and am getting the ball rollong. I just can't look at my breast the same. Today so many little things went wrong that normally I could push through. With this weight on my shoulders I broke down in the shower and cried my eyes out. It felt damn good too. I pray I don't have a long arduous fight ahead of me, but if I do I'm ready! Let's do this! Anyone who is interested in my journey, I'll be sure to keep you abreast (no pun).",
