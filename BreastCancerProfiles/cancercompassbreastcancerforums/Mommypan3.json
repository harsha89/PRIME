    "Content": "My mother (79) has metastatic lung cancer to her lymph system. She has done carboplatin & taxol and a few others (gemzan, tarceva). She is currently using herceptin only and it seems to be showing positive results with the tumors on her neck/armpit area. Her original biopsy/diagnosis (June 06) showed that her cancer cells \"resembled\" breast cancer so we are hoping these positive results will continue for her. She has done well so far w/3 treatments...only side effects...the runny nose, some diarrhea (only after 1st tx.) and some fatigue. Given her age and the fact that she has been doing chemo. nons-tstop for almost a year....I think she is doing VERY well! Â  Hope this helps... Karen",
