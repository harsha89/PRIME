      "Content": "Hi All, I found some interesting facts this past week, and thought that I would pass them along.I was Dx'd last Feb. with stage 3 breast cancer. I went through the Chemo & the Rads treatment, and hopefully everything is well. Last year, a month before we got the news about the cancer, my hubby lost his job after 11 years, so there went our Anthem Blue Cross Insurance. And being we were signing up for unemployment, we could no way afford the Cobra plan. My friend told me about the BCCP program, and I applied and got accepted. When the biopsy came back, and stated that I had Cancer, the BCCP put me on their Medicaid program. They did pay for the Chemo & Rads treatment. But... The canceled me right after.... they told me, being I wasn't doing \" Cancer treatment \" anymore, I was off the program. They also said that being my Rads Dr. Suspended treatment due to side effects, that was cause to be cut from the program. ( Which he suspended for a week, due to the fact I had Shingles) But I finished every last one of them. :) Now... Here is the interesting part.... What about the \" after care\"? Well, to make a long battle short. to all you women out there from Ohio.... The BCCP/ Medicaid program, is supposed to cover post treatment. It is up to your Dr. to advise them of this. I found this out, when I contacted Liz Schulte, from the Northern Ohio Breast Cancer Coalition. Her address is as follows, for all of you, that are worried on how you're going to pay the medical bills. Elizabeth Schulte Northern Ohio Breast Cancer Coalition Fund National Breast Cancer Coalition 8921 Brecksville Rd. Brecksville, OH 44141 p - 440-717-9912 f-440-717-9962 www.nobcc.org Northern Ohio Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, a member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, is a non-profit, 501 c 3 group that engages in advocacy on behalf of and provides assistance to those living with breast cancer.

Hello,  I am sorry to read about your mom. As for the time, relating to everything that has happened to her.. I can only tell, you about my experience.  I went in for a mammogram, on a Monday. The nurse told me to sit tight for a moment, and the the Dr. appeared. And told me he thought I had breast cancer. And in the meantime, he called my family Dr. And made an appt. for me , for that same afternon.  My family Dr. Then went and made an appt. with the surgeon. I went to see the surgeon, on a Weds. And was in surgery that Friday.  That was 4 years ago, they did a lumpectomy at that time. I was Dx'd with Stage 3 Breast cancer. A year a half ago, I was Dx'd with Stage1 cancer in the other breast, and opted for the bi-lateral mastectomy. Have a great weekend!    So.. It is possible, to have a DX. that soon.  ",

Has anyone had a problem, with the bras riding up, and settling on the incision?  I have an open wound ( Yes, after 1 1/2 years) But anyway, that's a story in it's self.   I am looking for a way, or a garment, that won't ride up on the incision.  I have tried the cammy's and that is ok.. But for something more formal, does anyone have any ideas? I have the sylicone(?) forms, and the softies as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Regards,  Deb",

Hope all goes well. Marcia Hi Marcia,  I have to agree with you. I was Dx'd in 2005 with Stage 3 breast Cancer. Then had it agaIN IN 2007.  The Taxotere was alot better to side effect wise than the A/C was.",

I went for an interview at a local private club, for a bartending job,( being I used to work at the local country club years ago I felt, WOW I could do this ... no problem! lol Well, damn, after I walked in there and seen the other \" girls\" with hip huggers and belly button rings, I sure felt like an ANTIQUE! LOL But while I was going through Rads, I was also going taking classes, and finally landed a job, in a local nursing home. They say that things come \" full circle\" Well, this did, it was the nursing home that I worked at 30 years ago! when I was in my early 20's. I talked to there DON and was telling her that next year I wanted to go back and get my RN degree.

Things are finally starting to fall back into place. yes, I did lose my business, but I also had a lot of time to think about things. What I have learned is that,God, and good friends will always pull you through. As my one girlfriend told me. \" if God brought you to it, he'll pull you through it\" And that's exactly what he did.

But i do believe in both! :) As far as coping after treatment. it's hard to stay positive. I am 49 years old, lost my business, due to scheduling for chemo & rads treatemnt. and trying to start all over at 49 is a real treat!! LOL.... not to mention, trying to get life insurance! I got refused coverage from one of the major companys in the U.S. Even though right now I am cancer free. Just the \" label\" As having had Cancer is a problem. I like many others wonder.... what the hell , do I do now?? But i keep plugging along.... Best regards, to everyone that is in the samne boat",
