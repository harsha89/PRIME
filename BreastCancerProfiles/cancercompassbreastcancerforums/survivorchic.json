I was given 3 sessions of Taxitere, had a scan last week & it's not working. My onc has switched me to Taxol & Gemzar, started that last Friday-had a very rough week last week after all this news. I had cancer 3 years ago & thought I was doing great. My husband left 2 years ago cuz he couldn't handle it & sometimes I feel very alone although I have great friends & family. I stumbled upon this site & hope it will help with suggestions & coping. I can't take any hormones, as I am er-hr-. I am going to try some alternative medicines & am radically trying to change my diet-NO SUGAR! anyway-love to hear from anyone who can perk me up! Thanks Linda",

My doc has given me 100% of the taxol, and 80% of the gemzar- next week I'll get 90%. Overall, hasn't been bad, just tired & no stamina, which is to be expected. Tell me how your scans went- I have prayed that they good results. This week I am going to explore a healing touch practioner & also some guided imagery class. Can't hurt right? Linda",

ER positive but even the anti-hormonals didn't do a thing. Joanne I was diagnosed in Dec 08 that my bc had meta to my lymphnodes in my abdomen after 3.5 years of remission. I have been on 5 diff chemos since Jan & the tumors have still been growing. I am now on taxol & avastin which is a prohibitor to starve the cancer cells. I think it's working, but I've been dissappointed so many times, I can't get my hopes up. I am triple neg so can't do any hormone therapies. I am 42 & very scared that this has come back & had alot more complications & trauma since the first bout in 04. I guess all we can do is keep trying & hope something will work-I know you're supposed to stay positive & I try, but when its setback after setback, it's tough! So stay as positive as you can and surround yourself with positive people.",

Let us know how you make out-lot's of support here just ask Linda Linda, may we ask how old you are? Also, how are you doing?  your reaccurances, are they in check now or are you still fighting the beast?stage?I am now 42 & unfortunately in Dec found out it's back-I was in remission for 3 years. I am on chemo, 2nd batch of drugs because the first drug didn't shrink the tumors which are now in my abdomen. Considered stage 4 since metastatic. I'm praying these drugs will work- had 1 cycle so far. No side effects which is weird, but great!  ",
