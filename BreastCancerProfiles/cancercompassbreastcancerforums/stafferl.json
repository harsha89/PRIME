    "Content": "I have had cancer 3 times in 5 years. My latest is metaplastic  spindlecell carcinoma. Currently I am told there is nothing to be done other than surgery. I have been told there are no tests that catch reaccurence except pain or rash. All three cancer's have been found by me the last reacurence was found by a rash on my mastectomy scar. There was a horrible disfiguring surgerys followed by 8 months with a wound vac for healing. I have only one layer of skin over surgery site. There currently is no follow up although the first time I had surgery it was followed by chemo and a full dose of radiation.  Does anyone have this diagonis and experience.",
