I think we've been trained to rely on mammograms to tell us whether or not we have cancer.  I now always advise people to trust their bodies, pay attention to what's happening, and insist on more tests if something doesn't feel right.Hi How are things since they have found in your spine and pelvis? Have they been able to treat it with effect? My mum has just found out she has breast cancer after the mammogram showed clear 2 years ago. After tests its too late to operate apparently and its been undetected for so long its now spread to her spine and pelvis. They claim its not curable but treatable with medication. We don't really know much more until Thursday when she sees oncologist. Thanks",

Hi Springflowers Hope you are doing well. It was so nice to read your story about how your cancer has been cleared. My mother unfortunately has advanced breast cancer to bladder, around bowel, in lining of lung, in stomach lining and spine. She is doing it quite tough at the moment and has been in hospital most of this year. She had strong chemo about one month ago and it has left her bed ridden and in a poor state. You mentioned being able to email a list of supplements/nutrients you took. I would love to find out exactly what you did as I would like to replicate this for my mum. I also read in an earlier post you said your voice went away for a while but came back. My mothers' voice is very weak at the moment also and she is having laboured breathing. I suspect from the cancer in the lining of her lung. Do you know why your voice went away? If you are still on this website please let me know so we can make email contact.  Many thanks and best regards and hope to hear from you soonHi My mum has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and secondary spine and pelvis cancer. I am really keen to learn what you did using the alternative route please. Please could you inbox me the details if it no trouble for you? Many thanks ??",
