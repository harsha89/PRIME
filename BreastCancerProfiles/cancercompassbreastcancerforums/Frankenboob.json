      "Content": "Hi Annie, Thank you for writing me back. You make me feel like such a sissy for feeling the way I do and I have not had to endure half of what you have. I have a few more weeks to see how this anti depressant is going to work on me and see how my moods/physical stuff is going to be and if I want to make the decision to go back to work or apply for disability. Everyone that I know keeps telliing me how strong I am. I know that I am strong, I know that I will get through this, I know that I will not lay down and die here, but I am just not so sure if I want to return to the life I had before cancer. I can't seem to fit myself back into that picture. I don't know what my Creator has in store for me, but I don't think that it is going back to work. I have talked to some who ended up going on disability after their cancer. When I talked with the cancer legal rights people, they informed me that cancer was a disability. I told them that I had a bilateral mastectomy and they got all the cancer, so I did not have cancer now. The girl I was talking with kinda laughed. She asked me if I have an appt. with my oncologist scheduled. I said yes, why?? She asked me how often I was going to have to see him. I said that I did not know. She informed me that I would have to see him the rest of my life because once you have cancer, you are always on the lookout for it. I was so numb to everything that I did not realize that it comes back. She sent me information to read about disability. I don't know what I am going to do and keep reminding myself that I don't have to make any decisions today. I have been 22 years sober without a drink, and I have done it one day at a time. I could not predict my future with my alcoholism, I just had to keep doing the next right thing, trust a higher power and keep working with others. That is what I need to do with this, I guess. I hope that all is well with you now. How long has it been? How was it going back to work? How often do you see your doctor? Anita    ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in December 2006 with breast cancer. On January 13, 2007 I had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. I was stage one and I was told that I only need to take Tamoxifen for the next five years. I am very grateful and I do believe in miracles. I have been off work now since Jan. and am on the Family Medical Leave and extended disabiltiy pay, which is not much. But my job is protected and they are waiting for my return. I went back to work in March and worked two weeks and could not do it. The Tamoxifen has not affected me very well. I can't sleep at night because I wake up every hour soaked. I am very emotional and am having a hard time getting a handle on it. I am so fatigued and can't seem to think straight. I don't know if that is because of lack of sleep or depression or what. I talked with my ocologist and he said that what I was experiencing is normal and anti-depressants might help. He gave me two months off work to try to get it together. I am considered by most who know me as a very strong person. I have been recovered from alcoholism and drug addiction for 22 years and I attend AA daily to help others. The people that I have known in AA think that I am invincible. I am weak as paper in the rain right now. I just had a second surgery to correct the size descrepancy of my breast implants and had to be off my medications for a week and now am back on them and recovering again. I am supposed to return to work at the beginning of June. I do not want to go back to work. I am afraid, I am not feeling competent, I do not feel as though I can go back and act like nothing happened, I do not feel emotionally or mentally able to return to work. I have good days and I have really bad days. I try to pray my way through the bad days and just hang on till tomorrow. I have gained 20 pounds because I quit smoking and I am constantly dripping with sweat. I feel unable to present myself to the public and feel ok about myself.  Is there anyone else out there that has not returned to work? Please let me know. Anita  ",

      "Content": "Dear Kimarie,      Did you decide to go off the Tamoxifen on your own? I have been reading some information that suggests that if you are early detection and stage one, that the Tamoxifen can actually do more physical harm than good. I have been contemplating goin off it and just drinking the Esiac Tea. Many doctors in Canada actually prescribe that tea to their patients. I have gained twenty pounds and sweat like a stuffed pig, I have also always been small and I am not happy with my appearance. How vain is that?? I think that it has to do with the powerlessness of cancer. I know how much it has stepped in and changed my life, and I don't want to accept anymore changes. But if I take the time to ask my Creator to redirect my thinking and give me a new perspective, I can say, \"Yea, I am heavier than I have ever been, but I smoked for 38 years and I have not had a smoke since January 11th. And hey, look at Mae West, she was not no Twiggy!\" And the bottom line, we are still here! Anita  ",

      "Content": "Hi there! I had bilateral mast and immediate reconstruction in January 2007. One was bigger than the other and he had to redo in April. After a few months of healing, they both appeared symetrical.  I have been taking Tamoxifen since then and just last week the doctor told me that my estrogen levels were low enough to switch to Arimidex. I started taking it and after three days of taking it, my right breast, the one that the cancer was in and the one that had to be redone, has grown to double its size. It not only visibly appears larger, but by touch it is very hard and actually hurts and feels like it is going to explode. I am wondering if the Arimidex has done this to anyone else?? Anita",
