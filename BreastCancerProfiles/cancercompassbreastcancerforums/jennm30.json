I have one that is a nodule kinda deeper down, seems to be in the breast tissue,and the other is kind of a long lump across the underarm. Anyone ever get anything like this?  And i only had the ultrasound on the left breast so now I'm freaking out about the right. Especially when i have a couple of red marks on it that Just developed yesterday. ",

      "Content": "Hey everyone. About me, I'm a 30 year old with a 4 y/o daughter. I'd say a month and a half ago I found a couple of lumps in my armpit. I called my drs office and they ordered an ultrasound...ultrasound says all is benign including a simple looking cyst in my left breast, same side as lumps in armpit. About the time I noticed the lump, I started getting pain in both breasts.I noticed it most in the one spot I was told i had the simple cyst. Then I noticed it was the same kind of ache in my other breast. And an ache in the other armpit. I am sick to my stomache every day thinking the ultrasound missed something. I have an apt Monday and was told I would probably be sent for another ultrasound, this time on both breasts and with a mamogram just to.ease my mind. Has anyone ever had anything like this happen? Should I be freaking out? Thanks in advance! -jenn",

I'm on my husbands insurance which is an HSA so I'm freaking about the cost of it all of it does come out as positive. So all in all I'm praying its all in my head and my stress is causing the pain. then comes the what if its positive and it spread everywhere and I only have months to live... see, its making me crazy. I'm terrified its something they will miss and rhen months later its too late, ya know? ",
