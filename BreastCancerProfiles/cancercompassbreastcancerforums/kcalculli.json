    "Content": "I have now had 2 Zoladex implant treatments and as a result my body is showing signs of forced menopause. I no longer get my periods etc. However my recent blood test has shown incredible high level of estrogen still in my body.  My Dr is at a loss to explain this elevation and can't seem to give me any answers as to why considering the role of Zoladex is to halt the production of estrogen produced by the ovaries. I have also done everything in my control to reduce my exposure to anything that may mimick estrogen in my body ie; non use of personal products, removal of all plastics in the house, non exposure to pesticides, diet etc. Has anyone had a similar experience?  If so what options were you given. I am totally against going on tamoxifin.",
