    "Content": "There is an excellent laser breast cancer surgeon in Long Island. Dr. Vincent Ansanelli, I went to him for a partial mastectomy and I had NO PAIN, this surgery needs to be made public. I walked out of the recovery room and out to dinner! I flew home 2 days after surgery to host a babyshower for my niece. No one could believe I just had surgery! Â ",
