      "Content": "Hi. I'm Pete my wife's caregiver. She's 43. Survivor to stage llla primary  IDC triple negative breast cancer 24+ lymph nodes in addition to....... at the same time, stage lla EGFR + primary Non small cell lung cancer.  She's been through alot and back. NED since Nov 2016. I know this topic all too well. We found a lump one inch above my wife's left breast in Jan 2017. To explain I will fast forward and use bullet points. 1. Found lump above left breast in late January 2017 2. Oncologist said \" couldn't say what is was \" 3. Plastic surgeon said \" looks like fatty necrosis \" 4. Double mastectomy surgeon \" not sure what it is\"  offered to order ultrasound. Gee, thank you Doc! 5. 1st Ultrasound Dr said \"looks like fatty necrosis 98.9 percent sure\" do you still want biopsy?  Absolutely!! 6. March 2017 2nd Ultrasound Dr with the guided needle point biopsy said \"looks like fatty necrosis \" my wife decided to trust her medical team and agree it's fatty necrosis.  Opted NOT for needle biopsy.  I respect my wife's decisions, I'm still trying everyday to be positive and calm. It's very tough though. 7. Saw the plastic surgeon again, \"yeah, yeah still looks like fatty necrosis \"  Looks like, looks like, looks like.....how about finding out for sure. I'm sorry for venting on your topic. I'm still having small break downs over this. I hope that you decide to get the biopsy.  To make absolutely sure. I wish my wife would have. Be well moms... Pete.",

Everyone's cancer diagnosis is different.  Everyone's dealing with cancer is also different.  How you describe your feelings,  I think is absolutely normal to feel this way. Please come here often and let us know how things are going.  Do you have a caregiver to help you through this?",

The oncologist is very busy, thats why there is a flip flop every 3 weeks.  My wife also goes in for port flushes.  My wifes sees both her surgeons  (breast and lung) every 6 months. My wife sees her breast reconstruction surgeon every 4 months. I hope my post helped you commett. Be well. Pete.",

When grade 3 cells divide quickly the cancer is at it's peak point of vulnerability. Chemotherapy kills grade 3 cancer cells like using a water hose to put out a little camp fire. Even cells whom like to hide in the far corners of your body that are undetectable from tumor markers in blood tests to ultrasound, CT, and PET scans..... can't survive. If your doctor suspects/his gut is telling him, that even one cancer cell got past your clear margins, that's maybe why he still wants chemotherapy as a (final cleanse) treatment.  ----------------------------------------- These are just my thoughts, I'm in no way shape/form/credited/associated in any medical field or occupation.
