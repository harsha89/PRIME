    "Content": "I am getting concerned.  I have been on Arimidex since 7/07 and my body HURTS.  After sitting for a while, I get up and my feet and ankles are SOO stiff.  I find it hard to fall asleep and even harder to stay asleep.  I wake up with a headache, stiff neck, swollen fingers and very achey arms. Is anyone else experiencing these same symtoms? HHEELLLPPP!!",
