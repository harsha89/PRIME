    "Content": "My mother is diagnosed with two cancers, one in Sigmoid colon, and another in Left breast. Surgeries were already done, and 2 rounds of chemotherapies were given for both, breast and colon Recent reports have shows it has spread to liver, and CEA value has consistently increased, currently, 193.2. Her chemotherapy has been changed after this, concentrating on colon. Is it ok to give the Hormonal Therapy(HT) tablets also, as chemo is right now for colon alone. Her Breast Cancer is ER+, PR+, Cerb B2 -. Internet search says that Hormonal Therapy(HT) tablets have a good role here. But, I wanted to confirm. Regards, Pankaj",
