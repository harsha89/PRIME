    "Content": "I have lost 6 (my dads side) to different types of cancer. I lost my sister in 1998 (she was 33) to breast cancer. Now my daughter is 27 and has pimple like spots in her arm pit. What should be my advise? I'm so worried about her, but I don't want to scare her. She keeps remembering about her Aunt Barbara (my sister). Remembering all the bone marrow transplants, the pain and the steroids. How can I help my daughter without scaring her?",
