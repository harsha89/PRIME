    "Content": "My reply is to the whole discussion actually... can't figue out how to just post a comment.  I too can smell this since i was a teenager and my uncle lived with us, he had hiv, and non-hodgkins (sp)...  the smell is terrible, rotting is right, it makes my eyes burn almost chemical like (sometimes smoke like).  I now work in an integrative drs office and see lots of cancer patients - i don't always smell it.  the other day for several days a women came in for ivs and I never smelt it, but then one day she did a little o3 treatment and i smelt it when i went in that room.  I smelt it on a women at the coffee shop yesterday who i talk to but don't know well... what do you do? i would like to have a gift, but i'm nots sure about this one.  I also can smell other odors - i think diabetes - sweeter, and I was teaching a young girl yoga one day and she is physically disabled some and she had more of a urine smell, but she was a clean girl... and it was each time not just one time i saw her.  I know i can smell some foods in my urine like asparagus is the most detectable, but there have been others.  Facinating, I wish i could develop and understand this more and use it to help people... ",
