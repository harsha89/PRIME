    "Content": "My wife has bone mets starting in 03 after having a mastectamy in 2000, 6 cmf chemos and taking tomoxafin. She went 1 yr. on paclitaxel before relapse. She then went 18 months on Xeloda before the tumor markers began to climb. She then went on adriamycin for 9 treatments with the markers still climbing. We switched to abraxane which is protien bound paclitaxel nano particle. She has had 5 treatments and the tumor markers have begun to drop. So the answere in this case seems to be a qualified yes.",
