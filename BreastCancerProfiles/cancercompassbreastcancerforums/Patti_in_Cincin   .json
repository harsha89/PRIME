I was down to where I would just have to see my oncologist twice and year and started having some leg pain, well after some scans it was determined that the \"C\" had metastized to my bones. So I had a few more rounds of radiation on various parts of my body. Through all of this God gave me His continued strength to keep working. However, now I am taking Xeloda and have developed hand & foot syndrome. Has anyone expierenced this and if so do you have any suggestions to help it. It sure is painful................ Thank you and God Bless to All J   I received Adramycin/Cytoxan and Taxol Chemotherapy also for a 6-month duration back in 2001 for early Stage II cancer (after having had a right modified radical mastectomy from a breast cancer specialist).    I ended up with peripheral neuropathy in the hands and feet just as you are experiencing.  In addition to that, I had severe nerve damage in the chest and pain there from the surgery which has never gone away. I've had extreme pain all along in the chest, feet and hands.  When the pain peaked so badly after the ending of my chemo, I called the nurse in the oncologists office and was in tears.  I'd been boiling hotpacks at home and applying them to my chest and that helped for a short while.    What might be of help to you is NEURONTIN (Gabapentin) CAPSULES  - 300 mg.  I worked slowly and built up to 1,800 mg. per day, taking 2 at breakfast, 2 at lunch, and 2 at supper time.  These could be prescribed by your oncology office or your family doctor or internist.    Also, my internist doctor prescribed PAMELOR (Nortriptyline) - 25 mg. capsule - 1 at bedtime to help with all the pain and help with sleep.  So, I've been on this regimen since 2001:  6 Neurontin Caps per day and 1 Pamelor at night.     You can ask for the generic forms of these two medications and it is CHEAPER.  Generic Pamelor is Nortriptyline, and Generic Neurontin is Gabapentin. Also, I've read about something on-line recently that I'm exploring and you might want to read about it too. It's from ReBuilder Medical, Inc.: http://www.rebuildermedical.com   They will send you information upon request about a device that they claim can help with the neuropathy in the feet.  I have received a small disc with information on it that I've yet to put in and play.  It is called Heartbeat of America Interview - Hosted by William Shatner. You can purchase the device on-line from ReBuilder Medical Technologies, Inc. You can read for yourself and see what you think.    For the pain in my chest that peaks throughout the day, I've discovered that a heavy-duty moist THERMOPHORE heating pad really helps that. I have it on several times a day when the pain peaks the worst.  I think it encourages blood circulation around the damaged nerve tissue.  The most up-dated pad has 4 blocks that turn green when you plug in the pad.  Each block is for 5 minutes duration.  The pad goes off on its own after 20 minutes total.  Or, you can turn it off on your own if you do not need all of the 20 minutes.  This pad penetrates down deeper than ordinary heating pads.  You can purchase the Thermophore on-line also or have your pharmacy order in one for you if you are interested in it.  The peripheral neuropathy you are experiencing is a result of taking TAXOL.  Have you talked with the nurse in your oncologists office or specifically your oncology doctor as well about it?  They are familiar with Neurontin which can help a lot of people like you.  There is also a new medication called LYRICA that is for neuropathy.  I tried it for three months but it was not effective for me.  If you do decide to take the Neurontin, order some Vitamin D-3 capsules from Swanson Vitamins and take one daily.  Taken long-term Neurontin can deplete Vitamin D in the body.  I've read that anticonvulsants can sometimes cause osteoporosis when taken long-term if you do not supplement with Vitamin D-3 (Cholecalciferol).  So, for that reason, I buy the High-Potency Vitamin D-3 in the 1,000 International Units size from Swanson Vitamins - Item No. SW1030 - Toll Free Number is:  1-800-437-4148.  I've also read that Vitamin B 6 is good to take for neuropathy and I  take that as well and boost the level to 3 capsules per day.  The B-6 Item No. is SW022 at SwansonVitamins.com or at the same toll free phone number I've listed above.  The B-6 I take is 100 mg. 3 x per day (in capsule form from Swanson Vitamins.  I'm not sure of your age, but if you have not had a DEXA Bone Density Test, ask for one to get your baseline.  Then follow your doctor's suggestion as to what intervals to redo the DEXA Bone Density Scan thereafter if you take the Neurontin ongoing.  I hope this information will be of help to you.  Do let me know how you do on the Neurontin if you take it.  Remember, you can start low and build upon it as you need it strength wise.             ",
