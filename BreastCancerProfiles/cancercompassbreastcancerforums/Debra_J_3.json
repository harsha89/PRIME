      "Content": "Cheryl, I will keep both you and your sister in my prayers. Never give up hope. If I had to give anyone advice about how to best help a loved one with cancer it would be simply this: Ask them what they need. You might have to ask more than once. Some of us have a little trouble under the worst of circumstances admitting we need any help. In my case, (and I apologize in advance for my snarky sense of humor), I wish I'd been specific when my friends and family asked what they could do. Since post-op what I really needed was someone to lift a laundry basket, not send me a fruit basket! *laugh* If you or your sister need an ear to listen or a shoulder to cry on, I'm here! Deb",

      "Content": "Has anyone else had this type of reconstruction after breast cancer. Frankly, I'm the toughest person I know and after three months I'm still not back to normal! I was in the hospital for longer than expected. Two nurses who had never dealt with a patient who'd had this procedure came in and gave me a less than gentle sponge bath and caused some problems with a hematoma which reqired me to go back to surgery twice. After I came home I ended up back in the hospital a week and a half later for an infection involving my abdominal incision. My original surgery was in early April. I just had to go back last week because of several areas where the sutures didn't disolve before my body sort of encapsulated the material and then these areas sort of became red and puffed up and burst! Anyone else experience anything remotely like this?!",

      "Content": "I initially had my surgery scheduled to recover in time for spring planting for NE Ohio, but my surgeon had a cancelation and I decided that I should just go ahead and get it over with. Then I had the unplaned trips back to the OR and when I finally thought the weather would stay warm enough and that I'd recovered sufficiently I ended up being surprised that my abdomen played so much of a role in digging and standing again once you'd been kneeling and at one point I ended up on my back on my lawn feeling more like 80 instead of 40 and when my neighbor saw me she thought I'd had a heat stroke! *L*",
