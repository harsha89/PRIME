      "Content": "Hi Linda, I am so glad that I read your message.  I ran into this website and had become discouraged by some of the consequences of people not doing certain drugs or what have you.  I am a 32 year old (premenopausal) woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 7/06.  After 3 surgeries they stated I had clear margins and I could go ahead and proceed with chemo, herceptin, radiation and tamoxifen.  I said no way and (but I did accept the herceptin).  I read everything I could about natural ways to cure cancer.  Made several changes to my diet and lifestyle (suanas, colonics, organic foods, organic products, Protocel, supplements, herbal teas.. etc)  anything that made sense I tried.   5 months later I found another lump that was diagnosed as cancer (same breast right underneath the scar tissue) Immediately I thought I tried the best now I have to try chemo & radiation.  But it just did not sit right in my spirit,  I could not imagine risking my health just so I \"might\" get rid of cancer.  I want to fight cancer not cancer and treatment.  I have a couple of questions for you.  I would like to hear your opinion and or your experience (and anyone else who might want to chime in).  How have you encountered cancer?  Was this your experience or a loved one?  How long have you had a successful recovery?  Finally,  I know pharmacueticals can be damaging but how do you feel about surgery?  Masectomy or lumpectomy?  Just your opinion.  Thanks  DW",
