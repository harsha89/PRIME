    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006.  I also carry the BCRA gene so I was not surprised when I was diagnosed.  If I had not been so vain I would have had my breast removed before I got cancer.  Thank God it was the BEST possible diagnosis if one has to get cancer.  I had a 14 hour surgery for removal of both breast and reconstruction.  I did not need chemo.  One of my daughters carry the gene so of course I worry constantly about her..She is now 25 years old and does not want any radical surgeries. I am taking Arimidex and have been told I will need to take it for 5 years. Has anyone taken the Arimidex, if so how long, has it been beneficial and have you experienced any horrible side affects. ",
