      "Content": "My sister has breast cancer that has met. to liver. after chemo,  doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide., the blood supply to the cancer in her breast has been cut off. The liver has less cancer but still some spots. Her doc is not worried about the breast cancer, but is focusing on the liver.  Since the cancer is estrogen sensitive, she is now on letrozole 2.5 milligrams to block estrogen. Her Doc says take this for 2 1/2 months and then a new liver scan. Does anyone think this is waiting to long to recheck. Any knowledge at all would help. We are worried!! Thanks!",

Demateo and after reviewing tests he agreed to remove the part of my liver that had cancer. You can reach his office at 212 639-5726 and see if your sister is a candidate for the surgery.  I wish you all the best   Thank you for the information. I was wondering if removing part of her liver would help. I will save the number in case her hormone therapy doesn't remove the remaining spots. Thanks so much and I wish you the best also!",

I have since started chemo and have gone thru all 4 treatments of adryamiacin and it has really done its job. The lesion on my liver has gone to half the size it actually was when first found. Did the onc do all tests on sis before starting on chemo? Yes, the liver cancer was discovered before she began chemo and it has been reduced. Now she is taking hormone blocker which will hopefully continue to choke this cancer out!!",
