Had double mastecomy, final path report shows no lymph envolvement, and clean margins around the cancer site. Awaiting Oncotype results to see if need chemo. Onocologist states will need med next five years, after reading about all the side effects wondering if its a good idea, have arhritis in by low back, scleraderma, my joints always ache anyway, can't aford any more time off work, this is where my insurance is from. I'm 4 weeks post op, still confused, worried, and uncomfortable,having reconstruction done also. I'm 54 years young. Any input in should I or shouldn't I take a anti cancer drug. A nurse I am and I can't answer this ?  Help, hanging in there. Hi I too am trying to decide whether or not to take Arimidex as prescribed by my oncologist.  My bone density test shows I have osteopenia in my  spine and could have fractures so I am petrified to take something that I have read so much about in relation to being hard on your bones.  I too had Stage 1, double mastectomy, no lymph envolvement and clean margins. I chose not to have reconstruction.  My oncotype test came in at 1.  I hope you have a good result too.  Let me know what you decide on the meds.  Dear Rosieo, You shall do as you wish, of course, but please don't do anything until you have watched the dvd \"Healing Cancer from the Inside Out\" by Mike Anderson.  It's an eye opener.  The first part tells you, and has testimonials about, what happens when you have chemotherapy.  The second part is about alternative methods and clinics and is full of hope. The choice will always be yours. Best of luck.",
