      "Content": "hi andi - i was just diagnosed with triple negative ductal invasive too - caucasion 49 year old - i found my lump - it's painful too - i met with oncologoist monday - have had breast mri - pet - and now am having a bone scan and chest ct scan - 2.5 x 3.5 cm - all in all - pretty scary - i did not know that there were subtypes of cancer - i just thought it was \"breast cancer\" - oh well, i am glad i found this board - i am keeping my spirits up and hope you all do the same - a good friend of mine described this as a \"major inconvenience\" - let's all pray it's just that for all of us!! I am currently in nursing school and no one seems to have heard of this triple negative thing - keep us updated   amf923",
