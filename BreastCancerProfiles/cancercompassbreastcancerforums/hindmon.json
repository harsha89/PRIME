    "Content": "My 69 year old mother was diagnosed 7 years ago with invasive lobular breast cancer.  At that time, it was also discovered in her bones (mainly hip and lower spine.)  This last fall, it had spread to stomach, stomach lining, and many more bones.  Just after Christmas, she was told that they found cancer cells in spinal fluid though no masses in brain/spine.  So far chemo has not worked (directed into spinal fluid per epidurl type procedure.)  Now they've placed a port in the top of her head to put in chemo that way.  My mom will not ask a lot of questions nor does she allow anyone else too.  From everything I can find, basically we're just buying time.  Even if this chemo works (I don't know type), it's just to extend a few months.  Am I reading all the information correctly.  She's at an excellent facility.  Thanks for your help!",
