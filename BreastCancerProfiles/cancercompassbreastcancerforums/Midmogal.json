      "Content": "A couple weeks ago, I had my first mammogram ever.  Last week, they called and said that I needed to come in for a follow-up ultrasound, as there was something in the mammogram that they wanted to check further.  Today, I went for my ultrasound.  After the ultrasound was complete, the radiologist came in to let me know that I have a solid \"lesion\" in my right breast that is 12mm x 9 mm in size.  His concern was not so much in the size of it, but in the fact that the \"lesion\" has warbled edges (my word choice, not his).  He showed me several of the ultrasound photos and I completely saw what he was referring to.  He advised me that, while he does not want to scare me, he feels like the \"lesion\" should be core biopsied as soon as possible.  They will send my results and their recommendation to my doctor first thing Monday morning and I expect to have the biopsy completed sometime next week, as he says that he will see that I get scheduled in as soon as the doctor orders the biopsy.  I'm still a bit in shock, though I have caught my breath and calmed down for the most part.  I know that the time between now and the biopsy is going to pass sooooo slowly, so I am asking the CancerCompass family to please lift me up in prayer in the days ahead and ask God to prepare my heart for whatever the results are.  I'm 43 years old and I have been married less than 10 years, and to be honest, while I am not afraid of death, I would really like to spend another 20 or 30 years loving my wonderful husband.  Thank you to anyone who takes times to pray for me.  Brenda",

      "Content": "My mother-in-law found a lump in her breast and recently had an ultrasound done on it.  As is expected, she has been extremely stressed since the lump was found.  Today, she received a letter with her test results, that stated that the lump was  \"Bi-RAd IV catagory... complex cyst with eccentric soft tissue echogenecity component.\"  My mother-in-law has no idea what this means, but to her it sounds absolutely horrible. Because I'm a realtively smart cookie with some nursing school under my belt, she came to me to ask what I know about this.  I told her I did not knwo anything at all about it, but that I would find something out about it.   I believe that knowledge is power, so I want to give her all the info I can, not only to inform her, but hopefully to ease her mind that she is not \"ate up with cancer\" as she so eloquently has put it. It is my understanding from what I found that the BIRAD IVresult is not uncommon and that while most cases end up being benign, there is a chance that this abnormality could be a type of cancer.  Does anyone out there know anything else that would help me help her out?  Can anyone tell me what that \"eccentric soft tissue echogenecity component\" part of this means? I fully understand that the next step is to have a biopsy done to verify if this is cancerous or not. I pray that this is not cancer.  My dad was diagnosed with brain cancer last January and died this past January from complications.  2007 was the most stressful year of our life.  I don't want to think about someone else I love having to go through what Dad went through.  And not to sound selfish, but I am not sure that I have the strength left right now to handle the emotional aspect of yet another bout of cancer in my family. Please keep my mother in law, Julie, and our whole family, in your prayers and if anyone has any info in response to my question, please let me know.  Thanks!!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "My mother-in-law had a lumpectomy done several months ago and they told her it was cancer, but they got it all, and at that time, they did not feel she needed to take any medication at all.  This information was discussed by the surgeon, an oncologist and the radiation specilist.  Now, here we are at 6 months later, and today, the surgeon who did the lumpectomy told her that he wants to put her on Aromasin for 5 years.  Once he told her all of the side effects, she is completely freaked out and wants my husband and I to give her advice on whether she should take the medicine or not. Before I say anything to her, I wanted to get some input from folks who have had personal experience with Aromasin, regardless of whether you had a positive or negative experience with it. I am new to the Breast Cancer Board here at Cancercompass, but am completely familiar with the website as I have been using it for almost 2 years after my Dad was diagnosed with Brain Cancer.  So, I have learned that the best \"info\" one can get is from the people who are experiencing it. 1.  Is is normal for this drug to be used for someone who has not had cancer so serious as to require invasive surgery? 2.  Is there anyone who has NOT had really negative effects from this medication. 3.  Can anyone tell me if this is a well-known drug, and if so, is it expensive or relatively low in cost.  If is it expensive, we will never convince her to start the treatment. 4.  Has anyone experienced hospitalization as a result of Aromasin?  Julie does not provide us much information about her situation.  With my dad's cancer, we knew everything that went on.  Because she is such a private preson, she does not talk about it much. Thanks so much.  I do hope that someone will help us with the answers we are looking for...Please pray for Julie and her family also....Thanks again.....brenda",
