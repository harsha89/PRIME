      "Content": "cognitive impairements we suffer after cancer treatment. I've have my onco's constantly tell me that it will pass and it can't be that bad. Well it's emabarassing offering a plate of chips and calling them bandaids with a perfectly serious look on my face. Forget important appointments, being afraid to drive a times because of fogginess and fatique.  Putting up the joint pain and bone pain.  Addd that to losing your hair and your skin drying up no matter how much you slather on it. It's about time it's been looked at as a serious part of cancer after care.  When this happens I tend to feel so alone and afraid that it will never end.  Maybe now they can do studies that will help future chemo patients not have to suffer these effects as well as everything else cancer throws our way.

      "Content": "I am having the same problems with extreme bone pain and joint and finger pain.  A great new one started about two weeks ago I have two large spots on my right leg where I have absolutely no feeling except it's ice cold and it' drives me crazy.  Taxols are the main cause for the neuropathy that's what they call it.  And I had FEC-D that was my chemo treatment. I felt really bad with FEC but when they started the Docetaxel I was floored with body pain and major headaches.  The onco's say it's a side effects and will pass but they really play it down.  A really good hones book is by Dr. Susan Love she wrote the truth about what chemo can do to some patients.  Your not alone and my heart goes out to you and I will say a prayer for you to get some relief.  All the best and please get the book it's amazingly informative.
