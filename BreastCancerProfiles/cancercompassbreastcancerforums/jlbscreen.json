      "Content": "MY daughter has had this for 3 years and breast cancer for 3 years previous.  She is taking the zomata shot once a month for bones and femera for the past two years.  Her side effects from chemo is loss of hair that returned very thin and straight with little growth.  She also has a weight problem.  What she does on her own is take a Vitamin C infusion once a week, and a variety of vitamins and minerals.  She also does a liver flush about every three months.  We have followed a variety of wholostic readings to come up with what she takes.  This is not approved by her doctor nor does she discuss it with him.  He is a wonderful person, but most doctors prescribe only from pure medical choices.  We get the Blaylock Wellnes Report monthly which has great cancer information based on a variety of studies.  I would aslo suggest reading Love, Miricales and Medcine by Dr. Bernie Segal.  This book was published in 1988, but is the best book I have read for both you and your loved ones.  Diet and excersice are the two most important things you can do to live longer with or without cancer.  My daughter actually looked and felt the best when she stopped the chem and was taking nothing for two months, one of which we went to Eruope two weeks of which I stayed with her and two in which she visited friends there. She teaches school so had the summer off.   Sometimes I think medications make you feel bad and have adverse effects on the way you feel that you may be better off just doing the wholistc approach.  However, she is afraid to do that and so does both.  I pray that some break throughs will come in cancer because you do  become a slave to doctors and medicine.  It keeps you broke and not feeling top notch.  I am not sure that doctors and their medicine are the answers, but fear keeps us all tied into that approach except for a very few. ",

      "Content": "This is my second email.  In looking for new treatments because my daughter has had an increase in her numbers in the testing she has monthly, I found a new reference.   This book has been around a long time and I am just reading the first addition, but he has an addition that was just recently released.  The book is by Bill Henderson who lost his wife to cancer in the 90s.  He has since devoted his time to studying cancer treaments and compling this information in an easy to read book.  It is called Cancer-Free Your Guide to Gentle, Non-Toxic Healing.  In it he outlines alternative treatments and gives you web sites and specfic information on purchasing supplements, etc.   All the treatments are out there, he just puts it all together and will speak to you.  He charges for the book and a one time consultation fee.  I have not spoken to him as I just started reading the older book.  He is so uplifting and postive that I thought about you and your situation with your wife.  I urge you to look into this as quickly as possible.  He is so postive about beating cancer if you are willing to take control of your case and believe that you can do it and are willing to make some real changes in your life(mind and body) Please check it out on the internet.   I am pulling for you both.  BB",

I feel your pain, but life hands us tough times.  The only thing I know to do is jump in and fight as hard as you can and pray for strength to handle it on a daily basis.  Read and get as much information from as many sources as you can.  This is a great resource because you are communicating with people who are living it. I am pulling for you two.  Bobbie B.",

I am due for new scans soon to see if it is working. Ask your doctor about Avastin treatment it is supposed to be a very good new drug. My daughter has stage 1V breast cancer after chemo, lumpectomy with 21 negative lymph nodes dissection and a 2-cm tumor removed.  ep-postive Her 2 receptor negative. She had radiation after.  She was cancer free for 3 years and then it was discovered as she was having tumor marker test every three months.  Since then, she has had the iv vitamin infusions, 3, in New Jersery and then we found a place here.  She has been taking it once a week.  In October, 2006, she entered into a trail with Abraxine and Avastin.  It was not know whether she was getting the avastin, but from her symptoms, we thought not.  She would have scans every six weeks.  Because of neuropoty in the feet, she recently elected to stop the abraxine and went out of the study.  Prior to that decision, she took 30 days off and went to Europe in which she had a great time.  I forgot to mention that she took tamoxifen for the three years up until the time she was diagnosed again.  It had awful side efects with extreme weight gain, depression, and nausea. I beleieve it did her system more harm than good.  This time she has changed her diet, but is still somewhat over weight.  She takes numerous vitamins.  She will be having scans again and they are trying to get her to take another drug that will supress harmones, but I am afraid that it will put her into the situation she had with tamoxefin.  The last scans she had, the nodes in her lungs, 4 of which had disappeared with the largest, almost gone.  I am so encouraged to hear how long you have lived because I believe that she can do it, but not with chemo and just conventional medicine.  No one seems to care what you eat, what your akline level is, nor anything even though they know that they only speak of months to live and not years with the treatment available. I am more the one that looks for everything and she is more the one to do as the doctor request.  Sometimes I make her mad and I admit to stepping over the line since it is her life.  On the first time around, I was not actively involved as she is independent, but this time, I feel it is our last chance and that you have to fight, study, believe, and be actiive in the choices that are available.    ",
