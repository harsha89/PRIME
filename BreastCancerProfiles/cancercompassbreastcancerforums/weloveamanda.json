      "Content": "I am too having a hypothroid problem, and ovalrian faiure where we can only find one undersized olvary and the other we can't and to top it off it doesn't even work. I have to take birthcontrol to have puberty after chemo therapy and to have my period and absorb calcium ect. I never had all my hair fall out so I did not shave my head, we wonder if that was the cause of it not going back fully... It is thin and not all of my head where my hair use to grow, grew back. I am told to take certian vaitamins that improve hair, nail and skin growth because I can't even have strong nails and my skin is sensative. sadlly hair every where else is growing fine but my head and part of my eye brows. I am finding out hair transplants are scams and that naioxine does not work unless you use it every day for the rest of your life and if you stop it goes back to how it was or worse... also I can't use cheap every day shampoos ect. I can't even use sented lotions, all of them have to be nonsented and the exspentive brands too. It is completely upsetting. I am trying to research how to make my hair grown to a better quality I am to start also taking vaitamins daily to improve on my lack of nutriance due to chemo. I am 8 years cancer free, but still my hair lacks and is high maitnance, hats have caused more thinning and I can not wear a wig all time due to brakeage of hair. I hope to keep in contact with others to figuring out a solution to this permanent problem.",

Seems chemo can really leave a mess behind. I hope to find an answer soon, other than putting natrual hair oils or massaging the scalp or not wearing hats or wigs 24'7 due to it damaging the hair, or not over exposure to the sun. These things are important but I'm not seeing it being fixed yet.",
