    "Content": "My wife was cancer free for 9 years and found a stage 1 lump with no node involvement in Sept.  She has been receiving Carboplatin, Taxotere and Herceptin every three weeks and then just herceptin every week unitl 6 cycles have past.  She just finished her fourth out of 6 cycles and her tumor markers were also elevated.  She is having a PET scan Thursday and a Muga Scan on Friday.  I will let you know what we findout.  Her previous PET showed no other cancer anywhere in her body.  I am freaked out waiting to know the results and if she is going to be ok.",
