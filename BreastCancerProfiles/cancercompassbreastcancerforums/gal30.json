    "Content": "Hello my sister has Hodgkin lymphoma and she finished the chemotherapy sessions. She's 25 years old and she just got the results of her pet scan.. this is the 1st time that she had the pet scan and we don't understand some of the terms and the meaning of the results,  I was wondering if someone can help me. Thank you so much. Abdomen, pelvis : GI genitourinary FDG activity psychological.  Retroperitoneum: small nodal hypermetabolism left obturator region is SUVmax 3.0 and right and left inguinal nodes is SUVmax 2.5. Urinary bladder, rectum and pararectal space: There is a focal area of hypermetabolism in the right adnexal area measuring 18mm in diameter is SUVmax 8.1 of unknown clinical significance.  Impression : minimal nodal hypermetabolism left obturator, right and left inguinal region is SUVmax 3.0 - focal right adnexal hypermetabolism 1.8cm in diameter SUVmax 8.5 to correlated with clinical and MRI findings.  I really don't understand what all this means. She's having the treatment in México and the pet scan was applied in USA. I just want to know if she's going to be ok.. all the others organs and body parts the result was unremarkable. Thank you. ",
