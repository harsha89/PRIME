    "Content": "Hello all, I am a nurse. Cancer is not my expertise. Over the last 5 months, my left breast has shrunk by about a cup size. I have pain with pressure such as hugging someone or lying face down that feels like shards of glass just behind the areola.  My mammogram was normal this year. Last year, the radiologist wanted an ultrasound due to some suspicious findings (right where my pain is located now!) My gynecologist is very concerned and has referred me to a surgical oncologist. My appointment is this Thursday and I'm so nervous!  I've also had burning pain in my neck/shoulder blade area. Not sleeping well. Did anyone have any symptoms even remotely like this?  Or am I losing my mind?Thanks for reading :) D",
