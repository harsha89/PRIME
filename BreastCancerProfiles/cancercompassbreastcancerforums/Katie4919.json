    "Content": "Hiya, your obviously really worried and i would be the same! Im sorry I have no words of wisdom because you can just never know! I had a big lump in my neck and a bitch of a nurse patronized me saying it was a swollen gland! Being a nurse i knew it was cancer, even after 2 biopsies came back normal! But i didn't know there is hundreds of type's of cancer, and if i hsd let them they wanted to leave it in me and watch it grow!!  Ive done extensive research on thyroid cancer, looking for something to blame   and ive noticed that all endocrine cancers are related, even though my consultant wont agree! Ill be back nexg week, hopefully after a dcan and fingers crossed they'll prove me wrong, because if not, im suing the whole NHS??",
