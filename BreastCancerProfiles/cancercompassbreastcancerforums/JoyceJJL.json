Had 3 lumpectomies to try to get clear margins, but they couldnt  then got a bad infection, so I immediately talked to my PCP and said I want to go to another Hospital closer with a surgeon I had heard was excellent.  She immediately, after I sogned off from the Dr in Boston, took  me on and had a double mastectomy, which strong rounds of chemo & radiation. Neulasta shots.  I am still on a 5 yr hormone pill.  I tried arimidex, but had side effects am s taking Femara now, but I think depending on the strength they basically all ruin your bones .  My oncologist & Pcp said thats the bad side of those pills, so basically I put up with it. But I['m 65 now,  had my first round of cancer 22 yrs ago, and came back in other breast 22 years later.  So I take it day by day and my goal of the day is \"If I can make just one person smile I;ve met my goal\"   Its horrid disease, But we've all got it or had it, and might as well try to make the best of a lousy situation.  I have always felt that I can help others by the things I went thru, as far as cancer goes.  As it truly helps me knowing I can make it easier for someone else.  Well if there is easy. lol  I have a \"super\" oncologists.  Actually the same one my Mom had, we went thru radiation together.   And we were closer then than ever before.  Unfortunately she died  shortly after that.  But we talked about so many things, and when I lost my hair she actually shaved her head also..  She did try that really expensive pill, but had side effects to it, so she stopped, as she knew she only had 6 months and didnt want them to be worse.  But she really only got 2 months.  Wow  I really have rambled on here, but anyways if theres anything I can say or do to help someone else just ask.  I do have to take some pills for the joint & bone pain from the hormone pill, but thats normal I have been told.  Altho my Aunt took Tamoxofen 8 yrs ago and only had hot flashes, so maybe it depends on the mgs or the type of cancer or age or whatever  lol.  One never knows all the details with the \"C\"  other than it can really get you down or try and have alot of upbeat friends and relatives  help you.  Did you get nauseaous (sp) with your treatments?  Theres alot of different pills they tried and they seemed to be so helpful with me.  But anyways before I go into my lifes story lol, I will close hoping someone got something out of this.  And you're right when you say 'been there'   take care & Bless you  Joyce",

I always swore I would never have my breasts removed or do chemo,.  But if I didnt I wouldnt be here typing.  I know on your name you fully believe in Hollistic, and I am sure people could probably purchase it from you.  Which is all well and good IF they want to go that route and many do,. However I am one that did what I said I never would, and would do it again.  I guess its the old \"cliche\" to each their own.  I am just saying I did try the chem and they do tell you what its doing to you and its up to me or anyone else who chooses that route whether or not to do the chemo through your system,  I am only saying my perspective as well as you did yours.  I respect yours, so Please respect those of us who choose the opposite.  Thanks Joyce",
