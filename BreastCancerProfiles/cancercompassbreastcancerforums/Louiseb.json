    "Content": "I would certainly obtain all the information you can about the different ways for reconstruction. It will seem overwhelming but then you will be really informed when the time comes for reconstruction. It is also positive that you are looking ahead to when most of this BC journey is fniished. I had a tram flap about a year after my simple mast. I just felt that I wanted my own body involved in this reconstruction and even though I didn't think I was so into having a breast, I felt that I needed it to look good in my clothes or to even wear a bra! The tram flap was extensive surgery and I was in the hospital for 4 days and needed every bit of my 6 weeks recovery. I have a large scar, tummy tuck, across my abdomen which goes from hipbone to hipbone. That was the most difficult to recover from. I didn't get my nipple reconstruction but I doubt if I will do that. I am very pleased with this and it has been almost 3 years. However, at this point, i would concentrate on what treatments I needed, etc. and get that all out of the way before you starrt any reconstruction.",
