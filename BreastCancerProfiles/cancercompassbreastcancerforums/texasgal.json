      "Content": "Called doctor's office today as the pain I am experiencing, along with itching, in my left breast is getting progressively worse. Realized that the nurse practioneer I am seeing is only there every two weeks, so she wasn't there for me to talk to. The doctor's nurse called me back and said that the doctor whom I have never yet seen, (my initial appointment was in May...) wanted me to see a surgeon as she couldn't do anything for me. Earliest the surgeon could get me in is October. I feel as though I am riding in a covered wagon....everything is way too slow. I'm still concerned because I don't think anyone knows what's going on.

      "Content": "Good morning.... I am a 49 year old who has developed an enlarged breast, pain, itching and something similar to a 'spider bite' on my left breast. While I had the 'bite sight' biopsied and it was negative, the other symptoms have gotten progressively worse. Yesterday I had a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. The staff told me that while I did have cysts nothing indicated that there was breast cancer. Of course, this is good news; however, I don't feel comfortable. When I looked up the symptoms of what I was experiencing, of course, it went to IBC. I've read that you have to stay on top of this and I'm one who can....but what do you tell a doctor? Is it like 'do you know about IBC' or 'just sit there and wait' until they are on to it...I'm sure you don't. I just don't think that we are all on the same page here. Perhaps I need to find someone who specializes in IBC. I've read where it can take lots of time to diagnose, I'm interested in any and all replies.",
