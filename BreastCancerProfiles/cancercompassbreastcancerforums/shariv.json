    "Content": "I am hoping one of you may be able to help me. I had radiation for a brain tumor and finished the radiation in October 2009. I lost a lot of hair. My hair started growing back in January 2010. All the hair has been grown in for months. The hair in the spot where most of the radiation was (at the tumor site) was not as long as the other hair because it started growing after the other hair, but it was there. Last week, I noticed the hair in that spot had fallen out! Yesterday, I noticed more hair had fallen out so now I have a pretty big bald spot. Luckily I can cover it with my other hair, but it is bad enough that my 11 year old daughter asked me not to show her anymore because it was \"freaking her out\"! I've never heard of this happening before. Has anyone else had hair fall out over a year after having radiation and after the hair has grown back? Thanks!",
