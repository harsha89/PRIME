      "Content": "I was originally diagnosed in Mach 2007 with invasice ductal carcinoma, stage II.  I had a lumpectomy, sentinel node and 2 others removed that were negativeand clean margins, and then chemo.  Before I could start the radiation, I had another mammo that showed lymph node involvement.  I then had an axillary dissection(4out of 25 tested positive and 1 was ruptured, radiation for 7 weeks and then more chemo.  It was discovered at this point that I was so minimally positive on the er/pr receptors that I was now negative.  I am also Her2 negative.  After chemo I then was clean for 6 months.  I then found another lump under my arm which was biopsied.  I then had a mastectomy and axillary wedge resection.  I then went through yet another round of chemo.  I just finished this on July 12th, 2010.  October 1, 2010 I found another lump in my arm pit, had it biopsied, and it was in deed cancer again.  I had it removed and my oncologist has painted a very grim picture.  The area thet removed was a subcutaneous nodule and my oncologist states that when you start to see these it is only a matter of time before a mets will show up somewhere.  My oncologist consulted each time with a universitybreast cancer specialist each time and my cases have been presented in their case conferences and all agree that I was treated aggressively and with the best comb of chemo drugs.  Now my oncologist wants me to go to MD Anderson for consultation.  He has now moved me from stage II to stage IV.  Help!!  Has anyone gone through anything like this?  I need some guidance!",

      "Content": "Julia, I don't think anyone has come up with that answer.  If had, we would be closer to a cure. A cancerous tumor develops from normal cells in everyone's body.  For whatever reason something changes and those cells start growing as cancer cells.  This could and does happen to anyone of us.  I hope this helps.  Very good question!",
