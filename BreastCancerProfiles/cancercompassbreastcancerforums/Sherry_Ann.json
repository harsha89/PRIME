    "Content": "I am in a serious long term relationship of 20 years. I am 46 and now have breast cancer, and although my boyfriend is wonderfully emotionally supportive, and caring, kind, and thoughtful, he has COMPLETELY stopped initiating ANY kind of sexual activity. He will still hug, kiss, constantly hold my hand , , and kiss me, but the sex is gone. When I discuss the reason, he insists he still has desire for me, but still he will not make love to me. When I make the first move, he will always find an excuse,such as he's tired. We have always had a VERY intense, passionate love-life, and now I feel devastated. He insists I will \" always be attractive\" to him, but I feel he is not telling the truth. I end up feeling rejected, andterrible. Hugs are NOT enough... To make matters worse I know he regularly views porn on the computer. (Which never bothered me before,as we had an open-minded relationship, and viewed it together often. But now that he has stopped making love to me, I am seriously upset and disturbed by this fact ! )If he is acting this way now, how on earth will he react towards me AFTER the mastectomy ?!! I am seriously considering going against my doctor's advice, and NOT having the surgey. He NEVER touches my body in any sort of sexually intimate way anymore. I am confused, hurt, and feeling completely unfeminine and embarrassed, to have to practically BEG for sex, and STILL getting rebuffed. He is otherwise phenomenally supportive. We talk constantly, and do many things together. So is his behavior normal in this kind of situation , or am I doomed to no love life anymore ?????? I cannot possibly imagine him want to make love later if he he refuses NOW... A reply would be greatly appreciated !! Thanks, Sherry Ann",
