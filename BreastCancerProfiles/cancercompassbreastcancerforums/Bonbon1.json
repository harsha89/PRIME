    "Content": "Yes- I also was on Tamoxifen for 3 years. Then I started Arimidex. After 3 months I ached all over. My feet, legs, arms. My doctor denied that was a side affect. Then I started Femara and in a few weeks the same thing. Besides joint pain I am now experiencing very very sore hands. The orthopedic doctor said I had 3 trigger fingers in one hand which was to much to treat with injections and that surgery was my only answer. I can't live this way with the pain. I can barely function at my job and I need to work. Last night at this site I found 15 other ladies with the same problem. I was so happy to read I was not the only one and that my intution was right. It was the meds. Now my oncologist wants me to start aromasin. When I see her Tuesday I am telling her no way. I really hope this all reverses itself by massage, hot parafin treatment and anything else I find as an alternative. I did not experience any bleeding or cramping but I do get mouth lesions which a specialist doesn't know why---go figure. I believe it is yet another side effect of the drug. I am going to wing it and hope I stay cancer free without the help of drug. May you find relief also.",
