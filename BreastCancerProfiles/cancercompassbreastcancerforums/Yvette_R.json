    "Content": "Hello Wendy, I, too, have had a second cancer; breast cancer. My son and his wife are confident that healing is in prayer and healthier eating. My son's mother-in-law was had cancer seven years ago, and the doctors told her that she had three months to live. She is living today. She changed her eating habits and now is a herbalist. She has helped other women laced with cancer and through healthier eating, they too are still here today. I, also, believe in prayer and God. Just to say to you, your message was encouraging to me. Thank you.",
