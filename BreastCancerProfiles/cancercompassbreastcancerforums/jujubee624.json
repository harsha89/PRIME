    "Content": "I had a masectomy in March 08 & have been followed by the same doc since my diagnosis in January 08. I'm really frustrated by the fact that I have regular (every 3 to 6 months) CT scans & MRIs because they're watching a couple \"ditzels\" (spots too small to biopsy) to make sure there is no change. The problem is that the tests make me nervous & add to that fact it takes an entire week to get the results because my doc doesn't review them until the day I see her -- 1 week after the tests -- even though the radiologist has read them w/in 24 to 48 hours. Am I just being a baby about this or is it normal to have to wait this long for test results?",
