    "Content": "Hi, mom mother has a chemo port in place, she's being treated for breast cancer. She had complications with the first port (very painful and protruded), so it had to be removed. The fluid around the port appeared \"cloudy\" according to her surgeon, so he tested it for infection and fortunately the test were negative. She had her second one inserted a week ago and her second chemo treatment on Fri. This port seems to be fine, she is experiencing side effects of stomach cramps and nausea from the chemo. Hope this helps and my advice would be to be proactive if you think something is not right with your port. No one knows your body as well as you do. Jan",
