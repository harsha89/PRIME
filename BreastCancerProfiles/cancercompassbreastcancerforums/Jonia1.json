    "Content": "I had radiation for rt breast cancer. The radiation was more involved, treating not only the chest wall, but straight through to supra clavicular lymph nodes. Not certain if this is the exact term for that 2nd area radiated! In April, 2012 I received the radiation treatment at Abbott Hospital in Mpls, Mn . They were one of two radiation clinics in Mn who offered radiation with respiratory gating which protects the heart from radiation exposure. I would think that there are now more clinics throughout the US offering this, and advances in perfecting it in the 5 years since I had treatment. Check with your oncologist to see if this would be appropriate for you. I have heard that it is wise to be treated at a major medical facility because they are able to offer the most advanced treatment options. In 2009, I had radiation for left breast cancer in my small home town hospital. The radiation oncologist at Abbott was excellent and was definitely more current in the practice of radiation oncology. We stayed at Hope Lodge, an American Cancer Society facility for the 6 wks while I had that treatment. Our stay was free of charge and there were about 6 kitchens with separate food storage areas for people residing there. Criteria for being able to stay there was not financial. You had to be receiving cancer treatment and live a certain distance from your cancer treatment center. Staying at Hope Lodge during treatment was a healing experience for my husband and me. Getting to know so many other cancer patients and their care givers normalized our situation. So different from feeling so alone with my cancer when treated previously in my home town. I hope you can find the very best treatment and have all the love and support of family and friends.",
