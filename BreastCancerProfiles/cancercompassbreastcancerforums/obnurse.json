My gyn dr. said it's nothing that the other dr. who read the report is just being cautious. I did have thyroid cancer and had surgery this past January. A little nervous. Thank you for any help and advice.   I was informed today that I also have complex cyst, and a biopsy was also recomended, I meet with a surgen next week and I assume I will get set up for a biopsy at that time.  I'm alittle nervous too, but from what I read on line, a  maligant complex cyst is rare, so I would rather be safe than sorry, so good luck to you and try not to worry",

The surgeon was happy it was HR+ and only had 3 nodes, as the sbr score was 9. He didn't even mention the her2 status or what it meant. I went home and researched and found out the her2+ means the cancer will probably be resistant to hormone therapy and recurrence higher and survival rates are alot lower. I'm really feeling scared. Every bit of info I get about this cancer is worse than the last. CT scan and bone scans clear. So far.But for how long? Pauline Hi, last fall I was diagonised with stage 3 breast cancer, I also was hormone positive and Her2 positive,  it was in early mestatsis to the lymph nodes, also.  Her2 postitive is very agressive, my tumors were 2-3 cm and I had 2 in the one side,  after many tests,  treatment was started I had adramycin and cytotoxin every 2 weeks, (which is called dose densing,) for 4 cycles, then taxal every 2 weeks for 4 cycles. half way thru the taxal I was also started on herceptin, and when the taxal was finished I went on arimedix. herceptin and arimidex are called hormone therapy  and very effective for her2 . I could be taking arimidex 5 years or more. this inhibits the production of estrogen, which is feeding your tumors, that's why they call it hormone positive.  Following the chemo I had a repeat cat scan and the lymph nodes in question no longer showed up.    I would gather all the information from the ACS, and your doctors office, because there's so much information out there and not all accurate,  You will see many doctors, including an onnocologist, radiation onnocologist and surgeon, and maybe a family doctor to take care of things that they don't do.  I was never sick from the chemo, because they have such great drugs to stop that, but I did loose my hair, and all of it to be sure, and it effected nails, I had  some numbness in my fingers and feet, that should go away within a year, if it doesn't it can mean permanent nerve damage,  if you have a breast center or maybe the place where you got your mamogram, they should have information on breast cancers. I will have a mastectomy tomorrow, only one side will be done the chances of me getting on the other side is 5% or less then after a month or so radiation will start, my chances for survival is 50 to 60& with treatment.  Your doctor will start setting you up with these other doctors,  and don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion, you will be told so much information its hard to take it all in, have someone go with you because they can remember what you don't. and ask your doc.questions and make sure you understand what they are saying. Turn you fear into power, by educating your self, and beleive me it will be more information than you ever bargined for.  Cancer is what it is, you don't have to have it in your family, a genes or anything it just happens, and we learn how to deal with it, but don't ever give up, regardless of any news that isn't good, because things change all the time. you need to know at what stage you're at that so you can get a better grip on things.  and your onnocologist will tell you that. so good luck to you and I will pray for you,",
