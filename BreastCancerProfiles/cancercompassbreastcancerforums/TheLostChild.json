    "Content": "im 15 and my mum wont be here by christmas   About a week ago i was visiting my mothers house and her friend nat was over too. At this point i knew she had cancer but i had been decieved into thinking that she was recovering. The next morning i woke up and went to use natalies phone to check my ebay stuff and when i unlocked it i saw the single most horrifying message possible on her inbox screen \"yeah going 2 Shas place l8r on at this point shes been given 6 months 2 liv and were trying 2 spend as much time as possible with her\" I was shattered. I ran into the office and couldnt stop crying. At this point i said to myself \"well thats what you get for being nosey\". My 17 year old sister doesnt know my dad knows and i told him i know my mum doesnt know i know and its all one big mess. I dont know what to do i feel helpless to do anything. My mother lives on her own and i fell so unbelievably guilty leaving her alone but at the same time i couldnt bear to watch her die. My friends dont seem to care so im sorta on my own i dont know what to do the world is know just a cruel sickening place. How could this happen. ",
