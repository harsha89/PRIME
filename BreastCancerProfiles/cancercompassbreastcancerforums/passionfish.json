Cheers, Passionfish :)",

      "Content": "Hi there,  After breast reduction surgery a number of years ago, I was given a DX of DCIS & LCIS and told that I should have bilateral masectomy asap. I went for a second opinion at Dana Farber in Boston . We met with a team and the pathologist disagreed with the initial dx...I chose a wait and see position with very close follow up. I had a  mamogram every 3 months for a year, twice a year for 2 years and then back to once a year. I lost my health insurance 5 years ago and have not had a mamogram since then.  Tonight I found a number of small lumps in my left armpit and needless to say, I am freaking out..Tomorrow I am going to a free clinic where hopefully they can get me an appt for a mam..   Thanks for any input you may have..I usually post on the brain cancer site but thought I would bite the bullet and see what you might think :) Peace, Adonna  ",

      "Content": "I`m wondering if anyone out there has been dx with DCIS and made the decision not to have bilateral masectomy? I had breast reduction  and upon return for stitch removal was informed that I had DCIS in right breast and DCIS & LCIS in my left breast..They scooted me down to the surgeon who recommended immediate bilateral masectomy. I chose to go into Dana Farber for a second opinion..The team there disagreed with the pathologist dx and suggested that I do a \"watch and wait\" ...they did inform me that most women choose the surgery over the watching...needless to say that was a number of years ago and all is still well...I am wondering if anyone has chosen the same path and if so, how they are doing??  I have to admit that I`m a bit haunted over the decision and occasionally wonder what could be \"cookin\" inside my breasts.. Sorry for the lengthy post....Adonna",
