I've been on Arimidex since 2/05 and will stop on 2/10. I've always taken a big fish oil capsule with my daily vitamins--and have never had a problem with an Arimidex interaction. I used to have outrageous hot flashes, and my oncologist gave me different prescriptions, now, finally they have dwindled down to a few a week. Good luck! Elizabeth, AKA RVwoman   I am curious about the meds you take for hot flashes.  I too am a 5 year survivor and will be taking my last dose of Arimidex 1/31/2010!  My hot flashes are almost unbearable and seem to be getting worse the longer I am on the Arimidex.  The same is true for the bone and joint issues.  I was given Effexor for the flashes.  I would appreciate you input. I also take fish oil with my Arimidex, there have been no issues.   Elizabeth,the hot flashes you're having,I think if you would take the arimidex in the early morning you wouldn't notice them during the day.Thats what I do,and I never notice having any at all. I've been on them  almost 2 years and the first 4 or 5 months my joints were so sore and hurt and for some reason,i hardlyhave any joint pain  .i don't take meds for the pain .I take vitamin E and multi vit,plus 1200 unita of fish oil tabs,so I'm doing fine.. good luck to ya   Mogal",

Hope we're not all going to have them forever!! good luck with yours. Mogal",
