    "Content": "I recently found a small lump in my breast/armpit and being so young I went straight to my local doctor. I had biopsy done and scans. My doctor told me that it was cancerous. When I told my mum she asked me to get a second opinion on the lump. I have traveled to a different town to see an experienced breast doctor and had the same test done only to find out that my local doctor had misdiagnosed me and mistaken a breast cyst for cancer. How could this happen. How can a doctor misdiagnose a cyst for cancer.Â ",
