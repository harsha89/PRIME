      "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 23 months with many of the same side effects mentioned on this board. Mostly joint pain and thinning hair.  Recently there has been changes in my liver enzymes and extremely high ferritin levels (1388).  I have been tested for Hemochromotosis and found to be negative.  My oncologist is taking me off the arimidex for 4-6 weeks to see if these levels change.  If they do he plans on changing my medication to Aromasin..if not then a liver biopsy will be done! I was diagnosed with bi-lateral BC in October 2007, estrogen, progestorin, and her2nu positive.  Left breast was stage I right was stage IIB with 3 lymph nodes involved.  Breas spareing lumpectomies were done. Four rounds of A/C, 12 rounds Taxotere, 52 rounds of Herceptin and 40 rounds of radiation.  If that wasn't enough I turned out to be BRCA2+!! Has anyone else experienced this side effet from the Arimidex????",

      "Content": "I am 3 years out from Chemo.....had the same problems with unmanageable hair.  My first regrowth was curly on one side straight on the other sticking up every which way.  Before CA I had thick course hair now fine limp hair.  No amount of product seemed to help.  So I just kept cutting it short, eventually the curly side became straight.  I know this is not much of a suggestion...but short of wearing hairpieces...this is one of the side effects of survival we have to deal with.  I for one am so happy to be a survivor that I no longer worry about my hair.....in the words a dear friend that is losing his battle as we speak \"it is what it is\"",
