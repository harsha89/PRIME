Thanks,   Barbara     ",

      "Content": "Hello, I was wondering if anyone can help me -- I am a 48 year-old female who gets mammograms every year since I was 35.  When I had one in May, they called me back and said they needed me to come in again because they needed better pictures and an ultrasound on both breasts.  So, I went and they told me there was a spot on the right breast that wasn't on last years mammo and that I would need a biopsy.  (They told me the same thing six years ago and I went to a breast surgeon for a second opinion and she said it was just nodules, that I didn't need a biopsy)  So I went to the same breast surgeon and she said it looks like just a cyst, but I have to have an aspiration done just to rule it out.  Can anyone give me any advice about any of this -- I need to call for an appointment for an aspiration; What is an aspiration like, as I am very anxious about the procedure?  Thanks,   Anxiously waiting",
