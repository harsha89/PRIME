      "Content": "I took Arimidex for 8 months and developed some irritating hip pain and sciatica that hasn't gone away. But the worst side effect that I can only attribute to Arimidex is all over itching with no rash etc. I quit Arimidex with my doctors permission and none of the pain or itching have gone away yet. I have been to a dermatologist, allergist, oncologist, gynecologist, rheumatologist and my primary care doctor. None could find an answer or help for the itching other than taking up to 8 antihistamines a day!! So I decided I'd see a neurologist. She put me on Neurontin and it kicked the itching immediately. So I did some research and found that Progesterone is lowered as well as estrogens, by Arimidex. When progesterone is too low, GABA is lowered too. GABA is a neurotransmitter. It is a calming neurotransmitter. In lowered levels it can trigger systemic itching. Now for the interesting part. Neurontin's generic name is Gabapentin. It increases GABA in the transmitter world of the body. It also helps with nerve pain. My sciatica is a little improved and the itching is gone as long as I take the Neurontin.. I will not take anymore of the cancer drugs. My oncologist said I probably would do worse on tamoxifen so I passed on it and another one. I am working on my diet and exercise to hopefully deter the cancer from returning. Has anyone else experienced this horrific itching? I pray it can be reversed eventually so I can stop the Neurontin too. I hate medicines. I have Lupus and have had it for 20 some odd years. I had about 10 years of horrible illness and meds with that and am happy to say it is under control now for the past 7 years. So now you can see why I hate meds! Well, I have rambled enough. Let me know if anyone has experienced itching. Thanks!",

      "Content": "You are so fortunate that the itching was mild. I had itching that was everywhere and extremely intense. Before I saw the neurologist I was taking 6 to 8 antihistamines a day and a few more at night. I literally was going crazy itching. My oncologist acted like I was making it all up. Anyway, I am doing well on the Neurontin, but hope my system can get back to normal enough to stop taking it eventually.",

      "Content": "I took Arimidex for 8 months for stage 1 hormone Positive breast cancer. I am not on any other breast cancer drug due to the side effects. My side effects are hip pain and sciatica and systemic itching. The itching was so horrible I begged to be taken off of it. No rash and several doctors later I got my oncologists ok to go off it. I am working on my diet and exercise. Hopefully this will give me some defense from the cancer coming back. I am taking Neurontin for the itching. Arimidex disrupted my system so badly that I am left with horrific itching! I had lots of hot flashes at first and then total loss of libido. Thankfully all that has reversed itself. All but the hip pain, sciatica and itching. I have been off Arimidex for 4 months now. It's terrible to feel so awful and they recommend 5 years! I just couldn't do it.",
