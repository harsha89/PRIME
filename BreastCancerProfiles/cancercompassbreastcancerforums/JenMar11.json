    "Content": "Hi, I've been reading the boards for a while now and figured I would post about a wig that my friend recently gave me. It actually only covers half my head, but it's made from real hair and if I wear it with a hat or scarf.... It honestly looks like my old hair... its AWESOME!!! A a woman in San Francisco makes them by hand. A friend of mine knows her and she forwarded her link to me at www.halohair.net I highly recommend it and if anyone has any questions feel free to send me a message.",
