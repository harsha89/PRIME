I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years now, having had a mastectomy in November 2003.

The main side effects which I am experiencing now are aching bones and joints, mainly while trying to sleep at night. Also tiredness and seem to want to just go to bed to rest from as early as 8 in the evening - this is sad as I always went to bed late before my breast cancer. I also contemplated coming off the drug but decided that as the cancer hasn't come back at all in almost 2 years then perhaps I am doing the right thing in taking it every day. I am new on here and happen to stumble upon this site as I was researching *side effects of Arimidex*. I was DX with stage 4 breast CA in 2003......a lump was found at the 6 o'clock position on right breast. I went the next day for a mammogram and yes, it definately was suspicious. so off to the breast surgeons, biopsys, and then the dreaded comfirmation words we think we would never have to hear: You have breast cancer! I had a lumpectomy, nodes removed  and the results of that was NO node involvement....Thank God! I then went on to an aggressive form of chemo due to it being stage 4......the 2 drugs that were used on me every other week, usually did not get used that close together. I finished chemo, then onto 36 rounds of radiation, which totally wiped me out.....but......then came the discussion with the oncologist: which drug was I going to take.....Tamoxifin or Arimidex....hhhmm, my hormone receptors were estrogen ---- and progestrone + well, not wanting to due 5 years of either a *blood clot issue* with the Tamoxifin.....or 5 years of a bone eating drug.....hard decision... I opted for the Arimidex only because I *figured* I could counter act bone loss, but the silent blood clot issue scared me too much. I had lost my mom due to a sudden heart attack and she was only 54 yrs young, so that drug was no in the cards for me. I did my 5 years of Arimidex and finished it in 2010. I was only off the drug 1 month, and my front tooth fell out of my mouth into my hand, and that continued until I went to my oral surgeon, and it was decided that I was going to lose all my top teeth....*talk about tears* I had them all pulled this past July and a whole plate put in right away, and this has been another rollercoaster ride that I don't want to be on. I thought my bottom teeth were okay, and today...a bottom front tooth broke off in the back and I have a hole in my tooth:( I go to the dentist tomorrow morning, and pray my bottom teeth can be saved. I have gone thru every symptom you all are..or have...experienced. bone pain, always exhausted but can't sleep, hip joints pop out of their sockets and then I can't walk until they pop back in.....my last bone density was about 4-5 yrs ago and I was DX with osteopenia. I have bursars on my knees and elbows, a bunion on my big toe, sharp burning pain in my feet...and...it never seems to stop! I would of never in a million years ever thought my  teeth would go because of the Arimidex, but yes, that is the case. I still have my meltdowns and cry...except now I am saying: why did I bother to fight....when I got the diagnosis: hearing the words: you have breast cancer and saying: why me?? Everyday, there is an issue to remind me that I have so much damage to other body parts due to the Arimidex.....   I am so sorry you are going through the dental problems.  I understand there is bone loss but the doctors are supposed to keep you on calcium so this does not happen.  I get a yearly shot because my stomach does not handle the calcium pills too well.   They are also supposed to be doing bone density tests evey year.  I go to MDAnderson in Houston, TX.  My oncologist told me from the beginning every breast cancer case is different and handled accordingly and to autodiagnosed myself. I am a 65 year old women, had dual mastectomy, and have learned to leave a day a time and enjoy my family.  My mother lived 20 after she was diagnosed with bc.  She did not have chemo nor radiation. The cancer came back in her stomach.  I prayed that you recovered from the side effects. The thruth is that knowing all I know today if I had to take Arimidex I will take. What are the choices.",

I am getting aches and pains which are getting worse and worse. GP has checked me for all the usual things - athritis, etc but all showing up clear. Now it's really bad - back is sore all the time, shooting pains in hands and shins and upper arms.  At night it is particularly bad. both my hands go numb at night with pins and needles and lack of sleep is driving me insane.  Oncologist is suggesting I go back on the Tamoxifen.  Anyone else having these symptoms?   I was on Arimidex for five years. Now I have been off the Arimidex for seven months. The first three months after the treatment was over I went on withdrawl side effects.  I think the tiredness never leaves. I like to stay busy so I know what you mean by been in bed by 8:00 PM. Just push yourself.  Do not let get to you. I learned to take a day at a time. Blessings.  All of these will be behind you before you know it.  Have a great day!",

      "Content": "I took Arimidex for five years.  I took the last pill on April 30, 2011.  I think that during this period of time I experinced all the sides effects listed by all you who have taken Arimidex including a metal taste in my mouth when I woke up in the morning.   The metal taste in my mouth is gone.  However, what concerns me now is that I have been having stomach problems since I stopped taking the Arimidex (coincidence?)  After nagging my GI she ordered complex blood work which included  HVY MTL PN (Heavy Metal Poison) and AMY LIPASE (This is to check the pancreas functions).  Can hardly wait for the HVY MTL PN's results to see if my experience with the metal taste in mounth every morning when I woke up have any relationship. On the other hand, the pressure that I feel in my stomach has affected mysciatic nevers which hasresulted in excruciating pains thatmake rolling on bed or getting up in the morning a living hell, because the musles on my lower back feel like some one was wringing them. Hope this information, helps someone outhere.  I am sure that if I had to do it again I will take the Arimidex.  What are the choices: cancer, side effects, or ???   He who said \"Cancer does not kill you, is the medicines that kill you\" was not lying. Stay hopeful and let faith carry you on.! This is men's induced disease not God\u2019s given punishment. Know that He is with us at all times and he will give us thestrengthto survive. Phil 4:13 Blessed you all.",
