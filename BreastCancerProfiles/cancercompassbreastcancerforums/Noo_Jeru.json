      "Content": "Eight days ago my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer.she had her first lot of chemotherapy yesterday.The plan is to reduce the size of the tumours, to allow the surgeon to have a better chance of removing all the cancer when he does a Mastectomy in 4/5 months. It would be an understatement to say our world has been rocked. My wonderful wife is terrified that the cancer has spread further.we are waiting on the results of a bone scan, she is having a CT scan this evening. The nurses and the Doctors are very helpful regarding explanations of procedures, they are also encouraging us to take advantage of some of the alternative therapy's at a  local centre, they do Hypnosis, Rieki,Reflexology etc... As Christians we are aware that not alternative medicines are good, especially those that invade mind and spirit, you don't realise how vulnerable you are until your put to the test ?  Could you please pray for my wife`s safe passage on this journey and also that God blesses us with the gift of discernment, and guides and protects us from the enemy`s crafty and deceitful ways. I thank God for this site and may he bless all the people who are involved in it and all who view it. N Jeru  ",
