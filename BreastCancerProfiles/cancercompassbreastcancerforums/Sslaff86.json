      "Content": "Hi Kim, I am very similar to you in profile: 44 yrs old, bone mets, on zomeda, lupron, and recently, arimidex (instead of femara). I was diagnosed last year, was put on Tamoxifen originally but my tumor markers have been rising so he switched to arimidex. How have your tumor markers been and have you ever been on arimidex? best - stacy PS - also am a caretaker of a severe handicap daughter (15 yr old)",

      "Content": "wow we sound alot alike. I have never been on arimidex. As far as my tumour markers. I have always been told my blood work is fine. But of course I was told that two months before I found out it had spread to my bone. This is my third time with cancer. But I have been very lucky in that each time it was caught early. The femera is working on me. I just hope it works for a very long time... --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
