Concerned daughter :/  Hello Hana24   My mom also has metastatic breast cancer in her bones. She has has 4 broken bones in the last 3 years with surgery, radiation and chemo to follow. I have found myself buying all types of food at the store. I let my mom decide but I try to tell her she has to eat something. Ginger is good if she is sick to her stomach. My mom eats lots of gello, pudding, apple sauce but definatly try to get your mom to eat something with protein. God Bless Eve",
