    "Content": "Dr. Kathleen Ruddy is the founder of the non-profit organization Breast Health & Healing. The goal of this foundation is to garner support and funding for research of the cause of breast cancer. Below I have included a link that directs one to Dr. Ruddy's personal blog, which includes the 'tweeted' version of this incredible woman's story: http://breastcancerbydrruddy.com/ Once you have taken the time to read through this telling account, please go to the website for Breast Health & Healing and learn more about the objectives of this foundation. http://www.breasthealthandhealing.com/ Learn more about this mission and help to spread the word about a fundamental, yet overlooked approach to the eradication of breast cancer. I do NOT want to lose another loved one to the horrors of breast cancer and I know you don't either.Â  In order to prevent the possibility of such a loss we must work to find the CAUSE of breast cancer.",
