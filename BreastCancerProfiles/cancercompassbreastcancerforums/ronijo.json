    "Content": "Hi! I had the same thing last September. The surgeon will use the same incision and take out a bit more tissue. This second surgery is much easier than the first. It's so important to get clear margins, most surgeons want at least 2 mm of tissue surrounding the tumor where there are no cancer cells. The surgeon is unable to determine this during the surgery; only the pathologist can confirm that the right amount of tissue is clear. My doctor said approximately 40% of women will need this second procedure. I did not stay overnight but went home the same afternoon. You will have greater peace of mind knowing for sure that those margins were clear! Good luck to you and keep the faith!Â  Rhonda",
