I go every week, take herpercin and toxal.  Lost hair, no biggie. Feel tired alot of times. It is hard for me to get out alot because when I start walking my liver area hurts. Went into hospital during newyears because I was freezing, my head, shoulders aand across the face. Could not get warmed up. I finally got out of the hospital after a few days they gave me alot of antibotics. My  chemo study lady was not to happy that they gave me antibiotics. Too bad, it worked. Very confused about the liver mets, what do I expect from this area. It swells up a little sometimes. Hurts more when I walk around. My doctor seems hopeful, doing a muga scan next week. Hope to see if it is shrinking the mets. At least I'm not throwing up any more. My doctor lets me take something for the pain in my liver which helps. I know the liver is a vital organ to our bodies, so what should I do to help myself?      ",
