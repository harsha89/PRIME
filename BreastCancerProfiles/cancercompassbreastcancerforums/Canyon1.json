My Dr. has recently decided to switch me to aromasin. But research tells me that the results will be the same and the cost will be $245 more a month. But last week, I received a 3 day suspension from work because of poor work performance. So the decision has been made for me. I was scheduled to begin medication in a couple of days. I have been off medication for 3 weeks now and I feel better than I have since all of this started. I can continue medication and suffer the horrible joint pain plus all of the other wonderful side effects and hope I can funtion well enough to keep my job, or I can stay off this 'neccessary' medication that is eating my cartiledge, bones and maybe damaging my liver, and hopefully keep my job. What do I do if I can't work and lose my insurance? Then I would have no medical help at all. After 3 weeks off, I still have pain in my fingers, mostly in my thumbs and still some pain in my calves. So I don't know if any damage done will be reversible, if my body can heal itself in time. Will keep you posted. Five years of this agony? I can't do it. Hi!  I just found this site and usually I just lurk a new board for awhile, but your post encouraged me to respond.  I have been on Arimidex nearly 4 years now, and I filed for FMLA shortly after I began taking it.  My doctor filled out the form noting \"breast cancer and breast cancer therapy\".  It was readily accepted by my employer and protects my job and health benefits.  I encourage you to see if you might be able to do the same.",
