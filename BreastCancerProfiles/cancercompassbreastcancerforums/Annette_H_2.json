    "Content": "Hi Holly, I am receiving chemo for ovarian cancer. I've been on chemo, steadily, for 2 years. Last August, I too became more anxious and depressed. I am usually a very up-beat and positive person, so these feelings were more distressing to me. I called my doctor (didn't wait for my next visit) and explained things. He immediately prescribed 25 mg of Zoloft on a daily basis. It took about 3 weeks to begin working. I feel great now. This improved feeling helped me cope with things, enabled me to better make decisions, helped me to get back to enjoying things, etc. I also feel that having the depression and anxiety removed has helped me to heal better and more quickly. I have learned to be patient active. Ask for what you need to feel better. I was surprised to know there were so many things to help. Prior to this, I just accepted chemo and all of the side effects it dealt me. I thought this is what I was supposed to do. Now, I don't hesitate to ask if there is something available to help me to through whatever situation comes up. Hang in there. Annette",
