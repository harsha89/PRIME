      "Content": "I am soooo against this \"screening\" method!  Every year my Dr. wants a mammogram and every year I refuse and  we settle on an ultrasound. This year, due to leukemia, I now have a swollen lymph node in my armpit...she wasnt sure that it was in the armpit and therefore not sure it was leukemia related and again asked me to get a mammogram with an ultrasound if they deemed it needed.  I scheduled it but was SO uncomfortable about it that, after reading PILES of stuff and going into the imaging place to talk to them, I cancelled the mammogram and just went with the ultrasound.  If you have been doing any research about mammograms,  you will know that there are a lot of false positives.  AND there is a lot of controversy as to whether women under 50 should even be having mammograms!  Do your reading and decide for yourself...it makes absolutely no sense to me that, especially when it is known that there is a lump, why would I allow my body to be treated this way.  Some countries(Switzerland (for sure)and Sweden (I think))are or have already cancelled their screening programs and have decided that regular self and Dr. exams are just as effective.  They have you scared now (probably for no reason) and you are going to be put thru the ringer now.  Oh but when they realize it was really nothing and stress the crap out of you for no reason they will justify it with... arent you glad that everything is just fine!  NO...they should never have sent you for this test in the first place!  So no stress should have ever been necessary! I wish you the best and it's too bad you are being subjected to something you likely should not have been.  Such a shame they have not replaced this ineffective tool(?) with something that actually works!   Samuelly",

      "Content": "I have to say that I have heard this information as well.  My sister's Doctor is in agreement about the damage a mammogram can do.  He has never had her go for a mammogram and quite frankly I have refused to go for them myself.  I flatly refused to go for a mammogram when my doctor asked me to go for a one.  I agreed to an ultra sound instead. ",
