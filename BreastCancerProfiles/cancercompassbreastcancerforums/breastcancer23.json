      "Content": "I am 23yrs old. I found a lump in my breast like 3months after I stop breast feeding my son. Went to my OB and had an ultrasound done. They told me there was nothing to worry about and it was not cancer. 6months later I had another ultrasound and same result. My lump had double almost tripled in size. Breast cancer stage 2 Long story short, I had a double mastectomyjuneof this yr and had to do chemo do to the size of my lump. Chemo is hard. 6 dose 3weeks apart. I am currently about to complete my last treatment. I would say it is your decision. I choose to do chemo because I needed to live for my son. Herbal medicine was offered to me by several people including my own brother. I am not saying it doesn\u2019t work. I will try some herbal meds after. My side effect effected me physically but emotionally it was harder. I lost my hair. I was sick and unable to work for days. But at the end of the day, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. by the way thecytoxanis like going through hell Vomiting, nausea, dehydration was my 3 biggest. Thetaxofelewas more random. One daysick,weakand mouth sores. Not being able to eat. And the next day ok.",
