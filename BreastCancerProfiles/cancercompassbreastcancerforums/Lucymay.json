    "Content": "I found this site by Googleing \"Exposed jawbone in mouth\" I don't have cancer, although I have been treated several times for skin cancer and go regularly to my Dermatologist for checkups and treatment, as needed. A few months ago I was looking at my teeth and one of them seemed to be a little \"tilted\" (bottom teeth).  When I looked closer in the mirror and tried to see the inside surface of my tooth I saw something white on the gum beneath the tooth.   I have a dentist's type small round mirror on a long handle and I used this to check the inside of my lower teeth/jaw...and discovered two spots, one on the right side of my jaw and one on the left side beneath corresponding teeth.   Running my tongue over both of these spots told me they were hard (the left side also feels \"ridged\", the right side is smooth). I went to the dentist and he confirmed that it was bone tissue, specifically jawbone, not teeth bone.   He said it is not unheard of, but not common....maybe 5% of the population.   I didn't think, at the time, to remind him that I've been taking Fosomax for years.   Later I saw an advertisement in the newspaper pertaining to a law suit for several things, one being symptoms of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ).   It listed several symptoms, the only one I have is the exposed bone.   I called my MD, who put me on Fosomax because I have osteaoporosis (sp?).   I told her about the jawbone issue, she said, essentially, don't worry about it and not to stop taking the Fosomax.   After a couple of weeks I decided on my own to stop the Fosomax. I appreciate the candid information and historys that you folks are writing about here.  I've been considering changing MDs, and now I think is a good time to follow through on that.  I like my present MD very much, but I have felt for awhile that I'm not getting the thorough attention that I think I need.   I'm a 77 year old female, in quite good health condition, and I'd like to keep it that way!  (grin)",
