Keeping busy also helps :) and keeping a sense of humor or rather a sense of the ridiculous.  I have so many things to do and now they don't even matter anymore.  Who'd've thunk it would turn out like this. I had breast cancer in 1998 and took the chemo for 4 cycles and 36 radiation treatments. I had turned 40 that year. I took Tamoxifin for 5 years and never had one side effect. When I turned 50 this year I have severe hot flashes. My Dad was dignosed with stage 4 lung cancer and died 8 weeks later and my husband was dignosed with stage 4 lung cancer one month before and his already spread to the other lung, liver and lymph nodes. I think the stress of all this started my hot flashes and I have them all day and night. I may sleep 2 hours a night total. I am not on hormones. I know what you are going thru and I wish I could have some good advice. I exercise alot. I go to spin class for 1 hr. at 5am, 3 mornings a week and I go to 3 hrs. of exercise on Tues and Thurs evening and I walk everyday for 30-1 hr. I can tell this really helps my hot flashes. My husband is doing really good with the chemo. He is also alcoholic. He still works and to look at him you would never know he was sick. I hope you find something to help with the hot flashes. Try some exercise.  ",
