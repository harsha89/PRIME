      "Content": "  On 5/24/2009 I am OK wrote: Be skeptical!  It might save your life!!  I am 47 and found a lump during self exam and called my ob/gyn.  She immediately sent me to The Breast Center for a digital mammogram (always faithful to get annual exams) and nothing showed up.  I was insistent there was a lump so the tech did a sonogram to see.  Nothing.  I took her hand and made her feel the lump.  She did and called the Radiologist in.  The Radiologist did another sonogram in high resolution.  Nothing.  She told me \"if it was me, I would keep an eye on it and come back in 6 months\".  I took her hand and made her feel the lump.  She said \"I can do a needle biopsy if you want but I am sure it is nothing\".  I felt like an idiot and went away with a nagging feeling.  After two weeks, I went to see my Ob/gyn again and made her feel the lump.  She called a surgeon who specializes in breast cancers.  I saw him and he assured me, after looking at the films and reports, it was nothing.  He said, \"if you cannot believe 3 MD's, 2 mammograms, and 2 sonograms, I will do a biopsy if you want\".  One week after the biopsy, I got a call from him.  I had ductal cancer and would need to come in that afternoon.  It's now 7 months later.  I opted for a bilateral radial mastectomy and have never regretted my decision.  I felt if they could not detect the first tumor, how would they ever detect any future tumors?  Because I opted for the bilateral radical mastectomy, I did not have radiation or chemotherapy.  I also chose not to have reconstruction.  I talked to too many women who had reconstruction and then were forced to have as many as five additional surgeries (in the same year) to \"tweek or fix\" them.  I am happy, cancer free, wear two breast prosthesis', and encourage you to follow your instincts.  On my first meeting with my Oncologist after surgery, she walked into the exam room and said \"Mrs. ____, you saved your life\".  I also ran into the Radiologist at a Cancer Awareness Dinner who came up to me and apologized.  I don't blame her - the tumor did not show up on any film but I know she will be careful when telling future patients \"come back in 6 months\".   Would like to know if you ever had a mri.. I also have some lump on my right breast, had a lumptectomy last year on my left breast.. Not in my lympth nodes.. But i feel a lump in my right breast have had it for a long time but they say its breast tissue and fibro cystic breast makes me very nervious but all test ultra sound ,mamo and mri is normal..wanted to know how they biopsy your lump ..thanks katt   ",
