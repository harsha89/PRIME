      "Content": "Hi , I have been reading this thread with much interest as I will start my first round of Taxotere and Cytoxan coming next Wednesday 5th. The oncologist told me right away I will lose my hair, she even said this before I asked...guess this must be the number 1 question they will get. It WAS going to be MY number 1 question..... I am bothered about losing my hair, but I know all the worrying will not change a thing...I have already gone wig shopping. I shopping, I have not purchased the wig yet, but it is on hold. Right after I get my first chemo treatment I am heading right over to get that wig, because I know then there is no turning back...it's a done deal. The reason a wig is so inportant for me is I am a teacher for Preschool/Kindergarten children. I feel I need to look as normal as I can. I wish I could be like the other women that mentioned above and just wear a different hair style every day....just to have fun with it. But I don't know if I can as I am trying not to cause the children to really notice I have a sickness that causes hair loss....But I will wait and see. At first I will try to hide it from the children just so I don't have to answer a lot of question they might have....BUT if they discover....who knows maybe I could have fun. I do have a plan on buying a cheap wig and having it in the classroom for the kids to style it. I would like to offer a suggestion about wigs....Mind you I have not worn one yet other then to try on. I have shop at many, many, many stores in two different cities....I believe it is going to be one of those \"you get what you pay for\".  The mose comfortable and real looking wigs I have found range from $175.00-$300.00. Please keep in mind I am no expert and I have no knowledge of the places through the cancer society or hospitals that make wigs available to women for free. I did find some places will take a % off the price if you are a cancer victim. Off the wig subject and back to the treatment..... My questions are: I have heard this treatment is one of the most tolerable of treatments....Many have said they have not missed much work or had many sick days. Is this true? What are the secrets?  I read about drinking lots of water....What is the advice about scheduling days to get Chemo? I work Mon-Fri, and want to miss as little days from school as I can?",

      "Content": "I have just become familiar with the 1 week vs week treatment you are talking about. This is known as \"Clinical Trails\"  You can google the term to have a better understanding. I was given the choice to participate....choose the \"no thank you\" The decision was to go from a whole breast radiation to \"maybe\" getting partial breast radiation (being done in three different ways). Decision to not participate was due to the fact theat my surgeon agreed the whole breast radiation is the best course for me to take....whole reason to even have radiation after having a breast cancer surgery is to kill any hidden or traveling cancer cells....this can not be completed by a partial radiation.  Another reason I declined was more on a mental side....I am a planner and need to know what is happening as so I can make plans and prepare myself.  If I agreed to sing up for this clinical trail....a \"coin is flipped\" by the clinical trail medical team and this decides which treatment I get. I do not want to have my set to do one kind of treatment to have it changed later...plus the partial is done in three different ways, two have which I should of been prepared for when I had my lumpectomy ( to rule out chances of infection) Since this was not done....well this helped me make my decision, Also the other reason was....doing this would change the time of doing my Chemo.  For me just too many changes and too many unknowns. So this was not right for me, but it may be a good choice for others...and I look up to the ones who agree to do this, as they are helping medical science advance and help others. On that note there are some radiologist doing an partial breast radiation that are not doing it becasue of clinical trails....this I have no experience or information on.",
