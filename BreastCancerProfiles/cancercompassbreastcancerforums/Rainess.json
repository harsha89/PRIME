      "Content": "Dear GramNurse, You are going to be fine.  The chemo is not as bad as you think.  I have stage 3a bc, with a 9 cm tumor in my left breast.  I am doing 6 rounds of taxotere, carboplatin and herceptin.  I have completed my first round.  The day of chemo and the day after I felt fine.  They give you steroids and great anti nausea meds to take for the first couple of days.  Once you stop the steroids, on about day 3, you will be very tired.  At least this was my experience.  I was super tired on day 3 and 4, but still managed to work 1/2 of each of those days.  Day 5 I started to feel better.  No nausea at all but did have some diarrhea.  That was it.  It's been over a week since my chemo treatment and I feel great.  No aches or pains.  I am a single mom, and also work full time. You can continue on with your life through treatment.  You just need a plan, and support, and lots of patience.  You are going to do great!  If you ever have questions or just want to vent you can email me atmichl@cinci.rr.com.  Good luck lady! :) Michele ",
