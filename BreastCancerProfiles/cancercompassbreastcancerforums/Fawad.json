Hi,please note that similar situation has been recently diagnosed with my couzin (age only 25) having breast cancer reached bones. Oncologist here in Pakistan, suggest to go on Herbal treatment (no chemo which is confusing us). I saw your message and the medicine we have been suggested is more or less same 'Nolvadex (Tamoxifin)' one tablet daily and 1 injection (once in 3o days). Could you please advise, if your herbal is effective? and is it without Chemo? or you already have had Chemo and now having Herbal treatment. What food intake you suggest during the process. Please please your urgent response here",

      "Content": "Dear All, my 25 aged couzin has been recently diagnosed with breast cancer stage 4 (reached bones). Oncologist here in Pakistan has suggested not go on Chemo instead they are suggesting \"Herbal Treatment' and have prescribed 'Nolvadex'(Tamoxifin) on daily basis (1 tablet) and an injection once in 30 days. I am a bit confused as no Chemo. Can anyone advise here please, is it the right way to go or should we consult someone else (particularly if some good suggestion in US available). Also, what should be the food intake during the medication process. Please some urgent guidance",
