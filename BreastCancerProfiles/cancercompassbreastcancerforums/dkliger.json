I know the signs and symptoms of these cancer. Last year between august and september, one day i had my self breasts examination and i felt a lump on my left breast beside the nipple, its size is much smaller than a pea and immovable. But i never consulted any medical practitioner to further assess my conditon, i was busy that time so i continue to what im doing. And another reason for not consulting is because our family is going through a financial problem which cause the family members start to argue with each other, i dont want to be a burden. This year, i felt another lump below the right breast.. same as the lump on my left breast. I started to worry more becase there are two lumps in both of my breast. I used what i know about breast cancer to be my checklist. I also ask my friends whose nursing student, they told me maybe those lumps are just benign. This month, i had my self breast examination again. I squeeze my nipple and i have a white discharge in a very minimal amount like your putting a period(.) in a paper. Both of them has. Im having an anxiety now, if i really have a cancer. I know its my fault to ignore my situation last year, i have a reason that why i did that. Im so scared, i dont know if its because of the possibilities that i have cancer, the procedure i must go through or the pain it may cause to my family? I know this site has the people who experience the same thing, my questions are.... Can you tell me what do you experience before you consult the doctor? Is the nipple discharge is white in color? How can i tell to my parents that i need to consult a doctor? It hard for me, just thinking to tell them this i wanna cry. How will i accept this? Thank you to the readers and respondents of my message. Hope you could help me. Bye! Take care! Hello, You need to take care of this problem by going to the doctor so they can find out what is wrong and so you know what you have.  I would be more worried not knowing what I have. I guess you have health insurance but go and tell your parents. You need to be assertive and take charge of your own life.Don't wait and stop worring and be strong and brave and take this step.  Go online and learn from different websites and read about how to be more assertive. This is not going away until you take action by going to the doctor.   Good Luck! Dee    ",

      "Content": "Hi, I have been on Arimidex for 1 1/2 years,  Along with joint pain in my hands, I am now experiencing eye vision problems.  My eyes are always red and I am seeing floaters in my eyes.  All of a sudden my prescription glasses is blurry.  Is there anyone out there that has a similar problem on arimidex??  I also have dry eyes and have always had dry eyes for years before my breast cancer 2 years ago. but the eye vision problem bothers me..I am not sure if arimidex is causing it or is it something else is causing it.  Thanks, Dee",
