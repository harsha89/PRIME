Although I try not to dwell on the possibility of recurrance I find that sometimes I worry a great deal about the cancer coming back.  I also think at times that I want to stop arimidex due to the side affects which I live with daily. Does anyone have input to , or share my concerns??  Please respond. I just stumbled upon this website this morning and am hoping it is a good place to be.  Friends who have not shared my experience cannot relate to my feelings on these matters. An unusal vascularizationin my left breast was visualized on thermography.  Started to get things checked out however my breast cancer did not show up on my mammogram, my sonnogram nor when they did a biopsy.  The lump was removed because of it's size: 2.5 cms.  It was a surprize to find CA there.  Sentinal node +4 were negative.  Lumpectomy.  Radiation x32.  Then arimidex since last November.  The side effects make me crazy, feel lazy and the joint and muscle pain make me want to smoke joints!!  I take INSAIDS which tear up my stomach and tums, etc. for that.  I finally have gotten a second opinion and I am not taking arimidex this week.  Switching to it's cousin:  aromasin.  Hopefully, I will tolerate this better.  If not, on to tamoxifan.   I understand completely why one would consider not completing 5 years of chemotherapy.  I worry about recurrance all of the time.  I think sometimes, this is so intense because the side effects of the chemotherapy doesn't allow me to just \"forget\" about CA and go on about my life.  Each little ache and/or pain reminds me of the possibilities.   ",

      "Content": "Hi folks--    I was on aramsin for 11 months and aramadex for another 4 months with such miserable joint and muscle pain that it affected my quality of life so that basically I was working and resting (when the insomnia wasn't driving me nuts.)    Got a second opinion began tamaxafin and although pain isn't gone completely it's a 2 not a six and I can SLEEP.     Considering the use of these drugs really only prevent recurrance up to 4%, I thought I'd rather be able to dance my 4% than be in constant pain. Regardless of what you're taking talking to your doc is the best way to make these decisions or get a second opinion.  He reported to me that there is now a study reporting that 2 years of an aramatse inhibitor and 2 years of tamaxifin if for some people resulting in even fewer recurrances!    ",

Radiation (32 treatments) ended on January  8.   Mid  Feburary, I had an abcess (on my lumpectomy scar) which ruptured.  It is still draining after 2 rounds of antibiotics.  Supposedly, the culture was negative.   Any thoughts?",

      "Content": "No one has mentioned a stitch abcess to me.  The cavity of the abcess is about 1.25 inches deeo.  Yes, it is still draining.  I have three more days of antibiotics and am worried that the process will begin all over again:  The skin heals and a new abcess will form.  On 3/13/2007 Witchdoctor wrote: If it was in the scar it sounds like what we call a \"stitch abscess\"  This is usually caused by an absorbable suture that sets up an area of inflammation, which can sometimes get in infected.  Treatment can be conservative or some people \"incise, drain and remove capsule\" and let it heal in secondarily.  It can take while to heal completely.  If it still draining then you may need the more aggressive management above.  ",
