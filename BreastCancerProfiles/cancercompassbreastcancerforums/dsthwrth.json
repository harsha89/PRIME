    "Content": "Has anyone developed Breast Cancer after having Breast reduction? I have very dense breasts and had my reduction 10 years ago. I have had \"normal\" mammograms since then. This last one (Oct 2014) was the first 3D one I had with an additional Ultrasound. I had a pallipable lump on my left breast which was determined to be \"scar tissue\" by the radiologist on this mammo. I now (4 months later) have a small lump on my right side upper lateral from the nipple that I believe was not there before. However, they did a rescan on my mammo the same day because they thought they saw something on my Rt breast. But when they reposition the breast in the machine, it was gone and dismissed by the radiologist. I go to the Breast Specialist this month to get this new lump checked out. Very anxious to find out if this was there the whole time and they just schrugged it off to be nothing.Â ",
