    "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, stage 1. I had a lumpectomy surgery and the tumor was 1.5 centimeters. The tumor had not spread to surrounding tissue or the sentinal lymph nodes. However, the tumor was irregular in shape and I think that means that the cell activity could be active. It is my intention to go through radiation therapy and take Femara. My pathology slides were sent to be tested (oncotype DX) to see what the possibility is that the cancer could spread to other organs. The results came back in the intermediate area, which is the grey, unknown area. My oncologist recommends chemo (4 weeks). I am very reluctant to take chemo. I have a great sensitivity to drugs, and along with chemo he gives steroids. I got very ill with a virus for many months, when I took steriods for a foot problem. The virus went to my eyes (iritis) and I eventually lost the sight in the central part of my left eye which has completely changed my life, and not for the better. I don't feel my immune system can take all the toxicity. (I also have Gauchers Disease.) I told him I don't want chemo. My gut feeling is that I am correct. However, he said that with radiation and femara, I have an 85% chance that the cancer won't spread within a 10 yr. period. chemo improves that about 4%. I don't feel that 4% is worth taking a risk with my health condition. As I said, this is my gut feeling. I just don't want to start worrying that I made the wrong decision. Am I wrong to feel this way? I know there is no guarantee, but I think they are overdoing it, to be honest. Any guidelines would be helpful to me. I know this is a personal decision in the end and I take responsibility for it. Thanks, Dogwalker",
