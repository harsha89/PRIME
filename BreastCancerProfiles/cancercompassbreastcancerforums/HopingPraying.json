    "Content": "Good evening, just joined.   My family could use some support and guidance with my sister-in-laws battle. Let me give a brief run through and may be someone out there as gone through some similar things. In 2008 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, they found it in her liver and under her left armpit. She under went chemo all things were looking good, the liver cleared up and is healthy in that respect, and the nodes look god too. That was until this past January, they found some liessions on her brain(2). they have tried some different things to slow them, they put her on roids that helped with them getting bigger but have cuased her face and joints to sweel and be very painfull, also lead to mouth sores ao she is not eating much because it hurts so much , they just stopped her secound round chemo feeling as though it was not helping he, her Dr. said that she has more liessions now and that they can not operate becuse of where they are and that ther are so many. We also feel her mood has gone and she is not fighting as hard as she was before.   Now is there anyone that has gone through anything similar we need away to figure this all out, they are going to go to Danna Farber and some where in Penn state. We are so worried that we will here that this is it what are the options for this kind of situation. I hurt every time I see her, she is my wifes sisster, the god mother of my children, yes I am sobbing now. To see thier pain and all the ?, I am seeing them ? thier faith and try to tell them he hears them stay the coarse, then I come to my own cross roads, I am sorry for carrying on but the news today sucked, we hope they can find some thing fast, even something to put it into a holding pattern til they find the right treat ment, if she could get off those roids and get up and move her mood might improve.  ",
