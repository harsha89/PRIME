      "Content": "Yes, they took me off Tamoxifen as it obviously wasn't working. First op was a lumpectomy, but as I had radiotherapy breast had to be taken away on second reoccurance. First diagnosis was in November 2005 and second in November 2010. I'm feeling great though. Just need to keep on taking the tablets. :)",

      "Content": "I started off with Tamoxifen, but cancer returned and I am now taking Arimidex. I was told that Tamoxifen costs less, which is why I was prescribed it first of all. I have found that I am getting stiffness taking Arimidex, but do regular exercise to try and offset this and it is monitored. As for reconstruction - yes, this was done at the same time as the mascectomy, but waiting to have another op to balance with t'other side. I've had no problems with the reconstruction and post op period was managed very well with only a stiff feeling. :) :)Â ",
