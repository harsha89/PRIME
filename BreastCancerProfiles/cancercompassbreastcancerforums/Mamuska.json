Steroids seem to be really helping my mom right now.           Hi LoveandLight, How is your mom doing? Still around?  My close friend was just diagnosed last week with CM and is having her 4th radiation treatment today.  Your mom's story was the only one that gives me hope that my friend will regain any quality of life.  Any advice you could give would be great.  Thanks.
