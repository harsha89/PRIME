      "Content": "Hi , I would suggest you do nothing except pray for your neighbor. Obviously she does not want to share information with others.  Cancer is very invasive.  She must be in shock herself and probably does not want pity from others.  Just pray for her.  When she is ready to share with you, I am sure she will. That other neighbor should not have share.  When people confide their personal information and specifically request not to share, it is a betrayal of confidence to share,  especially when one is seriously sick and vulnerable. Be blessed. Jockey",

      "Content": "Hi Jodie, I am sorry for your dilemma. I would suggest you just enjoy the times that you have your grandson and cherish them.  I have 2 grandchildren and really adore them.  I have found the secret to having them around more is having a good relationship with their mothers.  Try to understand the mother's reasoning.  She is probably trying to protect her little boy from getting too attached then you probably leave him.  I think most of the parents' selfishness comes from being protective of their kids and not trying to be mean.   I lost my son to stomach cancer 2 weeks ago and appreciate life even more.  The times you have your grandchild are times to be cherished. When you don't have him, just plan on your next visit with him. I wish you well with yoiur health.. and wonderful times with your grandbaby..  God's blessings to you. Jockey",
