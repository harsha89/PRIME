    "Content": "Yup me too. Lumpectomy, SNB, 6 weeks radiation ended end of May 2015. Left with chronic pain in my breast, under my armpit, sore ribs, slight cough if I breathe too deeply, intolerance to heat and general exhaustion. Let me not to forget to include my breast lymphadema. Not that I am a miserable person, I try to deal and not whine.... (No more wine for this ER+ gal). Went for surgical follow up yesterday and got some sympathy and told he sees 1 person a year with issues like mine.....?? And he promised my \"little tumor\" would be so easy to rid me of. Huh? All I can say to everyone is I feel your pain and anxiety. I tire more easily and tire of people who don't get why I need a little more downtime to myself and the need to manually drain/massage the lymphatic system. i don't think I would have said no to all this treatment I had but I sure as heck hope it doesn't come back or anew. Good luck to all!",
