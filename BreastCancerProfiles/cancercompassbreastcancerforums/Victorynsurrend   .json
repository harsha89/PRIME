    "Content": "My mom had a Pet scan before a scheduled lumpectomy. When they went to do the lumpectomy, they did not remove the tumor. Why would they choose not to remove it?  Why didn't they see this info on the Pet scan?  They have now ordered a bone scan and are scheduling her for chemo. She isn't giving me good info, not sure if she is getting it herself. Could someone give me some insight into what we might be dealing with here? Thanks ",
