      "Content": "I'm so glad I found you all here! I switched from Tamoxifen to Aromasin about 6 weeks ago. The pain and stiffness started in my fingers, then wrists, and then to elbows and shoulders. Last weekend came the pain and stiffness in my feet and ankles. Right now it's managable, but annoying. I'm wondering how bad it will get. I've upped my calcium and I'm now taking a multivitamin. I'll see how things go. I really don't want to have to take pain meds with this drug that is supposed to be so good for me.",

Are these the result of the Aromasin....or just me getting older?  They hurt like the dickens! Also, my feet have grown a full size larger in 4 months.  Will they go back to the original size, or am I stuck with these feet? ",

Are there any of you that have any input on things you were able to do to help with the Aromasin issues? I've started taking a multi-vitamin in supplement to already eating what I think is a very healthy diet. I've doubled my Calcium supplements. I'm a very active person, but am slowing down because of the pain. Is there an herbal supplement, massage therapy, special dance....that I can do to help tolerate this pain?",
