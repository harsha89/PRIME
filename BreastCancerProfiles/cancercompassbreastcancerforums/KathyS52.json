      "Content": "Starla, I am sorry you are going thru so much pain and suffering. I think you need to find a new doctor. My surgeon was excellent. I had a double mastectomy and a year later when my cancer had gone into remission, I had started breast reconstruction. Do whatever you have to do to seek additional medical treatment. Contact the Cancer Treatment center closest to you for referrals and check them out. Get references. Surely there must be something they can do to stop the pain and suffering. There are aÂ  lot of pain drugs on the market and one of them has to work for you. I was lucky. I did not suffer as you did. I still need to have surgery for the implants but I don't expect any problems. Thank you for warning us about this type of trauma. I wish you the best always! Kathy in Ohio",
