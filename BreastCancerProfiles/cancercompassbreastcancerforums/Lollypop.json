    "Content": "I am a 45 yo female and have had regular mammograms last 5 years.  Annual mammogram on October 1 showed \"something\" that needed further investigation.  Went today and had digital mammogram which still showed spot, so radiologist did sonogram.  Sonogram was clear.  She reported that compared to 2007 mammogram, which was fine, the  tissue in question had enlarged.  Recommends further tests just to verify everything is ok.   Even though she does not see anything on the sonogram, she does not recommend the \"wait 6 mos and repeat\" theory in case it continues to grow.  My choices are biopsy or MRI.  Of course MRI is less invasive, but she said it is \"in vogue\" right now.  I would prefer tests so we could know for sure.  She said I could discuss with doctor, but it up to me which way to go.  Anyone have this type expreience?  Any thoughts?    Thanks.          ",
