      "Content": "Thank you for all the great advise. I am learning as we go and putting your advise to work. Mom had round two yesterday and so far she's not in as bad of shape as last time. The doctors change some of the meds, not the chemo drugs, so she's not having any severe reactions like last time. She is just very tried but we knew that was coming. I'm praying that the med changes are going to help her. We'll know for sure in the next 24-48 hours. I have changed some of the things I've been doing to help her from your advise. I have a better understanding of when to encourage her to do a few things and when to back off and lousy be there for her.. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Doctors have said they want her to wait until they are done with the chemo before she can move. My aunt does live down the street from her so she helps out a lot. I've been coming up for the first week after her treatments . That's when she really needs someone her with her all the time. Iim going to do what ever I have to while she is under going the chemo. Once she's done the plan is to get her closer to me. Until then I will make the drive because I know it's what I did to do. I'm glad school is out for my son because now I don't have to worry about his school work. Dad is stepping up at home so I can go as often as needed. I also have a couple of parents back home where my son can go and spend the night when I'm gone. It's hard but it will pass. It's going to be a long summer though.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am a new member and would like some ideas to help me cope with my mothers treatment. I've always felt I was a strong person and could deal with anything life sent my way. Moms diagnosis of Brest cancer hit me very hard. She had a single mastectomy with lymph nod removal and came through surgery with flying colors. One week ago she had her first of 4 chemo treatments and she had every reaction you could possible have from the drugs. Her face turned purple from the steroids, broke out from head to toe in hives, developed thrush in her mouth and throat, and was severally dehydrated. After 3 trips to the er and 2 trips to doctors she is finally coming back to life. I feel so helpless and want to do everything I can to help her gain some strength back before the next session. I pretend to be strong when I'm with her because I know she needs my support now more than ever. At night when I'm alone all have to much time to think and I have become very depressed and struggling to keep myself together so I can be there for her. If anyone has any suggestions to help me become the strong person I used to be please help me. I can't help her if I can get my emotions under control first. My mother is my hero and I need to be her hero now as we begin this journey together. Thank you for any advise you have to get through this.",

I've found a couple of good apps to put on my ipad to re rood all the information on meds as well as a diary for the aches and pains. This is the first group I've joined and I value you all the information. When I choose the app pot if anyone else has an app they use let me know. Thanks again to everyone.",
