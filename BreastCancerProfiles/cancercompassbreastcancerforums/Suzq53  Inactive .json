      "Content": "Thank you for your response. Did your sadness go away after you stopped taking the medication -- or did you notice any changes in how you felt? If so, how long did it take for you to realize a difference? I'm leaning towards stopping the drug at the end of February -- and I will be so disappointed if I don't feel better afterwards! Maybe it's just getting older, and not the medicine at all! :- 0",

      "Content": "Hi. I am five years out, as of Jan 14th. I took tamoxifin for two years, then switched to aromasin. I was told that I would be on these drugs for a total of five years. Now, my doctor tells me that I can stay on Aromosin for five years. I'm concerned that maybe these drugs might be doing harm that we don't know about - but at the same time I want to do all I can to prevent the big C from returning. I have had joint aches, back pain, sadness (on and off), tiredness and just not feeling \"good\" since going through this cancer experience (chemo, radiation). I'm curious if some of these feelings will go away if I stop taking the aromosin. I don't know what to do -- keep taking it, or stop. Any thoughts? My heart-felt wishes go out to all of you on this message board. Thanks for reading my message and for your thoughs.",

      "Content": "Hi... Congratulations on being four years out! I can totally relate to the lower back pain you are having. I had serious back pain during radiation, related to a pinched nerve and sciatica (spelling?). My lower back has hurt almost constantly ever since. I so want the pain to go away. I know it will take time for the aromosin to get totally out of my system. On March 5th, I will have been off it for two weeks. I have to say that I already notice some differences in how I feel. More energy, less emotional. It might be pychological, because I wanted to \"be better\" so badly...but I'll take it! I'm 54 years old -- so we are near the same age. I, too, don't believe that these aches are age related. Also, I had terrible hot flashes from the time of chemo, and they didn't go away until this last year. I know that chemo put me into menopause, and that resulted in the hot flashes -- but, for sure, the Tamoxifin and the Aromosin had an effect too. Best wishes to you and thank you for posting your message. I'm sorry you have the pains -- but it is reassuring to me that possibly the pain is drug related and there is hope that it will subside.",
