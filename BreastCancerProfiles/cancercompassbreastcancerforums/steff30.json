    "Content": "Hi, I had a LD flap reconstruction mastectomy done last Feb and in the last two months finished with Herceptine but am still on Tamoxifen. I have the most awful backpains and chest pains, I am hoping it is the nerves healing I guess, but it can completely wind you as if you have been stabbed? Is this normal to still have this a year on? I have asked my doctors and they have done scans but not found anything and have quickly dismissed it as nothing, but obviously I am still extremely paranoid. Â If anyone could put my minda at ease that this is ufortunately normal I would be very grateful. Thanks",
