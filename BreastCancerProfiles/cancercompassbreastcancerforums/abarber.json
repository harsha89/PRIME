I also have some lump on my right breast, had a lumptectomy last year on my left breast.. Not in my lympth nodes.. But i feel a lump in my right breast have had it for a long time but they say its breast tissue and fibro cystic breast makes me very nervious but all test ultra sound ,mamo and mri is normal..wanted to know how they biopsy your lump ..thanks katt    i have been having issues with swollen lymphth nodes for 2 yrs now along with lumps in my breast that do not show on the ultra sounds along with lactation.  My youngest child is 7.  Today they are very swollen again so i went for another ultra sound the right side showed the node swollen my left side is larger than the right and it showed nothing on the ultrasound.  the tech was confused and wanted to do more his boss said no its nothing, cancer runs in my family so what do i do contact a cancer dr and beg them to do the test?  what if i am wrong, my husband would rather not even hear about it and thinks im stupid but something is wrong.  Im 5 \"8 and down to 127lbs from the stress.  need some advise do you know any dr that will listen in san antonio tx?????",
