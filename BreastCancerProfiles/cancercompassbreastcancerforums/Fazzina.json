    "Content": "Dear Susan C. I just finished chemotherapy for my second time with Ovarian Cancer. I am so obsessed with it coming back a third time - there was 2 and 1/2 years between my first and second operation. I never heard of glyconutrients but I am going to try them. I would love to know what other nutrients you and your friend have or are taking. I think I am more afraid of this disease than I let on. Everyone thinks I have such a good attitude and for the most part I do - but there are those times when things are quiet and I can think and I get frightened. Anything on alternative medicine you are willing to share with me I am more than willing to look in to. By the way - have you ever heard of mangosteen juice and what do you think of it? Thank you, Gail F.",
