    "Content": "There are new findings about a genetic cause of odor connected to cancer. The one I read was at http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/news/20090605/ear-wax-bod I had stage 4 non-hodgkins which was everywhere. During treatment the chemical smells were horrible. I figured it was the chemo leaving my body through my skin. However for months before diagnosis I was constantly asking my kids if they smelled a \" chemical \" smell. I do not have diabetes and my sugar is almost always around 85. Maybe one day doctors will be more alert when we report a change in body odor.",
