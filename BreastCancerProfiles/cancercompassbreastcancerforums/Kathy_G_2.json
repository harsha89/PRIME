      "Content": "Hi.....I was on Arimidex for only about 3 mos--9-04 till 12-04. My body could not handle it( Arimidex made a mess out of my intestines!!) I have been on Aromasin for almost a year and I too, had joint pains. I use to take FYI from Garden of Life and found that it was very helpful BUT very expensive so I switched to FeelAnew. At first I was sorry for switching (the joint pain was bad!!)but I also knew I needed to give them a chance. Well I am not sorry now!! I feel pretty good. Plus I have been able to exercise!! I hope this info was helpful!! Kathy",

      "Content": "FeelAnew----this is what the box states......Joint Comfort Glucosamine & Chondroitin with Nexrutine. From reading the box Nerutine is a patent-pending natural COX-2 inhibitor. I found this product in Vitamin Shoppe (I live in New York) I have found that my knees and feets do not hurt as much since I have been taking this product (about 8 weeks) I hope this info has been helpful!!",
