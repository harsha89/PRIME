I just wanted to say Thank you for your letter that makes me feel as if I have NOT lost my mind and that the pain and swelling that I am experiencing is not in my head and is not just due to my age (65). I also have been a very active person and had some arthritis in my knees but could always exercise and walk forever.  Now however I feel so crippled (even tho I force myself to keep moving) and I too feel like an old woman. I took Tomaxafen for 2 years and had a small amount of pain but I have been on Aromasin for 6 months and I am ready to stop the medication. I will keep checking to see if we find out any new information. Thank you again ! Jeannie  ",
