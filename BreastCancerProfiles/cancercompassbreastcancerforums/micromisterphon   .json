    "Content": "You could try glutamine supplements. It's supposed to help the body repair damage. I get mine at Target, but a pharmacy or General Nutrition store might have it. I have been taking it since chemo and radiation for tonsil cancer last year. I had pain and numbness in my legs and feet, now just some numbness in my middle toes on both feet. Hope this helps. Best wishes, Mike",
