      "Content": "My wife was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in 2002 age 37. She had mastectomy and went through chemo regimen. 2006 she had a reoccurrence, bone and liver. Treated with xeloda until Feb. 2007. This time it spread to spinal fluid. After many times of asking Dr. if it was correct diagnosis or could it be retested and continually shot down, we got a second opinion. First thing they did was retest pathology. It came back as triple positive. Now she is on Aromasin, Hereptin, and Methotrexate in a port placed in her head to get directly to spinal fluid. She lost vision and hearing. Hearing has returned to 90% but vision is still very poor. I guess my point is, QUESTION EVERYTHING, and get 2nd and 3rd opinions if you are not 100% comfortable. Stay positive!!",
