    "Content": "I just had a lumpectomy and the lymph nodes removed from underarm area next to that breast. The Dr. said they removed all the tissue of the breast that had the cancer, but that quite a few of the lymph nodes were cancerous. He was surprised since my tumor was small and he felt was detected early. I am to have appts. with a Dr. for further tests to see if and where the cancer may have spread and then to schedule chemo and radiation. What I am not sure of is, since I have cancer in the lymph nodes they removed under my arm, is that considered lymphoma or if the cancer hasn't spread and they kill it with the chemo is it just-cancer in those nodes and not considered lymphoma. There is so much to ask, learn and think about right now. Just answering this will help me to start understanding. Thanks, Nancy in Ohio",
