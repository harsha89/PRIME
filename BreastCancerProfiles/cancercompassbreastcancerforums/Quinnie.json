    "Content": "hi I too have been on tamo for 5 years then now 3 years on Femara. I too have achey joints and feel 80 at the age of 55! I am seeing my onc next week for my yearly checkup and asking him how much longer I have to endure this as my quality of life is very low at the moment. I have a big problem with my feet as I can hardly walk as they are so sore. when I wake up they are stiff then they loosen up and after three hours at work I can hardly stand as my legs and feet are acheing so bad. Another problem I have is my hair is thinning and it is getting worse as the months go on. I'm afraid that the onc will say \" It's better than having cancer\", which is supposed to be comforting to me! I do think however, that after you stop this, things will get better as the estrogen is returning to the system. Can I ask why you have stopped? Was it prescribed by your doctor to stop after three years? Thanks for your time. Good luck with things. Val",
