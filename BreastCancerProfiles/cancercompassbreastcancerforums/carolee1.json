    "Content": "Thanks for informing me about flax seeds. I've been eating them daily for nutritional purposes along with Dr. Barlean's Omega fish oil but will now only take the latter. Â  I am 56, have stage 1 ER positive breast cancer, had 2 surgeries to remove the tumor, none in the lymph node, 7 weeks of daily radiation, and after a lot of deliberation, as of Dec.7th 2011, have been on Aromasin. I have knee pain which is so far bearable but now I have shoulder pain and lower back pain. I want to attribute it to my weekly yoga and zumba workouts but after reading all the posts I'm sure it's from the medication. Has anyone taken less of a dose and been successful? And/or has anyone found natural alternatives that have kept them cancer free? Unfortunately, we are all just guinea pigs for Dr's and gold mines for the pharmaceutical companies. I wish you all a long and healthy life!",
