      "Content": "I started out taking Letrozole and it made me so tired I could not get out of bed.  I also had calf pain and a problem with the middle finger on my right hand.  Now I am taking Aromasin and the calf pain is worse.  Now I also have joint pain, particularly in my legs and feet.  I just don't know how a person can be expected to take this medication and function. My husband is an invalid at the moment and between him and the side effects, I feel I may die yet.  Is there anything that helps?",
