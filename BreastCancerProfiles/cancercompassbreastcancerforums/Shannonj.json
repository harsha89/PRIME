My breast, where the neoplasm was located and where they left the titanium clip is so sore and getting more sore by the day. This is kind of freaking me out: is my body rejecting the clip? Or, is it breast cancer? I am scheduled for a follow up ultrasound in two weeks, they have to wait till the tissue from the core needle biopsy is completely healed, they wanted to do an mri but as I've posted here before I am balking at that. So, my question: has anyone here that has had a core needle biopsy experienced pain from the titanium clip they leave behind? Like months after the biopsy.... Â  Valarie I had a breast biopsy about 7 months ago since then I had severe pain and large painful lumps. I tell doctors that it is the clip. They put me on antibiotics then it became more painful developed what looks like a staff infection. I had to make appointment with surgeon. Now I am left with scaring and have two holes in my chest that are getting better. But this hole thing has made me physically ill. I have vomited daily. At on point I was in shower and I gently squeezed area to remove puss and I guess the hole was so deep it was in top of a vein literally stared shooting blood out of my chest. I don't know what the surgeon will do I am afraid the will admit me into hospital. I just want it to end. So I will update what happens.",
