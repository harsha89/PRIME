    "Content": "I had bi-lat mastectomy 5 months ago. I had drain in for 6 weeks on left side. Since the surgery, I've had a large swelling just under where my left breast had been. The surgeon didn't really make much comment after I asked him what it was and if it would go away. He just said \"Maybe in about 6 months it will be gone.\"  The GP doesn't know what to tell me either. It is very uncomfortable.  I cannot wear my prosthesis  because the mastectomy bra irritates the \"bulge\".  I had not planned to have reconstruction  surgery. The bulge is hard. It doesn't seem to be fluid-filled. It feels like muscle but the doctors are not saying that it is.  If anyone has had a similar problem after mastectomy, could you please let me know if you have found out what this could be. I don't feel comfortable going out in public without my prosthesis, yet, I cannot wear it.",
