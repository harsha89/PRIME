    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with Stage IV a little over a year ago. By this October, she was doing really well -- no signs of disease except for a very small mass on her left breast. Previously she'd had metastases to her liver and lungs. Anyway, we thought things were going well. The oncologist told us she could have five years ahead of her, maybe even longer if she was really lucky. Then in early December she started having problems with her left eye. At first she and her doctor thought it was just a temporary side effect from some of her new meds (she'd recently started hormone therapy as disease \"maintenance\"). Then they decided to get a brain scan just to be sure... and found over a dozen tumors in her brain, including a big one on the nerve leading to her left eye. She's just finished WBRT, but the doctors are not particularly optimistic. They're thinking she'll have somewhere between 6 months and a year. Now, I know they don't know everything and it's hard to predict when anyone will die, but nevertheless it's got me thinking about what will happen when she's gone and the grieving process. Now the issue: I don't know if I want to attend the funeral. To me, the purpose of funerals is to help people accept that their loved one is gone and to give/receive support from others that knew her. It's not for the dead. The problem is that I do not find funerals helpful when I'm grieving (I've been to a few in the past few years for grandparents and older friends). In fact, in the case where a family member has died, I find them distressing -- in part due to a number of ill-behaved aunts and uncles. I find other things more helpful when it comes to grieving. For example, after my Grandma died, I looked through family photos, and I played scrabble (her favorite game) with my family. The point is, I think I need to grieve differently. I know I won't regret missing it. But I'm concerned about the reactions I may get from family members. I'm not worried about friends and extended family -- I either know they'll understand or simply don't care enough about their opinion -- but I know that my dad and my younger brother and sister will both attend, and have a tendency to judge others harshly. Should I just go with my gut and grieve in my own way? Or go (even though I'll find it the opposite of helpful) to avoid potential issues with my immediate family?",
