At that time my oncologist said that as a result of the radiation you can have cracked or broken ribs up to 2 years after. Well it was 2 years and I was pulling weeds in my garden and it happened. After many xrays and scans having a hard time finding what was causing the pain, she sent me for a PET scan that found the 2 broken ribs. I was then told that they never heal completely. This is true because when I do certain poses in yoga I can feel them pull and I have to change position to make the pain go away. Just the other day I was leaning over tying my tennis shoes and I felt another rib crack. So it seems that this condition never goes away. Unless you really, really need the radiation, I would recommend not to have it. My cancer was a stage 1 and if I had it to do over again I would not have the radiation and just take my chances. I hope this helps others. This is my first reply on any site regarding breast cancer issues.  I felt like I had to respond to this one.  I also had lumpectomy, and 35 radiation tx's in 2004 followed by  Tamoxifen and Arimidex.  I also have the rib pain even off and on to this day. (which is how I found the site here).  I think it is irresponsible to tell someone with breast cancer, even stage 1, not to have the therapy that their oncologist recommends.  I have worked for an oncologist, and am now working in hospice care.  The radiation very well might have kept your breast cancer at a stage one.  It is not something you can choose not to have and still hope to have the same outcome.  My rib pain can be an annoyance, but I don't like to think of the consequences of not doing it at all.  Breast cancer mortality has improved in leaps and bounds in the last 20 years; but because of good research and treatment.  It will continue to improve as we find out more.  Please do as your specialist recommend.",
