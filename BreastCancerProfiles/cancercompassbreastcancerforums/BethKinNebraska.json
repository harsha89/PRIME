      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy Oct. 14, did chemo and today completed the 3rd of 7 weeks of radiation.  My arm/hand has been diagnosed with lymphedema, which I started physical therapy for.  Yesterday, my doctor informed me my arm will most likely get WORSE for the next 6-12 months due to radiation.  He did offer the solution of me stopping radiation and having a mastectomy.  Kind of freaked me out since I thought I was past that decision.   My question is for those that have experience with lymphedema - does it get better?  Did it get worse even after radiation was over?  What was the timeframe of swelling going down, if it did?   I feel like I am being asked to decide between a healthy arm and major surgery vs a deformed arm and a breast.",

      "Content": "A friend of mine's Boxer, whom I have known since he was a newborn puppy and is now 6, detected my cancer.  I was visiting and he kept sticking his muzzle into my left armpit and whining.  He also became VERY agitated when I tried to leave - to the point he scratched up my car door and laid down on the ground in front of my car.  I had just been diagnosed, so I was able to figure out what he was fussing about.  After my surgery, I went to visit him.  He sniffed, licked my face, then laid down at my feet as normal.   I guess they got all the cancer out!",
