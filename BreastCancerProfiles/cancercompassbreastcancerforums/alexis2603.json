      "Content": "It is natural to be scared when you are diagnosed with breast cancer. .  BC is an overwhelming diagnosis. I was a grade 3 triple negative breast cancer with lymph node involvement and finished treatment 3 years ago and am still in remission.  I changed my diet, exercise more and meditate/relax more often.  Dont know if it helps, but I am still here!  I had my faith in God to get me through the tough times too which helped.  He holds my egg timer as I call it.  No doctor will tell me how long I have got or when I will die.   I just keep my faith and take one day at a time.  I have too much living to do now to worry about dying.  Once you start your treatment and get the cancer into remission you will start to feel much better and positive about the future.   .  ",

      "Content": "I am 3 years out of treatment for my triple negative cancer.  i was told it is very aggressive and needs to be treated aggressively. I had a couple of surgeries, 4 doses of Adriamycin and Cytoxin then 4 of Taxol.  I had to have a heart ultrasound to make sure I was up to the treatment as they wanted to give me it every two weeks which worked out fine.  The treatment was tough, but 3 years later I am still here and in remission. I hope your mother does well with her treatment.",

      "Content": "Your wife could also get a second opinion if she is not entirely satisfied with the response of her oncologyst/physician.  It is good to know the cancer is not in any major organs.   I have heard of many stage IV women living with cancer for many years.  There are so many drugs out there that we can be put on to keep the cancer at bay.    ",
