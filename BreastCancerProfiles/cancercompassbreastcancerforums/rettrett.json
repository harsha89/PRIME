    "Content": "I found this after searching for collarbone and shoulder pain being related to breast cancer.  I too had breast can 11 years agoand have had many aches and pains since, but recently I have been experiencing extreme pain on my right shoulder and collarbone.  The pain is so severe at times that even a lydodermpatch and my regular pain meds do not help.  I had not injured my shoulder and really can't remember doing anything that would have brought on this kind of pain so of course I started tquesastioning if there is any corrilation to the cancer.I do plan on going to the orthopedic to see what he belives could be the cause, but in the meantime I can't get that nagging feeling that something else is wrong out of my mind. Let me know what happens with your mom and I will send good thoughts and prayers your way  ",
