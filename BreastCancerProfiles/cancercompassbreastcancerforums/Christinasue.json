      "Content": "Hi Lisa, I am 39 & fifteen years ago my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. (survived that one) Five years ago my mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. (not doing well) She has fought long and hard to beat the ovarian cancer but unfortunately, she is in her last days. My mothers mom (my grandmother) also had breast cancer twice at age 40 and 70. My mother was tested for the BRCA 1 & 2 (cancer gene) and it came back positive for the BRCA 2.(breast/ovarian) I have always had very lumpy breast's (many surgeies for lumps,lucky me none were cancer) I really was always worried that I would come down with some form of cancer breast or ovarian. I am married and have three small boys and was so scared that I would not get to see them grow up. We have a wonderful facility in fla. (moffitt cancer center) and they have a genetic counceling area as well as well informed specialists. Last year I took the plunge and had a prophylatic bilatteral mastectomy. I have to say it was one of the toughest decisions I have ever made in my life and last year was a long hard road. I had three surgeries (tissue expansion) (implants) & (nipple reconstruction) and finally tattoos. I have to say that I feel great and my breasts look great! The most important thing for me is that I do not worry about my mamo's every 6 mos. I am now in the process of getting tested for the BRCA 1 & 2. If positive, I will take the plunge once more and have my ovaries out. (finished with children) If I test positive, my three sons have a very high chance of prostate cancer. (later in life) For me, I wanted to know if I carry the gene so I could keep on top of it, for other people they just dont want to know. I hope your mother does well and has a full recovery & lots of health. I hope this has helped you with your question? Let me know if I can help in any way. Christina in Florida",

      "Content": "Hi Caroline, I really think the swelling is normal. I had a double mastectomy last year and I was swollen for quite a long time. For me, I just did not take it easy (three young sons) and I found that the more I did, the more I was swollen. Tylenol helps and I used ice packs (the kind you buy at a pharmacy and you can use hot or cold-made out of rubber w/screw on lid ) I used crushed ice and really kept the ice on 24 seven for many weeks and that really helped me more than anything. If you are not sure about the swelling, by all means go see the doctor to ease your fears. Take care! Christina",
