I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!! I was given arimidex post lumpectomy and after 3 weeks developed trigger finger, muscle weakness, joint pain and constant nausea.  Called my Dr. and told him I couldn't take it anymore and he said ok. He advised me that arimidex only decreases your recurrence rate by 5% anyway and you have to weigh your quality of life against that 5%.  You also need to be aware that some of the damage arimidex cuuses while you take it can be permanent even after you stop taking it.  If you have over a Stage 1 though give it more thought.",
