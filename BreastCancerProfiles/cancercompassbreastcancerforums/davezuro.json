      "Content": "Lunasin DOES NOT contain any soy.  That info was mentioned several times by Dr. Galvez.  Here's his response: There have been requests to repost my personal view and the link to an article on the safety of soy ... Several people have asked for my own view on whether soy is safe or not. Here's my response as a scientist: There is a fundamental difference between the training of physicians and scientists. Physicians are trained to be decisive, even in the face of incomplete information. Scientists are trained to be skeptical, even in the face of (apparently) overwhelming data. To drive home this point, let me use as an example the effect of soy consumption on breast cancer. In the early 2000s, Dr. William Helferich, a nutrition scientist at the University of Illinois, published a series of papers on the effect of genistein, a phytoestrogen found in soy, on promoting the growth of human breast cancer cells in mice (whose ovaries where removed to get rid of endogenous estrogen). His research was sensationalized by the media, and to this day, has been used by anti-soy proponents as an example of the \"dangers of soy\" and by physicians to recommend to their patients NOT to consume soy. Dr. Helferich, being a scientist, knows that the relationship between soy and breast cancer is much more complex than what his initial research has suggested. He did more research and in 2010 published with other scientists a review article on this subject: Is soy consumption good or bad to the breast? (you can read the whole article in link). Portion of their abstract states, \"Results suggest that women consuming moderate amounts of soy throughout their life have lower breast cancer risk than women who do not consume soy .... Findings obtained in 2 recent human studies show that a moderate consumption of diet containing this isoflavone (genistein), does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence in Western women, and Asian breast cancer survivors exhibit better prognosis\". And in direct correlation with my work on lunasin, they further conclude, \"We propose that the reduction in (breast cancer) risk involves epigenetic changes that result in alterations in the expression of genes that regulate mammary epithelial cell fate, i.e. cell proliferation and differentiation\". http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long",
