    "Content": "I was searching out some info on a drug that was prescribed and as I was searching I found this page. I read your message and just want to encourage in anyway I can. Let me say that \"This too shall pass\", and you will make it through this. I was diagnosed 41/2 years ago. Went through the surgery of a lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation and all went well, considering. In November there was another tumor found. After a double mastectomy, I am again on the road with the rest of my Survivor Sister's. My encouragement to you is hold your head up high and FIGHT! Don't give in to the disease. Attack that disease with fighting back and know that you will win that fight. Attitude is the most important to your health. Be strong for yourself as you were for your son. You can do it!Â ",
