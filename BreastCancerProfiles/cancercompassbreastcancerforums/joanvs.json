    "Content": "Hi, I took Arimidex for eight months before having a lumpectomy 5/9/12.  My surgeon told me my tumor was on the edge of acceptable lumpectomy and mastectomy. I definitely did not want a mastectomy; my tumor was very low Oncotype Dx Score, and nonaggressive.  I learned through an MRI six months after starting Arimidex that the tumor had shrunk from 35 mm to 18 mm, and went ahead and scheduled surgery.  It is worth it, if you have the mental stamina to wait for surgery.  But if you don't care if you have mastectomy or lumpectomy, then probably it isn't worth waiting and trying to shrink the tumor.  Using Arimidex to shrink estrogen-positive tumors is apparently common in Europe..women wait up to 18 months to do surgery using it to shrink tumor.  I hope it will become as common in America...we all need to keep panic at bay when we are diagnosed, and be patient and steady!  Best of Luck to you, Janene74! ",
