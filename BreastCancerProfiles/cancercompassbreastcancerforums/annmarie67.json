    "Content": "Hi, I am a newbie! 49 yo, just moved back to States after 16 yrs in Grand Cayman, diagnosed last week with DCIS and IDC Stage 1 grade 1. I dont remember all the other test results except that the tumor is estrogen driven. It's all pretty overwhelming! AND I am nervous of course.... Met yesterday with my medical team including genetics counselor. Breast surgeon says my tumor is 7mm and VERY well behaved, best case scenario she says, not life threatening at all. Going to do lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy AND breast reduction which i am SUPERRRRR happy about. Going from G cup to C cup. :) QUESTIONS: **Anyone had breast reduction as well as lumpectomy? **Is there a lot of pain afterwards? **What type of bra helped you? I have no idea what size to buy since I will not be the size I am now (SO thankful for this!). **How long were you off work (I sit at a desk all day on computer)? **Will I need serious help around the house? (Husband is an amzing guy who already cleans and does the laundry LOL). But have 3 kids (8, 12 and 14) and I cook ALOT.Â  Thank you so much. Never imagined moving to South Dakota and being diagnosed with breast cancer!",
