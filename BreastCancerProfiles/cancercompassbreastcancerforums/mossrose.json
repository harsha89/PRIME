      "Content": "36 years ago I had breast cancer at the age of 32. I have always been atune to my body for that reason Now, I have had a sore nipple and breast discomfort for some time. No discharge, but a rash at times with a scaly look. No lumps, so I am told there is nothing wrong. My gut says otherwise.  There is a strong genetic link to breast cancer in the family. Has anyone else every experienced this?",

(John Wayne)   I saw a doctor yesterday and have a test scheduled for Tuesday. I thank God for my NEW PCP. She is smart, understanding and just plain fantastic. A lot has changed since I first started complaining about breast pain in October 1966. Diagnostic equipment, surgical approaches, chemo, radiation methods, etc. Most of all peoples attitudes. I think in some ways the emotional trauma was the worse back then in what I call the \"dark ages\" of breast cancer. Thank God for Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Rockefeller taking it into the sunlight of real life. My cousin died at the age of 26 years with breast cancer. I was 11 years old at the time. An age you listen \"behind doors\" to every thing going on. I understood what was going on with her parents and children. I can not remember how it made me feel but I do remember what went on with her death. Yet everything was whispered about not talked about. Like it was some form of plague or something to be ashamed of. Then that was the attitude about most cancer. When I first went to the doctor in 1966, he did everything that was right in medicine at that time. Later after I married a man in the military, we moved and I saw other doctors. Again, nothing. I was told everything from muscle strain to \"you are just nervous because your husband is gone (Vietnam War) and you are not having a routine sex life.\" Oh, yes! I found the tumor myself on New Years Day, 1973. My husband was flying missions over Hanoi. The next day, I lucked out and saw a physician whose father had just had surgery, two weeks prior,  for breast cancer. The new surgeon who showed up about two days after that was brand new and the son and grandson of surgeons. He got on top of the situation and here I am today; against all odds for the time I lived in. And what a life it has been! I have been blessed with wonderful times and heartbreaking experiences. I have often thought about people who have their lives all planned out. I think maybe God gave me the best plan of all. He has given me a  life and experiences I could have never dreamed of.  I now try to always find the green in the sunset. It is always there, you just have to hunt for it. Now if Ike will just get out of my state, I think all would be right with the world.",
