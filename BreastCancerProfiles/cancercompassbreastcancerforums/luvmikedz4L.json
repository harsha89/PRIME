    "Content": "Hello, I'm new to the forum and I was wondering if I could get some advice. I noticed that for the past two months I've had an urine odor under my breast. The only thing that gets rid of the odor for a bit is Selsun Blue Medicated Shampoo w/menthol. I've tried to research it but did not come up with anything promising. My research showed it could be some kind of kidney cancer or breast cancer. Really appreciate the help in knowing what it could be. Thank you!",
