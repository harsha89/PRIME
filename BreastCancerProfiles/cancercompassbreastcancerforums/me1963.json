      "Content": "I have been on Femara for almost 3 years. The hot flashes eased. The bone pain did to. I also worry about the long term effects. However I think the tomoxifin is more dangerous. My sister took it for only one year, six years later she had a spot of cancer in her uterus. Her Dr. told her it was from the tomoxifin. My hair is very thin. I used to have very thick hair. The Femara does that. I am also 190 pounds, thanks to Femara. My Dr says I have to take it for the full 5 years. I think most of my problems are from the chemo and the CT scans they keep giving me looking to something to treat. The radiation from the tests are probably doing more harm than the Femara.",
