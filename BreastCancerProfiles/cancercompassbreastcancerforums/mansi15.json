So....I was pretty well toast, i've been told by 7 different oncologists to get my affairs in order.  First I was told Oct 'll, then March '12, then maybe I could last til the end of 2012.   Well, it's now May, 2013, all tumor markers are normal, some even below normal, bloodwork, stats all perfect, no cancer can be detected on scans other than a small reduced spot in the spine....I am still working on that with Cesium Chloride.  I've read over 50 books, some very detailed and needed medical help to decipher, but Suzanne Sommers book : KNOCKOUT will give you more info that most I can suggest.   I've read and found that the way American Cancer and NCI make up stats is enough to make one gag.   They'll put a patient on a 6 mo chemo and study program.  If the patient dies before the 6 mo's, they aren't counted because they didn't complete the study....if they die even a day after the 6 mo study, they aren't counted because they arent in the study program....how does that make sense?   Many of the minerals and nutrients are poo'd by physicians and pharmacies because they cannot make money on them, as in the book, GENOCIDE - The Cancer Coverup, a statement reads:   Well, we know that works, but we can't figure out how, so we won't approve it.  Who cares if you can't figure it out, it saves lives.   For me, I'm done with doc's.  I've gone alternative, had great results, feel great, do anything I want, never been sick a day, go for ckups 6 mo intervals, still no cancer invasion.   Why?  I have no idea, but i've always been one to follow my own path, I've had great results with the research i've done, first is diet, cancer is Anaerobic, it is not a virus or bacteria.   Some doc's evidently don't know this.   So....diet is the only thing that will cure this ill...you have to repair your immune system and let your body heal itself.  It will.  Then add DIM - Indole 3/Carbinol, Curcumin/Tumeric, B17 Laetrile, eat few Apricot pitts daily, the cyanide is not human body toxic but will go after the cancer cells.   Keep your body PH as low as possible, apoptsis will set in and kill the cancer cells.   Also, ck out the Kelmun Protocol, get on ASAP, that was what I did that cleaned out all my cancer in the soft tissue.   I am only telling you what I did, also know two other people who did this and they too are having great results...they both have leukemia and their white cell count is dropping like a rock.   You have to avoid sugar, milk, soy, cancer feeds off these, get on whole foods, keep your ph low and you will see positive results.  I've never had any chemo or radiation.  My oncologist is dumbfounded, but he agrees that whatever i'm doing, keep at it.  I do.  Best of luck to you.    Hello Spring flowers: Can you pleae advise of all alternative treatments, diet plans, supplements you used? I am trying to help my mom.",
