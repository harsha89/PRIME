    "Content": "I agree wholeheartedly with Angela on her summation of the link. This is infact a very real but not often discussed connection. I am the daughter of a loving wonderful mom who lost her life to Ovarian cancer at the age of 47. I never knew the connection....was always concerned about getting ovarian like her...and ended up with breast cancer at age 37. I am thankful to be in remission for almost 3 years, and recently had my ovaries removed. I did test positive for the BRCA 1 gene mutation. I am so grateful for the info and feel good about the decision to have my ovaries removed. They were perfectly heatlthy, but the call telling me that there was absolutely no sign of cancer when they were biopsied after the surgery was worth every thing to me! Best of luck to you!",
