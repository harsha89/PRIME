Thank you and all the others for their kind message. I have assumed the risk of stopping Arimidex after taking it for about 3 years. My oncologist gave me a funny reply: I don't know what happens if you stop or if you continue taking Arimidex. I am still cancer free, but I keep everything under control. The rest is God's will.   I am so sorry to hear about your mom.  As I posted on this website either here or on another thread, a radiologist I saw told me that some women do everything they are told to do, to a \"t\" and still get cancer again, while others do the absolute minimum & never have it again.  It really is a crap shoot.  I had a double mastectomy w/out reconstruction {oddly, I don't really miss my boobs at all! :-)!} and I do worry about how they will detect if cancer returns, since I'll never have another mammogram.  I see my oncologist about every 4 months and she orders blood work.  She told me one way they detect is if the blood work comes back and something looks abnormal.  Unfortunately for all of us, by the time that is noticed, the stage can be pretty severe.  It's just all such a bitch!  I have a support group of women who have been through it, and it is very helpful. We must support one another as best we can.  No one else knows what we have gone through and the concerns/fears we live w/every day.   Right now I'm suffering from severe fatigue and lethargy, which translates to \"depressed\" for me, even though I'm on /2/ antidepressants!  I have also gained almost 30 lbs. what with the antidepressants and the Aromatase Inhibitor ... and I'm not someone who can afford to be gaining weight.  I want to go off of these drugs and try this new Saffron extract that's supposed to be helpful for weight loss & mood.  Has anyone tried it?  If so, did it help?  I'm also waiting to get 3 books on the Glycemic Index eating lifestyle to see if that can help with my getting my weight down and off some of these meds; but, with the A.I., it's really a challenge.  God bless all of you ... all of us Sisters! ",

Now I am battling serious fatigue and depression and deciding the arimidex may be the culprit.  I took it upon myself to stop the medication for a trial period to see if things improve.  Today is just day 2 of not taking this medication so I've not seen any improvements yet.  But it is encouraging to know that I'm not imagining my symptoms.  I am a very active 57 year old and this fatigue is so out of charactor for me.  I can barely function at this point but have to muscle through.Please hang in there! Two days is not enough time to undue the side effects; give yourself at least 6 MONTHS!! If you aren't improving, go to an alternative health practitioner to help with the pain & fatigue. (Acupuncturist, Chinese medicine, etc.). I have had fibromyalgia for years (unrelated to my breast cancer), so I know how debilitating chronic pain can be! Western medicine has very little to offer for chronic pain but more of these damn drugs! Our doctors have, sadly, become \"pushers\" for the pharmaceutical companies. Yes, there has been some \"success\" with these drugs, but we have to have quality of life, not be fighting the side effects all the time! Some side effects of some drugs outweigh the benefits, IMO. I had double-breast cancer (right breast Stage 1; Left Stage 2; Grade 2). I had a double mastectomy, chemo, & didn't have to have radiation. The radiologist I saw (loved her!) said it's all pretty much a crap shoot anyway; she has patients who do the absolute least that recommended...i.e., lumpectomy only, no treatment(s), and their cancer never returns. Others do exactly everything to a \"T\" and die anyway. We're all going to die someday from something, so quality of life is imperative! I tried all 3 Aromatase Inhibitors and, lastly, Tamoxifen, all with side effects I couldn't manage, and all exacerbating, one way or another, my fibromyalgia symptoms and/or giving me new unpleasant symptoms. I'd say that, on and off, I was probably on one or the other of these drugs a total of under 2 years. I'd go off, wait a while, feel better, go on another one, etc., etc. finally I got a new, young, female doctor who basically said nothing was going to change so for me to just consider that portion of my treatment finished. I was very happy! My hubby & I said from the outset that we would make our decision(s) as the need arose based on what we knew at that time, move forward, and never look back in regret. If cancer comes back, that's what I'll do at that time. Though my health is far from perfect because of the fibromyalgia, I definitely felt better being off those other oral cancer meds. You are not alone! Give yourself some time to heal! Best of luck to you!",

If the cancer comes back he has no way in predicting how bad or what stage even.  The thing is we don't know that Armidex does avoid cancer at all costs. Women who take the drug faithfully still develop METS.  In fact many  die  who develop  a recurrence .I could give you several examples of this very issue of women I have known who have recently died from METS. who took not only Arimidex but the others in hoping it would work its magic instead of crippling pain. I did not say ALL women die I said MANY I also said I could give you examples.

If it works  then  thats the whole point.  I am simply stating  sometimes the drug does not have the same effect on everyone. One size does not fit all circumstances. Hi, all.  I've only been on this site a few times, but saw this thread & was interested in hearing what everyone had to say about the AI.  I had double breast cancer, Stage 1 & 2; double mastectomy June 29, 2011, chemo, no need for radiation because of a number of reasons.  Last chemo was 12/23/11.  Started on AI Feb. 20, 2012 & am having a tough time; all of the classic \"menopause\" symptoms in double time!  Was put on antideprssant Celexa just this past Friday & hope it helps with the depression.  Depression from symptoms of bad pain, mood swings, sweats, etc.  Here's what I was told by a really cool, young, female radiologist re breast cancer treatment:  It's essentially all a crap shoot.  She sees women who do nothing but the absolute minimum when more is recommended & they never have another problem, while other women do everything recommended & still get a return of breast cancer.  BUT, as this doctor said to me, \"Yes, it's a crap shoot; but, with modern diagnostics, medicines, treatments, etc., you at least have a loaded pair of dice to put up against The House!\"  And researchers are improving on all of this all the time, so who knows what new treatments/medications there may be in the future if I am unfortunate to have it return, even after doing everything that was recommended to me.  Still, there's no denying it; the whole thing is a real Bitch!  Bless you one and all.",

The doctor is an endocrinologist, who reads a lot about new discoveries. Lethargy, fatigue and muscular pains are the results of the disease itself and Arimidex. What do you do for yourself when you are in good moments? Adriana I used to be a singer, so I listen to the music I either used to sing or would love to be able to sing again.  My vocal cords got thrashed over the last 20 years because of a chronic cough that seemed to come on hand-in-hand with the FMS.  I've always been a very social person, and that seems to be a part of my past, too.  Hubby & I moved 50 miles away from my cohorts'n'galpals 2 years ago so I could be closer to my 90 year old mom.  He has to commute daily between here and there, and it takes him hours a day.  So, I'm alone alot.  We did get a darling little dog after I finished up my chemo; but, now I feel like a \"bad mom\" since I feel too low and lethargic to take her out for walks ... poor little dog.  I know I have to take care of my own emotional needs as far as socialization, connecting with my new community, etc., but that's the problem with depression ... doing so takes a type of energy that has been sapped from me. I was doing so unbelievably well, too.  I can't help but wonder if some of this depression is a delayed reaction to all I went through with the move out here, subsequent diagnosis, surgery, treatment, etc.  I really held up well and buckled down and soldiered through it, rarely giving much thought to how I \"felt\" about it; I didn't have time to feel much once I got over the initial fear of the diagnosis; I had to do what needed to be done to \"get well.\"  Well, I have been declared a \"breast cancer survivor\" ... but I'm not sure what that means.  Even when I heard them tell me this, I knew I should have felt some sort of joy in my heart, a spirit lifted.  I just smiled and rather weakly said, \"Yea.\"  I did likewise when I told my family and friends; I think they felt more actual joy in the cancer-free declaration than I did.  Fortunately, part of my cancer team includes a good psychologist who I'll see Sept. 27th.  And a psychiatrist I'll see Oct. 2nd.  Maybe they can give me some pointers on how to weather this particular storm.  I'm also going to talk w/them about an endocrinologist.  I don't know if Kaiser will let me go see one, but perhaps if I threaten to go off the A.I. altogether, they will.  Thanks again Adriana for you support and information!  CYD",

Some minor hot flashes, & I did have to go off my anti-depressant Wellbutrin & switch to Lexapro, which, after a rocky start, seems to be doing okay. A word to the wise: I, too, was tempted to use something \"natural\" for the hot flashes (such as Black Cohosh, soy supplements, or a \"bio-identical\"), but if your breast cancer was \"Hormone Receptive Positive\", you should not use these types of products. Even though they are \"natural\", they still provide you with estrogen, which is what feeds our cancer.",

      "Content": "Fortunately, I had a hysterectomy at age 38 (I'm now 65); but I do have 1 ovary, & the oncologist did tell me he wants me to have regular GYN appointments. I do agree that every available treatment, be it traditional or \"alternative\" comes with side effects & risks, & ultimately we are the ones who have the final choice. If I develop problems with the Tamoxifen, I'll probably just stop all and any \"after treatment\" medications & take my chances. I had a radiologist tell me it's basically all a crap shoot anyway. She said some patients do every single recommended treatment & still end up having a recurrence, while others do the minimum (usually lumpectomy) & walk away & never have another recurrence. I feel I need to make my decision based on the info available to me at that time & not second guess myself. If I find more or different info after that, I can make a new decision. I couldn't tolerate the physical pain of taking an A.I., especially on top of my fibromyalgia. So I hope things keep going well with the Tamoxifen.",

I was diagnosed in oct. 07. stage 3. her-2 positive. had 4 rounds of chemo. bracatherapt. surgery and six weeks of radiation. also a year of herceptin. now i have been on arimidex for 4 years. i too have had great mucsle and joint pain. of course always wondering if it is back. my blood work and mamos have been fine. my biggest complaint is after about 2 years of taking it i now am so hot at night when i sleep. even having the window open in winter. i am now on zometa every 6 months because the arimidex can cause osteoporosis. anyway . i am still cancer free have another check up comming in oct. hang in there  i know it is umcomfortable. i don't like it either. hoepfully we can get thru this together. Hang in there, Vickymae.  I have a big, soft bath sheet that I use for one thing only ... put it over my sheet on the nights I start sweating; it really helps.  I'd like to try a pair of these p.j.s that are supposedly designed to wick away sweat & keep you dry & comfortable, but they are really expensive!  Another thing I've done is use an ACE gel pack that I keep in fridge & then put between the two pillows I sleep with (or directly on mattress when I'm only using one.)  I usually wear a thin pair of cotton gloves because of a rash I have (unrelated to A.I.), so I can put my hands on the gel pack to cool myself down & flip my pillow when it gets too hot (from my head sweats, which are awful!) & get the cool side of the pillow for a little while.  Even my husband, who is a \"hot sleeper\", has used it & agrees it can be very helpful.",
