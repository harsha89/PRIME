Because they cause a lot of nerve damage during surgery and now the nerves ''wake up'' so to speak. It could also be the scar that is sensitive now due to the radiation. My thoughts..",

The side effects are not worth it and you cannot go by the stats because they are not accurate. Its absolute poisen to your body and Im sorry that I have considered this route. I was bullied into thinking it was my only option. It is not. ",

My sister had breast cancer 10 years ago. Last year it came back and now in her bones, stomach and intestines. She can't eat solid food because the food can't be digested. She has nausea and vomiting. Help!                               Suzy Reoccurance seems common although the oncologists dont like to say much about it - infact I dont care for their stats. I had 4 months of chemo only for the cancer to come back - 2 months later.....in the same breast, same spot (after having a mastectomy). The doctors tell me they may not have removed all the tissue and cells escaped..... I am now having radiation. The thing that makes me so mad is that the chemo and radiation can cause other cancers. So you fighting a devil with another devil. And I truly believe now that cancer is not cureable, however, containable. Like in your sisters case, she contained it for 10 years..... now its come back with a vengeance. I pray that there is still a treatment plan available to her and that she makes the wise choices. God Bless her! ",
