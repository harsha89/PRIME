      "Content": "So I'm reaching out to get a few opinions, as I know everyone I different. About two years ago my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer after she went in for a MRI for back pain. Almost exactly a year ago I moved back to her to help her around the house, medically and financially (that was a huge adjustment after having my own family{divorced a few years before I moved back} and after retiring from the Navy). Everything was going as well as it could be for her diagnosis, she had to have a few back surgeries to repair her spine where the cancer and radiation had deteriorated the bone, but that has been about the worst part so far. Her cancer is hormone receptive so only taking the hormone medication to fight the cancer, no chemo, and no mascectomy since it has already metasizied and the doctors didn't want to cause any more stress on her body. Well shortly after moving down her I started dating an awesome woman...serious relationship, not just some fling...., hopefully my future wife if she decides she wants to put up with me, everything has been great.....relationship wise, moms doing pretty well and then here comes September. My girlfriend was diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer, stage 2(an extremely large lump-7cm which is pretty scary), and then my moms last scans weren't that good, all her counts were almost back up to original diagnosis-86 I believe when they had gotten down to 24, and then two weeks later they found another spot on her spine that is active and starting radiation again this Friday. Oh and my GF starts her first chemo session tomorrow morning, Thursday. At this point I am completely stressed out of my mind. They both know it is hard for me and feel bad, but I feel like I have to be there, trying to pick up their spirits, making them laugh etc. Now here comes my first concern, I don't want them to feel like I am not worried or care about their situation, which this honestly is the slightest issue for me. I believe they both know how much I care and would do anything to help. Now where I am really searching for opinions is on how much to let them know, if any, how scared, angry, sad, etc I am about all of this. I'm lost on which way I should lean. One side of me says to keep it in, keep trying to make them happy, laughing, smiling and all that, but honestly I am afraid I'm just going to explode one day, not on them, but just completely break down, I already catch my self tearing up randomly driving down the road or sitting on the back porch, but I feel like taking this emotional brunt of it should be the least I can do seeing as I know they are going thru a physical and mental battle. Or should I let them know all these feelings? But the last thing I want them to do is to worry about me and how I am doing/holding up. My girlfriend has already said she feels guilty about her diagnosis since I was already dealing with my mom which I think is ridiculous. Obviously not her fault...so when I think about it I feel that I should kinda protect them from my struggle that I have and focus on themselves. So if anyone can chip in, let me know what y'all did with your family members/partners. How much you did or didn't tell them, I know everyone's different but possibly what someone who was diagnosed has told you on how they are feeling or concerns they might have for their caregivers etc I appreciate it and hope everyone can make the best of their day(or night)",
