    "Content": "I have been on Aromasin since October 2010 (breast cancer surgery in September followed by 35 radiation treatments). At 59, I'm a 10-veteran of rheumatoid arthritis, so I was already taking drugs that would help my joint pain. However, once I began taking Aromasin, my joint pain increased substantially. My rheumatologist added Mobic to my regular medications and it has helped quite a bit. I have gained about 12 pounds and am having hot flashes & insomnia. I have often wondered if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, but will continue the treatment. My oncologist wants me to take a shot of zometa in the summer, but my rheumatologist disagrees and says my bone density is not too low currently. We'll see how this goes...I don't want to take any unnecessary treatment, especially one that has such serious side effects.",
