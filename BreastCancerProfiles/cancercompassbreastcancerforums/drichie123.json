Had the masectomy, TAC chemo, and 6 weeks of radiation. It was found in my sternum and breast area 3-06. Inoperable and did 12 treatments of chemo -Gemzar and Taxotre along with 6 more weeks of radiation. Finished radiation in October, had a CT to find out the cancer has spread into the lungs and liver. I have been told it is aggresive because the lesions are innumerable and resistant to the chemo I just completed. Now I have Completed 2 weeks of Xyloda pill form of chemo.1500mg 2 times a day. I need to know what is in store for me. Please anyone who has been through this let me know what to expect. I have an 8 year old whom I am trying to prepare about death. Pain was something I did not think about and I am now questioning, quality of life issues. Most Sincere.Bette Bette, If you receive this message please let me know!

We just found out yesterday that it spread to her lungs, liver and bones pretty much the same as you described! How are you doing now and how is the treatments doing? You sound very similar to Shauna as she has a 3 year old and a 9 year old and trying to deal with it!",
