      "Content": "Kathi, I have had success using MGN-3 as part of a comprehensive nutritional treatment plan. Is it the MGN-3, the macrobiotic diet, the Hoxsey or Essiac or other herbal tratment that results in improvement? Don't know. Do know that cleaning out toxins, eating a whole food diet, and supporting the immune system with medicianl mushrooms and herbs helps. Stress is a major toxin that needs addressed also. So mental and spiritual parameters should also be included. Use nutritional treatments in conjunction with conventional treatment methods which assist in debulking the tumor mass(es). But simply debulking the tumor without addressing the underlying causes generally will not induce the body to heal itself. That is what nutrition, emotion and spirit are good for.",
