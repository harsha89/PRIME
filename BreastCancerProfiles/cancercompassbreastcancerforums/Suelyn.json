    "Content": "I was diagnosed 7 years ago with Stage 2B invasive ductal carcinoma. I was also given the choice of lumpectomy v. mastectomy. I chose mastectomy because I was only 45 years old then and I wanted to do the most aggressive treatment I could. It turned out to be the best decision because when they did the surgery, I had another spot of cancer below the original lump. My surgeon said that if I had just had the lumpectomy, he would have had to go back and do a mastectomy anyway. I also had 6 months of chemo and 5 weeks of radiation. I had 6 positive lymph nodes out of the 13. Then I did 5 years of tamoxifin and I have been on femara for 2 years. I guess I am lucky because I have tolerated all of the treatments fairly well. I would definitely choose mastectomy over lumpectomy if given the choice again. It is a very hard decision...go with your gut feeling.",
