    "Content": "I have two and half more years of femara to go.  Had most side effects in the beginning but kept on with it and seem to be able to ignore most now.I do take an added protein drink everyday and supplements, eat lots of veggies and fruit.  Just a constant reminder to stay with it. Anyway my question here is if I can't use a topical estrogen cream what do women use to make intimate relations more comfortable with my boyfriend.  I've gone on line and researched this with no good news.want to know if any of you out there in their late 50's or 60's experience the same and what do you do. Thanks DaisyR",
