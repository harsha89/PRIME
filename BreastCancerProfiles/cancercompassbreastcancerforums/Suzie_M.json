      "Content": "One other thing: look for symmetry. As I said, I had lumpy breasts forever and I learned to look for lumps in the same place in the other breast. If you find symmetrical lumps, then it is probably nothing to worry about. So if you find a lump (and it does NOT have to be hard and pea sized to be cancerous) on the outside of your right breast, see if you can find one on the outside of your left breast. Also, regular self exams will help you recognize a new lump that might need checking out.",

      "Content": "You might be able to figure out if the Femara is causing your pain by stopping for a shorter period of time. I've had a lot of unpleasant side effects on AI drugs since pretty nearly day 1 (I've been on them 2 years now) and twice I decided I needed a break from the hot flashes and the pain. Both times I stopped for just a week and I felt somewhat better while off the meds, but also had it a little easier for a while after I resumed taking them. I don't think anyone knows how long we can stop without endangering our health but I doubt that a week could make that much difference and it may be that a month is not too long either. Most breast cancer is very slow growing, particularly the breast cancers that are usually found in women who are middle aged or older. I hope you get some relief. We've all suffered enough!",

I don't know what I thought they would do, but I assumed they would leave the nipple. But my surgeon told me that the nipple is just another area of breast tissue and it and the areola had to go. I had reconstructive surgery with a great plastic surgeon and he created a new \"nipple\" out of my own skin and tattoed it a darker color, then tattoed an areola around it.

It actually led to my having a biopsy in my early 30s and beginning to have periodic mammograms around that time. And that's how my cancer was found because it is of a type that does not form distinct lumps (ironic, really). I'm just pointing out that these things can have unintended benefits--I don't know that I would have been as faithful with the mammograms if it hadn't been for that original lump. But what you are asking is whether you should trust your doctors or your own instincts and I think there are a LOT of women on these boards who will tell you to go with your instincts. It may be nothing but if you feel like something is not quite right you need to persist until someone takes you seriously rather than dismissing your concerns. I suggest making an appointment with one of your doctors when you know the lumps will be swollen. If you still can't get them to check it out, go to a different doctor. If it is nothing to worry about (and it well may be) then you will have peace of mind and that is well worth the hassle. Good luck!",

I had an endometrial biopsy--is that the same thing basically?--and it was really painful, although mercifully brief. I wouldn't want to do it again, either. I was really interested to hear about your experience with Aromasin versus Femara. I have been on all three and I am currently on Aromasin and I think the pain is a good bit worse.

      "Content": "Well, the cost is definitely an issue. I do have insurance that covers reconstruction, but I also have a high deductible and high out of pocket payments, so I have spent thousands on my medical bills since I was diagnosed three years ago. I pretty much wiped out my life savings. I still owe thousands on credit cards. My suggestion is if you want to get reconstruction find a plastic surgeon that will work with you. There are some who do a lot of work with breast cancer patients and might be willing to help you minimize the expense. The thing about reconstruction is that it does take place over time. They put a tissue expander in first--they put mine in at the same time I had the mastectomy, and that had to have saved some money because it wasn't two different operations. Then you have periodic visits to the plastic surgeon who adds liquid to the expander and you sort of space those out. Maybe you can find someone who will charge you a lower fee for those. The final surgery, though, is another real surgery with anesthesia and all. That's when they put in the final implant and get you all shaped up. As I said, I would try and find someone who will work with you. None of it is cheap, and it is obscene that we should have to pay so much or that we should be denied these procedures because we can't afford it. I'm so tired of being broke!",

      "Content": "I have been on all three of the AI drugs: began with Arimidex, switched to Femara, now on Aromasin. Side effects are the same with all of them. I had horrible pains in my joints, in my arms and legs, at night sometimes I'd have hip pain, and I have extreme hot flashes--both number (40-50 a day at one point) and intensity (dripping sweat, feeling like I was on fire). I've twice skipped my AI drugs for a week just because I needed some relief and the side effects did improve. (So if they ever let us stop taking these drugs maybe the side effects will go away forever!) My onco very much does NOT want me to stop the medicine so she has encourage me to do whatever I need to to control the side effects. So she has me on Percodan 5mg as often as I need it. And truthfully, I have found that I keep the pain well under control with 1 Percodan in the morning and 1 around lunch time. Late evening I usually have milder pain and I take a couple of Darvocet. (I don't know why your doc said it is a bad drug. If you don't take too many I can't see why it would hurt.) I was worried about addiction, etc. but I have never felt the need to take more pills than I need to control the pain, which my onco says means I am not addicted. One other thing that has really helped--exercise. As hard and painful as it is, the more you move, the better you feel. When I can get out and take a long walk my aches and pains are not nearly as bad. We have to hang in there for the long haul, so don't worry about the pain meds. Take the pills, take long walks, do whatever you need to do to feel better.",
