What is shameful about getting cancer? , cancer is a equal oppurtunity disease it does not recognize any scio economic boundaries at all .  I think the reason alot of people turn away is cuz they know in the deepest part of them that this could just as easily have happened to them .  Just be honest and give your Mom a safe place to talk  about anything , tell her your afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing ,talk about it with her , good luck ,",

I think Dave should lose the bit about trying to demonize the md's .  Explaining how they don't profit from his product and how they would see us all dead dead dead before they would recommand we try something that does not show a fiscal profit for them.  I think he actually loses credibility by using this tatic.I believe in my heart that my oncologist wants me to live and she is not above recommending anything that she thinks will get us there,  there may be something to this product , so many people have tried to sell me so many things scince I was diagosed  in april .",

      "Content": "well the idea if you  have a metastatic breast cancer is to treat with chemo to shrink the cancer as much as possible and then cut it out .  the liver is problematic , my cancer was at stage three , large but no meatastisis that they could see anyway . so  they are shrinking it to safe margins and then cutting it out .  the only advice I can think to give that might help is to say no matter how informed you are you are not a doctor of oncology.  At some point you are going to have to trust someone  only a fool has themselves as lawyer it is kind of he same thing , good luck , this is really tough stuff to have to deal with , I wish you well",
