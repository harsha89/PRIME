      "Content": "I am taking Cytoxan/Adriamycin/Taxotere for IDC after my double mastectomy. I have one more chemo to go! Anyway, the Taxotere gives me major leg pain and weakness for about a week. I was advised by the nurses of the other side effects of Taxotere like burning/stinging/redness/soreness of palms and soles. They suggested that I put my hands and feet on ice packs for the entire hour of the Taxotere infusion. I have done this for every chemo treatment and have NONE of those awful side effects. My nails look completely normal. Don't know if I'm just lucky but I'm sticking to my ice packs. (The theory is that it reduces circulation in your hands and feet by making them as cold as you can stand, which 'keeps away' the Taxotere as it rushes into your veins.) As soon as this med is done, I gratefully put on my warm fuzzy socks that I bring every time. Good luck!",

      "Content": "I saw your post and live in Houston also. What kind of Dr. are you and where do you practice? I was just diagnosed w/breast cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. I'm 41. My mammo last year was 'clean' per the report, but I just looked at the film and the tumor was there last year! Same size, same place, just w/o calcifications. I get body scans this week and am facing possible double mastectomy and they want me to do chemo. I don't want chemo. I am trying alot of supplements, including the flax seed/cottage cheese. I would like to talk to you (or email). How do we talk? Thanks so much.",
