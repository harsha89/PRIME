    "Content": "1999 - diagnosed with breast cancer - read My Story on Facebook - by Rose Lafontaine. I never took chemo or radiation - came very close when the 2nd tumor was found - but praise the Lord - I didn't take them. I finally found PROTOCEL in 2007 and took it for 9 months after having my 2nd tumor removed.  Then every year for once a year I take (2-month bottle) one bottle as a preventive to kill any cancer that might be growing.  I am to this date (Saturday, April 4, 2015) - Cancer FREE  :) in October this year (2015) 8 years cancer free :) - feel great and praise God for allowing me to live and share my story. Again - check out my full story on Facebook. Rose Lafontaine, Thunder Bay, Ontario Canada",
