    "Content": "Hi Tammy, My name is Jeff, age 48. I was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma stage four in 1999. Had my galbladder and left lobe of my liver removed. I declined any modern day treatments to date. The Cancer went to both of my lungs in 2001. I moved to Maine in 2000 to help out my parents for awhile, then moved to Kansas in 2002 just in time to witness the birth of my Grandson and now have witnessed the birth of a granddaughter. I have tripled my vitimins and minerals and drink Essiac Tea daily. I eat a lot of fruit and oats. I pray each night that if this is what God wants that is fine as there must be a purpose. But I also pray that my work on earth is not done as many people can use my help. I assist people with mental retardation and handicaps. Just last week my Cat Scan showed minimal grow with some tumors, some tumors did not increase in size, and some tumors actually decreased in size. So, as the others who replied to your message DON'T GIVE UP BE POSTIVE AND TAKE CONTROL. Be active, be loving, be loved, and love yourelf! Yes! things could change tomorrow but I look at tomorrow as today. It is 2004 and I'll be seeing 2005 as well! Yes I went through te emotions of shock, anger, depression. Even when they operated and opened me from bow to stern, I felt so violated! But with anti-depressant and sedative (very low dose) 100mg and 10mg respectively I am doing everything now as in 1999. Have you ever listen to Tim McGraw Country Artist? \"Live like your Dying\" is one of his songs and it really sends a message to me. God Bless You and Your Family! Go skydiving! and keep saying I know I can even though you and I both know there are no guarantees. Jeff and my supportive wife Valerie.",
