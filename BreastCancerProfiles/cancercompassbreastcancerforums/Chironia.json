      "Content": "Could the smell or lack of it be related to how much the person usually sweats? Some people have a lot more sweat glands or their sweat glands are more efficient at getting rid of toxins. In some cases strong sweat could indicate that liver and or kidney function is below par and the toxins are coming out through the skin instead. I have always had strong bitter sweat just before and at the start of menstruation which I take to be because the liver has more work flushing out the oestrogen at that time. Now I am of menopausal age and my armpit sweat is smelling really horrible and toxic but I have no way of knowing if it is for the same reasons as at menstruation or if it could be a sign of cancer. I have had chronic fatigue syndrome for over 3 decades which has slowly got worse to the point of incapacitating me and I have had toxic levels of stress over the last 3 years caused by being harassed by the welfare system. Long term ME sufferers are at a higher risk of getting non-hodgkins lymphoma or indeed any cancers due to chronic excessive oxidative stress generated by the body fighting chronic low-grade infection. Due to low energy and hypoglycaemia I can rarely cook fresh food and can't digest sandwiches so have to eat a lot of microwave food. Most recently I have been eating a lot of microwaveable rice in plastic pouches because it only takes two minutes. After many months or a year of eating that at least 3 times a week I am sensing something toxic off it, probably the xeno-oestrogens which are carcinogenic. Over the last few weeks or months I have been getting this terrible plasticky, protein-like smell from my armpits even when I haven't eaten any microwave food for days. I have no idea if the menopause alone could cause that but I get a bad feeling about it. It is definitely not a normal smell. I have been in the company of menopausal women in the midst of having a hot flush but I have never smelt anything off them. If I go to the GP and say I wonder if the smell could be a sign of cancer, he'll probably think I'm crazy. I'm in my mid-50's.",

      "Content": "A sweetish chemically smell from the breath can be caused by ketones which are produced when the body breaks down protein to convert to glucose when there is no stored glycogen to convert to glucose. This can happen with diabetes and when on a zero carb diet. Perhaps since cancer cells are greedy for glucose they can't get enough and resort to breaking down protein. Might be an idea to check for diabetes first and if that shows up negative to then get screened for cancer as well.",
