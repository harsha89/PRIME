      "Content": "Lifecoachbonnie said she was feeling like 70.  Well, I am 70 (72 actually), and I feel like 70 instead of the 45 I felt before the Big C.  Yes, joint pain, hip pain, knee pain, ankle pain, mostly right leg, with pain moving around.  One short term occurrence of trigger thumb, bone density went from mild osteopenia to severe osteoporous in one year.  Cholesterol jumped from 197 to 216.  Some weight gain.  Some rise in blood pressure.  Lumpectomy 5 years ago with radiation - no chemo.  2 1/2 months to go on meds - hooray.  3 years on Tamoxifen - just a relatively mild side effect towards the last.  Dr. switched me to Arimidex - okay for a few months before these side effects took hold.  Dr. said he would switch me to another aromatase inhibitor or back to Tamoxifen.  I told him I would tough it out.  After a month decided I didn't want to tough it out anymore but would finish the meds I had on hand, then quit four months in advance.  Nurse practitioner didn't like that and gave me 4 months samples of Aromasen.  I go from ready to quit, to sticking it out on a day-to-day basis.  I could handle it all if I was sure these side effects would reverse themselves.  I want to feel 45 again.  My stepdaughter says \"are you sure it's not just old age?\"  Well, maybe, but there are a lot of people my age who don't feel all these aches, plus reading this mail, I see a lot of people younger than I are going through all the same things.  I have just started taking Magnesium and Potassium again, and feel a little less achy.  Also taking a herbal supplement \"Essiac\" since June.",
