    "Content": "i finished treatment for breast cancer a year and a half ago. Six months ago I started having pain in my back. In the last 4 months I have had severe pain in my left upper ribs reaching up to my armpit and itches. The doctor is treating me for pancreatitis but I'm worried it may be cancer again. Any thoughts or info and recommendations would be appreciated",
