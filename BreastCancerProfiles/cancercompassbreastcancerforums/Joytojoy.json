      "Content": "Thanks lots all of you for the strengthening lines read- makes such a difference getting advice from the experienced, whether the patient or the 'supports'! Any of you experienced combinations of ill health in your parents/mothers? Mine has had breast cancer and is on medicaiton without chemo and is now showing strong signs of dementia, repeating what she is saying and even asking. Her although incorrect answers have such a 'firm, confident tone' about them that if the listener is unaware, could easily pass off as the 'truth' I've read the side effects of her present drug Nolvadex 10mg 1 X  1  (twice a day) which although far less than Aromasin, is also according to the Dr, not as 'effective' in sustaining the spread of cancer. Best she's in less discomfort even if it's for a lesser length of a life, wouldn't you say? Thanks all of you readers for your support! Great having each other for strength and guidance! Chins up!",

      "Content": "Yes Angel- your words are somewhat similar to what I am going through now with my own mother who had breast cancer surgery done in July 2014 without chemo and is now experiencing Aromasin side-effects. What seems to keep her going is a positive mood of laughter, praise, family seeking her advice and seeing them happy. Although no doubt difficult and often felt 'put on', if it's more effective, let's try hard to do this with our mothers...............together! They seem to be the only actions which we can manifest and be in control of and which would definitely be easier when communicating on this website- thankyou Cancercompass!",
