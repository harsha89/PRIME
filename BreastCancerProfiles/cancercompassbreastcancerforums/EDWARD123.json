It is 9 months since I first wrote about ONJ asking questions about how it progresses and whilst I have read a whole lot on the lawsuits and the correllation between bisphosphonates and ONJ I still can't find any case studies or hear from others with the same condition. So here I am reporting back on how I have been getting on. My jawbone continues to extrude through my gum (where back teeth had been removed from my lower left side some years before) It has got taller and longer and two holes have appeared. Inside the holes is soft squidgy tissue that bleeds quite often but oddly enough always feels better after a bleed. The holes have been the biggest problem as food debris gets into the holes and I have had several infections. I had pain from my temple to my collar bone, so much swelling in the gland beneath my jaw and in the back of my tongue that I didn't dare sleep through the night incase I asphyxiated and spent 4 days drinking through a straw, unable to chew or swallow solid food. I was in all consuming pain and had high doses of Metronidazole. I have some pain 24/7 but when it becomes infected it is incredibly painful. I keep records of any hospital/family doctor visit; what I asked , what was said, what was given etc. and I record too any problems or changes so have got some interesting news on the ONJ. What I noticed was about 10-12 days after my Zometa IV I had a growth spurt on the jawbone and extra pain too. I have stopped the Zometa (6 weeks now) and have had no growth spurt this month. I also know when an infection is beginning. Twice now the first sympton is a smell (rather than a taste) I wake up in the morning and the room seems to be filled with something like a sour/biscuit odour and within 24 hours I am in excrutiating pain, the gum deep red and swollen around the bone and the taste in my mouth is disgusting (just like a camel's). I told my family doctor this but he seemed doubtful, but I can only go on what I have observed. My Oral Max Fax surgeon has now seen 11 patients and still says I am the worst of all. I still rinse several times daily with hot salty water, I know it's not always possible to keep it up regularly but carry a little bottle of salt with me and an old aerosol lid for a cup so I can keep up the rinses when I am out. My Oral MF says salt is as good as anything, the mouthwashes made my gums sore and my teeth pink, (very pretty but not for teeth!) I am now considering something called debridement, where the surface dead bone is removed as the holes, one at each end lead to a cavity beneath the 'lid' of bone and food debris collects and I can't remove it but if and when the 'lid' is removed I am concerned about the exposed soft tissue beneath. I am also thinking of having a gum shield made so I don't hit the soft tissue with anything I eat yet can remove it to clean. I will feedback here any decisions I make. I think one of the things that concerns me most about ONJ is the drug companies' lack of response in advising patients as to how it progresses, the best course of management, yes, lots of advice on prevention but it seems once you have it you are left to get on with it. I feel incredibly angry and I am really fed up with, 'well we just don't know!' 'we will monitor!' 'it is a rare complication!' responses, it simply isn't good enough; drug companies out there ~ are you listening? Rare? Are the drug companies sure about this? And what does 'rare' mean to someone who is up all night crying with the pain, pain on top of their original bone disease. In the UK we seem to have less reported cases, this is probably due to the fact that the USA got licenced for bisphosphonates earlier than UK so our problems are just emerging. And as prescribing HRT has been reduced for osteoporosis (partly because women are more informed nowadays) and bisphosphonates have taken their place, I foresee this present 'tip of the iceberg' exploding in the coming years.
