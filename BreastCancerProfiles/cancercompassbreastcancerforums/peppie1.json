      "Content": "Hi Lassie home..... yes i will go get a mri of my underarms, now that you mention it, but now its not just the side that i had the surgery and the radiation, its now on the other side as well... which are baffling the doctors, i have so much pain in my armpits and all around my back... like a raging fire in my upper chest and a lot of constriction... its just awful awful awful.. i have had something weird going on with me since october 2011.. i have lost the complete ability to sleep,, i cannot ever ever fall asleep without a sleeping pill and it has to be Zopiclone, nothing else works... can never nap, ever... i have had burning pain behind my legs since that year and now having had breast cancer plus all  the treatments, i am so damaged its not even funny.... i am now going to see a lyme specialist as a lot of my symptoms looks like i  might have had lyme for a few years.. and now with all this its out of control.... its so hard to live like this... nothing is fun anymore..... and plus no pain meds work for me.. that neurontin i think makes it even worse... i try a few anti anxiety which seems to calm it a bit and also i have morphone, stronger then morphine,,, doesnt work much.. the burning goes away during the night though or when i lie down and as soon as i get up, its back for the whole day.   i will be going to a pain clinic in a month or so.. i sure hope that i can have some kind of mri of underneath my arms.  ",

      "Content": "|Hi Cancerkeys.... no i am done with my rads since over 2.5 months now.. the pain started getting really about about a month after i was  done.... and now its been 2.5 months  since am finished and  the pain continues to get worse and worse.. it feels like i have broken glass in that area, its so painful. i was told i had no scar tissue or very little.  But i was not well before they discovered the cancer.. some sort of nerve disorder and plus i was hardly sleeping even on sleeping pills.. so  now i am in terrible pain and feeling awful also.  I hate getting up in the morning as its another day to go thru all this pain... i was put on morphone a few days ago , it helps with the burning but still the arm feels like its not connected correctly to  my body, feels mechanical and like i said, like broken glass inside the muscles... awful feeling.",

      "Content": "i went to see a neurologist yesterday,, she did not even examine under my arm or anything... they did that nerve conductivity test in my arm and on my leg, since everything was like two years ago, she said i was fine on that part.. she is sending me for a spinal MRI.... but still 4 weeks to wait for that... its unreal how much pain i am having.. i had some throughout my whole chemo also but figured the chemo was doing that and then when i was having radiation, thought that was causing that,, well now its been over 2 months i am done with radiation, no way should i be in this kind of pain....the radiation doctor told me to put some kind of anti inflammatory cream on it. well of course that didnt work...  the morphone is hardly taking the pain away, just a bit of the burning.... i continue to use my arm as its my right arm. but the pain is over the top... i cant believe i have to live like this forever now..  i tried a tens machine on it a few weeks ago, dont know if that caused the problem...but i only did it for 2 minutes .... i wonder",

      "Content": "On Jun 08, 2013 9:37 PM muskans wrote: Hi,  My mom had a radical mastectomy on Dec. 10, 2012, and had lymph nodes removed as well. (it was a stage 3a cancer). The surgeon had said to do exerise till she gets full range of motion, which she did after the first 15 days in January. She then did not do the exercises. Her chemo subsequently began in the end of January, and was 8 sessions. In April she started exercising again. About a month ago she started experiencing tightness in the surgical area. The Last couple of weeks it has turned into an excruciating discomfort.  These are the things she is describing:  -The tightness is like an iron bra that is pulling and tightening where the mastectomy happened -The tightness has recently spread to the underarm (armpit) area -It feels like the skin is sticking and pressing against the chest wall, and the ribs. Almost as if its constricting her lungs.  -She also feels like the muscles are contracting in that area, and feels like there is a rock under the skin, and everything is a frozen block.  She is on round the clock pain killers to handle the discomfort (excrutiating discomfort not \"pain\"). She was on Percocet to manage it before, but it stopped being effective. She is now on Dilaudid.  The pain doctors at stanford have felt that it is potentially a nerve issue, and prescribed neurontin and desiprimine. The pain doctors at UCSF feel its more of a muscular issue. So she has also just recently started physical therapy.  We read in a previous post from 2009 on a forum, that some of the symptoms we are describing may be caused by scar tissue adhesions. None of the doctors have talked in depth about this aspect. But it sounds like it can definitely be that, with maybe a combination of muscles issues. We just feel so frustrated and helpless, since we arent getting any clear answers.  Though her tightness and pressure began 4 months after the surgery. Did you guys also have to take pain killers? Also after how many sessions generally should she start feeling some result of the physical therapy? We arent sure if who we have is good/the right one.  The UCSF pain doctor also recommended trigger point injections, and if that works then botox shots, to relax those muscles. Thoughts?  Her radiation just started this week as well, so she cannot undergo any procedures with injections till after it is over. We are worried, because radiation is just suppose to increase the tightness, and she is already starting in such a bad condition!  PLEASE HELP! Hi,, i just recently read your post... i had a radical mastectomy on sept 3, 2013.  and it was a 3 stage cancer also and i had 15 lympth nodes removed and 2 were positive... i didnt do my exercises like i should have done as i was so unwell and so tired because i wasnt well two years prior to all this happening, so the surgery really took a toll on me.  When i started the chemo, i started feeling like a binding around my upper chest and also like the mastectomy area was plastered and stuck to my ribs.. they told me i had no scar tissue... everything was well healed.. but it got worse and worse... i too was worried going into radiation as how could this ever get any better after being fried from the radiation.  I am now almost a year since the surgery and still the pain and the discomfort persists... extreme tightness, banding around the chest, feels like rocks under my armpits, and not just on the surgery side but on both sides at times. it feels like i am paralyzing actually, i have pain in my upper arm and have lost my range of motion of how high i can reach up my back on that side.  they cant figure out why i am in such pain and distress, i have had spinal mris and a pet scan and it shows nothing.  they now figure i have severe nerve damage and will it get better or continue to go downhill, no one knows.  i too am in complete distress and its hard when you dont even know why this is happening.. and why i have it to some degree on the other side that hasnt had any surgery or radiation.  i feel for your mom, cause i know exactly what she is going thru.. let me know how she is doing now as i see that its been almost 2 years since her surgery and what they have done for her since.",
