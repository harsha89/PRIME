      "Content": "My wife has an aggresive form of breast cancer,the last 12 months of my life have been hell,am trying to keep it together. My brother works for a mining company in Suriname,thats a country in South America.There are amerindians living there and there is something called grama(some sort of herb) that they use to treat cancer.My brother swears that it actually works and that allot of Cancer patients \"really\" get cured. I know there is allot of quackery out there and I do not want to get into big pharma conspiracy theory discussions.but what if? I know that the rain forest contains like a billion type of plants and these amerindians have been living there for thousands of years,much longer then our modern medical science,should i give it a try? or even consider it?",

I will get alot of flack for saying that, it is true.  The oncologists get a kick back for each patient that he prescribes to take it thanks sandyjulia, my son says we have to stick with modern medicine but I believe that we should be able to try additional methods. Interesting enough,I did allot of research on this particular tribe today and found that medical researchers have been investigating their medicinal plants for years. I found their website and phone #,the guy is clearly not an expert in building sites..but hey we are going to try it out and see,its called www.akuriowisdom.com .. please look and post advise",
