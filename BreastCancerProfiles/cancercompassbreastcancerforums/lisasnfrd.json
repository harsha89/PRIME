    "Content": "I had a radical mastectomy on the right side nine years ago.  Many lymph nodes were removed also and I was told to expect to get lymphadema.  I was told that if I got it, it would never end.  Well, I did get it and immediately went to a special clinic at a nearby hospital that works specifically with lymphadema.  They taught me how to massage my fingers, hand, and arm in a way that would cause the lymphatic fluid in my right arm to flow to the left side of my body, relieving the build-up of fluid, swelling, pain, etc. They said that it was possible for my body to \"learn\" to do this on its own without the daily massage if I kept doing the massages twice every day, morning and evening. and then wrapped my arm in ace bandages to limit the fluid building up again.  I did as they said and it worked!  The fluids rerouted and the swelling and pain went away, never to return. I haven't needed to continue the massages or wraps since then.  This therapy took about four months before the lymphadema went away.  I have other pain and fatigue from my cancer, and have found oxycontin to be the best help for that.  Good luck to you.                    ",
