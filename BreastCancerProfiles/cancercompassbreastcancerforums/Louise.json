    "Content": "I think your doctor is wise to suggest a mamogram. However if you have doubts get a second opinion. Don't wait, but don't panic either. My daughter has a lump in her breast and all they wanted to do is wait till it gets bigger. She is 33. She went to another doctor and he did a biopsy immediately. Turned out to be some kind of calcium deposit. It seemed her blood has too much calcium in it. Now she has to get that taken care of but atleast she knows it is not cancer. As for being 27, your age is not the factor, there are many cases of breast cancer patients under 35. And it is growing. Don't play Russian Roulette. find out. A biopsy is simple. A needle biopsy is a little uncomfortable not painful. Scans at best require a IV. Mamograms are uncomfortable also. There is nothing to fear in getting checked. I know I had 2 years of these things and I feel great, didn't lose alot of hair and am so happy to be here. I will now only see a doctor once a year. You only have one life and one body take care of it. If I can help don't be afraid to ask. good luck. lan",
