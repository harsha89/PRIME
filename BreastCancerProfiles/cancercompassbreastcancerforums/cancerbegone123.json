      "Content": "Dear Ryalma, Good morning.  My mom went to the Oasis of Home in Mexico for stage 4 endometrial cancer aprox. 8-9 years ago.  We had a terrible experience there and was charged a fortune.  The treatment was non-effective and the doctor was trying to get an extra 10,000.00 from my father after already paying the 10,000.00.  She had all the treatments there including the dentritic cell therapy that we had the responsibility to bring back to the states in dry ice and a cooler with no help or advise from the clinic.  It did not go well to say the least and the doctor's office very dirty.  I do not recomend going there.  By the time she came home, the cancer had advanced significantly.  There are wonderful and more safe alternative clinics in the states.  I do not recommend going there and I do not feel Dr. Issel (the origional founder) would be very happy. ",

      "Content": "HELLO, GOOD MORNING.  IN THE PAST 10 YEARS, MY MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER, AND AUNT ALL HAD STAGE IV CANCERS.  WE HAVE GONE TO MANY OF THE TOP HOSPITALS AND ALTERNATIVE CLINICS IN THE COUNTRY.... MD ANDERSON, MAYO CLINIC, MOFFITT CANCER HOSPITAL TO NAME A FEW.  WE WERE MOST IMPRESSED WITH THE MAYO CLINIC AND MOFFITT CANCER HOSPITAL.  FOR BREAST CANCER, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT I WOULD SEE DR. PEREZ AT THE MAYO CLINIC IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA.  SHE IS ONE OF THE TOP DOCTORS AND RESEARCHERS FOR BREAST CANCER.....EVEN KINGS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES RECEIVE TREATMENT FROM HER...LEADING EXPERT. AS FAR AS ALTERNATIVE CLINICS, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE OASIS OF HOPE IN MEXICO.  MY MOM HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE DOWN THERE.  SHE RECEIVED ALL THEIR TREATMENSTS INCLUDING THE DENTRETIC CELL VACINNE. THE LOCAL DOCTOR ADMINISTERING THE DENTRETIC CELL IS A CROOK AND WAS TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY AFTER ALREADY PAYING.  IT IS ALSO VERY UNORGANIZED AND DIRTY.  AFTER SPENDING OVER TEN -15,000.00 ....THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A WAY TO SHIP ALL THE VITAMINS AND DENTRETIC CELL SHOTS BACK TO THIS COUNTRY.  IT WAS ALL LEFT UP TO US TO KEEP REFRIGERATED ETC.... BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  I FELT LIKE IT WAS A BIG SCAM ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS AND HIS WIFE (NOT A DOCTOR) WAS REAL NICE AND GENUINE.  I DO NOT FEEL THE FOUNDING DR. ISSEL WOULD BE PROUD.  THERE ARE 2 GREAT ULTERNATIVE CLINICS IN FLORIDA....ONE IN BOCA RATON AND ONE IN TAMPA.  THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON DIET, VITAMIN IV'S, HYPERBARIC OXYGEN CHAMBER, ETC.  I WOULD SEE DR. PEREZ FIRST AND THEN RECEIVE VITAMIN THERAPY AND DIET.",
