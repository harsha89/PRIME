      "Content": "I have been treating her2 breast cancer for the last 3 years with an arsonal of drugs. I am stage 4 and have been managing the disease well. I have been a member of an on-line her2 support group which has given me so much support and info regarding this disease. Just type in her2support.org and you will go directly to their site. I was on herceptin for about 18 months. I am now waiting to get tykerb, which is an oral drug not yet approved by fda, but my Doctor can get it because she is in a teaching hospital. You probably need to see a doctor with more knowledge about her2 cancer. If you don't you are not giving yourself the best chance at controlling this disease. I have met so many stage 4 patients on this support group that have maintained a good quality of life after having brain mets, lung mets, liver mets, bone mets(what I have). My name in lu ann if you see any of my posts. Everyone there is willing to answer any of your questions. Take care and God Bless. Lu Ann",

      "Content": "Hi Her2+ survivors, I was diagnosed with stage 1 bc in 1991. I had mod. rad. mast. with tramflap reconstruction. I had 6 months of cytoxin, methotrexate, and 5fu. I remained symptom free until winter 2003/4 when I was dx. with bc mets to spine, pelvis, and mediastynime. I had a biopsy of my spine which showed I am her2+. They did not test for this in 1991 so I did not have the option of getting herceptin. I have been on a chemo/herceptin combination for 15 of the last 18 months. I also received rad. treatments to my spine and mediastynme. I'm not in remission but my disease is stable and I have a good quality of life. Knowing what I know now I would get the herceptin if I was stage 1. It seems to be the magic bullet that is keeping me alive with this agressive form of cancer. Please feel free to go on www.her2support.org. You will receive alot of suport and information to help you on your journey to surviving this disease. Blessings, Lu Ann.Single",

      "Content": "Dear Terry, When I was dx. with stage 4 bc Feb 04 I thought I would only live 6 months. Although my prognosis was poor I have managed to keep the disease stable with radiation and chemo. If you havn't already, go on the her2 support group web site. I have been with them for almost 2 years and have received much support and information about this disease. You are unique as you have inflammatory along with the her2. There is a woman named Sandy who is living proof that you have hope. Make sure you address a message to her specifically and she will answer better then I can about inflammatory bc. There are so many women living quality lives with stage 4 her2 bc. I can give you my e-mail address on their site if you want to e-mail me. My name is Lu Ann and I check in daily. Take care and God Bless you.",

      "Content": "I had a recurrance 2 years ago to my spine, pelvic bones, and mediastynim. I received rad. tx. two years ago to my spine and mediasynim at Cancer Treatment Center of America in Zion, Ill. I continued my treatment with chemo back at home. I am her2 positive, estrogin and progesterin negative. I was on taxol, carboplatin, herceptin, and zometa (bone strengthener) for 6 months. I had a 1 month break then I had navlebean, herc., and zom. Then another short break and replaced navlebean with gemsar. I took last summer off, got a new doctor and took the gem., herc., and zom., cocktail on a different schedule. My last chemo tx. was 12/19/05. My Ct and bone scans show improvement so I will continue to be off all but the bone strengthener, zometa. Have you been tested for her2? If you are positve you should be able to take herceptin. I'm not sure if I can give you my e-mail address on this web-site, but you can get it on the her2 web-site. Just enter her2 support in the subject space and when you get to the site's home page click on the members list and go to the L's for Lu Ann. If that doesn't work just post a new thread. I go to the site daily so I would be able to contact you. That site has a wealth of information. Most everyone are eager to help. Take care and God Bless You. Lu Ann",

      "Content": "I to have breast cancer that has spread to my spine and my chest. I went to Cancer Treatment Centers of America for a second opinion for treatment and was totally satisfied with the care I received. I underwent 22 radiation treatments with a 30% reduction of the tumor in my chest, the lesions in my spine are being replaced by new bone, and my tumor markers are down from 345 to 111. I was in severe pain before treatment. I'm currently on 20mg. oxycontin for the pain in my back as I have a compression fracture from the cancer. I am currently undergoing chemo therapy at home which consists of Herceptin, Taxol, and Carboplatin. I also get a monthly dose of Zometa to rebuild the bone and suppress further bone lesions. The treatments haven't been real bad as I am getting them at a lower dose weekly rather then once every three weeks. Don't waste anymore time call Cancer Treatment Centers of America. They give hope where other places don't.",
