    "Content": "Hello Sharon, My Mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000. Her initial treatment consisted of a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by taxomorphen on a daily basis for what turned out to be just under 5 years. In May 2005, whilst on holiday, Mum started to feel tired and noticed that any food she ate tasted greasy. When back from the holiday she started to go down hill quickly, losing a lot of weight and experiencing pain in her side. The doctors though she may have Hepatitis and their complete ignorance (given her previous condition) led to her having to be rushed into hospital after 10 weeks of suffering classic liver cancer symptoms. If there is any advice I could give it would be trust your instincts. If you believe something isn\u2019t right then keep making a fuss until someone listens and does something about it. Mum was so weak by now that she was only able to cope with tablet form chemotherapy drugs (sorry I don't know the name). She responded to these well but did experience sickness and near the end of the course she was extremely depressed, to the point of needing someone with her all the time. After this treatment she went onto Herceptin. Things went well for a few months but the pains, weakness and strange greasy taste came back. Another scan showed the tumours had gone from 2 to around 10 on the left side of the liver. Mum is now on Taxotere and has coped with it amazingly. I thought she would be really sick and start to lose weight again but in fact she hasn't been ill at all and, if it wasn't for the cancer, you could say she is as fit as she ever was. She has been offered an extra two courses of the Taxotere on top of the six she's already had. She is due for her penultimate one on the 5th Oct 06 and final on the 26th Oct. At the moment we are desperately looking for ways to try and save her. Medical advances are happening all the time, every day I read of new drugs or surgical techniques that are being developed. The US are lucky they have had access to herceptin for so long. The UK have only just licensed it (tip for all UK based patients - Welsh hospitals have been offering Herceptin treatment since 2004, if you have problems with the English hospitals then transfer if possible) and although it didn't help my Mum there are many women out there that are benefiting greatly from it. We are also now aware of a new drug that has not yet come to the UK market, although I think it may be very close to being out in the US, called TYKERB (by GlaxcoSmithKline). Apparently it has an immense ability to kerb cancer growth and was so successful in trial that they halted the trial early to put all the women involved on it. I've also heard much about the various ablation techniques (radio frequency, high intensity heat ones and cryo or freezing ones) also chemo-embolisation. If anyone has had experience of any of these techniques and knows where they would be available I'd be very interested to hear off you. As a 27 year old daughter of a merely 55 year old mother I feel completely devastated by all this. The thought of my Mum not seeing me get married, not being able to cuddle her future grandchildren, combined with wondering how my Dad and younger brother and sister are ever going to cope, etc is tearing me apart. I love her so much and would do anything to help her but so far, no matter who I contact or how hard I research, I can not see a path out of this one. Even in this message I feel so up and down. One minute positive with all the new treatments and yet the next the reality of it all sinks in and I just break down. It really is a horrible disease, not just physically but for the mental torture it causes too. To try and end on a more positive note - think back a number of years when HIV/AIDs was a death sentence. It is now perfectly manageable via retroviral drugs and many people live full and happy lives. One day, of this I am certain, the same will be the case for cancer. A breakthrough could be found at any moment. Please, all of you, never give up. Claire",
