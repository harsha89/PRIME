    "Content": "Hi Eliz, I read your message and totally understand your fears.  I have been diagnosed with rectal cancer a month ago and Its been one appointment after another and still more to come.  They want to do radiation and chemo - scared is an understatement. Then surgery. I could not stop  crying for most of the last 3 weeks.  What I did do is get alot of people around me brought into this so I did not have to try and hide it. Second-I found a support group I could go to with people going through the same thing, and I repeat the serenity prayer.. so I think it is time and knowledge that helps to go forward.  I am still scared and I get depressed but hope I learn to except the things I can not change... I wish you the best. And I send a Big hug!!!  Peggy",
