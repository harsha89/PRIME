I had 2 lumpectomies in May and 30 radiation treatments that summer.  From 9/06-6/06, I took arimidex, as recommended by my oncologist.  Weight gain, fatigue, and especially nausea with vomiting were my symptoms during that whole period.  I took myself off of it, but my oncologist convinced me to try aromasin beginning in Dec. of 07.  I have been taking it for 7 months now, and I've never felt so bad daily for so long before.  My first trigger finger developed while on the aromosin.  I have had 2 cortisone shots to help temporarily and only slightly relieve that one.  I have same digit, middle finger, on right hand now, with very limited movement and lots of pain. The pain and stiffness in both hands and feet, is probably the most debilatating symptom for me.  I have trouble walking and using my hands normally.  I too, am so stiff after sitting for even a few minutes or when getting up in the morning, I feel like someone might feel at 100 years old.  My arms and legs hurt, as do my rib area and hips at times.  I go back to my oncologist for a regular check-up in a week, but I am quitting the aromasin TODAY!  My mammogram recently came back clear.  I don't know about the bloodwork yet, until my appt.  My fingers are so swollen.  I am CONSTANTLY tired, regardless of how much sleep I get, which has been about 8-9 hours a night this summer, since I am a teacher.  I rarely have any energy to do anything, but force my self too.  But I also find myself on the couch much of the time, if I really don't HAVE to do anything.  I hate being and feeling like this.  I will post another message in a few weeks to reflect on what I notice about being off the meds.  I'm 52, going on 92!   You poor, poor thing!  A year ago I was writing almost daily on this web with the same symptons.  It took a long time and I was going to give up on the Aromasin after changing from Arimidex.  However, whilst I still have3 the weight gain, sausage fingers, spread feet and a general \"laziness\", I have to say I feel great and can walk.  No pain any more.  It is hard for me to believe that I am the same person.  Wait and see what the oncologist says and then evaluate your quality of life, which, in the final analysis is what it is all about.  Good luck to you.

Please can anybody tell me what to do? Delia I took Arimidex for four years and had huge negative consequences and became very \"mannish\", but never had unusual swelling. Is Arimidex the only drug you're taking? Did you tell your doctor that you have this problem? You might ask your doctor if you can suspend treatment for a week or two to see what happen s. A week or two off of a treatment never really hurt anybody. Do you really need estrogen suppression? I wish you the best but always complain and  complain andcomplain about side effects to your doctor and don't leave the office without answers.   Thank you for your reply suggesting a \"time out\" from the Arimidex or Aromasin but I have tried this without success.  There just has to be a way of getting rid of those swollen feet and hands.  I am glad you escaped.  Good luck for the future.

My general health is good ,but I would love to have some answers on how I could help myself prevent this. Thank you. Delia Does anyone have any ideas?      ",

How did the recovery go? Is there a wait period after radiation? Also I am having pain under my arm and along the bra line under the breat, has anyone ever had that before? Thanks in advance for you help.   'Dear Courtney, I had the flap operation you refer to a year and a half ago.  Like you I had had an infection that wouldn't heal.  It was a piece of cake and I wish I had done it sooner but I was apprehensive of further infections.  Hardly a scar and not soreness or pain.  Now the other pain you refer to I get occasionaly and was told the other day that it is from the radium.  The muscle pulls away from the breast bone and can hurt.  I suppose we just get used to those bi-products of the whole silly business.  But the flap is a breeze.  Gook luck!!  Delia",
