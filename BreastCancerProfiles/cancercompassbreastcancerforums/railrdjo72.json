      "Content": "I started arimidex 8 months ago and the joint pain was almost unbearable.  My doctor changed my meds to aromasin and though it subsided, I still had it.  A friend said her chiropractor recommended fresh pineapple.  I was skeptical, but tried it anyway.  It really helped, but I got careless and stopped taking it for a few days.  The joint pain came back.  I now eat fresh pineapple every day and the joint pain is minimal.  Try it and let me know it if works.",
