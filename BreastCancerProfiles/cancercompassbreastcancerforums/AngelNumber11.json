      "Content": "I'm STILL in the stage of shock from my breast cancer diagnosis @ the age of 38. I have 3 young children who are my everything & I'm just now trying to understand my pathology results & my prognosis. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma/HER2-/ER+ diagnosed on July 15,2015. 11days prior, I spent the 4th of July on the ER with an Ovarian cyst diagnosis the size of a baseball. The ER (PA) told me I'd need surgery to remove such a large mass & told me I'd need it biopsied to test for cancer. I was then pushed onto the gynecology department whose chief gynecologist informed me that my cyst would NOT need to be removed & my body would ingest it on its own. Huh?! What conflicting opinions!? The ER (PA) told me a mass this size would take me down & require emergency surgery if ruptured & the chief gynecologist didn't even want to see me in person to discuss, but rather ordered a follow up ultrasound 6 weeks later?! I was overdue for a PAP & experiencing some yeast infection like symptoms (I'm a runner), so I went against her advice to wait 6 weeks to schedule that PAP & got in right away. It was @ that appointment I was referred to a breast care specialist for the lump next to my left nipple that lead me to a mammogram/ultrasound/biopsy to confirm a positive result.Who knows how much further the cancer would have spread if I'd had water longer?!....When I asked the Dr. who performed the biopsy if my ovarian cyst & breast cancer were related, he said NO. Everything in my gut tells me YES & though I'm no Dr. wouldn't an overproduction of estrogen during my menstral cycle (ovulation) when I developed my large ovarian cyst be linked directly to a biopsy result indicating I'm ER +, or another words, my breast cancer grows in response to the hormone estrogen that requires endocrine therapy in order to block the effects of estrogen . Should I insist on getting tested for the BRCA 1 mutation gene? Or should I assume my medical history with an ovarian cyst diagnosis automatically qualifies me to be an ideal candidate for this test anyway? This is all so overwhelming & when your trust is compromised so early on in the process, it's different to know how to proceed. I will continue to follow MY OWN intuition & be MY OWN advocate regardless! I have 3 young children who need me!",

      "Content": "Thank you for that link to that helpful article Jody! Both the general surgery department & OBGYN department have put in referrals for me to have genetic testing done to provide more information about my specific kind of cancer & it's possible links to my ovarian cyst. I appreciate you taking the time to send it my way! I'm in the information gathering stage of shock! ????",
