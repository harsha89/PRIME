I don't have the inverted or flatter nipple, no lymph swelling or anything.. Just a patch of thicker skin on my left breast, slightly near the nipple. The only time it changes/gets redder is if I poke at it for too long.

But then again, what doesn't?  I just can't get IBC out of my mind though - Looking it up on google is terrifying. - Especially since i'm only 19. e_e! I just learned that a friend has IBC. A very good friend of mine died in 1992 after a 3 year battle with IBC. I noticed a small macular lesion on my L breast. I had a simple R mastectomy 3.08 and I am a nurse so I am somewhat of a worry-wart. A mammogram won't show IBC because it is a surface cancer. You need to go to someone familiar with IBC and/or get it biopsied. I am going to my oncology office tomorrow. I am not as panicked as I was but I want an expert to tell me that I don't have to worry or have it biopsied. IBC is rare so many oncologists don't see many cases. Are you near a big medical center? A dermatologist could probably biopsy it or a very experienced oncologist(cancer specialist) could lead you in the right direction. Good luck, and get the followup and reasurrance you need. Kayatl  I don't have much money, i'm uninsured. I want a biopsy to rule this out, because honestly sitting with it and thinking 'what if this isn't a cyst' has me panicking on occasion. It's unhealthy for me, but I don't know how easily I could get one.  Right now the only people taking me truely seriously are on the other end of a phone, because i've made a point to call a breast cancer hotline for advice. It really helps, but I still have these moments where I go 'what am I going to do if I have this?' I'm not even 20 yet, the thought of having this cancer terrifies me. But thank you for replying. Atleast I know now I wasn't being ignored.",
