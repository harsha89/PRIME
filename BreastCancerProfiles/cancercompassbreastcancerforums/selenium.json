    "Content": "I had a mastectomy in 2005 and just starting last year started having wierd pain on the left side of my mastectomy and under arm at first it started with a strange pain that was always there a really strange feeling that if you moved a certain way would be worse making my nerves really bad then it went away. Now I have a shooting pain under my arm I never had reconstruction either Do you think this is because of scar tissue",
