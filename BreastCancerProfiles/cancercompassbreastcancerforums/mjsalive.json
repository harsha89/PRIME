    "Content": "I had stage 3 breast cancer double negative HER 2 positive. I was also told of the probability of it spreading to the brain. I originally had a lympectomy and chemo, and started my herceptin, I had 2 treatments when the herceptin damaged my heart infraction rate to a near fatal low. They had to stop treatment. I still had almost a year of herceptin to go. Was this enough? I asked, no one knows, the human body is so unpredictable. My onclogist did a mammo before I started radiation and found the cancer returned in a more aggessive strain(double negative HER 2 positive). Here came the bilateral masectomy, what a way to get out of radiation. You must live and love life to the fullest, don't fear the things you can't control. I have had many set backs from the chemo, but I am proud to be a 7 year survivor and plan on being here at least that many more.",
