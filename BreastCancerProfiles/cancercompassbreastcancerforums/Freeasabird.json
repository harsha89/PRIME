      "Content": "Years ago before I had a formal diagnosis the child of an acquaintance claimed, quite audibly \"You smell bad!\"  The mother said nothing, not like \"that is a rude thing to say\" or \"apologize for your comment\".  Needless to say, I was chagrined and did not pursue anything further in the way of being around this person or her brood.  Within a few years I was to be diagnosed with cancer but never tied the comment to my situation. If only that mother and child had known what was occurring I might have been spared some of the health issues I was to face. And they might have taught them to take responsibility for what was obviously a 'gift'.   Was I angry? Not really. I just did not have enough information yet nor did that acquaintance ever acknowledge wha had transpired. ",
