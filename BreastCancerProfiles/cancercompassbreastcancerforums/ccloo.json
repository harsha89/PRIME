    "Content": "I am also so very sorry that you are facing such heartbreaking news. I am also sorry that your friends do not understand what you are going through. This devastating news is all so brand new. Allow yourself time to process it. I know you must feel confused and don't know what direction to go. While I have not faced what you are dealing with, I can only give my perspective as a mom. I have a 12 yr old daughter and I can only imagine what it would be like if we faced this. I'm sure your mom didn't tell you how bad off the breast cancer was for a couple of reasons. She may have just found out herself and needed time to come to terms with it herself. And, she didn't want to upset you. She would have I'm sure told you and your sister in her own time, when she was ready. Now, what struck me in your message was your comment about feeling guilty for leaving her alone but couldn't bear to watch her die. The reality is, we are all going to die, you just know when your mom may leave this earth. Just imagine if you lost your mom suddenly without any warning. There would have been so much left unsaid, feelings never shared. You now have the opportunity to spend time with your mom, share with her your lives. Please, go to your mom, share with her how you feel. I know she will understand and want to listen. After all, she is your mom. Maybe she just hasn't had the strength yet to have this conversation, but now that you know, now is the perfect time. Once you have cried enough tears together, talk about a plan for the remaining months you have together. Time to be together. Your life ahead will not be easy, but if you have a plan to spend time with her, share with her, then you will have no regrets. And that is best way to live your life, with no regrets. I will pray for you and your mom, for strength, for love. I know, sometimes the world does seem like a cruel sickening place and what you are dealing with is not fair for a 15 yr old girl to have to deal with. But you can survive this. No, it won't be easy, but you can. Maybe someday your experience will allow you to help others. Be strong, but it's always okay to cry. In God's Love, Collette",
