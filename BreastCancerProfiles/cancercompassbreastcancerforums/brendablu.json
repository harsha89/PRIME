      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply. I also have cancer in my lymphnodes. I think that what is bothering me the most. That's why I did chemo. Too many tumors in my breast to save it. Was thinking of having both taken....still undecided on that. Very glad to hear you're recovering well...leech included (lol). You've given me abit more encouragement & I again thank you from the bottom of my heart. :-}",

      "Content": "Hi, this is my first time...I've been through 20 weeks of chemo & now scheduled for mastectomy November 7th. My last chemo was last week. Now I seem to have had a break down, tired of being strong. Most of my friends don't talk to me anymore, my best friend has been there through everything till now & this last week he hasn't returned calls or texts. Don't work anymore. Too much time with my thoughts & they haven't been good.",
