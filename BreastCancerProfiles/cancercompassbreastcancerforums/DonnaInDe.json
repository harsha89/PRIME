      "Content": "Thank you for your responses. I have a sterotatic biopsy scheduled for the 14th of this month......won't know the results until the 17th. Hoping it's not cancer, but like you said, if it is, they will have caught it early. Is there more of a chance of it being cancer, since the axillary tail is included? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hello. I'm trying to calm my nerves I guess. Any information anyone would be willing to give will be greatly appreciated. I just received the results from my mammogram. It states, \"multiple calcifications identified in the upper outer quadrant are of the right breast towards the axillary tail. There is also a cluster of microcalcifications identified in the upper outer retroareloar region. Biopsy is suggested.\" I have a sterotatic biopsy scheduled for Aug.14. I am pretty shook-up by this news. I am 41 years old. I went o my OB-GYN because of severe pain in my LEFT breast and under my left arm. But everything on the left side looks o.k. This is all on my right breast. I'm mostly concerned because of the \"axillary tail\" oart. Can anyone offer any advice? Thank you.",
