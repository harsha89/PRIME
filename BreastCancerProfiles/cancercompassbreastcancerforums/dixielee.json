A feeling of tired that you really cannot describe utill you have experienced it. I had bad night sweats (still do). Just make sure to protect yourself every way that you can for your own health. I bought and wore mask from the time I started chemo till I was done with radiation. That was from september 2006 till april 2007. I went thru treatment during flu season too the mask seemed to help. This was the toughest thngs I have ever been thru and hope it is the last.  Gather the friends and family around you that really care about you and what is going on with you. Let people know what they can do for you and your family.   Thanks very much.",

I have two wigs that I've never worn.  I'd be happy to give them to you. I must add that I, too, found them to be a little itchy and wound up buyinig a bunch of cool hats.  But, I'd give you the wigs in a heartbeat.  ",
