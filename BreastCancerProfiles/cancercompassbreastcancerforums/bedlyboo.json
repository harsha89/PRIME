      "Content": "Yes!  Ive had pain in my rib right underneath where the \"booster\" dose was given.  I was diagnosed with DCIS with micro invasion (final biopsy showed no invasion) stage 0 had a lumpectomy and then felt bullied into the radiation.   This was 8 years ago.  Ive always had pain in my breast that is burning and pinching but the rib pain started about a year ago maybe longer.  Im going to have a scan.  Lets see what they tell me.  ",

Ive had pain for 7 years.  It seems to get worse every year and they just blow it off.   Ive had an X-ray and they say nothing is wrong.  The pain is always there but gets worse from time to time.  It completely freaks me out thinking its bone cancer which is alway a worry after radiation.  ",
