      "Content": "Hello, I have IDC and was diagnosed in 2006, the most important questions I found were what stage is the cancer, (the lower the better), and has it spread, these are important questions to ask the Oncologist.  Make sure you get a Dr. you trust, trust is very important.  I am 47 yrs old and  I have stage II  Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (Adenomyoepithelioma) and received 6 rounds of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation.  My cancer was rare otherwise there wouldn't have been any chemo. I had a lumpectomy and went back to work in a week.  I had my chemos on Friday and was back at work on Monday.  With breast cancer a lot of people don't get sick or nauseous like they do with other cancers, I was a lucky one.  It wasn't nearly as bad as I thought that it would be.  Mainly I was tired and a little dopey, but hey I'm still here. I gained 35 pounds from the meds, lost my hair and eye brows and waddled for about a month from fluid retention.  But, the hair grew back (very nice), the eyebrows returned very bushy and the fluid went away.  I am now on Femara because I can't take Tamoxifen.  Just one pill at night and I don't worry about the cancer anymore.  I am still 35 pounds overweight but I am soooo going on a diet one day soon. I wish your mom all the best, and I will keep you both in my prayers.  kcmarrio",

My 75 y/o mother was just diagnosed with IDC just yesterday and we're all just dealing with so many emotions! But fear is number 1. We're scared that my woderful, loving mother won't make it through the surgery. We're praying to God to give her the strength to fight this horrible disease. If there's anyone out there that had /has this and would like to offer some advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you and may God Bless you and your families, Maria  ",

I also had double mastectomy. I would like to hear from someone who has been diagnosed as being her2 positive, and has had the herceptin treatments. I guess i would just like to know that there is hope at the end of this journey. My dr says that my cure rate is at about 70 to 80 percent, but I read that sometimes the herceptin does not always work. Even though my cure rate is pretty high, I still get nervous, after reading some of the info on breast cancer. Maybe I should just quit reading so much, huh? ha ha Thank you for any info k Hi I don't know how much help I can be, but I have stage II breast cancer, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, not in the lymph nodes though, I am her2nue 3/3 positive, I am told that thats not to good, but my Oncologist says that I have an 80% chance or higher of beating this thing.  I have done the Herceptin for a year and had no side effects.  I have been off of it for 6 months now, and am now taking Femara to keep the estrogen away.  I haven't had a recurrance and don't expect to if I can keep up with the Femara (I had a bad reaction).  I think you'll be fine, and I'm sure that you are getting blood work every time you get the Herceptin, I'm sure they would have told you if they didn't think that the Herceptin was working.  Good luck!",
