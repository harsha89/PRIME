    "Content": "Hi Tasha  How is the Sucralfate working?  My mom is on Tarceva and Avastin IV (clinical trial) for lung ca and she's starting to have GI burning as well as decreased appetite.  She's on hold right now because of a high creatinine level and may not be able to continue in the trial.  So far, she's had a positive response to the treatment with the shrinkage of one of the larger tumors.",
