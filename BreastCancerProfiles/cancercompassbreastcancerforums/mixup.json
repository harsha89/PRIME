    "Content": "I have been on Aridimex for nearly 5 years following breast surgery and radiation. I have tolerated the med fine . About two months ago I started tingling in my right hand and I thought it was due to the weather. I started using hand cream more frequently but then it started in my lerft. Now both feet have the same effect in my toes. There is no discoloration just a funny feeling and by the end of the day they really burn. I saw my interenist last week and mentioned it to him, He said it could possibly be from the radation and I was shocked. After all this time. then yesterday in the local newspaper there was an article about a lady that was having neuropathy due to treatments. Has anyone had this system? I would apreciate any info. Thanks and good luck",
