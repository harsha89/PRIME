      "Content": "Hi I'm Amy. Halfway through radiation I started this fabulous exercise program I DVR off P{BS. The \"instructor\" or whatever you would call her had breast cancer and she designed a special routine for range of motion after a mastectomy (with oncologists and physical therapists etc.). I just do the \"regular\" ones because I just had a lumpectomy. In any event I think its great and being athletic you would probably really like this. It gave me a feeling of control and power over my body even though I couldn't control cancer (fortunately my doctors could!) It's called Classical Stretch and the woman who designed it is Miranda Esmonde-White. She also used to be a ballet dancer with the Canadian Nat'l company. The breast cancer one is online for free.",

      "Content": "Hello! I know how you feel about the abnormal cervical cells. Did you know that paps have a 30% false negative rate? Also the virus that causes those abnormal cells (which may or may not develop into cancer- most don't). I know about this stuff because 20 years ago my stepfather did a cdc study that eventually led to the discovery that this virus (HPV) causes abnormal \"pre-cancerous\" (I put that in italics b/c in most people it never does develop into cancer, so breathe a little sigh of relief and demand a colposcopy at least every 6 months. I waited 3 months after my husband found my lump too actually go to my GYN, who told me to get a mammogram. I dragged my feet on that too because I was AFRAID of getting a mammogram (the pain not the results). Get it checked out. It doesn't hurt that much. Also my doctors told me many, many times that they're finding breast cancer is not necessarily genetic. No one in my family has ever had it and I was 43 when I had it. Granted it's only been 7 months since my diagnosis but they got the whole tumor no lymph node involved and then I had radiation and now I feel great! I'm happier than I have ever been. My tumor was \"typed\" and it showed a very low risk of recurrence. I feel like I beat death. Good luck to you. It doesn't have to be so scary.",
