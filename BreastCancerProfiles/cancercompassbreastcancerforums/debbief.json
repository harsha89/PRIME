    "Content": "I had nodes removed under my left arm 3 years ago and had no problem with any swelling. Then I had a reaccurance in July at my masectomy site.  I had 2 positive nodes this time on my right side. Unusual, anyway I also had 5 fields of radiation one at the armpit. They told me lymphodema could be a side effect, so I started seeing a therapist right away, four months later I developed lymphodema and its not getting better, not worse, I bandage at night, wear a sleeve everyday, exercise and do massage.  Im interested in the rebounder. How do you use it ",
