      "Content": "Theresa and Liza, I wanted to respond to both of you. First, I am a registered nurse (37 yrs) and have worked in a variety of settings including oncology (but many years ago). Second, I was diagnosed w/ stage 1 BC without lymph gland involvement on a routine mammogram 1 yr ago. My tumor was 1 cm, estrogen dependent, Her2  negative. Because of my previous history working as a nurse in oncology back in the 80s, I was TERRIFIED of everything. However, things have worked out well for me. I just wanted to share a few things with both of you...some from my experience as a nurseand others from my experience as a patient. Perhaps, they will be helpful. My tumor was unusual-soft and difficult to palpate (the surgeon couldn't even feel it during a breast exam). Initially, he thought it would not be cancer but it was. I had a 2nd surgery to get clean margins with no cancer cells (lumpectomy) and removal of 2 lymph glands,which came back negative. My oncologist told me that many MDs would recommend I get radiation and chemo as this would be the safest choice for long term survival. He said that statistics showed that approx 5% of women who had radiation only would get a reoccurrence 5-10 years later and it would kill them. However, he said there was a new test that could evaluate my individual tumor cells and identify my level of risk for reoccurrence. If the result was \"low\", I wouldn't need chemo. He sent the sample off to some lab and the result did come back as low chance of reoccurrence.so I only had  61/2 weeks of radiation which wasn't bad. Started feeling tired and had loss of appetite about half way through. Also, got a bit depressed.  I am a redhead so my skin developed a bad rash and little blisters but they had a special cream I used which helped a lot. When I was done, my skin healed up in less than a week. Regarding anti-nausea medications: there are many and everyone responds differently to them. I always tell patients that if a medication isn't working, make sure you ask for something else....there are many choices. Zofran is one of the better ones. Regarding chemo: Hydrate yourself well before treatments,you will feel better. Treat your anxiety; high anxiety escalates fear, pain, stress, etc which can increase nausea and make the overall experience worse. Regarding the injection after chemo (we called it Neupogen): try not to be afraid of it.  It is a good thing. People can die from infections after their chemo drops their white counts so low they were vulnerable to everything.  Yes, your bones can ache as the medication is stimulating your bone marrow to produce new white blood cells but try to feel fortunate that you are living at a time when they have this med. Treat yourself as if you have the flu with hot baths, etc. Well, maybe this has been of assistance in some way. I send both of you my best wishes...you can do it! Jan",

      "Content": "Your tumor size is on the smaller side and with no metastacies to the lymph glands...that all looks good. I,also, had some cells that were outside the walls of the tumor...\"invasive ductal carcinoma\". I am not familiar with DCIS. Was your tumor estrogen and/or progesterone dependent like mine? I started taking Tamoxifen in Aug...no major side effects except hot flashes. Let me know what you find out after your appointment. I can't remember the name of the test that predicts chance of reoccurrence but it was \"onco.....\". Would be interested in your oncologists' recommendations. Good luck...been there :) Jan",

      "Content": "Hi, I was also diagnosed with stage 1 Br CA last Dec 2011 at age 59. I had a lumpectomy and a surgery confirming no lymph gland involvement. Radiation was recommended which I did and chemo was optional. They did a test {oncogenic?} that tested my specific tumor cells predicting a low, medium or high chance of reoccurence. Mine came back low so I rejected the idea of chemo. Has anyone else had this test?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",
