      "Content": "Jan--Let me encourage you to keep looking for answers. In my nonprofessional opinion chemo is not the answer. Your liver needs all the help it can get to become healthy. I have posted several messages on this site relating to Ann's question. They will give you more information than I will go into here. My nutritionist tells me that most of us suffer from a fungal infection which impairs the liver and results in estrogen levels rising. In my case, high estrogen levels gave me cyclical migraines and set me up for cancer taking hold. We are working to repair my liver and other things. Glyconutrients are anti-fungal and help the body to repair the immune system. I have been taking them since November 2002. My nutritionist uses them as a base for her therapies to bring the body back into balance. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Hi, Ann! I was diagnosed with non-invasive and invasive ductile carcinoma Grade 3 after a lumpectomy in October 2002. Pathology reported some margins of the tumor were missing. Further surgery with chemo/radiation were advised. I was not a candidate for mammosite radiation due to the proximity of the tumor to my skin. I chose not to further cut, poison, or burn my body and wanted to find a different way to solve the problem. In the past my husband and I have known about various remedies out there for cancer. I do not fear cancer, although I have a healthy respect for it and what it can do. My goal was to find a way to overcome my problem without maiming my body. I attended two of Dr. Birdsall's seminars and was encouraged. I kept CTCA as an option to use and was prepared to go to Zion in January. In the meantime, I quite miraculously learned of glyconutrients and what they have done for many people in dire straits. My thought was, if it can happen for someone else, why not for me? For the last year, I have been using these natural substances to help my body fight the cancer and repair my body. One thing I was lacking was a way to document my progress. In November we were in Mexico where again, quite providentially, I met a nutritionist from London who specializes in cancer therapy. She told me of a blood test developed in Russia which she has used for the last 18 months that conclusively shows whether you have any active cancer in your body and what risk you have to develop further cancers. She does not believe in leaving such things to guesswork. I learned my results yesterday. All my active cancer is gone. I do have other issues going on in my body which she will help me address so that I do not develop cancer again. She says the good news is that there is a way to fix things. I am so thankful to God for this help and for someone like her with the tenacity to find an answer to a problem when others would give up. My nutritionist in London wants to bring this information to this country and hopes to talk to the people at Zion as well. Virtually no one over here knows about this technology and some of the things she has found that repair the body in addition to glyconutrients. Thousands of research papers have been written about glycobiology. MIT has called it one of the ten technologies that will change the world, similar to computers making typewriters obsolete. You can learn more at www.glycoscience.com. If you would like to know more, please contact me. I wish you all the best in your personal fight. I do believe there is an answer. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Jewel--One thing I neglected to mention: the nutritionist uses glyconutrients as a starting point for her therapies in addition to diet and other regimens. These are not vitamins and minerals. They are a whole new class of food supplements that give the body the materials to repair and build healthy cells. That is, of course, what the body was designed to do. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Audrey--I am happy to share with you what I've learned. The nutritionist and my husband and I were all in Cancun courtesy of the company that produces the glyconutrients I have used in my care. I took the opportunity while there to ask one of the company's doctors about what I should do to chart my progress. When we finished, I walked away and a woman who had been listening followed me and introduced herself as a nutritionist from London who specializes in cancer therapies. Lo and behold she also tells me of a blood test she uses from Russia which is very accurate. Just what I was looking for! I don't believe this was just concidence. Praise God! She had come to Mexico to tell the company's doctors about therapies she has found which work. She wants to train other professionals in order to help many more than she alone can possibly reach. In fact, she is preparing a seminar to present to doctors in the very near future. I asked her today (Tuesday) about the AMAS test which a friend found on the internet. She said it is not as reliable as the test from Russia. Her therapies have been very successful for cancer patients. She can work with those who have had previous surgeries, chemo, etc. I originally had a lumpectomy. She has put together a protocol for my continued healing using glyconutrients along with other things. Let me know if you would like to know more. Marilyn",

      "Content": "Hi, Carolyn! Thanks for your inquiry. My apologies for not responding before this. I was waiting to talk with my nutritionist. She just returned from her other clinic in Morocco and called me today (Monday). She would be very glad to call you and answer your questions. In my case, I had the added benefit of meeting her in Cancun and peppering her with questions. I am sure you have many for which you, too, need an answer. She will give you direct answers and, if she doesn't know, she will tell you that, too. Thankfully, it doesn't end there; she goes on to find an answer, if possible. I sent blood and urine specimens to the lab in London and faxed my answers to a 12-page health survey to the nutritionist. She used these, along with a phone consultation, as a baseline for preparing a program tailored to my needs. In addition to my bout with cancer, I have other health issues she is addressing which stem from a couple of root problems. One I will mention here is the trembling I have experienced in particularly my left hand which has gotten progressively worse over the last 15 years. She says symptoms like this always indicate a problem with mercury poisoning. I have known about the proper removal of mercury fillings but have never had it done. She says, however, that at this point we will concentrate first on getting it removed from my fat cells where heavy metals are stored--not primarily in the blood--and cause problems for my nerves. (Nerves are covered with fat in the myelin sheath). I am excited to see others get this kind of help. If you would give me your phone number, I will send it on to her. I hope to hear from you.

      "Content": "Jewel--I, too, have been told, blood tests for tumor markers are not all that reliable. My nutritionist wholeheartedly agrees. The blood test from Russia, however, has been very reliable. Certainly knowing where you stand is infinitely more desirable than \"watching for signs of anything returning\" which would certainly put one at a disadvantage in conquering the enemy. The blood sample is handled differently in that no centrifuge is used and it must remain absolutely still for one hour before transport. As far as treatment is concerned, I suppose that differs from case to case. The nutritionist endeavors to correct basic systemic problems, not just treat symptoms, through, of course, diet and other means she has found which work to bring the body back into balance. The key words here are \"work\" and \"balance.\" To date I am unable to give you my personal testimony since I have only begun the process. I am looking forward to the day which she has told me will come when I will be a \"new woman.\" At 52, that sounds wonderful. I am anticipating the journey. The best way to get your answers is to talk with her directly. If you would give me your phone number, I will pass it on to her. She has told me she would be glad to call you. I know it is worth it.
