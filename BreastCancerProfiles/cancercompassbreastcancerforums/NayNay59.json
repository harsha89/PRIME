      "Content": "I am scheduled for a lumpectomy / excisional biopsy this coming Monday, May 5th.  I am terrified.  I had the stereostatic biopsy a couple of weeks ago and ended up taking a lot of ativan, probably close to 3 or 4 mgs and really do not remember a lot about that procedure and slept the rest of the afternoon.  Now I have to have the wire guide placed prior to the lumpectomy and will be taking more ativan.  I am prone to anxiety and have been known to make a run for it if the anxiety gets too high (mostly with the dentist :) ).  Reading through the post on this site have been very helpful and calming in a way.  Any other advice you all are willing to share I would love to hear.  Like how do you get through the days prior without going crazy....all I can think about is the up coming surgery and have a hard time concentrating at work.",

      "Content": "Thank you Millie, In most things I am a very strong woman, but when it comes to needles and pain I become a quivering mass of tears.  The actualy surgery is not concerning me as much as the wire placement, because I know I will be asleep for the surgery.  I do not know what kind of follow up will be needed, the surgeon says my tissue was bengin, but that there could be something hiding behind or within the atypical cells.  So after the surgery and the pathologist reviews I will know if anything further is needed or it I will be good to go.  I am starting to feel like that women in the movie \"Erin Brockovich\" - am I still considered a women if I have no uterus, overies and now scarred up breasts.  I didn't realize how importnat my breast were to me until this started a few weeks ago.  Trying to get through work this week has been trying, I cannot concentrate on anything, and when I have had to deal with state regulatory authorities ( I am a compliance officer) I find that I lose my temper and get frustrated very easily.  So I have decided to avoid all contact or at least as much as possible until after this is done.  I know this weekend I will be good because I have layed out a plan to give my home a good cleaning to keep my mind busy.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",
