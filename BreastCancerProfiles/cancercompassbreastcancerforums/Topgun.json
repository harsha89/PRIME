    "Content": "I want you to do a google search for Cynthia Bamdad in MA. The company she runs is called Minerva. In my humble opinion her discoveries will revolutionize the way we look at cancer. She understands how cancer is formed especially breast cancer. If your mom has the MUC-1 receptor on her tumor you need to get your mom Glaxo's drug. I predict a year from now women will be able to take a simple blood test to tell if they have cancer. Mamograms will be a thing of the past. These relvelations are not years but months away. Keep your spirits up and do a little research. Have your mom hang on. Glaxo's drug is in Phase III. Since MUC-1 is expressed in 96% of breast cancer patients there is a pretty good chance a MUC-1 drug will help. I bet glaxo gets approval this year. Steer your oncologist in this direction. If your mom doesn't have the MUC-1 type of cancer then the drug will not do anything just so you know.",
