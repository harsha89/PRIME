      "Content": "Hello, I have been tremendously fortunate to have so far survived 5 years from my original diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer. It had / has spread to my lymph nodes, liver and bones. I have gratefullyÂ undergone an anterior resection, 2 liver resections, a knee and partial femur replacement. In addtion, I have had 3 lots of Chemo and radiotherapy. The cancer has again returned to the colon, bones and liver and I have recently had (another) PET Scan which, amongst many other findings as per above, reported \"FDG Uptake around the right shoulder appears to be degenerative in origin\". No one seems to be able to explain exactly what this is - and doesn't seem to be available on the internet. Could anyone advise more precisely what this means please??",
