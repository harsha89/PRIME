    "Content": "I just did a protocol of herbs/diet and a vegetarian diet, and it worked.  Last year I had stage 2 & 3 breast cancer.  Now, the blood test, the mammogram and the ultrasound show it is \"no longer evident\" as the radiologist put it.  I got a second opinion from an independent doctor, and two nurses, one being my daughter.  Everyone concurred: the tumor is missing! Write to me for this free protocol...I don't get money for sharing this, just the joy of knowing someone else is healing their body from cancer.  I know other things that work, too, used by people still living. And you can see who else it helped. I've lost loved ones to cancer and was determined to go natural, live or die. Praise the Lord, with prayer and these herbs/diet, and I walk daily as much as possible....I've lost 65 lbs. and the cancer, too. Praising His Name and grateful beyond words.   Blessings and prayers!",
