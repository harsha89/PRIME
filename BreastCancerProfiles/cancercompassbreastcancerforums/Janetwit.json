      "Content": "Hi Lisa, I was on Abraxane for 6 treatments and it didn't do anything for my tumors on my liver. I'm now on Avastin with Adriamycin and Cytoxcin. My doc had suggested we go to MD Anderson,but my family is in GA so I'm trying to go to Emory. I am very interested in this Stem Cell process. Would you mind telling me how that will work? I hadn't thought of that, but it does make perfect sense. Jan",

      "Content": "It was a fluke. They could not do my sentinel node biopsy because it is in my check. My radiation onco brought up my case at the hospital tumor board and suggested I have a chest CT to see if my nodes were enlarged and that's when they saw something on my liver then I had a liver biopsy. Autually 2 of them. I had a PET scan too, but the doc who read that said it was neg, but my doc that did the bio said he didn't think it was neg. It's best to get a lot of docs to view all your test. I feel fortunate,but I'm still seeking opinions from a large institute as well. I want to cover all my basis and feel that I have made the right decision and not just the doc. My doc actually encourages that. Good luck. Jan",

      "Content": "Hi Sheela V. I am also 46. BC with METS to liver. Had lumpectomy in November. ER+/HER2NU-. They could not do any lymph node biopsy because my sentinel node is in my chest. Just a fluke that they found the tumors on my liver by CT scan. I had 6 treatments of ABRAXANE. Didn't shrink any of my tumors. Starting tomorrow I go on Adriamycin and Cytoxcin with Avastin. Not sure what they will do if this doesn't show any improvement after 2 treatments. I may have to go to MD Anderson in TX. I live on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi where the hurricane hit.",

      "Content": "Lisa, Thanks so much for the information. I'll talk to my Doc about it next week. He does refer a lot of his patients to MD Anderson. We're near New Orleans, so Houston is not out of the question. I had originally said that I wanted to go to MD, but at that time my doc didn't think it was necessary. Just want to go where they can give me the best treatment and alternatives. Jan",
