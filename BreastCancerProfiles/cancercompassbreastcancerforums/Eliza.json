    "Content": "I have been taking Femara now for 5 years this August. All of a sudden in April of this year I discovered a large bald spot that the Doctors can't explain. Severe joint pains, but learning to deal with it. Went to a dermatologist who has me using a topical steroid and the hair is returning, but it's White! She says it will probably change back to the natural color. My liver enzymes have remained elevated since chemo and radiation in 2001. Something strange going on... Eliza",
