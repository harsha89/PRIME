Please let me know if I can answer any other questions for you or help in any way.  There are several of us on the message board that remain in contact with one another who have had metaplastic carcinoma and are doing well.   Best wishes, Chris Hi There, My sister has Triple Negative Metaplastic Carcinoma, she has had chemo, radiation, and masectomy. At her last Doctors appointment I was with her and she had some questions that the Doctor couldn't/wouldn't answer. She wanted to know the prognosis of Triple Negative Metaplastic Carcinoma. Are there any patients who have had this and it has not returned? He just said that it is so rare that little is known about it.  She really would like to have more information, and I just want to help her so much.",
