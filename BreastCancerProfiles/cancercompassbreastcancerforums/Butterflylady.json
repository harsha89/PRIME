    "Content": "I was on arimidex for 5 1/2 years.  I ended up getting cancer in my other side and it was estrogen positive also.  My doctor said, after I finish treatment again, he is going to put me on tamoxifen, since the arimidex obviously lost it's punch for me.  I am leary of taking tamoxifen because if the armidex didn't work, will it.",
