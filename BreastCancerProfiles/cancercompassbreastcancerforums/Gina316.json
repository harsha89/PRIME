      "Content": "hey debra, That is such a cute idea and right up my Mom's alley! I think she'll love it. Thanks for the support and suggestions. I have definitely learned that it is the little things that make the biggest impact. Keep doing what you are doing. I know you are making people very happy. I would be more than willing to talk to any teenagers about what we are all going through. And also willing to talk about anything else. Feel free to give my screen name for instant messenger out to anyone that would want to talk. ginabeana316",

      "Content": "I just wanted to thank everyone for their conrtibution to this discussion. It is amazing how helpful it is just to know that other people are in the same or similar positions. I just spent a great weekend with my mom. She came up to visit me at Penn State and it was her, me and my aunt all weekend. It was great. And she looks great too! A little tired but overall she is doing very well. If anyone knows any teens that would want to talk about cancer (or about anything but cancer!) please pass on my instant messenger screen name to them. (ginabeana316) Hope all is well with everyone. You are in my prayers.",

      "Content": "I am a 21 year old college student and my mother has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, she will be 51 this friday. I was hoping I could get some insight into how to help her as much as possible. My mother is a very independent and strong woman. She is my idol. But she RARELY asks for help and will not admit to having a crappy day of feeling bad. To make things even more complicated, my sister passed away two years ago from a battle with cancer herself. She was 22. I want to be there for my mom as much as possible and still give her her space. we talk when she wants to and I do what I can to be there, but not ALWAYS be there, kind of give her her space and privacy. Does anyone have any suggestions for little things I can do to help her through this?",
