    "Content": "Adenocarcinoma is basically a tumor of the glandular tissue. Metastatic basically means that it came from another site within the body and the current location is not the location of origin. For instance... my father had a mass in his liver about a year ago. Had surgery and it was completely removed.  A year later, they found some nodules in his lung, and deemed it as Metastatic since the pathology report shows that the type of cancer is the same as what was found in his liver a year ago.  This means, that the cancer most likely stayed in his bloodstream and metastisized (moved or migrated) to his lung. Did you have cancer elsewhere in your body, prior to this diagnosis?",
