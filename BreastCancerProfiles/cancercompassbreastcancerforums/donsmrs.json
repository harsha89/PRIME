      "Content": "Not sure if this will work for you or not, but seems to work for me. I use \"One,\" a hair cleanser for straight hair (there is also one for curly hair) which I bought for around $13.00 a bottle at Sally's. (\"One\" is Sally's Beauty Supply's answer to the WEN products). I only wash my hair twice a week, and \"lather,\" up twice when I do it. Then I follow with  a nickel-sized daub of Original Argan Oil, which I also bought at Sally's. Don't wast the money on the cheaper argan oil product. It did not help my hair. Take that dab of argan oil and rub it between the palms of your hands to your finger tips. Then start by running your fingers mid-hair shaft to the ends of the strands, and I wipe the excess on my hands off on a towel to prevent applying too much. It can be applied too heavily so instead of preventing the broken and split ends, common to both chemo hair and processed hair, and getting shiny hair to show for it, you get a glob of grease, and have to rewash. I also never use a blow dryer, and often go to bed with damp hair that has been towel dried, and combed through with a wide-tooth comb after this treatment. I do frequently use a curling iron, but only on a medium setting and sparingly applied when I do it. Am 2 years, 2 months post-chemo, and for me, those \"pattern baldness,\" spots are finally starting to fill in, even though my Arimidex literature says it can cause hair loss. I hear Tamoxifen does it too. I have chin-length hair, slowly growing back into the longer wedge style I had and loved when this mess all began in late 2011. I bleached it back to pale blonde almost as soon as I saw the steel-wool-patched-with-mud-spots color that grew back, a few months later. Said to myself, \"Self, you have been a great sport, but this simply will NOT happen, period!\" and headed right back to Sally's for coloring supplies. Would say that in my case, having short hair would and did simply expose those thin areas more, and longer blonde hair does seem to hide much of that. And, I think because I wore my wigs so long, (about 18 months) and that the bald areas were exactly where the wigs are the densest, probably didn't help, because it inpeded air and circulation to those damaged roots. Hope this helps!",

I think wigs will be my best friends now, because nothing else seems to be working.  If anyone finds an answer out there let us know.  Take care All. Hmmh!  I wonder what was in the chemo meds in 2006?  I too was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. 6 rounds of TAC, 40 rounds of radiation and 17 rounds of Herceptin.  I opted out of Tamoxifen and Arimidex, in favour of a holistic approach using Indole 3 Carbinol and Sulphorafane.  That said, my hair did not come back either.  I had AMAZING hair - it was my crowning glory - before treatments.  Physicians also gave the male pattern baldnes BS. I had tried everything from Nioxen to laser treatments to no avail.  GOOD NEWS though ... I started using a hair growth product from Aveda and supplementing with biotin (capsules), silica (tablets) and liquid Biosil.  Miraculously my hair is growing and people who have not seen me for a couple of months have even commented.   This is more than 7 years later, so there is hope :) Hypothyroidism IS frequently a factor in both scalp hair loss and eyebrow loss near the temple areas. There are new testing standards for the TSH and Free T3 and Free T4, so you might  find that you need some synthroid, where 10 years ago, with the same test result numbers, you didn't. In my case, I found out I was hypothyroid 2 years before I got breast cancer. But, after diagnosis, surgery andcompleting chemo, when I went on Arimidex and my estrogen levels dropped, the synthroid dose turned out to be too high. We could tell by the lab tests and because it caused an atrial arrhythmia which went away in about 5 days or so when we lowered my Synthroid dose. Estrogen as a hormone, decreases natural thyroid hormone production. So, when the estrogen is suppressed by Tamoxifen or Arimidex, if you already take Synthroid, it's a good idea to get the Free T3, Free T4 and TSH checked after the first 60 days or so, to be sure the current dose is not too high. For those who think they might need some thyroid supplement, you might still need it even on the estrogen suppression medication. The correct level of thyroid also protects the heart, so getting checked is a good idea. With respect to hair loss, if it is due to low thyroid, serious improvement won't show up for a few weeks to a few months. Hair follicles seem to be among the last to get the help, is all.",

Sometimes, without rhyme or reason, the thyroid might quit working up to speed. You need all 3 tests (they aren't that pricey, if the ins. doesn't cover it), initially because it is rare but possible that the TSH is kind of normal and even the Free T4 is kind of normal and the Free T3 is low. That can cause pattern baldness, too. If so, it takes about 6-8 months of taking prescription thyroid medication for the hair to grow back in. At least it's worth investigating.",

      "Content": "Hi!  Hypothyroidism has lots of causes and can produce 20 diffreret symptoms. I had 17 of them. When my doc wanted to rtreat each complasint separately, I said no-deal, the common denominator was a need for Synthroid, not polypharmacy. Among other things, hypothyroidism causes hair to thin or fall out in patches. It is very common. I bought my first wig 2 years before I got breast cancer just for that reason. After 6 months and 3 appointments, my family doc finally caved-in, prescribed a low dose of Synthroid and retested my TSH and Free T4 and Free T4, a month later and sent the blood to a different lab, this time. The TSH came back essentially normal but the T3 and T4 were in the toilet, lower than when a different lab had run them when I was NOT on synthroid. (That says a lot!). So, no matter what your doctor says, TSH, which tests the pituitary gland's ability to send a message to your thyroid, can still be in a normal range but your thyroid might still be under-producing. TSH alone, therefore, is NOT a valid assdessment of the thyroid. My hair grew back in, after about 6 months on Synthroid, and I lost the hypothyroid weight after about 2 years. Good luck!    donsmrs",

Dear mmilas,   Yes, arimidex can cause hypertension. It's in the drug manual. Other patients report glucose elevation. That is usually associated with weight gain. My weight gain was fluid in my legs, so I got fit for 20-30 compression knee high stockings I wear daily, and the weight went down in a few days. But I also cut way back on carbs and sweets, so I am actually losing weight. (needed to). Exercise in the form of just a good, casual walk early in the morning when it is cool outside, is good for all of that. I am now up to a mile a day, and think it helps, and might be worth a try.   Hope this helps!",

I take Calcium and Vitamin D3 with supper daily and get Prolia injections every 6 months. My D3 levels are monitored so that they are in the normal range before I get the Prolia injections. For lower leg swelling and fatigue side effects, I wear knee high compression stockings, and I walk every day or use the elliptical trainer we have.   Claritin taken at bedtime seemed to prevent neuropathy both with chemo and with the Arimidex. When I became allergic to the Claritin, my family doc recommended Zyrtec for my allergies, and even this drug seems to also prevent neuropathy. No one knows why this stuff works. It just does. No bone pain. I had a back ache for awhile until I placed a 3/4 inch plywood sheet under the mattress, and that cured the back ache overnight.  At 67, I am at the far end of flashes, but I do have to sleep in a cool environment so my husband adds an extra blanket on his side of the bed. I work full time, have my office at home, and to help me keep my job, my oncologist spread my chemo over 6 months instead of over 4, to prevent the extreme nausea and fatigue. He said the overall survival percentage diffrerence between chemo for 4 months and chemo for 6 months was 2-3%, so not a big deal.  It may have played a role in less memory loss issues. I had far worse memory issues before I was treated for  hypothyroidism. THAT was a nightmare. Could you possibly have low thyroid? Insomnia and mood swings go with that in some people.

      "Content": "Hi AyJayBeeGee,    Trigger joints are usually from arthritis which Arimidex can certainly aggravate/ exacerbate. But even people who don't take Arimidex get trigger joints with some forms of arthritis. The only real fix I know of is an outpatient surgery to release/ relax the tendon. It's less of a big deal than the surgery for hammer toes, but the surgery doies need to be done by an orthopedic surgeon with tons of successful experience operating on hands.   Arimidex can also cause female body tissue to shrink to the point where urinary tract infections start occurring.  I had never had a UTI in my life, and now at age 64 have had 2 in 6 months on Arimidex. So, I did what many hospitals are doing: I stated taking Cranberry Extract capsules, one with breakfast and the other with supper. That herbal solution also requires some research because only a few brands offer the cranberry extract without  any soy product in them. Sundown brand does not have the soy and Sams Club sells one that also does not have the soy in the contents. The Sundown label says to take 4 capsules a day but the hospitals do just fine preventing UTI's  with 2 capsules, one twice a day, each about the same strength as the Sundown brand. Cranberry Extract will not treat an existing UTI. That takes a visit to the doctor and an antibiotic. But taken twice a day, it can prevent a UTI from occurring. On the other hand, an overload of Cranberry Extract can cause some blood thinning, even a little anemia because of the tannins found in the cranberry, in case anyone wants to know. So, you want to probably linit this to whatever your doctor says is wise. You can Google that tannin info, if anyone is curious.    Back to the Arimidex, don't give up. Any other drug prescribed  to reduce estrogen levels can also aggravate/ invite arthritis. And the drugs certainly beat chemo!   All the best!     donsmrs",

I felt as though my husband got the shitty end of the deal, he could only watch, drive, and hope.  So please take care of yourself. My surgeon on the first visit asked if we were talking to a therapist, yes, and with the huge intrusion of CANCER, we needed a place to talk. I felt at times I was being treated as a child, and it can be a vivicous cycle.  If your wife won't go then see about care giver groups available in your area. Both of you are going through this, both of you.  As a mom, you worry about dying, as a father you wonder how can I can i do this by myself.  The cost of care, insurance is also a huge stressor. The treatment is so tough, you don't have much spare energy.  You are an easy target. Your kids understand the level of stress and they too have reactions.  Be honest with the kids, answer their questions (age appropriate). I didn't find the women breast cancer support groups very helpful, I am not chasing treatments so I didn't want to hear the latest chemo side effects stories.  That was me, it is different for everyone.  Oh and that is another thing, \"everyone is different\", I wanted the straight answer, no soft fuzzy answer, it made me madder dealing with the health care folks who said that. Take care, if you want to convo more send me a private message.   I hope it gets better, and intimacy well, I'll leave that alone for the time being. Andrea When I was getting chemo for breast cancer, my husband only drove me to the first appointment for the Adriamycin and Cytoxan and again the first appointment for the 12 weeks of Taxol. I told the onc that because my husband was a fully-employed pilot, I would have to drive myself. Then we reviewed the drugs needed to prevent reactions, added Zofran and eliminated the Emend, (caused terrible, unrelenting headaches for 6-8 days afterward), and no Ativan or Phenergan or Compazine. We kept the necessary steroid and another IV non-sedating antiemetic (for chemo, only, and without sedating effects, and worked great, but whose name I forget) in the program.  There were no problems during or after. Sometimes I snozzed during the big IV treatments but usually brought a book to read. The big thing is, it preserved most of my independence and kept me, pretty-much, mentally and physically in charge, and also able to work daily in my home office.  Having done this, my take on it is, if you take all the stuff offered to you, you will feel drugged. Some women prefer it. I have two, very intelligent friends who swear by IV Ativan for chemo, for example.  It was just not for me and I was able to lead a fairly normal life, kept my job and all. The bigger challenge, to me, would be remembering to address this early-on, either before chemo or after the first treatment, and set up the right game plan with your onc, that works for you. Sometimes women are so stunned by their diagnosis, that they can't think as clearly as they normally would. The trick is to put those thoughts on hold, realize that breast cancer hits 1 in every 8 women, and now it's time to meet that demon head-on! We are women, after all. WE can do anything!",

I agree. Was very angry myself, but only because I had breast cancer, so I channeled my wrath to the cancer. Each day, I got up, got dressed, put on make-up, and did everything in my power to ignore the cancer, and live normally. On the chemo days, those were treated as necessary evils, and I tried to keep those days as positive as possible. Many drugs to control side effects have their own side effects, and when that happened, I drew the line and sat down with the onc and told him which of the non-chemo drugs I wanted to stop. Was not about to take yet a third drug for the side effects from the drugs given to prevent nausea from the first drug, the chemo. Fortunately, he was very understanding, (very dubious, but understanding), so I got my way. Turns out I knew my body the best, and knew I didn't need stuff that gave me headaches and made me goofy.  That prevented the extra days of feeling low, sad or bad from all those extra meds, believe me. And I didn't get nauseated.  It allowed me to focus on my consulting business. Now, the chemo will make you tired. I would plan a visit, exuding pep and energy, to a single client as my only activity in a given day because that's all the energy I had to work with. I would come home and plop face-down on the bed for hours afterward. You have to come to terms with that and treat your energy as having only so much money in your purse. When it's gone, it's gone. Some days, I'd go get groceries. My husband cooked for us about half the time while I was on the Adriamycin and Cytoxan, but I did the laundry and ironing. Neighbors were asked NOT to call or drop by, during daytime hours. This was because if I didn't sleep the night before, I would be napping and if I was not napping, I would be working in my office and would not have spare time for visits. Plainly stated, they knew not to stop by when I didn't have cancer, and had my office at home, and this was really no different.  Hope this is useful info.",

It's also good for soothing the alimentary tract. But, it is high in potassium, so those with kidney function issues need to ask the doc first.

I felt as though my husband got the shitty end of the deal, he could only watch, drive, and hope.  So please take care of yourself. My surgeon on the first visit asked if we were talking to a therapist, yes, and with the huge intrusion of CANCER, we needed a place to talk. I felt at times I was being treated as a child, and it can be a vivicous cycle.  If your wife won't go then see about care giver groups available in your area. Both of you are going through this, both of you.  As a mom, you worry about dying, as a father you wonder how can I can i do this by myself.  The cost of care, insurance is also a huge stressor. The treatment is so tough, you don't have much spare energy.  You are an easy target. Your kids understand the level of stress and they too have reactions.  Be honest with the kids, answer their questions (age appropriate). I didn't find the women breast cancer support groups very helpful, I am not chasing treatments so I didn't want to hear the latest chemo side effects stories.  That was me, it is different for everyone.  Oh and that is another thing, \"everyone is different\", I wanted the straight answer, no soft fuzzy answer, it made me madder dealing with the health care folks who said that. Take care, if you want to convo more send me a private message.   I hope it gets better, and intimacy well, I'll leave that alone for the time being. Andrea When I was getting chemo for breast cancer, my husband only drove me to the first appointment for the Adriamycin and Cytoxan and again the first appointment for the 12 weeks of Taxol. I told the onc that because my husband was a fully-employed pilot, I would have to drive myself. Then we reviewed the drugs needed to prevent reactions, added Zofran and eliminated the Emend, (caused terrible, unrelenting headaches for 6-8 days afterward), and no Ativan or Phenergan or Compazine. We kept the necessary steroid and another IV non-sedating antiemetic (for chemo, only, and without sedating effects, and worked great, but whose name I forget) in the program.  There were no problems during or after. Sometimes I snozzed during the big IV treatments but usually brought a book to read. The big thing is, it preserved most of my independence and kept me, pretty-much, mentally and physically in charge, and also able to work daily in my home office.  Having done this, my take on it is, if you take all the stuff offered to you, you will feel drugged. Some women prefer it. I have two, very intelligent friends who swear by IV Ativan for chemo, for example.  It was just not for me and I was able to lead a fairly normal life, kept my job and all. The bigger challenge, to me, would be remembering to address this early-on, either before chemo or after the first treatment, and set up the right game plan with your onc, that works for you. Sometimes women are so stunned by their diagnosis, that they can't think as clearly as they normally would. The trick is to put those thoughts on hold, realize that breast cancer hits 1 in every 8 women, and now it's time to meet that demon head-on! We are women, after all. WE can do anything!",
