I was HER2 Neg PR/ER Pos. Heard of Herceptin do you think it will work for me Herceptin is for her 2 positive br. cancer.  I dont think it works on hormonally driven cancers?  I finished up my 4 rounds of harsh chemo in April but 2 months later a tumor popped up along side my esophogus in the hilar region of the right lung.  I thought the harsh chemo would keep any recurrence from occuring for quite a while but it didnt.  So thankfully I was able to have 10 radiation treatments that targeted just the tumor that was growing..  suppose to be a 90% success rate and I'm hoping that this is going to be the case?  I feel very fortunate to have survived 15 years past my original diagnosis in 01.. ",

      "Content": "I too am fighting bc.mets to rt. lung. I have been since 2007. Herceptin which is an infusion, kept my mets in remission for 7 years. In the spring the herceptin quit working, which a sad occurence because it was very easy to take and the side effects were very minimal.  I am er/pr neg, and pos. for the her 2 gene. This is the type of cancer that the herceptin works on.  I was to receive the pills also but insurance would not authorize them..  One is Zeloda and the other is Tykerb.  Now that I know what the awful side effects are for these pills, which is what I have heard from many  patients on these pills, I am glad I havent had to endure the side effects from taking them.  Instead though my only option was to be given more stronger chemo to try and shrink the one tumor in my right lung that is trying to do me in.  I have been fighting since 2001..and it has been a long journey.  I consider myself a veteran survivor!!  Best of wishes to you.. ",

      "Content": "I would very much like to hear from a breastca victim who has had these three chemo drugs??  I begin next Monday on a three month tunnel of these drugs.  I am stage lV, mets to right lung.  I have been told that I am at the end of the road on what they have to offer me.  I have fought this disease for 15 years, beginning in 01 with a stage 1 simple tumor in left br. I was treated and went 6 years in remission.  In 07 it was dignosed in my medistinal nodes and a tumor in right lung.  Again I was in remission on herceptin until this past spring when the herceptin stopped working. Now I am facing either trying the only chemo drugs left or only having 3-6 months to stay living.  I would like to hear from anyone who has had the trio of chemo i mentioned above..thank you..  I am a veteran survivor..hoping to be a long living survivor at that!!",
