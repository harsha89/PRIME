    "Content": "My twin sister was diagnosed with stage I estrogen receptive, HER2 negative breast cancer in late August of this year. We are 33 the same age our mother was when diagnosed in the 70's. Unfortunately our Mom didn't live past 35 years old. My sister had a lumpectomy with sentinel node removal about 3 weeks ago. The pathology report revealed 1 of the 2 nodes were cancerous as well as 3 of the 6 margins. The tumor once believed to be .9centimeter was actually over 1 centimeter. Her diagnosis is now stage II. She is now faced with another surgery and the decision of having a mastectomy or a 2nd lumpectomy with node removal. The Dr is insisting on chemotherapy because of her age. My sister is leaning towards a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction to ease her mind and lower the percentage of recurrence. We are wondering if she can just opt for hormone therapy instead of chemo? She is not married and without children. Her fertility means the world to her. She is actually considering declinig chemo because she is scared she will be infertile after the treatments. Does anyone know what a young woman can do to preserve her fertility with chemo? Would it be foolish of her just to go with the horomonal therapy?",
