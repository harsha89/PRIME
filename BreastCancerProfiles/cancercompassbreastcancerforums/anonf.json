    "Content": "The best advice I can give, as a cancer patient myself, is to let your friend be the gatekeeper of her own information and share with you as she sees fit. If she received any more than 4-6 cycles of chemo, I'd imagine it was because she was diagnosed with stage IV cancer at the outset. There is no cure; some treatments prolong life and keep the tumor burden under control for a time; some are aimed at keeping life comfortable. None of us can accurately pinpoint her condition without full information. And it is her right to share or withhold this information from friends and acquaintances.  Your friend is facing complex decision-making and a world of hurt. Offer to visit or to provide specific help if you can think of anything appropriate, and listen. Beyond that, MYOB. Resist the common impulse to inject your own drama.",
