    "Content": "I read through all of the responses dealing with these medications. I had very agressive chemo, radiation, tamoxifen for five years, femara for two, and now amromasin. I am seriously considering that enough is enough. I have been very fatigued, have aches and pains, headaches galore, and feel very old. I never realized that the meds were doing this. I blame myself for not doing the research. All of your comments have been very helpful. I just saw that the meds should be used for a combined five years. I am way over that!!I just made my decision to go off of the aromasin for two weeks, keep a record of how I feel, and then call my doctor. I do think that they get too bogged down with the statistics, which are not guarantees, and neglect to hear what we are really saying. The reason I wrote is because of the last message that I read. It made me LOL because you said that it took care of your ingrown toenail!!! That should now be listed as a side effect. However, which medicine did it?? Or, was it just tired of being known as an ingrown pain in the nail!!!! I hope that with stopping for two weeks, I will be painfree and possibly lose some weight. That would be WONDERFUL!!! I really appreciate all of your comments. It is too bad that the adage, \"Misery loves company\", is really the truth. I hope that we all feel better soon. Good Luck! Karen",
