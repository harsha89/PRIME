      "Content": "Hi is anyone experiencing swollen ankles and pitting edema of lower legs from Aromosin . My Lipitor was raised up to 20mg about the same time I started Aromosin so not sure which is causing it. I also developed tendonitis and burchitis of right shoulder and hip pain I have only one more year until my 5year anniversary and am thinking about quiting the med Femara was much worse for side effects. Thanks",

      "Content": "I'm coming up on four years out of stage 2 breast cancer I had a bilateral mastectomy{my choice} chemo and radiation. I went through that with ease and good outlook. I did Tamoxifan for 3years and was recently started on Femara and then I started to ache and my ankles started to swell. I was switched to Aromasin and same side effects came back. I have a flare-up of bursitis and tendinitis in both shoulders,Carpal Tunnel Trigger Finger {  will need surgery] and a right hip which is very painful to sleep on I feel like I've aged 10 years It's good to know others are having these same side effects. Some days I feel like a chronic complainer!!  It scares me to think of the consequences if I continue to take these drugs and I hope in another year that will be it. I love to walk and used to be more active but now it hurts!!! Will try the baby aspirin and continue to live on ibuprofin",
