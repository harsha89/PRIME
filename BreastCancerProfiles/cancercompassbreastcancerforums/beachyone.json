      "Content": "I was on Femara for 9 month until I hurt so bad head to toe, I couldn't get out of bed.  After 3 month off that, I tried Aromasin.  12 days later my fingers were so puffy and painful I couldn't touch my palms.  My ulcerative colitis also had been in a non-stop flare.  I had an appt that day with the ortho hand Dr.  He said blocking hormones can cause an inflammatory response, I had to get a cortisone shot.  My oncologist told me to stop, I will try tamaxifen next.",
