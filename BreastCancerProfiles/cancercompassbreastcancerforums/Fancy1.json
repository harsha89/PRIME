    "Content": "Hi...I am new here and wanted to post a similar question about microcalcifications. I am 39 and have been tracking a \"cluster\" of microcalcifications on my right breast for about 2 years now. I went in for my first mammogram and they saw them. We did ultra sound and the magnified mammogram as well. Since then I have been brought back in at 3 months, 3 months, 6 months, 6 months, and yesterday at 6 months. They say that the calcifications haven't changed...but now they want to do an MRI as well. I have very dense breasts (although small :-) and my mother had stage 2 breast cancer and got a mastectomy 3 years ago. So I guess the family history is definitely there. My question...I will obviously do the MRI as the radiologist suggests, but should I demand a biopsy of the calcifications as well? If they are so concerned about them to make me come back every 6 months, wouldn't it be better to biopsy them so that I can stop worrying about them? I know they are being cautious, which I appreciate, but this fear keeps getting put in my head every 6 months. Any suggestions? Thanks",
