      "Content": "  On 9/20/2007 Leemg wrote: I was diagnosed with stage l BC, estrogen/prog. positive, Her neg. and was post menapausal at that time 4 years ago.  I had a lumpectomy (plus) and an additional biopsy in that breast at that time.  After surgery I went through 7 weeks of radiation and then started Femara which was the new kid on the block.  Because I also have osteoporosis and Femara can deplete calcium I get Zometa infusions, in the beginning every 4 months  now every 6 months as I cannot take Fosamax like medication due to GERD.  If you can tolerate Fosamax type meds this would be the first choice.  You should have a bone density if you have not already to see if you are currently suffering from osteoporosis or osteopenia particulary if you are placed on Femara.  There has been a new osteoporosis drug which has recently been approved for BC patients as well, Avista.  It works in a similar fashion as the estrogen inhibitor drugs plus it gives you the benefit of protecting bone health.  I've tolerated the Femara very well and have been on it 3 years now but you medical oncologist will choose the best for your particular situation.  These added drugs definitely show a benefit when taken after surgery and radiation treatment.  Hope this helps! I have had a baseline osteoporpsis test and am at normal bone density.  I just dont want the radiation to reduce my bone density.  Thus, my request regarding taking any suppliments?  Calcium,magnesium, vit E, etc?",

      "Content": "I need to hear from women of my age--post menopausal (I'm 66). I've a lumpectomy (.8 cm, estr pos, Her2 neu-neg) and now have to have radiology.  What about arimadex or other estragen inhibitors?  I don't need chemotherapy.  If you've had a similar diagnosis what was your experience.  I've yet to see my oncologist but I want to ask the important questions both about radiation treatment and about any further drugs. What about any suppliments?  more calcium?  More anti-ovidents?  More what>",
