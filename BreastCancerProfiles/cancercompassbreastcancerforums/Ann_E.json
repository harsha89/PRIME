      "Content": "Hello: Regarding lymphedema, I have a massage therapist who spends 1/3 of his time working at a lymphedema clinic in Denver doing lymphatic massage. I have witnessed the (incredible) effects of lymphatic massage and the related reduction in post-surgical swelling in my right leg/ankle/foot. The results are temporary, but provide immediate relief from the edema as well as the obvious notable change in physical appearance (my right foot/ankle/leg looks NORMAL for a few days after treatment). Lymphatic massage requires much training and certification which is very expensive; there aren't many CMTs who are trained in this realm. I would suggest doing a GOOGLE search to find a practioner in your area. If you don't have any luck, feel free to e-mail me and I will have my therapist contact you in this regard. Good luck!",
