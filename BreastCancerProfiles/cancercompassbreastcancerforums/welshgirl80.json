    "Content": "Hi, I am wondering if someone can help me. I've been on the pill for 6 months now and it's changed my breasts. They are both warm and tender, and I am worried. My doctor doesnt think its anything to worry about but I am worried. Why would they be warm and tender? This is something to worry about it?",
