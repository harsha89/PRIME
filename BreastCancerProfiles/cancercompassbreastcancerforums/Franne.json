      "Content": "Thanks for the reply.  I have heard that the Oncologists do make money off the drugs they prescribe.  Pretty scarey, huh? I truly feel good about my decision and won't let myself be influenced to take something that I don't feel is safe.  And, thanks for the hero comment, but I really don't think of myself as a hero, just another person who is surviving cancer.  Please wish your Mom the best from me. And, thank you again for your comments.",

I am so confused.  Can anyone share their experiences with the Arimidex?  I would truly appreciate any advice.",
