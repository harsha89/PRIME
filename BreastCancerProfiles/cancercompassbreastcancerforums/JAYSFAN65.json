    "Content": "I was diagnosed with Breast cancer in my left breast.   March. Surgery in April\u2026chemo from May \u2013 Sept\u2026.radiation from Oct \u2013 Dec.  Stage 2B,. with a very small grade 3 lump removed from my lymph nodes.  I found a lump on my opposite side while I was having treatment\u2026.was sure it was nothing but I had an ultrasound just to be safe.  They weren\u2019t concerned about it\u2026but scheduled a follow-up which I had Monday.  They found 3 nodules which look suspicious and I have to have them all biopsied tomorrow.  I\u2019m somehwhat concerned since I know that it \u201ccan\u201d happen to me, and although I did pretty good during all the treatment..I don\u2019t want to have it again .  But my head is spinning\u2026..would it even be possible to get a new lump while I was having chemo ? Or perhaps it was already on the other side but even still\u2026\u2026.wouldn\u2019t the 6 bouts of chemo have killed it ?",
