    "Content": "AMEN!!!  I was on Tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years minus 2, 6 week drug holidays because of severe headaches one time and general,\"can't take it anymore\" the second time.  In a nut shell, Tamoxifen robs you of your quality of life, while weakening your body to be more susceptable to other diseases.  It disrupts your body's immune and hormone systems.  Hormones run everything in your body. Robbing your body of estrogen has its own set of side effects. It is time women took some responsibility for their own health without acting like little robots.  Conventional doctors are bound to pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies and what they prescribe.  Doctors are not even allowed to tell you if there is alternative treatment.  They can only provide surgery, radiation/chemotherapy and drugs.  These drugs will need other drugs to counteract the side effects of the first drug.  The older you get the worse the cycle. I love my doctor, but I do my homework.  He thinks I am going to try one of the other drugs when I am totally post menopausel, but he is wrong. I was 49 when diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma with a micromet in one lymph node.  I had a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy with reconstruction.  He said chemo would only have added 1-2% toward my nonrecurrance rate and said it wasn't worth the horror.  I am currently looking for some way to prevent the night time hot flashes that wake me up every 1-2 hours all night long.  I am currently using the progesterone cream and taking an Estroven.  Sleeping pills don't help much and they have lousy side effects.  Anybody got a natural suggestion that has worked for them?",
