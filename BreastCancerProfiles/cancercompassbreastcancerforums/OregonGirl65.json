    "Content": "Hi I am new here and would love your thoughts on this. I am 50 years old and have 4 pea sized axillary lymph nodes that are not movable and very hard. My last Mammogram was April 2015 and nothing showed, just very dense breasts. I have had my mammograms most every year since 1999 when I had 3 core biopsies and surgery to remove milk ducks and a large mass from my left breast. I was told back then that no cancer was found but had cancer markers. I was just put on Tomoxifen for 5 years and watched. always come back no change but still very dense breasts. Never was sent for an MRI or PET scan. Now last week I noticed 2 pea size hard axillary nodesÂ under my arm and 2 days ago I found 2 more swollen axillary lymph nodes just down fro my armpit and next to my right breast. I also noticed my right breast getting bigger and swollen around to the side. I really dont feel any lumps, Just some thickening. no pitting, rednees or orange pill pits. My question is Monday I am set up for a 3D Mammogram bilateral,Ultrasound Breast Compleat Right and Biopsy. Does the 3D Mammogram see better thru dense breasts? And how does this sound to you? Thanks for your help",
