Hi. I also feel sad that you are going through so much. Your husband didn't realize what a strong quality wife he had. You deserve someone with compassion & strength. I also have metastatic breast cancer. Triple negative which spread to lymph nodes under my arm , lungs, bones (mostly spine) and now, my liver. I have some great news about a new treatment that I recently qualify for and am hoping you may be able to try this too if it works. So far, I have heard all positive news about it. It is spot treatments. I wil find out more about it and get back to you if you are interested. The doctor uses chemo and microwave. First they go into the cancer with chemo, then block off the blood vessels around the cancer so the cancer can't be fed from the vessels. The day after, they treat it with microwave.Â  You will be in my prayers and just remember, you have people all around you who are fighting cancer and we care about you and understand. Hope to hear from you! Jilliann",
