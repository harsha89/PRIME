    "Content": "I'm 48 and went for my first mammogram last year.  I got the \"call back\" for a second mammogram AND ultrasound. The white spot they found on my mammogram turned out to be a cyst on my left breast.  I got the \"all clear\" for a year.  I went for my annual mammogram this year and got the call back again for another mammogram and ultrasound.   This time, during the ultrasound, the doctor said she tought she saw something solid in the cyst from last year.  She looked agan and ran color through the arear in question.  She didn't see anything this time.  I offered up the fact that I had an MRI scheduled in about month. (My Gyno's nurse told me I was eligible for an MRI based on my family history when she called me to schedule this appointment. ) The doctor told me that they would probalby not see anything different than what we saw that day, but to go ahaed and have the MRI> I had the MRI done and I got the call that there were \"enhancing arease on BOTH bresasts.\"  I was then scheduled for ANOTHER ultrasoud.  They found nothing at all other than a few small cysts on my right breast now as well as the large one on my left.   Now I have to go back for an MRI led biopsy on something that was not showing on mammogram OR ultrasound.  Has this ever happeded to anybody else?  What was the outcome?  Just trying to make sense of all this.  ",
