    "Content": "My Mum was diagnosed last October with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy in December and went through 6 months of chemo. This October she got sick from Pneumonia and we discovered that her cancer had spread to her lungs. The doc diagnosed it as HER2+ with malignant pleural effusion. He said this is a very agressive form of cancer and that she has a 10-15% survival rate. She was hospitalized and is now on a vent. She started chemo Gemzar and Herceptin...and I believe something else butÂ the name slipped my mind....I am curious to know if anyone has any information they could share with me regarding this.Has anyone been in a similar situation? I am very scared, sad, angry about the whole situation. any info would be great, please feel free to ask questions also. Thanks....Lesley",
