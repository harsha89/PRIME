      "Content": "I´ve just been told by my best friend that was operated yesterday that she has got breast cancer. She is really young, 28, and I was wondering if this was better in the sense that she can battle against this disease with more chances than older people. I really don´t know what to tell her to make her feel better, I would like survivors to tell me what you hated and got on your nerves and what you really appreciated from the people around you. The strong point in our friendship is humour, and perhaps I can make her laugh despite all this. What are the first days like? How did you feel and what did you want? Please, I need to know.    ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your replies and suggestions. My friend will go under treatment- radiation for now- and will be operated on 2 more times. Her therapist has helped her to deal with this in the best possible way-staying positive. I found your tips very helpful, I try to stay around and provide practical help, make her laugh and when she feels like talking about this, let her do it.   ",
