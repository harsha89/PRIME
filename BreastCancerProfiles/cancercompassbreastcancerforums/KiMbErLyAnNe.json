      "Content": "My sister is 36 and we found out in the beginning of Oct 08 that she has stage IV breast cancer.  The only reason we found it was because she has pain in her tummy and they discovered the tumors in the liver...it has now spread to her bones and is on several of her vertebraes on her spine.  She was very ill in the hospital because her liver wasn't working and now she is getting Taxol weekly and Herceptin every 3 weeks...the doctor has given us no prognosis.  She has 3 daughters and we want to know what to expect as far as a timeline?  When she was in the hospital he told my other sister he gave her 6-12 months we didn't tell anybody and now that she looks better we are glad because maybe he was wrong and he said that becuase she was very ill.  Everytime they check her blood they tell us the liver is working better because of the biliruben results.  But what do we need to expect with it on the spine and in the bones.",

Her daughter is a senior this year after the doctor told us that short timeline it scared us to think she wouldn't see her graduate . Thank you for the positive info she is a fighter so we should get through this fine. God bless you and be with you through this storm in your life.",
