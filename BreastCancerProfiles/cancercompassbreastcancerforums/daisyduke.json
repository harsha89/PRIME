      "Content": "So sorry to hear this.  When was your radiation?  I still can not wear a bra for more than a few hours.  I have to wear one for work, but by the end of the day, go into my office and take it off.  When I am not at work, I just don't wear one.  Stretching is very helpful.  If you can find a good massage therapist to do myofascial release of the scar tissue, that is good also.  The first time I had it done, I felt like someone just released a tight belt around my chest, and I could actually take a deep breath.  Radiation causes severe tissue damage to the chest and scar tissue.   Also, be mindful of any cough you might develop.  3 months after my radiation I developed something called, Eosinophilic Organizing Pneumonia.  My radiation oncologist told me it was not related to the radiation, but I had a pulmonary biopsy done and it was determined that is was radiation induced.  Symptoms include flu like symptoms, crackles in lungs, fatigue, weight loss.  A CAT scan showed ground glass opacities in my lung.  I have been on prednisone now for almost 3 years trying to get rid of this inflamatory process.  I will be on inhalers the rest of my life, and have permanent fibrotic changes to both my lungs.   I am not trying to freak you out about the lung issue, but be watchful for any symptoms and seek care if you do develop symptoms. Do try the stretching, yoga and massage.  Meditation also helps. The side effects of radiation are greatly under represented by radiation oncologist.  The facts need to be presented so we are better able to make a decision about our care and quality of life. All the best to you.",

      "Content": "Radiation, the gift that keeps on giving!  I too have now developed rib pain and will be going in to my internal medicine doctor to have it checked out, as my radiation oncologist has dismissed every side effect I have had and tried telling me it was from something else.  Four months after finishing my \"short course\" high intensity radiation for DCIS, I developed a cough and crackles in my lungs.  I am a nurse so I pulled out my stethescope and it did not sound good.  A chest xray revealed wide spread infiltrates on my left lung, the side I had the radiation on...I returned to my radiation oncologist who did a CT scan, which was grossly abnormal.  I was put on prednisone and the symptoms got better.  As I weaned off the prednisone the symptoms returned.  This time I went to a pulmonary doctor in another care system.  Long story, but the final diagnosis after a lung biopsy was Radiation induced eosinophilic pneumonia, with lung scarring and also another type of Radiation induced pneumonia, Organizing pneumonia.  Even after the lung biopsy with multiple experts and pathologist agreeing it was radiation induced, my radiaition oncologist tried to blame something else for causing this...\"maybe you have an underlying immunocompromising disorder that predisposed you to this\"....I never had anything wrong with me before radiation.  Now, I am experiencing rib pain as well and will get it checked out, but I totally understand the frustration and lack of ability to trust radiation oncologists when they are not up front with all the side effects and possible negative outcomes.  My quality of life after radiation is poor.  I hate to complain, but if I would have known the outcome, I would have opted not to have radiation.  I have been battling the lung issue for over a year now and am scared to death it is going to be a chronic condition.  The prednisone has taken a huge toll on my body as well.  I am writing this to inform others of possible side effects so they can make informed decisions about treatment options.",
