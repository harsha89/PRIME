      "Content": "Ok, I am compiling a list of treatments that could possibly work and will add to it because it is rather exhaustive. Like cancer treatments they are best used in cocktails(combinations) to avoid drug resistance. Cancer cells for sure have drug pumps that try to pump the chemo drug out as fast as you can pump it in.Whethe r normal and senescent cells do I cant find an answer because searches always lead to malignant cells. I assume normal and senescent cells do also. \"Resistance to anticancer drugs is often mediated by the overexpression of a membrane pump able to extrude many xenobiotics out of the tumour cells. The most frequently expressed of these pumps is called P-glycoprotein and is encoded by a gene called MDR1 (for multidrug resistance). \" Me: calcium channel blockers IIRC increase chemo drug effectiveness by blocking this. PMID:10354216  (pubmed.gov) So, this isn't going to be terribly organized but I will try to follow with \"some\" logic or a link to someone who has some.:) 1)cimetidine(OTC) orally at about 1500 mg/day.-PMID:3570585  In a hair loss forum I showed at that dose 1500mg/day likely did NOT reverse alopecia by being an effective anti-androgen. It was considered to be a poor candidate for treating female hirsuitism.Even strong anti-androgens arent that great for treating female hirsutism anyways or hair loss for that matter. Some of you that follow along and check the pubmed studies will find cimetidine is an immunostimulant and has some effectiveness in cancer(the common denominator in all these drugs between mpb and cancer related hair loss treatments).Cimetidine also has some effectiveness in treating warts topically too. My opinion is that cimetidine increases killer cells which eliminate sen cells. \"The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01), suggesting that the perioperative administration of cimetidine could help restore NK cells in colorectal cancer patients.\"PMID:12938523 2)Garlic- yes garlic. Nothing from nature could work right? ;) Well garlic is one substance that does increase killer cells and takes out senescent cells.  Aged garlic extract prevents a decline of NK cell number and activity in patients with advanced cancer.PMID: 16484572 Garlic could be useful in preventing the suppression of immune response associated with increased risk of malignancy as it stimulates the proliferation of lymphocytes, macrophage phagocytosis, stimulates the release of interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, and enhancesnatural killer cells.PMID : 19484634 3)MSM- here is one picture from a very good hair loss website about what MSM could do. MSM anti-cancer agent. http://immortalhair.forumandco.com/t8346-why-is-nobody-using Extra virgin olive oil- MASSIVE potential. There is a guy just using a nitric oxide donor(minoxidil) and EVOO and having good results with just that. Presumably the anti-cancer pathways dont overlap which is the whole goal of treatment. http://www.medicaldaily.com/olive-oil-compound-kills-cancer- More to come...",

      "Content": "Actually, the doctors may be right about the mpb connection. I have researched mpb since at least 1998 and can tell you some of the mechanisms of chemo and mpb overlap. Mainly,(manely would probably be better :), I am talking about senescence.  Mpb takes a different route to achieve senescence(androgens>ROS>DNA damage).Once DNA damage becomes great enough the cell becomes senescent avoiding cancer. Chemo damages the cancer cells of course but also damages once viable hair follicles. If that weren't bad enough we also have aging through different factors also creating senescent cells.  I began to notice along time ago that many of the things being used to treat mpb were also being tried and some effectiveness as cancer treatments or adjuncts. Even the well known miNOxidil is thought to be a NO(nitric oxide donor)  is being used for cancer. The reason I even started perusing cancer posts was because of a study that was done on one man who had actinic keratoses on his bald scalp. They gave him one treatment of 5-fluorouracil & a glucocorticoid to follow up with for 21 days.Six months after treatment the guy is still regrowing hair. What happened? I was obsessed to find an answer to this because I felt(no studies at THAT time) that the inner workings of mpb were senescence driven. Kligman a prominent dermatologist at that time said mpb is not senescent driven. But the Randall invitro study showed the dermal papilla were certainly acting senescent. What happened(I believe) was the one time fluorouracil treatment knocked out senescent cells but didnt damage surrounding structures like stem cells which would replace the now dead senescent ones. Remember, senescent cells dont divide(cell division creates hair). The stem cells aren't just going to create new dermal papilla because their are space considerations(when everything works correctly) called contact inhibition which is a cancer limiting system. Aubrey De Grey(well known anti-aging) expert says the best way at this time to get rid of senescent cells is just to use cancer drugs that dont hurt normal cells. Well, there are substances out there that do just that and work to some extent in treating mpb. Remember, senescence is the probably one of the main drivers of aging and does not exactly have a silver bullet one step cure.Eventu ally(I believe), Campisi will be able to find a way to get the immune system to recognize a senescent cell antigen and just get something like a vaccination and the immune system will take them out. Killer cells are the part of the immune system that is supposed to eliminate senescent cells. But remember aging occurs everywhere including in immune structures like the thymus and elsewhere. But there are substances out there called immuno-stimulants which can perhaps bring back normal immune function. So much more to say....I read at least 10k pubmed studies about hair loss and aging. This by NO means makes me an expert because mankind will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER even figure out the complexities in one human cell let alone tissues and organs and the feedback among all the systems of the body.  What I recommend is: using things that stimulate the immune system killer cells and using cocktails of substances which have demonstrated some anti-cancer activity in themselves. Cancer & presumably senescent cells also don't \"want\" to undergo apoptosis.  This is a list of potential things to take either orally or topically. You can check some of the mens hair loss groups out and see if you think they have any benefit. Senescence is senescence whether it go there by androgens or chemo or aging. I'm going to put the list in another post following this one shortly. I am just running out of time for today. There are some promising things ahead....",
