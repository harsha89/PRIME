      "Content": " KathyKreicas, I have no medical credentials, but I can offer you my son's experience, a 47 year old, was diagnosed with CLL about 15 years ago. His attending physician was one of the foremost research scientists in this area at Sunnybrook Health Centre in Toronto. While the doctor never engaged in any kind of pharmaceutical or chem option, he had one recommendation: bicycle riding!! As an avid bicycle rider himself, the doctor has witnessed this activity to bring CLL into total remission. So my son took up bicycle riding a few years ago. I don't know is this activity had anything to do with the outcome, but his diagnoses of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), has been downgraded to stable Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). He has really gotten into the biking thing though doing 120 km rides, the big Centurion 100 mile, 160 km mountain bikng ride. He a long way away this week, mountain biking in the Whiteface Mountains of the Adirondacks, getting prepped for the next big 100 mile mountain race. :-) Kathy, my intent is not to mislead you, because there is so much useless bogus stuff out there; I am only reporting on my observations of one person.",

A friend, after recovering from breast cancer, was diagnosed with lymphoma at the Stronach Cancer Centre. Instead of going through the traditional chemo etal, her European trained doctor he set her up for hyperthermia treatment at a his medical spa. After two treatments, they couldn't find any trace of lymphoma!! And that was two years ago!",

      "Content": "I wouldn't trust anything you might get from a notorious unregulated spammer scammer like Rick Simpson vending something of unknown substance and quality. I have a number of friends in Canada who are using cannabis, along with recommendations and a prescription from their doctor.  We have a number of highly regulated products available at legitimate pharmaceutical outlets. The government regulators subject these products to rigorous testing for quaility. My friends are very pleased with genuine products with appropriately prescribed THC/CTB ratios. There is no need to waste money on unregulated Rick Simpson junk.",
