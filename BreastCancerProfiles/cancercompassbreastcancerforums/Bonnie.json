      "Content": "Hello, My mother was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer in nov 2002. She ended up having a double masectomy in Dec. 2002, during her surgery the lab at the hospital lost the lymph nodes and they couldnt be sure it hadnt spread .She has went through the chemo and the radiation,but now the doctors say the cancer has metasticised to stage 4 in her spine. They have given her radiation but they say basically that there is nothing more they can do. I am at a loss as to what to do next. My mom is in constatnt pain and has just about given up. i have started researching alternative therapies but i am not sure if they would help. I am not sure what questions i should be asking nor who to ask..Any help or advice would eternally appreciated.",
