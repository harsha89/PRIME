I stayed on the couch the rest of the day..Then this morning i  wake up in so much pain that i  am sadden by the thought of not being able to work in my yard.. The pain medication does help .. i now have the pain in my hip. oh well another day Cancer free.. Give me some more pain...Ha Ha.. LoL    ",
