Spent today getting my wife ready for another test, taking her to the hospital, sitting in the waiting room while she ingested her Barium and had another CAT Scan...those and the MRI's seem to be never ending, followed closely by a never ending stream of visits with her two oncologists. Right now, sitting on pins and needles three years out as we weather another SCARE STORM...A) maybe nothing more than a yeast infection, but doctors found abnormal cells in her pap smear...they will be scheduling some kind of a follow up on this, and B) wife has been having serious abdominal pains (maybe scar tissue) but her oncologist wants to check for abdominal lesions...so we wait. Meanwhile, I am both physically and emotionally SPENT right now...lethargic, cross, tired of sitting on this never ending bubble of uncertainty...I know, sounds selfish.  But three years into it, I am TIRED.  It's even worse, because the woman living in my house with me now is not the woman I married, not the woman that went under the knife three years ago to have the cancer cut from her breast, not the woman even who eight months later had to have a complete hysterectomy. There is not intimacy any more...least ways, not of a sexual kind.  She is angry most of the time, and when she is not angry, her sadness, her bitterness are almost more than I can bear. Surely I cannot be the only one here on these boards that feels like he is bailing water in a leaking row boat in the middle of a Tsunami and losing ground to the storm fast. What have some of you done to recharge a battery that is on dead empty? Daddy Pops please make sure you are alwAYS THERE WITH HER  .ITS IMPORTANT IM AM A  YEAR SAVIOR AND MY HUSBND IS GOING TRIOUGH THE SAME THING. I WAS A VERY ACTIVE PERSON TILL THIS BREAST Cancer took over. im fine now but no energy here or sex drive either.i had a hysterium at 29 and breat cancer at 56. you wife needs you. just be patiant and she will come around. this is the time she needs you most. you are brunt out just think how she feels love her and never leave her side it will ll work out",
