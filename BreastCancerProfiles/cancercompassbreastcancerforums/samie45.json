      "Content": "you have to take it at least for 5 years. if you have estrogen + then it's good for you as it helps with keeping cancer at bay (that's what they say). side effects are too many though including infertility, lack of sex drive, might have weak hair, etc..etc..etc.... if the cancer is aggressive they say you have to take it all your life...... it used to be taken for 10 years though. now researchers are  saying that 5 years is enough. this might change, who knows. the conventional medicine is funny, what's good today won't be good tomorrow.... hopefully they say soon that chemo and radiation and hormonal theray aren't after alll good for the body. but then again the market of cancer medication is so high, just like the tobaco and junk food, i don't think they'd want to consider removing this type of therapy off the market for a long long time....",

      "Content": "oh, and i forgot, stop all diary product, no crusteaceans, or fish with no scales, deep sea fish is ok.  cancerous cells love diary product. don't eat pumpkin or eggplant (aubergine) as they might supply blood to cancerous cells. just 'punish' the cheeky cells. lots of asparagaus, broccoli, mashrooms etc.... research all vitamins that can help your type of cancer.  ",

      "Content": "hi, there's a book that's called \"Cancer, step outside the box\". it lists a series of alternative medicine that can help with curing cancer. or go to google and type in alternative medicine to cancer and you'll find heaps. the most important thing is to stay calm and positive. think of cancer as it's a part of your body, little cheeky cells who wanted to 'play up' but don't realise the damage they're doing, if your body can create them it can heal them. you need to know the right way though. be strong this will boost your immune system. also search for the food and vitamins that fight cancer. start with cutting down on sugar, red meat, avoid preservative and non organic food. soak your vegies and fruit in 2 table spoons of apple cider vinegar to get rid of the pestisides, it's important that you follow certain diet with no 'junk food'. you'll feel the difference and you stop encouraging your cancerous cells from reproducing. read more on the internet. good luck, again be positive.",
