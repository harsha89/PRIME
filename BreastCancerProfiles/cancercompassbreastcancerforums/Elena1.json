    "Content": "Hello! I hope no one minds if I ask for some advice. I just received a breast biopsy report that is benign. However, I'm not at all satisfied with the answers and the pathology report. I'm glad it's benign, but the experience I've had seems so wrong. I'm 39 and went recently for my first baseline mammogram. I needed additional views so I had another mammogram and an ultrasound. Then an MRI with a diagnosis of \"probably benign\" but see a breast specialist. The breast specialist agreed with me in that I wanted a biopsy. So I had a stereotactic biopsy with a vacuum-assisted device (from reading I guess this is a core biopsy). They insterted a metal marker in the area where they removed tissue. The mass was 2.4 x 2.0 x .3 cm and was not palpable. It showed up on mammogram and MRI but not ultrasound.  After weeks of tests and worry, here's the report: Benign breast tissue with fibrocytic changes and stromal fibrosis. No malignancy identified. In doing some research, Susan Love's breast book suggests that this is not an adequate diagnosis. Also, my surgeon was offended that I questioned the length and lack of details on the path report. He is scheduling me for a follow up mammo in 6 months. Love's breast book advises another baseline in 1 to 2 months. My question is this: is it wise to have a different pathologist look at my slides? Or am I just being overly paranoiod and untrusting--should I just accept this as good news and be grateful?  Something about this process just feels wrong.        ",
