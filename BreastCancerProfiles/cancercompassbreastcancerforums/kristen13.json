    "Content": "Okay, last night I noticed that there was a lump on my left breast. It almost looks like a 3rd nipple and when you touch it it's sort of hard. It's clearly visible though. I'm only 17 years old and I'm freaking out right now. Is there any way it could be nothing at all? And of course I'm going to tell my mother and ask to go to the doctor but she won't be home until Saturday night. I just need some possible peace of mind because I couldn't sleep at all.",
