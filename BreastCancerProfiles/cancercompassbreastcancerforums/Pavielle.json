      "Content": "Hi Marietta! I hope you have found some answers. I did find some things out today, Dec. 6, 2005. On Oct. 3, I'd had a lumpectomy from my left breast. Two weeks later there was a pooch below my ribs, and a cord like thing starting at my incision (2\") and it runs down to and now past my belly button. The surgeon told me there was nothing wrong with me, while I was nerely passing out from chest wall pain! My new surgeon stated that the cord is scar tissue and will eventually go away. It does happen. He couldn't explain all the other symptom/problems I'm having along with it though. There is a possibility I have a hiatal hernia. I should know tomorrow from the scope results if I do. That may explain the bulge near my rib cage. The surgeons notes stated that he had removed the mass and needle tip from behind the chest wall, so maybe something became irritated. I'm still waiting on that. In the meantime, I'm still having chest wall pain, and the cord feels like it's thinning out, yet still feels really weird. Many prayers that you are doing well. Pavielle",
