    "Content": "My Name is Vickie, I am 47 years old and have been dealing with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer for a year and 4 months. I did all the treatment, changed my diet, take my supplements and exercise. I try to stay positive, but I know I am not curable and this bothers me to no end. I have an anxiety disorder to start with, which has turned me into a hypocondriac. I also suffer from depression, Sjogrens Syndrome (auto immune disorder) and chronic Lymes disease. I am an emotional basket case who can cry at the drop of the hat and do. Please someone tell me how to get out of this funk. I'm desperate. Thanks.",
