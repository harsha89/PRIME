(I've never had a problem with depression) My onc is aware of my decreased dosage and said that there are no studies to address this issue so she can't advise me as to whether I'm greatly decreasing my benefits from the drug or not. She said she just doesn't know. She did say \"at least you're still taking it\" We discussed quality of life and she said that what I was doing was ok with her. My question is this: Have any of you done the same thing? If you have I'd love to know what your onc said about it. My symptoms have decreased to a tolerable level but isn't gone. I would love to hear from anyone who has done this to see if your symptoms eased. Thank you in advance and good luck on your journey to better health.   Hi stac1014! Just picked up your post! Like you, I have suffered with severe depression since taking Arimidex but must admit to suffering from this on lesser occasions due to major stressful events.  I started Arimidex 4yrs ago after stage 2b idc which had spread to two nodes (chemo and rads) prior to that.  I really persevered but after 1 yr down the line was changed onto Tamoxifen and then a wash out period as it gave the same side effects.  My onc said that my quality of life was more important and could stop it if I wished as it only gave me a small percentage more protection. Since 2011, I have used my own judgement after also discussing with wonderful G.P. who says go with what your body tells you.  I therefore now take Arimidex for about 2months solid then as it builds up and symptoms become more intolerable I stop again for about the same time and this cycle continues.  Sometimes I have taken it every 2nd or 3rd day like you but eventually the depression and now other symptoms occur!  I reckon that I have taken it approx: for 2.5 yrs out of the 4 so I really hope and pray that it has done some good after all the nasty side-effects it has caused.  Sorry to ramble on but it has been one of those days, I trust that this has maybe been helpful to you and also wish you good luck on your journey to good health . Kind regards, susieque2.",
