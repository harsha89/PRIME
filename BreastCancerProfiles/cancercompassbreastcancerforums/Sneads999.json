      "Content": "I'm post lumpectomy for breast cancer.  Had 32 radiation treatments.   I'm now experiencing tingling that affects my entire left side all the way through my back.   It started about 2 months after radiation and seems to be getting worse.  It appears to be worse at night and has started to happen during the day.   There's also a burning feeling in my back.  Could this be from the radiation and if so does anyone else have this?  ",
