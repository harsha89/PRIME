    "Content": "Need some suggestions.  My mom had stage 2 cancer and infected some of her lymph nodes, so she had surgery to remove her complete left breast and chemo. Her chemo completed about a year ago. After chemo, we've been visiting the oncologist every 3 months to have checkups. The oncologist has my mom take a blood test before the checkups and usually just go through the test report. Recently, we had a friend that went through a similar surgery and chemo. A year later, her doctor told her there\u2019s cancer in her bones. Which got us a little worried, so we spoke to our oncologist. And like always, he says we\u2019re too worried, my mom\u2019s blood test report is normal, and there\u2019s nothing we should be concern. We told the oncologist that our friend did a whole body scan (don\u2019t know the same of the scan) and the scan is more precise to determine if any area of the body has cancer cells. We asked the oncologist if we can have something similar and he said no, and again, tells us not to worry. Ever since the beginning of chemo, every time when we raise a concern, his response is always not to worry, we concern too much. Now my mom has been getting nose bleeds. I\u2019m hoping is the weather but want to be safe than sorry. So wondering if anybody has any suggestions to see what kind of doctors we can see to refer to us to do more thorough checkups? Thanks a lot! ",
