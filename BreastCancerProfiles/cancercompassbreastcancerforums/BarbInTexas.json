      "Content": "I'd talk to your radiologist about the possibility of damage to the hair cells in the ears causing her hearing loss. Mine were damaged by chemo and it is, unfortunately, permanent.  About 40% gone now. Seems like if her ears were peeling inside and out, that it was rad. burns and they should level with you as to the chance of hearing loss from that. Ask. Sometimes just knowing the REASON for something makes it easier to bear and certainly easier to explain to others. But some side-effects are only temporary and it would be nice to know that, too. Hope this helps~ Barb ",

      "Content": "Maria, I'm sorry to hear your Mom's news, but this is do-able. I was diagnosed with IDC in '01 at the age of 56, and began w/ tests, biopsies, ended (for awhile) with a lumpectomy, then the margins were not clear so they did another surgery, many lymph nodes were involved, eventually had double mast. in Feb. '06 because other breast was going down the same road but not quite yet cancer and I was sick of it. Wish I'd done it all at first and not wasted 5 years messing with it!  I did AC chemo (adrimycin, cytoxan) and radiation on left side but refused to do Taxol meds because of family history of stroke, one of it's major side-effects. I must have made the right choice, as my gamma bone scan, CT, MRI and bloodwork are all clear now. Might do some reconstruction, still debating on that. Lymphedema in L. arm/hand is bothersome but not fatal so I just deal with it.  I'm still here and kicking, this was my third bout w/ cancer (colo-rectal in '87-'88, skin in mid-90's) so it's nice to be clean and just living my life, waiting to see what's around the next corner. So, now you know this is an ordeal, but not necessarily the end of the world. Keep rested as much as possible and always ask for a second opinion on just about everything. Remember that the people on here are behind you and available if you need to vent or need sources for more info. Good luck to you both~ Barb ",

      "Content": "I agree, do make a list of your recent symptoms and events and Immediately go get a second opinion and perhaps a sono/scan to be certain it 'is nothing'. This was my experience with waiting: I trusted the person who read my mammo and when told to 'check back in 6 mos', I did. By then, I had invasive ductal ca that was in several nodes, which led to several very traumatic and expensive years, so do not wait, go directly to have this checked out. Then you can rest easy once you know. Too many of us watch and wait, which is not a good thing where cancer is concerned, better to be safe than sorry. Sorry this all happened, hopefully it's hormonal and will be straightened out soon, but you are right to not ignore it. Good luck! Let us know what you learn~ Barb ",

      "Content": "Jodie, you've received some excellent suggestions, maybe I can help a bit also. . . I was going to add to the diary idea that you scrapbook it, putting in copies of every photo you have of your grandson and YOU with your grandson.  Date each photo and describe what you were doing or where you were. Add your personal comments, some humor, a lot of love. He will have that book forever, have someone hold it for him until he is older and can care for it himself.  Add some of his own artwork for you two to laugh about later on. Put in an inkprint of his hand and foot now while he's so small. Add a lock of his hair. List his fav. foods and books. etc. etc. A wonderful memory book was given to me by a good long-time friend. It's For my Grandchild, a Grandmother's Gift of Memory, 2005, Text: Paige Gilchrist, Design: Kristi Pfeffer, AARP, LARK books, Div. of Sterling Pub. Co., Inc, N.Y.  ISBN-13 978-1-4027-2325-4 and ISBN-10: 1-4027-2325-3  You might want to obtain one and fill it out for him, it has an abundance of information you will want to pass down to him. You mentioned spoiling the boy in every way. . . It might be a good idea to sit down and try to clear the air and see what is on the mind of your dau-in-law.  I know from my experience with my own parents with my own two sons years ago, they spoiled them to the point where my sons were horrid when they came home and it took days for us to get them where they were enjoyable again,  . . .  there IS such a thing as spoiling too much! Disregarding bedtimes for many hours leads to cranky kids and public melt-downs, and too much candy and junk food leads to hyper behavior long after kids get back home. Maybe your dau-in-law would love to have you see the boy more but cannot abide the thought of the changes it now causes so limits your contact for that reason but won't say it. Maybe a slightly delayed bedtime and healthy snacks would do the trick.  We had to sit my parents down and tell them that they were jeopardizing their relationship with our sons, as we worked and could not have them in trouble in school after a weekend spent with them and it lined out things very well in our case and my parents were able to have the boys for 2 weeks at a time every summer and we never had that problem again. It didn't do my boys any favors to let them run hog wild and disturb others and forget how to treat others nicely. Many people dislike children for that reason, and it's not the fault of the children that they are unlikable and rude. It doesn't have to be that way. You have already bonded with your own little guy, so I hope some of these ideas work for you~ Let us know what happens. And if you occupy some of your time and energy with other kids, doing volunteer work as mentioned, perhaps the jealousy factor will come into play and they will see that their child isn't the only one in your life receiving love, time, and gifts, and maybe they will come around because of that factor. When they are no longer calling the shots on your happiness, it might just change some things! ( I know, I'm evil, but whatever works) ;-)  Good luck! Barb ",

      "Content": "Wow, Kathy d, I am soooo glad to read your story. I just found this site and want to compare notes w/ you a bit. I don't know how old you are but your story is very much like mine. I'm a 3x cancer survivor, colo-rectal in 87 (chemo, rad, surgery, chemo), skin ca. in about '95 or so (surgery), and breast in '01 (surgery, chemo, rad, reconstruction, then biopsies, biopsies, biopsies, double mast., reconstruction, removal, ongoing pain).  Still here but lordy, am I tired. I hope you check into CFS, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.(CFIDS.org) I have been diagnosed with it recently and upon reading about it, it apparently begins w/ a virus, and cancer can be a virus. Mine in '87 was. (Maybe all of them are, I don't know.)  All I know is I blamed the fatigue and brain fog on chemo for nearly 20 years and am so relieved to know it's a combination of things and apparently not depression at all. Never thought it was, but some Dr.s did.  I've been on every anti-depressant known to man and none helped at all, some made me depressed or suicidal and others were like water. Very EXPENSIVE water! Not that I don't have good reason to be depressed, but my brain is very active, usually fairly happy in a calm sort of way. In years past, I DID suffer from depression, but got a divorce and got over it. ;-)   So I know what it's like and this isn't it. I want to do many things and work on many projects like I used to do, but the body is exhausted. Most days I read a lot, take care of my pets, cook a bit, do laundry, or visit w/ friends, etc. I would like to sew more, to garden again, and travel more, but it all takes sooo much energy, I have to juggle and try to pace myself. I have taken thyroid most of my life, it doesn't help the fatigue at all that I can tell, but it doesn't make it any worse, I guess. For years I often slept around the clock and still cycle w/ fatigue and semi-zombie and have to take prescribed stimulants to even resemble a normal day for others, then am laid out for 2-3 days to recover. The insomnia for years was the pits, but now I take Melatonin and drop off within an hour or so. I read or listen to music during that time to relax. Sore all over every day, some days worse than others, but it's not ever completely gone. Mine isn't joints but muscle and even skin aches. My hot tub helped me cope w/ my Dad's death, then Mom's but now have lymphedema so that's not advised anymore. I lost my Mom, too, in early '03 right after my year-long bout w/ breast cancer and treatment was just ended (I thought). It was very traumatic. She was an R.N. who had seen me thru the colo-rectal ca in the late 80's and we were very close, then to have her die of the same thing!  After Mom's death, I had more cysts, more biopsies, and finally a double mastectomy, then reconstruction, implants, an infection, removal of implant, hardening of the skin, chest aches and muscle pain, spasms, etc. etc. etc. This all took 3 more years. I'm now 2 years out from the last surgery, need more to get use of my arm back to normal, but haven't found a surgeon who can deal with radiation damage and isn't into 'beautiful' and 'uplifting' and 'youthful' instead of just making a body work right again. I, too, envy those who work thru their treatments and are back at work full time and full speed ahead.  I've been unable to work full-time since '87, have tried twice to work part-time but that's all I did, dropped into bed upon arrival home and got up for a shower, rest, brush teeth, rest, dress, rest, drive 15 min. and work the next day. Did that for 18 mos, was relieved when I was laid off for not being able to work up to full time as they wanted. When I get tired, the brain disconnects. I might be able to work 4 hours now, but it's never the SAME 4 hours. Am still trying to dig out from that period of time, am behind on everything here at home. People just think I'm a slob, but it's 'stuff' and unfinished projects, not dirt, food, or bugs at all, just no energy to straighten up much or for long, and organizing takes a lot of stamina. Sorting is the bane of my existence. My head just swims and I now understand the blond jokes a lot more than I once did! Energy is a bit better now, most days, but nothing near normal. I tend to push my limits, hoping to increase them, even after 20 years. I'd LOVE to work again, even part-time, but energy is so erratic. I have to pace myself . . . if I go on a tear, I pay for it later. No advance planning can be certain, it depends on how I feel that day, I nearly nod off at times in spite of meds to keep me awake, but am told I do not have narcolepsy. I DO have sleep apnea now, plus asthma that began during chemo in '88. My radiologist said it's called chemo-induced asthma. Because of this, low oxygen is also my problem; it's like high-altitude sickness in some ways. I set off the hospital alarms every time! It's all tiring.  I hate that part of it.  If I didn't have such a black sense of humor, I'd not be here now, but there is always something funny or strange about life as I know it. A friend who 'harps' is NO FRIEND. Until she walks in your shoes, she cannot judge. My Dad thought I was malingering until he, too, had chemo and radiation for his lung ca, then he never said another word about 'how lazy I was', he understood Big Time how tired one can get and how very frustrating it is to look so healthy and feel so rotten.   Spend time with those who appreciate you and help you be your best.  Kathy, you are NOT alone. If your Dr. won't listen or even try to understand, get another one. Life is too short to have people as 'care-givers' who won't even attempt to help you, this is not a One-Size-Fits-All world, neither is health. We all react differently to treatments and medicines. One of my oncologist/radiologists said they probably will someday find that there was damage we don't even know how to test for, that isn't showing up on my tests now. On paper I am normal, whatever that is, but something certainly went wrong. Try to do what recharges your battery and enjoy everything you can. There is still a lot to look forward to in this world.   I hope this did not depress you, but that you know there are others like you, fighting weird problems nobody seems to understand.  The key word is FIGHT, we are survivors and that is our job. ;-)  Hang in there and keep your sense of humor. I'll bet there are many more like us out there.  Take care, Barb in Texas ",
