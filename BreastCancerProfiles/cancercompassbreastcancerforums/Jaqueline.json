      "Content": "Hi there, I am on Tamoxifen, have been for almost 6 months now, went to 2 oncologists one prescribed Aromicyn and the other Tamoxifen. I opted for the second choice and although I did occassionally get cramp in my calves it is certainly more severe now, reading your letter explains why!!  When you get these cramps, a quick relief is to pull your toes upwards towards your knee, that is of course if you can get to them!!  Another thing that seems to help me, is if I have got to my toes and bent them up, I get out of bed and stand on the cold tiles for a few seconds!!  I only get these cramps at night.  Another thing that helps cramp is to take quinine sulphate tablets. If you try any of these, please let me know if they have helped you. Best wishes Jacqueline",

      "Content": "Hi there, Just read your letter, it is a terrible shock to the system to be told of this diagnosis! I initially went to the doctor for a pain in my eye, (which I still have in spite of meds) and night cramps in my leg.  I did however mention to him that I was not sure but thought there was a change in the look of my breast.  He took a look and told me he thought I had breast cancer, that was a Friday, the Monday had a mammogram, and a biopsy (one of the sorest things I've ever had!) Tuesday saw a surgeon and a week later had a masectomy, was not lucky enough to have a lumpectomy.  Hope yours went well and you are well on the way to recovery now. Keep your chin up and take each day as it comes. Best wishes Jacqueline",

      "Content": "Hi Deezin, Interesting, I am a cancer victim, had a mastectomy, and am Tamoxifen.  I have no idea why my Oncoligis chose Tamoxifen, think it is just the prescribed drug.  I have bee taking it now for 2.5 years and am feeling the side effects, like depression and totally \"out of sorts\".  Think two years ago I felt a hell of lot better and was coping better than what I am now.  Went on the internet and read about the drug and the report, 6 pages is awful! An going to see my Onc for a check up on Monday 21st and intend to tell him I no longer want to take these tablets. From what I read, it prevents co-lateral cancer, but on the other hand causes cervical and even liver cancer - seemingly a no win situation. 6 months ago I had to visit a gynae, on the Onc's instruction, and had to have a d & c, whih apparently was due to the tablets?! I am of the idea now that I shall just let matters take theri course and what will be will be.",
