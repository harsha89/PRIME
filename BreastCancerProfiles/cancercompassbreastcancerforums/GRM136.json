    "Content": "Over three years ago age 39, I had bleeding from left nipple, my gynolcologist referred me to a breast surgeon, she did a ductal excision, the concerned duct(z) biopsy was negative however the surrounding tissue had a small spot with atypical hyperplasia, the doctor said it was found incidentally and not to be concerned. The following year I had bleeding in right nipple, MRI and ultrasound was negative, ductal excision was negative. I have had several nanograms since all negative showing dense breast 45%, some benign calcification. Too my surprise at my yearly mamo follow-up I was told normal namo however with new studies on atylical hyperplasia I should see oncologist. I am not menopausal, I am overweight, I do have a great Aunt with breast cancer (diagnosed at 85 years). I am healthy aside from kidney stones, 13 years ago I had 9.5 cm liver cell adenoma removed via liver resection, benign considered to be caused by birth control (have not taken since). I have an appointment with oncologist. Very stressed should/would they do breast biopsies? I know tomoxifin will be discussed. Radiation? Just shocked to be seeing oncologist over 3 years from a spot atypical hyperplasia was removed.",
