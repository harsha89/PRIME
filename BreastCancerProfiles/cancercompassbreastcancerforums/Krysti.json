It's rare, but I always say \"it's not SO rare!\" and many of your symptoms - itching, thickening, rash, similarity to mastitis seem like mine. I would get to another doctor that is familiar with IBC. It's probably not, but it would be better to make sure and get a 2nd opinion. There are many IBC Survivors on both of these websites that can give you more info: www.ibcresearch.org and www.ibcsupport.org. If you tell them what area you live in they may even be able to give you ideas on doctors that are familiar with diagnosing and treating IBC. This cancer is very aggressive, so get to someone quickly to rule it out and may it just be mastitis and nothing at all. For an excellent video on IBC you can go to www.komotv.com/ibc also. Hugs & Prayers to you,  Krysti - IBC Survivor \"You don't have to have a lump to have breast cancer!\"   ",

The side effects are pretty minimal for me - hand and foot sydrome and some diarrhea at the end of each 2 weeks (2 on/one off). When I first started Xeloda I had burning of the hands and feet, but they dropped my dose by one pill a day and it's manageable now. The key to Xeloda is that you MUST let your doctor know if your having some of these side effects and how sever immediately and they will usually stop the pills for a week and then start you back on a lower dose! I hope to get as long a run as possible on it, because compared to many other treatments the side effects aren't bad at all and it's quite easy taking pills and doesn't take all the time out of your life sitting in a chamo chair!!",

The IBC was recognised late because I was feeding my baby then and gynaecologist misdignosed it as milk duct swelling to start with hence I missed some important months.  After diagnosis, I was given 4 rounds of chemo (TAC therapy) at regular intervals of 21 days. Tumour size only reduced from 10*10 cm to 7*7 cm. I was operated for mastectomy. Then again there were 2 rounds of TAC. THere after there was internal and external radiation (22 times). Medication seemed to have end and I was happy again.  But immediately in one month there was a small tumour see on chest. PET scan told us that even lung might be infected. I am shocked. Doctors have adviced GEMCITE/CARBOPLATIN chemos again, but are very pessimitic of outcome. But i want to positive and fight out the cancer. I want to survive me and my 1 year daughter. Please advise on this on treatment, options available, medicines, hospital etc. Any help will be appreciated. Regards I am an IBC Warrior Woman who has been living with lung mets for 2.5 years and I understand how scary it is. I would definitely recommend writing to and joining www.ibcsupport.org and www.ibcresearch.org They have been a godsend to me and kept me going with knowledge and support and friendship. Please join us there IBC Sister! Hugs & Prayers - Krysti  ",
