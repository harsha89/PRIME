    "Content": "God Bless You and your sweet Mother. I lost my mother 2 weeks ago after a 4 year battle with Mixed Mullerian Sarcoma (MMMT). It was almost exactly as you described. She spent the last week in a Hospice Care Center where they were trying to stablize her, and get the pain under control. She grew so weary and told me how tired she was. Once I told her it was okay not to fight anymore, she seemed to just give in to the pain, and within 3 days was lifted into heaven on angel's wings. I miss her terribly, but there is some peace in knowing that she is no longer in pain. May you feel the same peace when the time is right.",
