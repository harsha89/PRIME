      "Content": "I will pray for you and your mom.  I lost my mom to breast cancer last week-she was also diagnosed 3 1/2 years ago-although it seems my mom's cancer may have been more advanced than your mom's.  All I can say is be strong for her and encourage her.  I believed that my mom's cancer was \"cured\" after several months of intense chemo & radiation.  She did absolutely everything she was supposed to do but the cancer still won. About 6 months ago learned that it had spread to her stomach.  Whether I was in denial, or truly believed I wouldn't lose her, I look back today and can think of a million things that I should have said, done, etc.  I can only tell you not to let a moment go by that you don't let her know you love her, regardless of the outcome, there is nothing more important than that.  I guess it's still so fresh that I'm still sorting through those feelings of guilt, intense sadness and anger (my mom was my best friend!) but the fact that she won't meet her new grandson who is due this June is sad, but what really hurts is the fact that I didnt get to say or do all things I would have if I'd known how short our time left together would be.  Breast cancer patients with recurrent and metastatic cancers often live for many years-just don't wait for everything to be \"perfect\", but live for the moment with her. God Bless you and your mother.",

      "Content": "I know how you feel-why does it feel like these things happen to the good people-who've already had such hard lives? My mom, like yours, divorced when I was 7, and raised my brother and I on her own.  She had a hard life yet would give us (or anyone for that matter) her last penny or the shirt off her back if we asked.   It seems so cruel that this would happen to such a person.  I know from reading my mom's journal that I found last week while cleaning her apartment, that the hardest thing about the treatments after surgery was the fear of cancer and dying, not so much the physical aspect for her.  I wonder if that is the case with your mom? Seems like she is really trying to protect you.  I also learned after my mom's death that she wished so much that she could have talked to me about how scared she was, but as with your mom, didnt want to worry me.  If only I had known this then, I would have approached her about it, and been there for her to tell me whatever she needed.  I hope your mom chooses to fight this, because there are so many success stories also!! My mom's chemo treatments the second time around were much harder physically, obviously because her body was already breaking down since the cancer was already spreading.  But they did manage to by her an extra few months.  She had a lot of hope during this time-we all (including her doctor) felt she had at least a few more years, certainly not as healthy as the last few, but still some quality of life.  I guess you just never know.  Today was my mom's 64th birthday and there is nothing that I'd want more than to wish her a happy birthday and to tell her how much I love her.  No matter what happens with your mom, the most important thing is to be there for her.  If you're up to it, let me know how things are going with her. ",

      "Content": "Hello, my name is Sarah and this is my first time visiting this website. I read your email and this is the exact reason I'm reading.  I just lost my mom to breast cancer this past Sunday.  I also have a child and one on the way.  I have lost my best friend, the strength in my life.  I hope it gets better for you- but I am also struggling with how to be strong for my kids.  There is nothing worse in the world than losing a mom.  I was cleaning her apartment yesterday and I found some gifts she had bought for me and I had to leave.  I don't know if I can go back.  I don't know if there will be a truly happy day again in my life.  No one seems to understand why I can't stop crying and deal with things that need to be done but I can't shake these feelings that I should have done more, been there more.  Also, my brother and I made the decision to withhold antibiotics for multiple infections in order to ease her pain with morphine.  (breast cancer spread to bone marrow).  I hope we made the right choice.  I wish I could have known what she was feeling and thinking, and hoping she knew how much I loved her. I will pray for you and hope you can keep strong for your children and husband.",
