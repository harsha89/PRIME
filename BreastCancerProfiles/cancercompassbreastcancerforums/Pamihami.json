      "Content": "I have an extensive cancer history in my family, mom had lung & bone, her sister had breast, her brother had prostrate, her uncle had lung, I had cervical years ago so when my mammo showed fibrous tissue, the radiologist said to wait and repeat my mammo in 3 months, I said nope, not gonna do it. Called my family doctor and asked to be referred to a breast guy. The ultrasound didn't show the tumor because it was hid. Two surgeries later, i was dx with stage one, invasive carcinoma with no lymph node involvement and i'm half way through radiation. I'm a big believer in being pro-active with my health.  If I were your daughter, i would seek a second opinion.",
