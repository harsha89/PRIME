      "Content": "Dear momwithkids;Steve]. I hope that I can help you in someway with my info. Itook At the beginning of the treatment  the doc gave me 3 tablets in the morning  and 4 in the afternoon[each tablet 500mg]. I was very tired and my feet very sore, so he reduce the dose  to 3 and 3, altogether 6=3000mg. I tolerate xeloda reasonable well, feel a bit tired towards end of cycle ,but my feet are the ones that give me a hard time as  a side effect of this drug is the foot and hand syndrome. Itreat this with a variety of things... Ihad only once chemo[taxol and avastin] after that the doc put me into this drug, every 3 weeks I have blood tests to check how I am going. I have breast cancer, secondary to bones, no pain .Steve  I am happy to interchange info. Best wishes, j13  ",

      "Content": "I have been with Xeloda for nearly two years, mainly only one side effect hand and foot syndrome. For me only my feet. I have discovered that when they are red, sore and sometimes with cracks to put  them to soak in cold icy water, with oats[you make your own little bag with an old pantyhose], for about 20 min, even 3 times a  day if they are very sore, you will see an improvement. The skin becomes soft and pale, almost normal your walking  improves too. good luck! J. 13",

At the moment my feet are aching, and tried my ususal oatmeal bath[icy],hopefully get better.. The doc gave me an extra week rest of tablets, to  improve my feet.  Any idea if the producers of the gold cream have an office in AUSTRALIA?. i appreciate if you have a contact number in Australia?...thanks J13",
