      "Content": "If you have ultrasound and mammograms which are not clear as to the cause of your finding you can ask your physician to prescribe a breast MRI study.  The ICD-9 code for abnormal mammogram is 798.30 which allows your doctor to request a breast MRI.  This non invasive test does not use any xrays.  It is much more sensitive than either mammography or sonography for breast cancer.  It is less specific than a mammogram and or sonogram in some studies but in a recent study of Breast MRI done at 3T (which gets better pictures at no additional cost) it was also quite specific.  Therefore I suggest that you find a 3T MRI unit in Connecticut.  I am sure that Yale New Haven Hospital and St Raphael's Hospital in New Haven have such a unit but search in your locale in CT to fine the 3T breast MRI in your neighborhood.  Please use 3T for your breast MRI. All other units are less sensitive and you will always have a question.  I can explain ahead of your test - if you have a 3T breast MRI - if you have cancer it will find it.  It is 100% sensitive in a Universoty of Toledo study from 4/30/09.  You can look that up on the internet.  Just do a search on 3T Breast MRI.  Also if the test comes up with a indeterminant nodule - I counsel most of my patients that at 3T the resolution is so good most of these nodules are benign.  If they ask you to come back for a 6 month followup of a breast MRI the chance of this being cencer is mush less.  In general if the nodule is 6m or greater they will oiften recommend a biopsy.  For lesions less than or equalt to 5mm they usually do not biopsy them.  If your doctor wants a biopsy of a smaller than 5mm lesion you can get a second opinion reading of your breast MRI at the University of Penn.  I believe they charge 200 for the overread.  Dr. Mark Rosen or Dr. Susan Orel.",

      "Content": "If you have elevated serum calcium (sometimes due to hyperparthyroidism) it is possible to get calcifications in your breast but I agree with your doctor that the microcalcifications are likely to be related to other breast disease.  When we do mammograms we look for masses, increasing density or microcalcifications.  In general most experienced radiologists can tell when microcalcifications are suspicious.  No change after 6 months is a good outcome.  However no one finding is 100% specific or sensitive for cancer.  So I advise you follow your own breast self exam carefully and if you have any questions you can sometimes ask your own radiology provider to have a second reader look at your mammogram.  IN MANY cases this might be at no charge to you.  So more eyees are often better. Ask your provider if hge can get yoru mammogram reviewed at no charge.  It is always better to be dilient in following any abnormal finding.  If the radiologist is unsure they can do a 3T Breast MRI for further evaluation or a sonogram.  Both of these tests do not use additional radiation.",
