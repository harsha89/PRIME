    "Content": "Hi. I'm a 64 yr old woman and just signed up. I have been feeling that I need to join a group that is going or has gone through similar stuff. Over a year ago I was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer. I had the lump removed. After that healing process, I had 6 weeks of radiation with little side effects, just tired. I have successfully gone through follow up with my surgeon and oncologist. Within the past month, I experienced rib cage pain one time which last lasted a couple of days during bad weather. At the same time my legs,hands and neck were hurting. I've experienced arthritis symptoms before, but now I can barely walk and using a cane. My blood test result was rheumatoid arthritis. I know my rib cage pain can be a side effect of radiation. But is it possible that the pain in all my bones could be a side effect of radiation. Everything I read says no. But I'm suspicious if the radiation weaken my whole immune system. I have an appointment with a specialist, not till end of June. I am going crazy wanting to know answers. Help. Any comments will be helpful. Thank you.",
