Nipple discharge \"may be yellow,green,brown or bloody\" A bloody discharge should be looked into. \"Nipple discharge is RARELY a sign of breast cancer...if it dosn't resolve on it's own after your next menstrual cycle, see your doctor\". Also, \"frequent checks for discharge can actually make the discharge persist\", I know it's hard not to keep checking, but don't worry. See if it resolves on it's own,as they say.         Sincerely     dave Just for anyone's information....Dave is correct except if you have any unexpected discharge from a nipple get it checked out; black or clear.  It's wonderful that rute18 is ok.  But I started having a yellowish to clear discharge.  I read what Dave read and thought it was normal.  But it didn't stop.  My mammograms read as if everything was ok.  Luckily I went to a breast specialist who said that's not always right.  So she really studied those mammos.  She ordered a magnified mammo and found Atypical Hyperplasia.  It is a formation of precancerous cells in the ducts.  I had surgery, they were all removed and now I'm monitored every 6 months for the rest of my life for cancer formation.  Don't take anything for granted....always always get it checked.  Had I not been proactive, it would have turned into cancer.  This is more common than anyone realizes.",
