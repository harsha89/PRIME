      "Content": "Can someone tell me what the most common symptoms of liver mets are? I have lost about 10 pounds, because nothing sounds good to me to eat. I get hungry, but just don't know what I want. Usually I end up eating dark chocolate 'cause that's all I want. I had IDC Stage 2, 3 nodes +. I completed treatment with 8 chemos and 35 rads and now Arimidex. Is it possible this is a symptom of mets? Thanks.   MK   ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I don't think my onc does tumor markers. Sometimes I don't know that he is concerned about my weight even though I now weight 95 pounds. Then I think it must all be in my head and I am just thinking I don't want to eat. Anyone else play mind games with themselves. I am ER+ and thought Arimidex is to keep the cancer from returning or metastizing.",

I also have weakness in arms and legs, but that seems to come and go, so I don't see how it could be mets. I was dx with stage 2b BC Jan. 2003. ER+ and three nodes +. Thanks. MK     ",
