    "Content": "When I was first diagnosed with ER/PR breast cancer, by means of a biopsy on the 2 cm lump I had detected, an MRI showed one and possibly two smaller cancers in the same breast that had not been detected on  a mammogram or by physical examination.  Because I had uncontolled hypertension, I was informed that surgery would provide extra risk for me.  I had tried to see an oncologist but was tunable to get an appointment with any oncologist until I had the surgery. After three tries I found a surgeon who agrees that it was my choice to have the risky (to me) surgery and he agreed to make an appointment with an oncologist for further consultation. Good luck for me as this oncologist put me on Arimidex.  It has been four years with absolutely no side effects and best of all all according to a recent MRI there is no sign of the cancer I had previously.  I have seen a cardiologist and my blood pressure was determined to be part of a heart problem - and the blood pressure and the heart problems are now controlled by medication and I have been saved from a possibly deadly heart attack.  And both breasts are still intact. Why is this treatment not offered to all women hormone sensitive cancer? My experience leads me to believe the surgeons have more control of breast cancer treatment than they should.  All options should be available to patients along with the physicians personal opinions.  If a women is willing to pay for a consultation with an oncoligist she should be able to - before surgery.  I think patients should be given hard cold facts as well as options for treatment.
