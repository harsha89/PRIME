    "Content": "In 2007, my right breast on the outer side grew a very large, painful cyst. I mean, it stuck out the side of my breast. All tests done, was told it was just a cyst and a breast surgeon drained it. He said it grew from a large tissue in that spot and the cyst could grow back. It did in 2012. In the same exact spot. Again, stuck out side of breast. Had usual tests again, and again, it was drained. Both of these cysts grew during my period. They had me come back 6 months later to follow up, told everything was good and come back in a year. Well, just moved to another state and got new insurance. Knew it was a few months over my time for tests for made an appt so the new doctor would refer me to have my mammogram. She gave me a breast exam and didn't say anything, so I figured I was good. I had my screening mammogram the following week (found out I should of had diagnostic mammo due to my history of fibrocystic breasts) Sure enough, the same area lit up on the mammogram. Unfortunately, they didn't have my previous tests yet so they had nothing to compare. I was sent for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound the following week....still no previous records to compare. The radiologist came in and told me she wanted me to have a biopsy. In a panic, I told her my history of this spot and the problems with cysts. She said the spot was \"worrisome\" but after I told her of my history, she said it \"could\" be scar tissue from my \"previous procedures.\" The weird thing is I have NO symptoms. No puckering, nothing. My right breast feels the same exact way it always have. Believe me, I always feel it after the cysts, and I can always feel the tissue moving around that they grow from. Well, I was able to get in to have a biopsy a few days later. The tech was so nice and tried to ease my fears. She explained how breasts can change all the time and anytime there is any change from one mammo to another, they will do biopsies, and even admitted she couldn't feel this place they were doing a biopsy on. She then told me she looked thru my chart and said it noted \"small focal change\". Does \"small\" mean anything?? Haha should that make me feel better? The only thing that is somewhat getting me thru this is the fact that this is the same spot as usual. Now I wait for results. I can't concentrate on anything and have been reading everything. My aunt had breast cancer about 20 yrs ago. She just turned 80. I also know a woman who had it 12 yrs ago. Her was considered aggressive but they caught it good. She is doing magnificent.",
