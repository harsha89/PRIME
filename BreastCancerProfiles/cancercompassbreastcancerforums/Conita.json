      "Content": "I have had a number of doctors.  MY MBC was diagnosed in April of 2008 in Jerusalem and the Dr. was frank. All treatments,  surgery, chemo, radiation, tamofere, etc,  are all just temporary and MBC comes back usually as liver, lung, or bone cancer with no successful cure because it is a triple negative.  The doctors I saw in Texas were reluctant to tell me the same but when I pressed them with the correct questions, I had already had a mastectomy and chemo before I learned enough to ask the right questions.   I did get the same answers.   I chose to change my diet and tried to follow the Budwig Diet which is a great diet but most difficult to remain faithful to.  Thus,  the longer I was on the diet,  the more I cheated.  In April 0f 2011 I was diagnosed with a benign desmoid tumor and after surgery,  the pathology showed MBC again.  I told the doc I did not plan to do chemo or radiation and he agreed that  it would only extend my life for an extra 6 months and that would be 6 months of feeling terrible because of the chemo.  I have asked around repeatedly for holistic and homeopathic recomendations for a Dr. and no one knows of any.  A friend purchase the one minute cure. He has had leukemia for 10 years and he says the only thing the \"Drs. do is take his money and give him his white blood cell count.  After the past 8 days following the one minute cure his white cell count dropped 3000 points.  It is simple, very cheap,  and does not interere with any part of living.  Today I went back on the Budwig 'Diet because i think it is healthy and good for me and added the one minute cure as I wanted to see quick results.   You can purchase this book via the interent for between $20 and $0..  My doctor was all for me starting the program as he knows the medical community has nothing to offer me that will make a difference according to 7 doctors I have seen in Fort Worth/Dallas.  This regimen is usedly widely in Europe and especially in Germany.  It is not used widely in the USA because it would kill the triliojn dollar business of selling chemo and radiation which only treat symptons, and do not give a true cure.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma,  Estrogen negative, Progesteron negative, and HR2 negative.  After removal of the lump, I was given 4 chemo sessions of adrimyacin and cytoxine and 4 chemo sessions of taxotere.   As I read the message board, I see that some people were also given radiation.  My doctor is not very encouraging and is just waiting for me to have a reoccurence when it metastesizes to the liver, lungs, or bones and she says I will not survive this.  She says there is nothing else that can be done for me other than check ups to see when it occurs and treatment that will give me maybe up to 18 months more to live.  I feel like she is just waiting for me to die.  Any advice anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated.",
