    "Content": "You has a very similar diagnosis to my wife, but I would certainly get more opinions before following the Taxol or Herceptin regimen. In fact, it seems to be the opinion at some top centers that chemotherapy is not warranted on such a small grade/neg node tumor. The survival rate is so high, that there is very little benefit from using toxic medicine. But we did not get that from the first oncologist we saw, who immediately was pushing chemo. In fact, we went to Fox Chase in Phila and Sloan Kettering in NY and were amazed at the the diferences. So by all means, get those opinions and do your homework before just accepting what a doctor recommends. We paid $297 for a report called the Moss Report,its 500 pages and helped us so much. Not cheap but worth it http://www.alternative-cancer-treatments.com/moss-reports.htm. It gives all the clinical research on all the treatments including alternative treatments, it was well worth it. Good luck and God bless, you caught it early.",
