    "Content": "Hi all \u2013Â  I\u2019m one of a group of friends who is doing some research on a close friend\u2019s behalf, and I\u2019m reaching out to our sisters for help, advice, information, etc. We all met through an online board for young women with breast cancer, and have become the closest of friends. Our friend Kim was diagnosed at stage 1 in 2008, had finished all treatment, and this month was going to start the process of having a baby, implanting the embryos she had frozen before chemo. Then she found out 2 weeks ago that pain in her scapula was bone mets. Kim\u2019s dream, her plan, has always been to have a baby. She\u2019s devastated by the diagnosis primarily because of this \u2013 and as her closest friends, we\u2019ve promised her that we\u2019ll help her make it happen. We know not everyone will agree with this, but her mets is slow-growing (\u201clazy\u201d her doctors called it), and we think she\u2019ll be around for a long time. Plus she\u2019s a firm believer in living the life you have now, not the one that may or may not be sometime in the future. And Kim will be the most wonderful mother ever \u2013 she dotes on her sweet pittie named Lucy, is a huge animal lover, an amazing friend, passionate about animal rights, and the kindest and sweetest person any of us know. Truly. Her child will be lucky indeed to have such a great mom. And she has a strong, wonderful support system \u2013 a sister, family, close friends, etc. So. What we need to find is a gestational carrier \u2013 someone who can carry the embryo(s) through a pregnancy. Research shows us that finding someone independently is the better choice, as it\u2019s far less expensive than going through an agency. We\u2019re not sure where to start with this, so we\u2019re asking our fellow sisters. Either those who have gone through this process, or have thought about it and have resources to share, or who know people who might have info, etc. Anything at all would make us so grateful. Feel free to PM me directly too. And thank you all in advance!",
