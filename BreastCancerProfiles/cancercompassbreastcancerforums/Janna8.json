    "Content": "Hi from Tasmania, Australia.  I have been on Arimidex for 2 years now and just this week have been changed to Aromasin.  Last year I had dreadful syptoms with Arimidex, particularly aching joints and tiredness.  Mid 2007 I started taking one Glucosamine 1500 tablet each day which seems to have helped tremendously. (Glucosamine is for Osteoarthritis relief and joint repair and available at most health food stores).  I now am moving much better in the mornings and don't seem to be getting the aches and pains in the joints that I was. I also try to walk each day on the beach where I live and I do regular meditation which all helps I feel.  I am hoping that Aromasin is not a step backwards for me.  I still have 3 years to go so fingers crossed.  All the best Gayle58, hope all goes well for you, Cheers Janna8",
