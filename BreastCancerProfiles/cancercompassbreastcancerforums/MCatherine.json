    "Content": "Bon jour! Someone told me the if you have breast cancer, your breast do not hurt.  I was told that having a few tender areas in not a big deal. We need each other.  I am not sure who to ask because I have had enough mamograms to find something by now.  I do not take any hormones.... One question:  Is breast cance a silent pain, or can your breast feel sore to the touch in certain areas? Thanking you in advance, MaryCatherine  ",
