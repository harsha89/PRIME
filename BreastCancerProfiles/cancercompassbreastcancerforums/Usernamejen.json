    "Content": "Read an article about smell and its relation to cancer on here and decided to post. My partner of now 8 years smells so bad I can't stand the smell. Especially his mouth and face smell the most strong. The smell started end of 2008 and just got worse. Now I can't stand it I smell it in everything he lays in, on the bed, on the office chair, any pillow he lays on or touches his skin,  smells like a dead animal this smell. I told him I smelled this smell and somehow he doesn't smell it, and because this smell effected our intimate life I won't kiss him that's when he asked why and I told him it's this smell. He went to doctor they swabbed his nose for mrsa but nothing he didn't have it.  Everyone in his family who passed on, died of cancer. His father recently had cancer removed from prostrate. I'm hoping he will be getting checked for that soon this smell is so bad and then I feel bad for asking him to brush his teeth but no matter what he does the smell never goes away. He smokes cigarettes, but that isn't the smell I smell. The smell is like when you find a dead animal on your walk and its been there a few days, and it sometimes smells like th I that plus like someone spilled cider or some rotting fruit on top of it.  He is not diabetic, and doesn't have problems with eating sugars. He's 35 years old and I'm not the only person to notice this smell in him.  I don't know what else I could do, I told him about it but I can't live with this smell its ruined so many aspects of our relationship.  Any suggestions as to what might this be would be grateful. Thank you for your time. ",
