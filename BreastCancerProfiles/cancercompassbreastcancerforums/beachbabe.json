It seems to me that after prolonged use both create the same joint and bone stiffness, swelling and pain. Recently, I have been experiencing pain on the bottom of my leg so that it is hard for me wear shoes. I also get cramping in my toes at night. I really don't know what to do as I don't want to get used to pain killers. I took Darvocet for a while, but one of my doctors told me that 'it is a bad drug,\" so i stopped. In addition, I am also taking Lexapro for depression and clonazepam for anxiety. I wonder if any one else experienced these side effects. Before my breast cancer the only medication I took was Darvocet, as i have spinal stenosis. Now, I have a medicine cabinet full of drugs and i still can't sleep at night. I need help!!!! I've been taking Aromasin since Dec '07...and experience severe arthritis-like pains.  Joint pain, bones are howling, stiffness, etc.  It is very difficult for me to walk when I first get out of bed.  I believe it is the Aromasin and not the cancer (Stage 4 breast with mets to bones) that is causing the pain.  I, like you, never took any meds before the diagnosis and now have a counter full.  I take Vicodin (2-3/day) to relieve some of the pain...some days it works better than others.  I also take Benadryl allergy at night to sleep (had been on Ambien but it made me feel like a zombie).  I'm taking a low dose (37.5 mg) of Effexor for anxiety and that seems to help as well.  Hang in there and be strong--it makes the cancer wonder what we are up to!I've",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear about your problems.  I'm a year into LIVING with a Stage IV diagnosis (was 44 when diagnosed).  Have two young kids and refuse to be beaten down.  Husband has failed me MISERABLY in providing any kind of emotional support...feels anger is the best way to deal.  It is sad, but right now I feel like I can fight cancer or I can fight him, so I choose to fight cancer and I will deal with him later.  Be strong and lean on the people you CAN depend upon.  Peace~",
