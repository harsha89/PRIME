    "Content": "Dear Readers, My sister recently passed away having been diagnosed with lung cancer,she was 49 year old and a none smoker (please dont feel i am judging smokers because im not). She went into hosiptial on 26th August 2016 and had a CT scan because she was strugging with her breathing.They removed a litre and half of fuild from her lungs. She was informed that she had cancer tumors in her kidney, liver, ovaries, hip, stomach and chest bone. She passed away on Tuesday 13th september 2016, sixteendays later. The day she passed away we were advised  from the biospy that it started in her lungs. aAs you can imagine we are all devestated at our sudden loss, as well as feeling shocked that this as happened. My sister survived cancer at the age of 19 years old. She was dianosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and survived this with chemo and blood tranfusion.  After my sister death I decided to have her medical history investigated as i was aware that she had visited her GP on many occassions with an odur in her urine. This odur was only there during her first wee in the morning. She had other systoms, which now we understand to be the cancer systoms. Over a period of 16 months she visited her GP's at least 18 times and they never gave her a blood test for cancer (they should have treated her with extra care). Having read litature, it suggested that cancers can have have odurs can anyone help. I feel my sister was let down and she should still be here with us.  If like me you dont like writing emails please feel free to call me on Annmarie,  and i will call you back to save a cost to yourself. Although im still happy to read any emails i receive. I want justice for cancer patients who are being let down and not receiving the care eariler enough, espically when being fob off by GPs because they dont regconise cancer systoms.                ",
