    "Content": "i started treatment with tamoxifen, for 1 year.  it made me very nauseated. i then switched to arimidex, which i feel is the \"devil.\"  it made my bones ache beyond belief.  it made me depressed, and i could not sleep.  i then switched to evista...frankly i hate all these drugs...they are truly making me someone i don't even know.  i just feel there has got to be a better way, and i feel helpless in my attempt to feel happy, and without aches and hot flashes.....anyone else?  God bless all of us",
