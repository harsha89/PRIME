TIA - Sarah   Hi Sarah sorry to hear about you mum, Im sad to hear this So if you don\u2019t mine I like to help by letting you know some other treatments I\u2019ve come across from other members on cancer compass. my personal experiences  is I have advanced prostrate cancer. and some ways a lot of us use to fight it. I do a lot of research, I\u2019ve read that prostate cancer and breast cancer are both sex hormone dependent.. With out the sex hormones the cancer  dies. In 2007, three months after I had a prostrate biopsy, I found I had the cancer in my lower back, and my ribs. I\u2019m sure the biopsy spread the cancer  though out my body. After spending a lot of money on tests I was told by my doctors there was nothing more they could do for me. They told me you cant get cancer out of bone. Eventually  I ended up seeing  a naturopath, who know how to fight cancer, and   who also  recommended, I go on a cause of high dose vitamin C 6g a day, Zinc,  and a three month cause of liquid Zeolitte, 15 drops 4 times a day. At the time I found this only brought my PSA down a couple of points. But I stayed  on the high dose vitamin C and zinc for a long while my PSA seem to say  the same. But it wisent until  a year later when I had  an other bone scan that I found my bone cancer was gone. That I found out how well this works since then  Ive gone on to other treatment and  my PSA seems to be dropping down  now finely .  one of the things Im on is  the Dr Budwig anti- cancer diet if you go to these web sites you find out a whole lot more how cancer works and how your mum can defeat it   http://www.cancertutor.com/Cancer/Budwig.html     I also take 4 x 40mg red clover tablets a day, that\u2019s 120mg a day two at night and two in the morning  as well, this is also good for breast cancer   Here a report from breast cancer research .com  on the use of the 40mg  red clover tablets these are the red clover tablets you buy from  any drug store or supermarket to control menopause    http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/6/3/R170   hydrazinesulfate helps with secondary cancer   http://www.cancernet.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/hydrazinesulfa   I wish you and your mum well God bless both of you Ray ",

The main premise is stimulating the patient's immune system to attack the malignant tumor cells that are responsible for the disease. This can be either through immunization of the patient, in which case the patient's own immune system is trained to recognize tumor cells as targets to be destroyed, or through the administration of therapeutic antibodies as drugs, in which case the patient's immune system is recruited to destroy tumor cells by the therapeutic antibodies.",

I get cramps in my legs as well as achey feet....Is there anyone else out there who is experiencing what I am?  I would love to go off the pill...but I am so afraid that the cancer will come back!  Has anyone tried taking the femara less often...perhaps every other day? Hoping to share some opinions! Murphy   Femara stops or lowers estrogen levals over the years doctors and researchers have theorized that menopause is a kind of estrogen deficiency syndrome. No one knows for sure. Estrogen\u2019s primary role during a woman\u2019s reproductive years is to prepare the uterus to receive a fertilized egg, but researchers have shown that estrogen does much more than this. Red clover Iv heard  may help also taking antyoxidants and staying away from any Sugary food and drinks. will help your body fight the cancer Femara (letrozole tablets)may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.as was told by another lady on another sit You prob all ready know  It fights breast cancer by inactivating an enzyme known as aromatase. This prevents the enzyme from supplying the estrogen that allows certain types of breast cancers to grow and survive. One of the best known of the low estrogen symptoms is bone loss or osteoporosis. Until studies linked estrogen replacement therapy to serious health risks such as blood clots and strokes, it was often recommended to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Lack of estrogen inhibits the body\u2019s ability to absorb calcium and vitamin D. Vitamin D is necessary for the body to effectively absorb calcium. Sun-screen which is necessary to protect the skin may also inhibit the body\u2019s ability to activate vitamin D found in food. For this reason the North American Menopause Society advises that a vitamin D supplement may be necessary. The latest USRDA suggests that vitamin D supplements are probably necessary for anyone over the age of 50. Researchers at the University of Melina in Italy, investigating alternatives to estrogen replacement therapy believe that isoflavones from red clover may be effective. Isoflavones are a type of plant estrogen and there is evidence supporting their use to treat other menopausal symptoms, so these scientists decided to investigate their effects on the skin. They concluded that supplements containing red clover isoflavones increased skin elasticity, collagen content and thickness, reducing the signs of skin aging, believed to be symptoms of low estrogen levels. The body is able to absorb calcium most efficiently when iron, manganese, phosphorous, magnesium and vitamin C are present as well. Thus, a daily multi-vitamin containing adequate amounts of all of these nutrients, as well as vitamin D, provides the best insurance that a woman\u2019s bones will continue to receive necessary amounts of calcium. Specialized health supplements designed for women containing plant estrogens, as well, may be even more effective, as the increase in dietary estrogenic compounds may counteract the symptoms of low estrogen levels that occur when the ovaries stop functioning. you will have to see your doctor about getting off it hopes this helps cheers",

This little bit is from this website below http://alternativecancer.us/pawpaw.htm Paw Paw extract contains (among other active ingredients) acetogenins which modulate the production of ATP** in mitochondria of cancer cells. This reduces the growth of blood vessels that nourish cancer cells. It also inhibits the growth of MDR (multiple drug resistance) cells. No other alternative or conventional cancer treatment (except treatments from trees similar to Paw Paw) has shown any effectiveness against MDR cells. Paw Paw is a cousin of the graviola, guanabana, and soursop trees. However, the acetogenins extracted from Paw Paw are more active against cancer than those extracted from these other sources. One of the effects of Paw Paw is to reduce the ATP energy in each cell of our body.

So I been doing a search on alterative treatments  and found this on The isoflavones from red clover mimic the sex hormnes estrogen, and Breast Cancer is Estrogen dependent, with out  Estrogen the Breast Cancer dies  The Isoflavones from Red clover mimic Estrogen. When it gets to the receptor on the breast cancer, it blocks it by taking the extrogen place. with out estrogen  the tumor will then srink and die. Below is only  part of the artical on red clover from the Natural news Site  The isoflavones from red clover are water soluble compounds with a molecular structure close to that of estrogen. This structure allows isoflavones to mimic the actions of estrogen in the body by fitting into estrogen receptors. Red clover has a history of use for cancer treatment due to its ability to stimulate the immune system. Other recent research has found evidence that it may prevent the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells in test tubes. It is often use in alternative cancer treatment for cancer of the breast and other hormone related cancers. Since it is able to fit into estrogen receptors it can block some of the action of more potent estrogens that often exist in the body of women with breast cancer. These more potent estrogens are the result of hormonal imbalance resulting from the body's continuing production of estrogen after progesterone and testosterone levels have declined. Earlier studies have also suggested that red clover isoflavones can slow bone loss and boost bone mineral density in pre and perimenopausal women. Red clover may protect against heart disease through its ability to increase HDL cholesterol in pre and postmenopausal women. One study found that menopausal women who took red clover supplements had more flexible and stronger arteries. Red clover may have blood thinning properties that help prevent blood clots. http://www.naturalnews.com/025089.html",

I just found this site, so I am brand new, but I like having a link to people who know how I feel and what I am going through. Karen Hi Karen sorry for what you been through I have prostrate cancer chemo has little or no effect on it to.  Because breast cancer and prostrate cancer, both are sex hormone dependent, Sex hormone therapy has an effect on prostrate cancer. But sex hormone therapy on breast cancer has some pretty nasty side effects, so doctors don\u2019t use it.  I want to tell you about the isoflavones Genistein found in red clover these Isoflavones are hypothesized to protect against breast cancer, but it is not clear whether they act as oestrogens or anti-oestrogens in breast tissue. Isoflavones can also treat breast cancer with some pretty good resultes   http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/17   http://breast-cancer-research.com/search/citedby/15084240   This link is to a A double \u2013blind, randomized placebo controlled trial on Red clover-derived isoflavones and mammographic breast density Red clover-derived isoflavones and mammographic breast density  please go to the site have a read     http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/6/3/R170   I wish you well Ray  ",

Thanks   Sounds like hand and feet syndrome I  copied this from this site http://www.chemocare.com/managing/handfoot_syndrome.aspa&nbs hope it helps cheers Ray Hand-Foot Syndrome Other terms: Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia;  PPE What is hand-foot syndrome? Also called hand-foot syndrome or hand-to-foot syndrome, Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia  is a side effect, which can occur with several types of chemotherapy or biologic therapy drugs used to treat cancer.  For example, Capecitabine (Xeloda®), 5-Flurouracil (5FU), continuous-infusion doxorubicin, doxorubicin liposomal (Doxil®), and high-dose Interleukin-2 can cause this skin reaction for some patients.  Following administration of chemotherapy, small amounts of drug leak out of very small blood vessels called capillaries in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  Exposure of your hands and feet to heat as well as friction on your palms and soles increases the amount of drug in the capillaries and increases the amount of drug leakage.  This leakage of drug results in redness, tenderness, and possibly peeling of the palms and soles.  The redness, also known as palmar-plantar erythema, looks like sunburn.  The areas affected can become dry and peel, with numbness or tingling developing.  Hand-foot syndrome can be uncomfortable and can interfere with your ability to carry out normal activities.    Things you can do if you suspect hand-foot syndrome (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia): Prevention:  Prevention is very important in trying to reduce the development of hand-foot syndrome.  Actions taken to prevent hand-foot syndrome will help reduce the severity of symptoms should they develop. This involves modifying some of your normal daily activities to reduce friction and heat exposure to your hands and feet for a period of time following treatment (approximately one week after IV medication, much as possible during the time you are taking oral (by mouth) medication such as capcitabine). Avoid long exposure of hands and feet to hot water such as washing dishes, long showers, or tub baths.   Short showers in tepid water will reduce exposure of the soles of your feet to the drug. Dishwashing gloves should not be worn, as the rubber will hold heat against your palms. Avoid increased pressure on the soles of the feet or palms of hands. No jogging, aerobics, power walking, jumping - avoid long days of walking. You should also avoid using garden tools, household tools such as screwdrivers, and other tasks where you are squeezing your hand on a hard surface. Using knives to chop food may also cause excessive pressure and friction on your palms. Cooling procedures: Cold may provide temporary relief for pain and tenderness caused by hand-foot syndrome. Placing the palms or bottoms of your feet on an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas may be very comforting. Alternate on and off for 15-20 minutes at a time. Lotions: Rubbing lotion on your palms and soles should be avoided during the same period, although keeping these areas moist is very important between treatments.    Emollients such as Aveeno®, Lubriderm®, Udder Cream®, and Bag Balm® provide excellent moisturizing to your hands and feet. Pain relief: Over the counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol®) may be helpful to relieve discomfort associated with hand-foot syndrome.  Check with your doctor. Vitamins: Taking Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) may be beneficial to preventing and treating Plantar-Palmar Erythrodysesthesia, and should be discussed with your doctor. Drugs/treatment changes that may be prescribed by your doctor: Chemotherapy treatments may need to be interrupted or the dose adjusted to prevent worsening of hand-foot syndrome. When to call your doctor or health care professional: If you notice that your palms or soles become red or tender.  This most often occurs before any peeling, and recommendations for relief of discomfort can be given.  If you are on chemotherapy pills, you may be asked to hold treatment, or need  your dose adjusted to prevent worsening of symptoms.

Thank you.    Hi shazza you cannot have radiation to the same place twice. because ever thing in that little area is dead, killed by the radiation. It stays a dead  lump of tusue in your body the body later builds around it when the radiation dies down the body will in cust the lump in bone.  radiation is used Alleviate to reduce the symptoms of pain, bleeding, or other local symptoms caused by the cancer (This is called palliative radiation.) hope this helps Ray",
