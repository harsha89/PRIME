      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the site too. My mother has had cancer since 1998, three different times. This last time it metastasized (we found out last June). Yesterday we received the news of her having the same thing your sister has, and they only gave her 6 months, although I have read things that say 3 - 6 months with treatment. I pray that your sister gets a longer period of time with you and hope that my mother makes it as well, as I'm due with our first child in July. So far she is experiencing pain below the neck as she has been for the last year, but no pain in her head. Let me know how your sister is doing. I don't know anyone to talk to about this. Kristi",

      "Content": "Hi Kelly, Yes, what a difficult time this must be for you. When are you due? We're having a boy hopefully before July 16th. :) My mom passed away on March 11th, but it was due to her liver being unable to work. She never experienced any of the symptoms of Carcinomatous Meningitis. In fact, she was very alert until her last 24 hours. Sorry that I don't have more to help you, but I hope that things get better! I am amazed that she got her vision back - that is a terrific sign. Kristi",
