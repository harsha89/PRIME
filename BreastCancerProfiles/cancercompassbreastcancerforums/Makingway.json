      "Content": "There are many cold cap therapies that those undergoing chemotherapy can use to prevent baldness. Some work better than others. Educate yourself because most doctors won't tell you about them. Most are not keeping up with these current technologies and don't care either way-cold cap use is not increasing their income. Search and you will find; Penguin cold caps, Elastogel caps, Digitana and Paxman. There is a whole topic on subject at thebreastcancer.orgweb site.",

It's unfortunate the doctors gloss over that fact. Especially so when hair loss can be prevented entirely by using a cold cap during chemo. Penguin cold caps and Elastogel caps are what is available to the public.",

It's been 3 years since my surgery. I've been denied social security disability twice and had 2 appeals. I'm still waiting for the result. Know that if you move forward that you're in for the long haul. My best recommendation would be for you to find 3 doctors who specialize in pain mgmt. Have them do a very detailed diagnosis/prognosis. Most pain mgmt. doctors don't care-they just want to provide with some meds and kick you out the door. Find one you believe will help you and continue to see him every 3-6 months to document that you have no progress in pain relief. Don't rely on a doctor provided by your insurnace. Pay out of pocket-it'll be worth every penny!",

Los Angeles County has four county-run hospitals and partnerships with about 100 private clinics that care for indigent adults and other patients. Here is a link to a local Medi-Cal office in Hawthorne, CA http://dpss.lacounty.gov/dpss/offices/default.cfm?orgid=1157 You might want to go down there yourself and ask to speak to the supervisor. Ask them what your friend needs to provide to make this happen-now!This is another link to Health Care Services in LA http://dpss.lacounty.gov/dpss/health/wgyc/pdf_files/English% Look at pages 3 and 10.

They use a needle with a large hollow core to take a sample. The first time I had this done it didn't leave a scar. The last time it left broken capillariy veins that have never went away. I'd take your doctors suggestion and give it some time. It most likely will go away.",
