(this was in 2009) and I was told everything was great.  In Febr. 2010, I found a lump on my own, went to the Dr., she sent me for a mammogram - nothing showed.  The woman doing the mammogram told me she was going to ask my Dr. to prescribe an ultrsound (she could feel the lump!) - that didn't show anything - so the woman, again, ask my Dr. to O.K. an MRI and, there it was, plain as can be, a lump on my left breast located about 3 o'clock....it was very close to the outer surface of my breast!  Seems crazy that if a Dr. can feel the lump but when you have 2 mammograms and an ultrasound and the lump doesn't show - but they STILL can feel it - that there wouldn't be SOMEONE that says try an MRI...........  That persistent tech I had probably saved my life (so to speak).  I went on to have a biopsy and, sure enough, I had breast cancer...  Please, be a little persistent - talk to your Dr. and ask, specifically, if you can have an MRI, for your sake - you really can't just wait, if it is a cancerous tumor you need to get it taken care of!!  If your Dr. won't agree, go get a second or third opinion - it's your body, it IS a big deal.  Good luck to you!!",

I HAVE \"cried out to the Lord\" - on my knees, in church, with my priest.......you name it.......hasn't taken care of it yet!! I have been filled with gratitude for so many wonders, people, family, my home, my sweet doggy, flowers, food, beauty.....my life in general.....and, so far it hasn't alleviated my problem. I found a wonderful Dr. that has helped me through these past years with marvelous (I feel \"GOD GIVEN\") antidepressants and antianxiety medications that some wonderful people (that I am grateful to) that have come up with these life saving drugs - and continue to improve them all the time!!! Pray, call upon the name of the Lord, whatever, but get some good medical help!!!!!! Been there, done that!

I have had a lumpectomy, a terrible bout with staph infection, another surgery, misery under my arm from lymph node removal, am on my 6th chemo (coming up Tues) of 8 and then 33 radiation treatments AND then God only knows what!!!!!!  I am on a lot of anti-depressants but still feel horribly despondent, cry and worry a lot, wonder \"why\"???, can't seem to get my head around all of this.  My life is basically \"on hold\" while I go through this whole process, and I feel that \"at least\" I will know what I will die of - maybe not now, but eventually - I am pessimistic about the \"cure\" thing!!!  Out of the 11 people I've known that have had various cancers only 1 has survived 4 years - the others have died from their cancers - I'd say the odds suck.......   ",

I opted for the Oncotype DX Test. The results were steller.  My chances for reoccurace are next to nill. I started Tamoxifen and radiation therapy in December.  And here lies the problem.  I hate the cancer center where I receive my treatments.  I have no other choice but to go there.  I'm stressed to the max.  I cry before radiation, during radiation and on the way home from radiation. The first day it took them over two hours to set up the simulation.  Family members (both male) of a technician came into the room during my set up.  Here I am naked from the waste up and strangers are allowed to come and go as they please.  I was mortified. I told the doctor and that was as far as it went.   My second visit I found out that two of the meds I'm on shouldn't be taken with Tamoxifen.  I printed the information off of the internet and asked the doctor about it.  She told me that I have to take it up with the doctor that perscribed it to me.  She told me that I need to stay off of the internet then walked away. I've been wheelchair bound for a year now.  One time after the treatment I was scheduled to see the doctor for my weekly visit.  The technician got me into the wheelchair, threw my clothes on my lap and proceeded to take me into the exam room with no gown on. I yelled at her and she said, sorry I forgot; chuckling. What do I do to survive this? I think that is just horrible!!!!  It's bad enough we have to cope with \"Cancer\".......that's certainly hard.....but to be treated with such little regard!!!!!!??? - that's cruel and I would hate my center, also.  I probably would have not done much when I was first diagnosed as I was so shocked and scared I walked around like a zombie!!  But, now???  I think I would be screaming and yelling at everyone....GEEZ....how would these \"so called\" professionals like it it they (or their loved ones) were treated so casually???  Can you talk to your primary Dr. or your Onc.???  I was sssssssssooooo blessed with a super, very compassionate Oncologist.....now my surgeon was another story!!!!!  Good luck and try to stand up for yourself as best as you can.",
