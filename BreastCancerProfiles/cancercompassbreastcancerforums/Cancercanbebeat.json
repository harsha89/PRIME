    "Content": "Dear Enrique, All is not lost, hard to believe but your life is full of many blessings to come. My young husband is also battling node positive male breast cancer. Getting over the shock of diagnosis is very difficult. He has had a mastectomy , lymph node dissection, eight rounds of chemo, he is in week two of radiation and started Tamoxifen. Stage 3 is not without hope. Remission is possible. It's ok and very normal to be scared, afraid and depressed. It's a tough go. It took a while for my husband to change his thoughts from \"why me\" to \"what next\". Please do not overthink and bring yourself to a dark place. All you can do is soldier through the treatment and take each step as it comes. Your local cancer agency will have support workers you can talk to, reach out, you have nothing to lose. There is such an expectation for cancer patients to stay \"positive\". No matter how you slice it cancer sucks. You can do this, believe in yourself. Hang in there. Cancer can be beaten. Wishing you all the best Kirsten",
