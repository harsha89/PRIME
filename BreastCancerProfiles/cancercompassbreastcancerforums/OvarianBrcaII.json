      "Content": "My daughter, aged 34, is at stage 4.  She is BRCA 2.  After 6 months of chemo, the cancer was gone from her bones and lymph nodes.  She then had a total hysterectomy.  She then took Femara and Kisqali.  This did not work at all; her tumor markers rose rapidly and the cancer returned to her liver.  She is now on cycle 3 of Xeloda, and it seems to be working well so far.  Good luck to you!",
