    "Content": "I had a PET scan 2 weeks before my lumpectomy.  If showed my rt lobe of my thyroid highlighted, my breast, and my Lt ovary.  I had surgery 2 weeks ago and the ovaries were remaved along with the lumpectomy.  I was told the ovaries were positive,  from the looks of the test.  They were not.  Also my thyroid was highlighted in the PET scan, so I need to follow up with a biopsy for that.  I didn't know if the thyroid had a link to the breast cancer.  I'm praying it will be benign also.",
