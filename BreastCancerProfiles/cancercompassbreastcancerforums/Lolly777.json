    "Content": "I can't help but wonder if that is more a risk all from chemo than from tamoxifen or the other you mentioned? I had breast cancer no chemo, just surgery and radiation and now take anastrozole. I'm surprised they don't have you on that since you are through menopause. I'm 56. I have arthritis so I can't tell if my ankle swelling and joint pain is worse because of my arthritis or due to the medicine.",
