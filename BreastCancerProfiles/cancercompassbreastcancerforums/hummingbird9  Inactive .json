      "Content": "Hello Britt, My Sister, who is like a Mother to me, has Stage IV Breast Cancer - When she told me first, before my sisters and Parents and even her own children it was a burden I thought I could not endure.  I thought how unfair since she was such a loving and giving person all of her life.  I thought the worst and was stunned.  Funny thing was for about a year before she got sick I had an uneasy feeling.  I had been emailing her about taking better care of herself & telling her of my concerns.  Unfortunately she didn't go to the Doctor on a regular basis and when she did find the lump & take the initiative for a mammogram, the clinic never called her and it grew for 4 years into her bones. I try to tell everyone I can, if you don't get a call - don't assume everything is ok.  As in my sister's case, it has cost her dearly - it has robbed her of her job that she loved, her ability to do things she loves and God forbid potentially her life will end before any of us are ready.  When you have a test, call, when you get blood work, get a copy.  Be your best advocate. The reason I tell you this is for two reasons.  Take good care of yourself so you can take good care of your Mother and help be her best advocate in her care. What I have learned is that it can be managable, my sister is living proof, she does her chemo and bone treatments and unfortunately has lost sight in her one eye and broken her arm twice but she is still here and she is so strong.  Every day I get up I am amazed by her will and her determination.  I believe her strength is God given.  She is my hero and it helps me get through my health issues with more strength than I have ever had.  Everyone says there is a lesson, everything happens for a reason and I didn't see that at first but now I see - her strength and resolve not to let anything get her down, her appreciation for life is what I have learned...don't just go through the motions - appreciate and show gratitude every day!  I am so grateful for this forum to connect people with similar circumstances, fears and hurts so we can all help eachother. God Bless you and your family and our prayers are with your Mother and your family. Katherine",

      "Content": "Hello Aranka, I guess I am having a difficult time accepting that she will not be with me forever....now she told me that Dr. has been talking to her about getting a blood transfusion.  She even told me rather that I have first dibs on getting her dog, which I did not know how to answer because I am not well and have a dog myself...it would be too much for me so I am going to tell her next time I see her to choose someone else but I don't want to hurt her feelings.  It is also hard for me since I do not currently have a relationship with my other sisters and have not talked to them in years.  They are very cruel drama queens & I didn't want negative people in my life anymore.  I will have to see them when they come visit her and I don't know how I will feel, I will not engage them in arguments in front of my sister...I guess I will be the bigger person and just try to get along no matter how hard it is.  Your words made me cry, My sister is my best friend and I do want to make her as comfortable as possible & share tender moments.  I've unfortunately been in this place before.  My Dad had Prostate cancer mets to bone and we sat with him for weeks trying to help him in his final days have some comfort.  My sister had just started her chemo when my Dad went into paliative care so we looked at him and looked at her and thought will this be her end too?  Bone cancer is so painful and so awful....I wish I could take her pain away. I will pray for your friend and for you, thank you for sharing your life and God Bless you XO Katherine",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I am so worried about my sister.  She has Breast Cancer that had gone into her bones, lung etc. and now she is having problems with her kidney's.  This week she had an ultrasound that showed her kidney's were enlarged and the next day bilateral stints were placed and now she is using a catheter as the neuropathy has caused her to have no sensation of passing urine.  She is an amazing person and has fought this battle for over 2 years with weekly chemo treatments but has not been able to have them in the last 6 weeks.  Her blood Hemaglobin was low so they gave her 2 pints of blood and it did go up a slight bit and her creatine level has gone down since the stints have gone in.  She lost her sight in one eye from the chemo and broke her arm so they had to place rod and pins and she never regained function in that arm. She has also lost about 30lbs in last few months.  Her speech is slurred and she almost looks as if she has had a stroke.  Every time I see her Doctor, she is with me so I cannot ask the hard questions....... should I be concerned and speak to someone about this? (like her Dr.? privately)  I am so scared and I imagine she is too but I want to prepare and take care of her the best I can.  She is trying so hard to stay strong and hide everything from us but I have a gut feeling things are not going to get better.
