      "Content": "WCElliot,  How are you? Good job explaining apoptosis. I hope it helped someone. And yes it's not like (poisoning) cancer cells (all cells,in fact),with chemo/rad.,which is foolish considering that \"cancer\" cells are already damaged and for the most part (resist) these toxins anyways. There are so many effective natural,non-toxic chemotherapeutic agents available (that can't be patented),like Turmeric (curcumin) and Grape seed extract,or better yet grape juice and wine. These flavonoids,like all flavonoids,are potent inducers of apoptosis,among other things. Another polyphenol in wine,(resveritrol) has been called one of the most potent (effective) anti-cancer compounds known. These (medicines) will re-establish the apoptosis mechanism within cancer cells, so they can naturally self-destruct on their own, and without damage to healthy cells....Malignant melanoma? No problem! (easy for me to say) Conventional medicine (can't) heal this melanoma but real medicine can! (medicinal plants and foods),unless you know someone who makes better medicine than GOD. If it were me? Olive oil !!!(omega-9 PUFAs) Olive oil is a \"wonderdrug\" and \"pharmacodynamic\". What cant't it do. I'd use it (on) my body and (in) my body, and as much as I could naturally handle. And fish oils (omega-3s).Potent medicines! We already have too much (omega-6) in our diets,which actually encourage the malignancy process and/or carcinogenesis through chronic (pathological) inflammation. Omega 9 and 3s fix that problem, and so much more. And OILS facilitate the assimilation of the many fat soluble constituents found in Curcumin and anything else you are using.I'd be interested in knowing what else you are doing,maybe I could add my 2cents worth and help in some way. Malignant melanoma is no joke,however,and must be addressed with a well-rounded (comprehensive) treatment plan, to cover ALL the bases, which is simple to do! If you want send me a (private or public) reply outlining your treatment plan (what you are using,how much and how often), in ten words or less,ha just kidding.   Sincerely   dave",

      "Content": "spunkypb,      You have been through ALOT. I say (through),because you'll get through it,all. Anybody named \"spunky\" is an overcomer! And your (attitude) does determine your altitude. Arimidex, in case you were wondering,inhibits the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogen. But the body requires estrogen. Blocking it's normal synthesis in the body seems foolish,to me, and results in osteoporosis, osteonecrosis (bone death),heart disease and who knows what else...I'm just saying.  The better way to go is (putting) natural estrogens,plant estrogens (phytoestrogens) into the body to competitively inhibit the synthetic estrogens and other estrogenic chemicals (found in everything from plastics to perfumes), and which are the real culprits in breast and other cancers, because they cause unregulated/accelerated cellular proliferation and tumor growth. Natural estrogens don't do that! I wouldn't use soy, probably the most genetically modified plant on the planet.I'd go with Red clover, which actually has more phytoestrogens than soy. In fact, as you may or may not know, ALL green plants contain phytoestrogens, so juicing greens is excellent for breast cancer. Oatmeal, flaxseed, turmeric, fish oil all have their place, and are good choices.I'd put yogurt and yeast with the oatmeal. All excellent healers of the GI tract. 60 percent, it is said, of your immune system is in your bowls. Healthy, functioning bowls dramatically boost your immune system...Co-enzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) is made in the body from amino acids, B vitamins (yeast being one of the richest sources of B-vitamins and amino acids),and vitamin E. In fact CoQ10 is similar in structure to Vit E. CoQ10 is found in high amounts in fish oils, which you use, Olive oil (up to 160mg/kg, which might be the highest),meats, and greens like broccoli and spinach, both very good for breast cancer. CoQ10 the \"supplement\" may or may not work, in my opinion. I hope some of this was helpful. Successfully treating breast cancer is simple. A well-rounded plan, is the key. I'd be glad (honoured) to help you in any way I can... I wish you the best outcome.  And if it's ok with you, I want to pray for you. You need the prayers and I need the practice.        Sincerely       Dave",

Of course there are successful \"alternative\" treatments for breast cancer. But unless you understand what something is, and what it does, you could waste alot of time. In my opinion, Oldaxe has the best idea so far,but why cook it (or zap it), and change it's properties? It will at least help to get your pH balanced. And the plant-based diet, is no doubt,what is helping tina59. And the lectins (in mistletoe injections) are found in many good sources, like flaxseed. You don't have to go to Europe for that. And Rexin-G? I read the website, and as far as I can tell, it has something to do with genetic material from a rat virus, with an enzyme, in a \"nanoparticle\". And the rest read like an episode of Star Wars, in my opinion. Maybe someone can help me out here.
