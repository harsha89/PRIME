    "Content": "Hi there,   I can understand what you are saying.  I feel like the world has not stopped spinning and I have not stopped crying either.  My mom had breast cancer 28 years ago.  She is now 69 years old.  Over the last few months we have found out she has in-operable lung cancer in the right upper lobe where there is a large tumor and extensive bone cancer which is in the neck, upper and lower spine, lower lumbar (where she is having a great deal of pain one moment and totally denies she has any pain of course she is taking pain meds at the time) The bone cancer is also in her shoulder, femur, both sides of the rib cage, the sternum and skull.  It is also in the lymph nodes in the chest area.  And who knows where else.  We still have not seen the bone scan.  It appears she has had this cancer for some time or it is moving very very fast from the number of places and size.   My brother and I are not sure what to think.  We have talked with several doctors and the lung specialist advised us to look into hospice, and talk with an oncologist so we know what to expect.  The tumor and bone cancer is considered very advanced and large.  He felt she had little time and chemo would only extend her life a very short time, as in weeks for a month or so.  Our other doctor says with out chemo/treatment, she might make it till Christmas, with treatment maybe till this time next year at best.  However when he found out she is now having trouble standing, he felt she was going very fast and may not make it much longer.    Then there is the Oncologist who only wants to talk treatment and has yet to go over the details of what we are dealing with.  She says, \"she is not the one who ordered the test\".  She wants to do a low dose of Chemo, Carboplatin, with Zometa for the bones, and depending on the pathology report (she has been waiting on for the last three weeks), Herceptin if she has the right antibodies.  The Oncologist has made it very clear she can not cure her and that this will eventually kill her.  However she feels the treatment \"May\" help to reduce the side effect of the cancer and the pain and maybe give her a bit more time.  Of course she makes it very clear there is no guarantee. She then goes on to tell my mom that she has patients who are still around after five years.  This of course is all my mom hears and can't under stand why she is so tired and her back hurts, but she is not in pain.  We are just not sure what to think.  My mom lives alone, and is very independent; however she is getting very confused and emotional and doesn\u2019t understand what the doctors are telling her.  She just wants to be back to the way she use to be and thinks she will be.  We are worried she is being given false hope and really feels she is going to survive this even though she has point blank been told she will not.  We are just hoping to see if anyone has any information on what to expect with what she has and at the advanced stage.  I am not able to talk with her doctors with out her present because they are not comfortable doing that even though I have her signed legal permission to do so as well as make med decisions for her when she can no long make them for herself as well as her written permission for the doctors to release info to me..  She gets very upset and confused the more questions we ask the doctors in front of her.    We just want the best for her and to make the most of the time she has.  The more we look for information on what she has the less we really find out.  I wish I had more info for you but I too am trying to figure out what to expect next.   Thanks for any info you might have.   Pegi",
