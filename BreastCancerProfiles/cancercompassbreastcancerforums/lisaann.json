    "Content": "Hello, Has anyone out there heard of or had experience with either the San Diego Cancer Center and/or Dr. Derek Helton?  I have stage IV rectal cancer, but I thought I'd post on the breast cancer board for more exposure.  I'm almost two years into my treatment & my medical group is requiring me to make the change.  I've heard a few good things locally, but wonder if anyone else has any input- good or bad. Thanks in advance, Lisa   ",
