Now that my mom isn't here, I torture myself with things I wished I would've said and done. Just do it and if your mom doesn't make it, at least you can say you said and did all you could to make the time as best as it could be for the both of you.

This is the first time, I've really discussed any of this outside of my family and it's theraputic so feel free to ask any questions you have. Sorry you and your mom are going through this but someway or the other, everything will be ok.  Thank you. I am trying to see her as much as I can. My Dad visits her everyday and I am trying to go most days but we have to work around her sister too visiting her as she is too weak to have too many visitors at once. But thank you cause I too originally didn't want to tire her out because I know she gets tired with the constant tests, and checks the nurses and doctors do at the hospital...but I will visit her as much as I can. I have thought about video taping, but I am not sure she'd want that as she wouldn't want us remembering her like this (I think. She looks so frail and weak and originally she wouldn't let us visit her when she went downhill dramatically because she didn't want to upset us). I have just had a baby too so I wanted to get her to write or say a message to him but I don't know how to bring it up. Hmm I already have regrets with my life like you mention too. I regret not having a baby earlier as now I feel I've taken away her opportunity to be a grandmother to my child (which she was so excited about and I know that causes her great distress that she won't get to watch him grow up) and I was waiting to get married as I wanted a child first to meet her but not I regret that too. I guess it's natural to have many regrets in situations such as this and I guess we will learn from them. My mum's own mum passed away when I was a baby so I really didn't think lightning would strike twice as they say. But my mum was such a beautiful and positive woman and I wonder if it's because she realised at a young age how precious life was and she made the most of the life she was given.  Also one other question I think you were originally looking at alternatives. Was the reason you didn't try anything else because her situation deteriorated so quickly? Unfortunately my mum has said she'll try anything and we can't find the 'anything' for her to try. I just hope other families don't have to go through this and that a cure is found sooner rather than later. I hope your regrets pass in time. If you have any other advice (you mention there was so much you regretted not doing or saying. Anything else you care to mention?) I really appreciate to hear it. And I am glad this is therapeutic for you as it is most probably good to get this out and off your chest. I too don't talk to people about it either. Mainly because it's changed so dramatically from ok to bad and because it's too emotional and a lot of people don't understand. If you need to say anything to make yourself feel better please do. The one thing I was trying to get my mom to try was juicing. I don't know if it is a big thing where you are but here in California, juicing fruits and vegetables is a huge craze. I've done a lot of research on juicing and by all my accounts, it seems like a good addition to diet. My mom really wanted to try the juicing but I'm the one who had the juice machine and I either made them too strong for her or didn't make them often enough. I have no clue if switching from a mostly solid diet to a mostly juice diet would have helped but I think mentally my mom thought it would be worth a shot. Other than that, she did the normal Chemo and radiation. I don't know if she was ever offered any alternatives but if she were, she never let us know.  This disease unites so many people across a vast distance and it sometimes felt as if I were the only one experiencing this tradgedy. It's comforting knowing (even through tragedy) that I'm not alone and there are people who are going and have gone through this phase in life.  I hope the future for your mom, you, and family becomes clear because I know for the last seveal years and I suspect for the near future, everything is hazy and unclear. I can't see past this moment sometimes and not having my mom here was like losing my site. Don't know if that makes sense but I hope everything turns out ok with you. ",

It's totally shattering and I don't know how to deal with it either except cry. I too feel like I've let down my mother. I didn't realise she was so ill as doctors kept saying they thought they could maintain it but it hasn't worked out that way and treatment after treatment isn't working now so we are down to weeks. Can I ask did your mother pass away? My sincere condolences if she has. If not, what treatment did you take up? I am researching on the internet for anything to help but there's so much information out there I don't know what to believe and don't want to make her quality of life any worse than it is. Wishing you all the very best  Hi, Unfortunately, my mother passed on January 4th. It went from 0 to 100 within weeks. One moment she was here and the next she was bed ridden and lethargic. I hope your mom gets better but if I can make any sense of it all, ultimately everything will be ok.",
