      "Content": "Hi, I am a male diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in 2014. Radical mastectomy and then radiation. I am now on Tamoxifen since August 2014 and got in an Ibrance/Palbo study in Feb. 2015. I finish Feb. 2017. They let me in the study I presume since I am a male and had a couple micro-mets in my lymph nodes. Then maybe, Pfizer,the drug company can say it has same side effect profile for males. The drug is now FDA approved. For me the side affects have been fatigue, thinning hair, and Sinusitis, all of which are listed as common side effects. All the side effects seem cumulative(have increased the longer I have been taking it). I don't think I even noticed any difference for the first 6 months. Now more tired, but only have 7 months left. It really isn't so bad. I have been calling it \"Chemo-Lite\". Supposedly many with actual metastatic breast cancer are having good results with this drug. Hope that helps. Best, Fred",

My wife was diagnosed with Stage 3c Lobular breast cancer in 2013 and was treated with the usual mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Three years later(2016) it returned having metastised to the peritoneum, retroperitoneum and bones. She has been on Ibrance for 1.5 years.Our \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://years.Our \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">years.Our scan this week shows that it has progresed to the liver and spine. Her oncologists is talking about switching her to another type of chemo but we seem to get evasive answers from her doctor when we ask about prognosos and survivability. My wife has stated that she is getting tired of all the treatments, blood work and doctor visits. I am doing everything I know to keep her spirits up. Can someone please share any information about what her likely prognosos is? I'm trying to get a straight answer so that she and I can plan for the future. Sorry if I didn't work my questions correctly, it just tends to be a little emotional for me.Stage4 for me too. Mets in liver and on bones. If you guys are comfortable with your Oncologist, then try what they recommend. I was Abraxane for 8 weeks or so, it kept the cancer from growing but no size reduction. So we tried Xeloda next and after about same amount of time i have 30% reduction in larger tumors. There are many ways to treat breast cancer mets... many. Some say best way to look at it is like a chronic disease. Take a drug until it doesn\u2019t work. Then try a new one. Hope is important, positive attitude very important. Make her mind join the fight, it can really help. There are people posting on this board that have been alive for many years after a Stage 4 BC diagnosis. Look through the whole thread for anything about StageIV. It helped me. Good luck! ,",

So far, I have had no discernable side effects from Tamoxifen after 4 months. I have been offered entry to Palbociclib trial. I would love to know people's first hand experience if there is anyone on this board that has been in the trials. The drug has been recently approved by FDA, because it is effective at slowing growth of metastatic BC. thanks",
