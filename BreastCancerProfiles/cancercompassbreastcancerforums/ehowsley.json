    "Content": "I am 19 days post-op for double simple mastectomy.  I know I have a long way to go and have read some of the posts in regards to the pain involved in recovery.  So many of you have experienced pain for months and years afterward.  My question is whether there is anyone out there who has not had severe pain for months and years afterward.  I have begun my arm exercises and when I do them, it actually feels good, but then later that day or the next day, I am in more pain.  When I went to my radiation consult, I wore my camisole and the fake boob inserts since it was my first time going out in public other than my post-op visit with my surgeon.  I was nervous about the radiation consult, but basically felt pretty good that day.  The incision areas and area under my left arm of course are still very tender, but I thought I would go insane from the pain that hit me by just riding in the car to and from the doctor.  As long as I just sit in a chair and do nothing I have no pain, but the simple act of getting up, going to the bathroom or walking across the room is painful.  I have every confidence that I am going to get better, but would love to hear some encouraging words on this website about those of you out there who have had not had excruciating pain as some of the ladies have posted.  I strongly believe in the power of the mind to help us overcome our pain as well as the power of God's presence surrounding us, but it always helps hearing it being stated by those who have overcome this ordeal and gone on to live their lives as normal as you possibly can.   I did not have reconstruction done at the time of my surgery.  My surgeon advised against it since it can delay the time when you can begin chemo and radiation.  Maybe I am strange, but the loss of my breasts are not that big of a deal to me. As soon as I was told that I had cancer and required a mastectomy, I took the time to really investigate my family history and realized how extensive it was.  At that point, it was not a difficult decision to remove both breasts.  I just want to get healed and start living this new life that I have and continue to be with my husband, children and grand-children.  That is the most important thing....to be here and to be able to be a part of their lives and if that means doing it without breasts, then that is fine with me.  After doing much research online and talking in person with people who have gone through this, I have about decided to not even do reconstruction surgery after all of my treatments are done.  From what I have heard and read, it just sounds like more pain and recovery time and at this point, I see no positive purpose in getting reconstructed breasts.    Sorry this is so long, I would just love to hear from someone who is feeling good (as possible) and who, like me, has decided to live their lives without breasts, but with the people who love them just the way they are. I have two jobs (other than being a mom and grand-mom). I am an accountant and also a licensed minister.  It is so important to me to get back to my responsibilities....to my family...to my employer and to my congregation.  My heart goes out to all of you who may be still dealing with pain, with worrisome decisions to be made and with adjusting to the changes cancer has made in your lives.  I will remember this website and all who are members of this group in prayer and pray for speedy recoveries for us all. May God bless you all in abundance, Elaine H.  ",
