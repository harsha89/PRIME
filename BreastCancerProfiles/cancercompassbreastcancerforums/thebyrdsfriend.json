      "Content": "Xanax is for anxiety.  It helped me tremendously.  You don't have to take it except when you are feeling precisely the way you feel now.  Give your doctor a call and ask for a prescription.  They are mild, and not an anti-depresent and I'm telling you it will take away that \"cancer cancer cancer\" screaming in your head.  Call that doc as soon as the office opens.  It won't make you go to sleep, but it will allow you to sleep.  It is good for in the daytime too without making you sleep.  At least that is how it helped me.  You see, I believe that if you take medicine for what it was made for, then you won't have \"sleepiness\" it will just do it's job and take away the anxiety.  I sure will keep you in my prayers that your surgery goes smoothly.  God Speed, Helen",

      "Content": "\"My GYN has hooked me up with the cancer center associated with the local medical school\".  I think you are on the right track with choosing your oncologist and surgeon.  I teaching hospital will have a specialist in your type of cancer, and they are up to date on all the clinical trials.  I wasn't diagnosed with breast cancer, mine was lung cancer.  If you click on my name you can read my story in my profile.  But, I did have to get another opinion, and you asked how you would know if you should seek another one also.  All I can say, is that after you talk with the specialists, you should feel secure, safe, and at ease with them, and their treatment options.  I guess I'm saying that you will just know if you need to seek another opinion.  I know I felt empowered after meeting with my \"team\" from the very beginning.  They gave me not only hope, but they gave me the secure feeling that they cared about my condition and truly could and would help me.  I just knew these were the doctors for me.  Good luck to you dear, and it sounds like you are asking the right questions to the right people here.  May God give you strength and courage through this path you are now following.  God Bless!",

      "Content": "I think you've missed the point Shemay.  The alternative treatment board is where all this should be.  And if you think the subject line should ward off those who don't want or need to read about these alternative treatments, you are wrong.  What part of - Tired of pink ribbons? - points to a thread about alternative treatments?  There is a special section just for those posts.  If we feel the need to seek out those discussions, then that is the section we will click on. ",
