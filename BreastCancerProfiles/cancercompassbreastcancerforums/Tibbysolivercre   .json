    "Content": "I was diagnosed in the spring of 2004, had a lumpectomy, with clear margins, node negative, had radiation treatments during three hurricanes! I also lost my job and my dog within one month of surgery. I experienced these three major stresses, plus the radiation fatigue, with the support of a wonderful husband. My 'type A' personality could not cope as well as I thought, and my surgeon put me on Paxil 10mg/day. My surgeon said I could be the poster child for early detection, as my tumor was .4cm. I have always been academic about my good health, mammos/Ultrasounds, exercise, diet, and have no family history of breast cancer. Today I take tamoxifen 20mg and Paxil 10mg. My oncologist's plan is to change to Arimidex for the last 2 1/2 years of adjuvant therapy. Six months post-radiation, I now feel wonderful, have joined a gym again, have a personal trainer and take yoga classes as well. Now to your questions... 1. Since you found out you had breast cancer, have you ever asked yourself, why me? If so, what were your conclusions? I'm not the 'why me?' type and I never asked the question. I have given thought to my five years of HRT and its risks. I have great faith and great medical support, and simply am taking the best care possible. 2. Since my diagnosis, I have made the following changes in my life_______________ With the circumstances described above, I have taken the time to \"be\" and not be compelled to \"do\" every waking moment. I am reading more, enjoying my grandchildren, working out and spending time in my mountain retreat without any guilt! 3. The most important being____________ Increased patience with myself and others. I have a refreshing view of the \"here and now\" and enjoy being a good role model for detection and positive thinking. I'm quick to tell women about early detection, small tumors and taking responsibility for self. 4. When asked what the meaning of my illness is, I would answer___________________________ My breast cancer is a part of life and I'm taking care of business by keeping myself informed of the latest advances, and being well treated medically.",
