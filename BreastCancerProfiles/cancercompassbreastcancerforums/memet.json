      "Content": "Hi All, I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in March 2007.  It was aggressive.  I went thru chemo and radiation.  I believe I started Arimidex in Jan. 2008.  I'm also had a problem keeping my weight down lately.  When I was diagnosed I weighed 160 - 165.  During the chemo I lost 35 - 40 lbs.  I now am at 170.  I also experience hot flashes. This happens mostly at night.  I go from cold to hot to cold to hot......  I find I'm most comfortable sleeping just under a flannel sheet.  I have recentely noticed my hair thinning in some areas.  I notice a good bit of hair in the tub after I bathe/shower.  I was happy when my hair came back so nicely after losing it during chemo and I hope this isn't a true problem or being caused by Arimidex.  I also experience bone stiffness.  I have had bone & joint pain since the chemo.  I can honestly say though it is much more telerable now.  As far as fatigue, I sleep alot but then again I have always required alot of sleep.  All in all I hope I can stay on Arimidex as long as it keeps the cancer away.  My CT scans and mammos since have all been clear!  AMEN!  Take care!",
