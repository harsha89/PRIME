I plan to stay on Tamoxifen another 2 years and readdress the switch then. I have not seen my oncologist yet dont know what he will have to say about that. I see him in January. Maybe you could let me know how it goes for you in 3 months.  Also for your hot flashes there is a prescription  you can get for that, they work for me, they are called APO-CLONIDINE 0.025MG. Take2 tablets twice daily. Hope this will help you with hotflashes. Good luck to you, hope all goes well with your journey to a full recovery.
