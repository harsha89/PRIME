      "Content": "I also had chemo with cytoxon and taxable and the nuelasta shot. The shot caused lots of leg pain, for a few days. I was given a painkiller, which helped, as did acupuncture BEFORE the shot. Did not work well after. Hardback pain for a year or more after chemo. Exercise, on a constant basis, eventually helped. The shot makes your white blood cells multiply, which then puts pressure on the bone. It is necessary but unpleasant. Ask the oncologist for a pain killer. The combination of taxol and the shot make it worse. Good luck.",

It continues, in an abated, come and go way, ever since. I have done acupuncture and massage, but it still hangs on. Stretching and advil help. Drs say it is muscle pain, not a sign of cancer. Has anyone else had this lingering pain? I finished chemo in April.",

Remember that physically strong people handle the treatments well, and that statistics are weighted towards very sick people. The fear is hard to live with,but the treatments can be handled well, and do not go on forever. I am just out of chemo and radiation and doing fine, and did fine throughout. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I have a very rare form as well, metaplastic carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. I got three very good pieces of advice: rare means rare, it doesn't mean incurable or terminal. Two, statistics are skewed towards the very unhealthy, and three, if you want to stay hysterical, stay on the internet! Which doesn't mean you should not try to look into this, just don't get too involved with the bad news. Meanwhile, take this in pieces. I was scared to death too, but a masectomy, chemo and radiation later, I am in good spirits-eventually, I just found each step a victory, and stopped being scared. The cancer is scary, but the things you need to go through to get beyond it are manageable. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I do not know about Chrondroid Cartilage, but I had a 5cm Metaplastic Carcinoma with sarcomatoid features that popped up overnight-it was the size of a golf ball. Diagnosis was very difficult, and treatment was decided by the Tumour Board. Not much is known of this type of cancer, except that it is very aggressive,so we went with the strongest available treatment options: masectomy, followed by 8 rounds of chemo (adriamycine and cytoxin for four, then Taxol for 4, 2 weeks apart, with Neulasta shots to grow white blood cells in between treatments) Then boosted radiation for 6 weeks. I did very, very well. Being healthy helps, and keep on going helps. Managing side effects ahead of time helps, too. Talk to your doctors the minute you feel uncomfortable-it doesn't take much to solve the problems, if you keep ahead of them. And take Sennakot before chemo and for the first few days, and do not eat carbs for the same period of time! Chemo and radiation were fine-constipation was not! It will all pass but the worry. I never wanted to regret that I did not do something when I could have. A masectomy is a small price to pay for peace of mind. Good luck.",

      "Content": "On 7/20/2008 baseballmaven wrote: Hi,   I had a lumpectomy and Sentinel Node biopsy in April, and felt like my breast and under arm had healed... I just finished chemotherapy and am starting radiation.  About a week ago I started having pain under my arm, on my side, and in my breast (which feels swollen, like just before one's period--but I'm post menopause)--it started soon after the simulation for the radiation, so I assumed it was due to the long period of time I had to lie with my arm in an uncomfortable position, but it isn't going away.   I called my surgeon who agreed that was probably the issue, as it wouldn't be post-surgical pain at this point.... but as I say, it's been over a week since the simulation... and it's not getting any better...  I don't know who to ask about this--the medical oncologist, the radiation oncologist or??? Or, am I just being dumb and it will go away on its own?  Any ideas?   Thanks so much. I just finished radiation. I don't know how flexible you are, but the simulation is tough, and I am very flexible. Try yoga, and certainly do any exercise that stretches your arm, I hope it is just a pulled muscle. However, check with all the doctors. Re: radiation, I was \"boosted\" so I had a bad burn, easily handled with different ointments to numb it and Tylenol for the irritation. I had no fatigue. I recommend walking daily to keep your energy up, especially now that chemo is done. Rebuild your physical self and hopefully radiation will be nothing but an inconvenience. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with a very rare and very aggressive breast cancer-metaplastic carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. Treatment was mastectomy, which showed no lymph lode involvement, followed by dose dense chemo and radiation, all of which I handled very well. Prognosis is fast recurrence within 2 years, or, if not, I am clear. There are virtually no studies on this cancer, its causes, cures, or pattern, so I was just given the most intense treatment available. Does anyone else have this or know about this? Right now, I feel terrific.",

      "Content": "I hope it is not cancer. But radiation and chemo can do all kinds of weird things to tissue. But you do know that there is a law that says breast cancer patients are entitled to reconstruction of the affected breast in such a way that it matches the other as nearly as possible, and that the other breast is also eligible for adjustments in order to align with the implant. AND, the implant will not last forever, so at the time that is bursts, you are entitled to another implant, or to rebuild your breast out of belly fat. I have a fatty deposit at the side of my breast under the arm. When my real implant goes in, the deposit goes out, and my other breast gets lifted. There are some benefits to all this! Hope it turns out well for you.",
