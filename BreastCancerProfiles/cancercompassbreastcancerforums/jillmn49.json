    "Content": "So, Arimidex IS the culprit! I am up in the middle of the night because of the hot flashes that seem to come every 10 minutes. I'm 58, had bi-lateral breast cancer in 2006. Had lumpectomies, chemo and radiation. And yes, have been taking Arimidex. I got up tonight, went to the computer and typed in: Arimidex and hot flashes, which led me to this site. I am so sick of this overactive internal furnace! And my joints ache as well. I recently had my hip x-rayed because of pain, and it shows arthritic changes in the bone with signs of osteophytes (bone spurs). That may have nothing to do with the arimidex, but then again, I wonder. I have also become irritable which is not like me. About a month ago I decided to take the arimidex every other day. Made no difference. The cancer did not spread to my lymph nodes. Do I really need to take this stuff? Oh, and I often wake up with a headache.",
