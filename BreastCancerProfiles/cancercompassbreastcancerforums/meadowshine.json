      "Content": "Hello Tre , I realize your post is from 08' and hope to find you doing well today.   I'm 54, my mastectomy was in Oct of this year and started tamoxifen a few weeks ago for stage II invasive ER PR + breast cancer , - lymph nodes. 10 Oncotype.   I am also a long time believer of the wisdom of using herbs, so am very interested if you would share your researched regimen.  I felt so good after my surgery and before the tamoxifen , quite markedly not so after starting the tamoxifen.  My mood has changed and sadly almost immediately experienced changes and disappearance in my anatomy and sexuality.  I am seriously questioning , for me, if the tamoxifen trade off is worth it, also due to the increase possibility of uterine and liver cancer...  A large part of me believes in the research that good self care and researched natural whole herb and foods ,laughter, simple pleasures, nature and the full range of sensual being in the world also are potent factors in decreasing the chances of recurrence. The doctors cannot monitor or write a prescription for these things.  I want to trust my intuition and knowledge but don't want to act unwisely either , the oncologist and surgeon both remind me that tamoxifen cuts recuurence by 1/2.  Anyone else out there who also has chosen to forgo tamoxifen ? I respect all who choose to and I may continue as well.   thank you, meadowshine",
