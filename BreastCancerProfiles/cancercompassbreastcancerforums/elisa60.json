    "Content": "Hello everybody I am new here. I were diagnosed with breast cancer a few days ago now I have to have portacath  put in my chest. I have a few questions to ask.  I had a heart attack in 2016  and had five heart stents put in. I want to know have anybody else had a portacath put in that have heart disease and how safe is it for heart attack patients?  Is a tube inserted down your throat before the portacath placement?",
