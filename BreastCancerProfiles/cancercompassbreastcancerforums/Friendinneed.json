      "Content": "I just found out about this sight and am sorry I don't see any reply to this board so far.  I too live with metetestic breast cancer that spread to my lungs.  I have made a decision to make the best of whatever time I have left and continue to do so.  Look no one knows how long they have so the word stage 4 should have no meaning.  I could get hit by a bus on my way to the store. So try not to be depressed and remember you have a person to talk to right here anytime.",

      "Content": "I totally disagree.  I have metastatic breast cancer HER2 positive and after my lumpectomy my oncologist put me on Arimidex every day along with faslodex injections once a month.  I received no chemo or radiation.  Two years later my latest  2 pet scans came out no sign of active cancer.  I feel this combination is saving my life.  I hope you pursued a different follow up to keep reoccurance down.  I also want to mention I am postmenepausal. I don't know if HER2Neg will have the same good outcome as I am having but please talk with your oncologiist again.  I only want everyone to live a long quality life despite this terrible disaese",
