      "Content": "I was  so glad to see your post. I too am taking avastin and 3600mg of xeloda. Going for my second treatment next week. Tell your Mom my headaches are unbearable! My doc has given me pain meds until he can figure out what's causing my headaches. He had my buy a blood pressure kit to start recording my blood pressure each time my head starts hurting because avastin raises your blood pressure and he thinks that might be the cause. We really don't know yet since I am just starting treatment. I also have severe indigestion. My husband has found me crying over the pain. Also, Avastin isn't a drug approved for breast cancer by the FDA. It is still in the trial phase. I am in a study that is in Phase III so it is very promising. I think your Mom and I are having side effects that maybe they haven't had to deal much with and that's why they don't know exactly what to do for us. I know my doc will find out the cause and I will be sure to let you know what he finds.   I didn't have inflammatory bc, I had breast cancer with node involvement in 1996. It came back in 2001 in my bones. Had radiation. took femara and aredia until last week and in between 2001 and now have felt great. In March I felt a  lump at my collar bone and found that it was cancer there, in my chest and under arm nodes. Tell your Mom to hang in there and I'll keep her in my prayers. I have to believe answers are coming.",

I read about tykerb and it sounds promising but my doc really wanted me on this trial with avastin. My prayers are with your Mom and you.",
