Bottom line- I wouldn't wait for or trust in MD's to automatically schedule you for your PETS scan and f'/u MRI's- be proactive, ask questions and don't sit and wait for anything.  I wish you all the luck in the world and will keep you in my daily prayers!! I was wondering how you were diagnosed, how did you find your breast CA and what type is it?? We are looking for some positive feedback.  Also -did you use the local oncologist/surgeon or did you go to Cancer Centers of America or somewhere like that?? We are in the early stages of this and I have all the hope in the world.  Thanks for your time and I'll keep you in my prayers. I found my cancer when I was scratching my breast.  I had a 2cm tumor very defined.  Easy to grab.  Mammogram missed it 6 months before.  At 48 I had gotten lazy on self examines.  I had lumpectomy and 2 lymp nodes removed.  4 rounds of chemo, and 61/2 weeks of radiation and I take tamoxifin because my cancer was estrogen +.  That was 2 years and 3 months ago since my last radiation treatment.    So far So good.

I had serious back pain during radiation, related to a pinched nerve and sciatica (spelling?). My lower back has hurt almost constantly ever since. I so want the pain to go away. I know it will take time for the aromosin to get totally out of my system. On March 5th, I will have been off it for two weeks. I have to say that I already notice some differences in how I feel. More energy, less emotional. It might be pychological, because I wanted to \"be better\" so badly...but I'll take it! I'm 54 years old -- so we are near the same age. I, too, don't believe that these aches are age related. Also, I had terrible hot flashes from the time of chemo, and they didn't go away until this last year. I know that chemo put me into menopause, and that resulted in the hot flashes -- but, for sure, the Tamoxifin and the Aromosin had an effect too. Best wishes to you and thank you for posting your message. I'm sorry you have the pains -- but it is reassuring to me that possibly the pain is drug related and there is hope that it will subside. Dear Suz,  You are saying everything I am thinking and feeling.  I am 48 and so tired of hearing I am just getting older.  Wrist pains, feet hurt, especially when I get out of bed.  Been off femara for about 3 1/2 weeks.  Took Tamoxifin for 1 year.  I have gained 18 pounds.  My face looks swollen all the time.  I just would like to feel normal again.  Like two years ago when I started treatment.  I will say that I am a little better.  Not crying as much.  My husband is trying so hard to make me feel loved and to make me laugh by being goofy.  God gave me a super husband.  I am so thankful.  He is going with me to my next oncology appt.  I figure I need an advocate, because I am sure they will try to bully me into taking some form of the medication.  But I need a break for now.  Maybe will feel like taking at another time in my life.  May God Bless us and keep us cancer free.   Kimarie",

I don't know what to expect, the lump is very painful, wich i know is not supposed to be cancer but on my ultrasound it showed a mass that looked half solid and half liquid. I really don't know what to think, the doctor says there is a small chance of it being cancer but that doesn't make me feel any better, the last time someone told me it wasn't something, it was. I knew I had appendicitis, they said I probably didn't, but I did, same with a fractured pelvis! and that was all last year! (not including a knee surgery last year as well) Can someone just help me with what I should expect of my surgery and maybe even the results, the lump has been there for nearly 3 months now and it is being completely removed next monday! thanks everyone!!! Dear 17, I know it is very scary.  I am 47 and had a lump removed almost two years ago.  As far as the pain, hardly any.  My surgeon did a nice job my breast looks pretty normal.  Very little scar.  My lump was about the size of a walnut.  I will be praying for you.     Kimarie",

Hello Kimarie, I have been taking Femara almost 3 yrs. now. I had a reoccurence of breast cancer after 14 yrs.!  In 1989 I had BC & had a mastectomy, reconstruction & 6 mos. chemo. It also put me in menopause at 41 yrs. Then I didn't take any drugs after that and was ok for 14 yrs. until 2003. I found a small bump near my sternum & yes, it was BC again - a tumor near my implant and it had also spread to my sternum bone.  So I went thru 8 mos. of chemo & 6 wks. radiation. Then I started taking Femara (both times the BC was estrogen positive.)  I have many side effects from Femara: bone pain, joint pain, lower back pain, weight gain, and lots more wrinkles then ever, plus it made my cholesterol go up!  (I am now 59).   At first my oncologist was going to put me on it for 5 yrs. but now he said he's leaving me on it indefinitely since it's keeping the cancer away. I was surprised when he said that but then again, I do want to stay on it if it keeps me safe. Of course I know there are no guarantees with this disease but at least Femara is what we have now to help us.  As far as the side effects you are having now, all I can say is that they probably will subside as your body readjusts  to the drug. But also be prepared for new ones to pop up ... I also have been taking Fosamax to prevent osteoporosis (it's a once a week pill with no side effects) and trying to exercise more which helps with the stiffness I seem to have all the time. But overall, even tho the side effects aren't pleasant, I am still here !!!!!  I hope I have helped you a little bit. Do write back if you'd like.    HadiaDear Hadia, Thank you for sharing info.  I quit smoking and started walking and jogging at the same time I started Femara.  I guess with so many different things popping up at one time, didnt know what caused what.  My feet are sore when I first get up.  My wrist and one thumb.  My back is also stiff.  Had adverse reaction from calcium supplement,quit taking that.  A large tendon in my arm has popped up to the surface, and is somewhat sore.  I should be thankfull that my cancer was treatable.  Guess emotionally I will stable out.  Or maybe start taking something to make me feel less stress.  I have also put on 8 lbs.  I have dieted my whole life, and now I cant lose any weight.  I am just maintaining my weight.  Kimarie  ",

She cares how I feel but says she is helpless for any treatment of the hormone imbalance.  I tried taking femara and had extreme side affects.  I am tolerating the tamoxifin.  But my emotional problems are a battle.  Anger, depression, anxiety and foggy brain.  I am coming to terms with the fact this too shall pass.  Please let this time fly by.

They tell me they found somthing that didn't look right so they need to do a biopsy.  They did this while I was awake which was very scary.  I had to wait a week, well I called the doctor to find out if the results was in and the nurse said \"no one has called you to make an app. to come in, can you come in today at 3:30.\" I didn't have time to call my daughter, she lived 2hrs away and I couldn't get ahold of my boyfriend so I had to go by myself.  I was along when the doctor told me I had breast cancer.  I'm scared, I know theres a lot of women who have and are going through the same thing I am.  Just need to talk to someone and hear there story and experiences.  I think there should be faster ways to get things done so you don't have to wait so long to find out your results. 10-23-07 has changed my life.   Dear KDMackey, I am so sorry you were alone, and that they drug there feet on telling you your results.  I think this happens to many people.  My breast cancer was a tumor size of walnut.  Estrogen positive and one lymp node affected.  I had chemo, radiation and I take tamoxifin now.  I am 48, was diagnosed at 46.  I am happy to answer any questions that I can.  Everyone responds differently.  So I can just reflect my own experience.  Kimarie",
