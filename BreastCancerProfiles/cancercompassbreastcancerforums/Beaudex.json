    "Content": "Ask your doctor about Gabapentin for your sore joints and neuropathy. My doctor recommended Gabapentin and it helped immediately. I only used it for a few months. Gabapentin is normally used for Diabetics with neuropathy. I suppose the chemo just attacks the nervous system. I had such a hard time moving, especially hard time getting off the sofa. My husband had to hoist me up. I was hard moving around, but after the blood started to flow, it would be okay. Fatigue is normal after treatment. Try to walk and get fresh air and drink lots of water. The hot flashes, I tried tons of things, mostly supplements, look up Homeopathic medicine. Try www.womentowomen.com. Try different combinations to see if they help. Make sure you use a mild sleeping pill or Tylenol PM to get your rest at night. Sex, believe it or not is really good to balance your hormones. I didn't want to believe it, and had no sex drive, but regular sex acutally balances the hormones. That is what menopause is....hormone imbalance that effects EVERYTHING. Read up on this good website: http://www.taylormedicalgroup.net/new_page_40.htm it explains a lot. Best Wishes to you, keep the faith. And keep positive, happy people around you - KEEP OUT THE NEGATIVE! Anna Breast Cancer Survivor for 5yrs (this summer)",
