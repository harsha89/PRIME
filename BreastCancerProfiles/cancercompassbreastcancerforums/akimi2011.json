    "Content": "I was diagnosed with DCIS don't know the stage, per my oncologist she's assuming i'm stage 3, per my MD doctor my lymph node is stage 1. I refuse to go chemo and surgery, i'm using an alternative non toxic healing diet therapy. It's been 5 months so i decided to go PET/CT scan they did it one time. Their findings is: The large and infiltrative breast carcinoma lesion in the left breast is mildly hypermetabolic with a focus intense hypermetabolism in the outer lower quadrant. There are two adjoining, enlarged, and intensely hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the left axilla. There are no hypermetabolic chest wall or right breast lesions. There are no hypermetabolic lung, pleural, hilar or mediastinal abnromalities.  There are no hypernatremia supraclavicular or cervical lymph nodes. There is symmetric distribution of physiologic metabolism througout the head and neck with no hypermetabolic abnormalities (worried about this). There are no hypermetabolic hepatic adrenal gland, or splanic lesions. There are no hypermetabolic abdominpelvic lymph nodes or abnormalities associated with the pelvic organs. There is diffuse, physiologic gastric and bowel metabolism with no hypermetabolic abnormalities.  There are no hypermetabolic musculeskeletal abnormalities. IMPRESSON OF MY PET/CT SCAN: Large and moderately hypermetabolic infiltrative breast carcinoma mass involving the left breast with hypermetabolic, enlarged left axilliary lymph nodes, consistent with regional metastases (please explain). After the test results my MD doctor said i'm on stage 1 of breast cancer on my left lymph node . I told him before the biopsy i don't have lump in there. They took 5 sample of tissues on my lymph node, i told him after the biopsy that's when i got that lump. As far as I know i don't have cancer. My breast is so swollen i bumped it hard twice. Can you please explain if what stage i am based on my PET/SCAN results even that finding on my head and neck it alarms me. Thank you for your time to explain thi sto me.",
