    "Content": "Hello, it's been four years since my reconstruction with the expanders (two years in pain).  It seems like every time I excercise, I have 6 days of pain in the shoulder/neck that is very distracting.  Has anyone found an exercise plan that keeps the heart rate up without hurting the neck?   My doctor recommended walking.  I'd love to get back to Jazzercise full time, it just stinks to do it and suffer later.   Thank you!",
