Keep us posted as you can.",

      "Content": "If it makes you feel any better, I have gone through this several times before -- make that four, to be precise.  You've heard of the Queen of Hearts?  Well, apparently I am the Queen of Lumps, all benign.  It's always hair raising.  If your last ultra was 6 weeks ago, it's unlikely a malignant tumor could come on so quickly that you're having symptoms, in both breasts no less.  About going for the ultra and skipping the mammo -- my insurance will not cover ultra without doing mammo first to prove the need.  It's so stupid because I have very dense breast tissue and the mammo is useless -- but they make me get one every time.",
