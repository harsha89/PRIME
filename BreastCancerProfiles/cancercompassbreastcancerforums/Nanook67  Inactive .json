      "Content": "I've been sitting here reading previous posts for a couple hours and gotten very scared.  A person who knew someone with  \"Breast Cancer Stage 4 liver mets\"  mentioned that her labs -  liver enzymes I guess it would be -  went up a couple months before she died and not until then.   I have had Breast Cancer, Stage 4, with liver mets for almost 10 years and only recently my liver enzymes as measured by my monthly labs have started to rise fairly quickly.  \"Alkaline Phosphatase,\"   \"Aspartate Aminotransferase\" and one other have risen.  My PET scan shows increased activity in the liver and I am having a biopsy next week to see if I may be HER 2  positive now. I will be starting Xeloda and if HER2 positivem Herceptin or Tykerb soon.  I am wondering if I am at the end,  since my liver labs are going up.  Has ANYONE  with breast cancer & liver mets had their liver labs rise.... then done chemo or Herceptin and seen the labs go back down again OR once they start to rise does it mean the end is near?  This sounds silly probably for me to make that assumption but....I can't help wondering and being very afraid. Thankyou anyone for help w/this question, Nancy  ",

      "Content": "Hello,   I have stage 4 breast cancer diagnosed in 2000 with mets to liver.  Applaud you for seeking second opinion as no two doctors ever agree on options.    Xeloda is an excellent drug , I have been on it for 2 1/2 years, side effects often go away after first month if one is careful to moniter the skin of their hands and feet (esp feet.)The \"7 day on 7 day off\" protocal was a clinical trial at Sloan Kettering a couple years ago and found quite abit more effective than the \"14day on/7 day off and also found to cause less side effects.  it is worth sticking with.  If your mother is estrogen positive what hormonal treatments has she been offered?   I liked Faslodex, no side effects and put me into a remission for over 2 years.   How about Taxotare and... I have a friend who has stage 4 breast cancer with mets to liver and elsewhere for whom Navelbine was very effective for over a year and - wow !  you don't have to give up your hair. Seek a third opinion if you don't get more answers.  And don't believe everything the docs tell you, I have way too many friends told they'd live (aproximately) 1 year or two or three who outlivbed that prediction by many years.   Stay hopeful.    ",

      "Content": "I have stage 4 breast cancer and begin my 12th year in February.  I did 2 chemoembolisms treatments for my liver metastasis that gave me a summer off chemo so I had time to \"get healthy.\"  Now I'm back on Xeloda.  I did Xeloda, the 7days on/7 days off protocal, (except for this past April-September) for over two years and as soon as I began this oral chemo drug again in early December I was overpowered by every side effect in the book.  I guess my system has had enough of it.  BUT I have to do it, have done most of the other chemos available in the last 11 years. My hands swelled up like a baseball mit and felt like someone was pouring acid on them.  They were not just inflamed but the skin turned tough and leathery.  (Better now -  my last Xeloda pill was taken last Saturday so it's been a week.) My feet swelled and were tender but I could still walk on them, unlike last year when I took Xeloda and the year before. My face swelled hugely and still is swollen when I wake, but it goes down 60-70% during the day.  My problem is my mouth and lips.  Mouth was so painful it took an hour and a half to brush my teeth last week. And of course eating was extremely hard but we found things that I could eat. A banana even hurt my mouth but winter squash and strangely, tuna fish, did not.  It's better, but still painful and hard to eat.  My lips are my biggest problem.  They remain ulcerated w/raw sores.  They begin to heal during the day, and then at night if I close my mouth my lips stick together  -   when I pull them apart the crusty sores (sorry - yuk) break open and bleed.  I have tried Vit E and calendula oils to heal, NOTHING has helped these sores and I have had them since I began Xeloda again .  Does anyone have any ideas re esp the mouth and lip sores?   Thank you for any help !",

      "Content": "  Dr. Lisa Rutstein in Brunswick, Maine at Midcoast memorial Hospital does chemoembolism on liver mets, injeting chemo agent directly into tumors and then blocking their exit so they stay in there and hopefully, kill the cancer mets.    She may possibly do RFA (ablation) as well - worth a check.  On 4/9/2009 Haverford PA wrote: From reading the Internet, my understanding is that the best treatment for recurrent breast cancer in the liver is surgery (a 2004 article in The Journal of Radiology) plus chemo.  The surgery recommended is laser ablation thermography; the problem is, I can't find out where it is done, other than in Frankfort, Germany.  Does anyone know of a surgeon who will do this?  I tried to get an appointment at Sloan-Kettering, and the \"referral person\" told me that the surgeons do not operate on patients with a recurrence in more than one spot (I have one bone spot and liver).  I think she may be wrong, but I can't get through (the journal article said that having both liver and bone were not a problem).  Does anyone know of a surgeon who will operate on recurrent in two places breast cancer in the liver.  They do it in Franfort, Germany, but what about the U.S?  The Internet says that the Sloan-Kettering doctors operate on breast cancer in the liver, but I can't get through.  Haverford PA     ",
