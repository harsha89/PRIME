    "Content": "Congrats! That is fantastic news. Buy the book \"Beating Cancer with Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin. Cut out sugar-tumors feed on it. Also, look into essiac tea. (essiac-info.org & essiac.com). My husband has just beat brain cancer and he has been taking the Flora Essence brand of essiac tea, beta-glucan along with his chemo therapy. His tumor has actually disappeared. They are documenting his fabulous progress and publishing it. They told him whatever he is doing to keep doing it. God bless and keep up the good work.",
