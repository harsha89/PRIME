    "Content": "for all of those who know someone with cancer or you yourselves have cancer... (((((BIG HUG ))))). I have researched alternative therapies for  cancer for the last few years and here is what i have found... 1. I highly suggest the book cure for cancers by dr.  hulda clark 2. Google and read up on the Dr. Budwig cancer diet.... this diet is amazing 3. Google and read up on vitamin b17 it has anti cancer properties 4. Google and read up on natural cellular defense ( cellular zeolite) lots and lots of testimonials from people cured of cancer 5. Google frequensea and read all of the testimonials about that as well i am by nooo means a doctor or anything like that ...ii have a dear friend whos father has cancer and i have been doing alot of research. also for those with cancer..... stop using deodorant, shampoo, hairspray, perfume, lubes, gels, creams, bathroom sprays,  etc...... USE ORGANIC..... my suggestions would be aubrey organics visit their website.. i am by no means affiliated with them. There are soo many chemicals in these products that they are feeding your cancer and making you sicker!! also sunscreen has 5 known toxins in it that promote cancer as well.... do not wear sunscreen it will give you cancer!!! also do not eat anything out of a microwave oven and check out the qlink . google it.. May God Bless you on this difficult journey!  ",
