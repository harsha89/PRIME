      "Content": "Hi there, I have been batteling inflammatory breast cancer for a year now. I had never even heard of it. It seemed to progress quite quickly. I had 4 rounds of chemo, both breasts removed, then 4 more rounds of chemo, 2 months of radiation, and waiting to start herceptin. They took a skin biopsy from me as well as needle biopsies. I would get it checked out asap. I hope it all goes well for you. I also did not feel a lump around my red skin, and it was very warm to the touch. As it progresses it starts to look like an orange peel. I am hoping mine will be ok, it seemed to respond well to the chemo, the redness all went away after about 2 rounds of chemo.",
