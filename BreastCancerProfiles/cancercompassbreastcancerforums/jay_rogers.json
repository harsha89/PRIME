      "Content": "Hi Snane, I would suggest you to let doctors decide for further treatments, because all the options are good enough to cure, but which one is worthy in your condition is needed to decide. Whatever it is but you please don't afraid of it as it is diagnosed very early and you will be fine again. Please stay in touch and keep informing us! All the best.",

      "Content": "Mammogram is just a kind of x-ray machine. You do not need to worry about it. Usually it generates pictures of the breast tissue, and can detect and evaluate breast changes. it can also locate tumors that are too small or too deep. So it is just used to identify the cancer. It doesn't mean that you have cancer if you are asked for Mammogram. Relax and be positive about it!",
