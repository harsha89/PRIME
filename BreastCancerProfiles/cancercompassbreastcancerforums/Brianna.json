    "Content": "I was 38 when i found out i had breast cancer, i was so depressed, it was a hard time in my life, but then a friend recommended a book to me, and i want to extend this favor to you. This book helped me cope with my feelings and taught me sooo much about breast cancer, i hope it can help you. The name of the book is Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, she is one of the leading breast cancer M.D.s in the US. Since reading her book i have been living a fuller life, and in October i am going on a strong women's summit, where she will be speaking and i will have a chance to meet with her. The summits are more than just about meeting her though, they are about teaching women that we are strong, and can handle anything life throws at us. This next summit is for anyone who has been touched by cancer in their lives (themselves or family/friends) check out the summits at strongwomen.com, or recommend the book or summit to someone with cancer that you know. Hope it helps you all as much as it did me. Stay strong sisters! -Brianna",
