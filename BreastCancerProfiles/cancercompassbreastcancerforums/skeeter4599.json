    "Content": "Hi Leslie  My heart hurts for you.  I have not lost my Mother, yet.  As I type this I am sitting vigil beside her bed.  She is in the hospital with stomach cancer.  I am so lost right now.  I don't know how I am supposed to go on without her.  I read your post and I it sounded like my heart talking.  I hope you have some friends and family around to ease your pain.  You sound like you really loved your Mother.  You should take comfort knowing that she is watching over you again now and always. Before my Mom's drugs kicked in and permanently knocked her out she promised me that she would always be watching out for me.  I just want her pain and suffering to stop.  I'm sorry for your loss and your pain. Sharon",
