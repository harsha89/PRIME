    "Content": "My mother had her abnormal mam and ultra sound in mid march and we have been to the surgeon. He scheduled her for a biopsy which was just done last week and then this week we meet with the oncologist then back to the surgeon. No surgery has been scheduled. He told her that the chemo wouldn't be done until after the surgery and now we are being told that the oncologist may want further testing to see if the cancer has spread. SO my question is what is the normal timeline for action?Â  She feels as though they are wasting time she already knows they are doing the masectomy. She said this is worse than getting the news she has cancer is waiting for something to be done.",
