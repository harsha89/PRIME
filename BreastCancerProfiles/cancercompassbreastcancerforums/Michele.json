      "Content": "Try not to dwell on the horror stories. Every time you start a new phase of treatment you feel scared all over again. Then you get used to it. You will burn to some extent but it's not horrible. They will prescribe ointment for you to use and my advice is to begin using it before you feel you need it. I waited a little too long and was more uncomfortable than I should have been. There is no pain with radiation unless you get a \"sunburn\". The biggest thing about radiation is that it insidiously drains you of energy over time. You'll want a nap every day. If you can, cut back on your schedule. If you have small children, I don't know how you do that but if you can, try to rearrange your life to give yourself time to rest. I had great success with juicing all through my treatments. Fresh fruit juice in the morning and a power juice of carrots, spinach and beets or celery in the afternoon. I waited nearly a month after finishing chemo to start radiation. You deserve a break and time to re-group. I'm taking Arimidex now. I feel achey, especially in my ankles and knees but I'm not sure it's entirely from the medication. I've spent years working on my feet and by now my legs are kind of shot. I exercise three times a week and always feel better. I couldn't maintain that kind of exercise schedule during chemo or radiation - I just worked out when I felt up to it and always felt the good of it. I go to CURVES and the social aspects of it were good for my spirits, too. Still are. I finished radiation around Thanksgiving last year. I will celebrate this Thanksgiving in a big way! I've learned a lot during the past year and in a strange way, feel much more contented and happy than I felt before. You'll do fine. It's amazing how strong we are. You never know until you're tested.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in right breast in March 2004. Had modified radical mastectomy in April 2004... Hormone receptive with four out of twelve lymph nodes involved. Just finished 8 rounds of chemo (4 AC and 4 T)and came through that quite well. My frame of mind has been unwaveringly high from the beginning and I'm feeling very good. I'm trying to make a decision about whether or not to go ahead with radiation. All doctors recommend it but there is enough negative information about it to make me have serious second thoughts. I'm not concerned about the short term, I'm more concerned about what happens down the line because of the treatment. I would love to hear from woemen who opted out of radiation and have information to share about how it turned out. Thanks, Michele P.S. I'm thrilled to have found this site.",

      "Content": "Hi Pepe1, No, I never received a response to my questions. I went ahead with radiation after some terrible misgivings. It was much harder for me than chemo. The whole process of getting ready for it was very dehumanizing for me...the calculations, measurements, the tattoos, the endless time in the machine to get everything just right. In the end, it was all OK. Everyone in the office was ablsoutely wonderful, patient and kind. I went through the whole course of treatment with no trepidation and in good spirits except for the very beginning. The unknown is a very scary thing. Once it becomes familiar, it's relatively easy to take it in stride. Now, a year later, I feel better than ever. My energy is good. My hair came back curly! My spirits are high. As someone said to me recently, \"You still have your glow on.\" I did make a point of celebrating the end of every stage of treatment. I had a little party after chemo was over and took a little trip after radiation was finished as a symbol of regaining my freedom. (You'll know what I mean after you make that daily trip for months.) Best of luck making your decision. Once you decide, stay your course and try not to second guess yourself. Live in the moment and enjoy the new perspective you now have on your life. There are wonderful things in store for you at the end of this journey.",
