    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast ca on Nov. 8th.  I waited 2 weeks to see a general surgeon (that is what is available in my community) who I don't feel comfortable with.  I have a referral to a surgical oncologist December 15 in a larger centre (toronto).  That is in about 3 weeks.  Am I harming myself by waiting for this specialist?  Of course I'm worried about spreading to lymph nodes (hoping it hasn't already).",
