    "Content": "I went back to the doctor because of the pain with this second lump this past week. The pathology came back and it is cancer (was there really any doubt??). I start my chemo Thursday, April 16th at 10:30 am. I will post the drugs they will be pumping me with once I have them in front of me. They have given me different medication for the pain this second lump is causing but honestly they do not seem to be doing much. I do not complain but I am a singer and not being able to sing at Easter time is truly a bummer. I will keep you posted to my progress. Thank you to those who have answered me. Even if you do not have metaplastic carcinoma I would love to here from you.",
