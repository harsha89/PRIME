      "Content": "Hi! Before I start treatment, I'm trying to do some research and learn as much as I can; yesterday I was so happy to find your website; it's so helpful . What is meant by a tumor marker?  Is it similar to C-reactive protein or ESR (sed rate)?  (both of these are markers for inflamatory disorders). I have allergies but did well for a long time by just avoiding certain foods/drugs, etc.  Has anyone tried any natural treatments for breast cancer with success? I'd appreciate any help.  ",

Mary Pat   Hi, This is in response to Mary Pat who  would like to have a cat scan to be sure she's cancer free now that her treatment has been completed successfully!  That's great news!  I delayed so long in finding an ocologist (since Jan. 2006 and then another biopsy on a lymph node in May 2007) The oncologist ordered me to have an MRI and an entire \"body scan.\" It didn't show any tumors in my body but I was  told the microscopic cancer cells don't show up on a scan so I'd need follow-up treatment. We have to live with the knowledge that there's no cure for cancer, yet, and be grateful for the life we have. I'm going to be seventy-six this month and I'm going to try to accept what each day brings, keep myself as healthy as possible, and enjoy every day. Accidentally, I came across this message board while I was looking for info on the computer about aromasin. I took arimidex for about a month when I noticed I was having pain in my right leg and left arm and my fingers felt arthritic so I took myself off it. When I went for my appointment last week, the oncologist gave me a prescriptiion for aromasin, but I haven't filled it yet.  I've been reading your messges and maybe I won't go that route.  I have some other health issues and I'm working on each one of  those, too. There's a limit how many pills I'm going to take.  I have found your messages to be very uplifting, I was feeling sort of alone.  I admire each one of you and respect what you're going  through ---most of you are so young,  I must be the great-grandmatka of you all!  EllaJ",
