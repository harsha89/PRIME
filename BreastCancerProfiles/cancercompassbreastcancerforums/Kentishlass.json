    "Content": "Hi I too am sorry to hear the news of your mum. You both need to remain positive throughout and seek light at the end of the tunnel. I was diagnosed last July with a stage II aggressive tumour, and have been through 5 months of gruelling chemotherapy to shrink the tumour and was feeling poorly throughout. I made a goal to reward myself with a holiday after the treatment, which must say I welcomed with open arms. On Wednesday this week, I am having surgery, a lumpectomy & lymph nodes removed, followed by radiation therapy. Without my positive thoughts and goals, I would have never been able to cope with my emotional shock of this horrendous disease. I am not out of the woods yet, so to speak, but making the most of my days and enjoying what I have with my family. I wish you and your mum the very best ! !",
