      "Content": "Hi Cheryl, Thankyou so much for responding.  So the thing with her wounds/lesions is that they recently just started taking over her whole chest (almost completely).  A couple days afer her chemo it will be oozing really bad and then part of it scabs up roughly a week after the chemo.  Her doctor and nurses haven't said anything about putting dressings on it, but I am going to talk to them this week because something needs to be done.  The thing that is the weirdest is that she says it doesn't hurt and just the smell bothers her.  (It smells awful)  I am almost more worried that it doesn't hurt, but glad that she is not in pain from the lesions.  I don't know if your mom's doctor did this, but they started scheduling her appointments with the doctor only on her chemo days and so she only sees her every 3 weeks (Because my mom only gets 1/2 the dose of chemo every 3 weeks IF her levels are good- like platelets and liver function).  I am going to make an extra appointment this week though so I can discuss her dressing situation and also the fact that she possibly has thrush (because she wasn't able to swallow well for a couple days and then she stuck out her tongue and it just looked like thrush to me).  It is just stressful with everything that is going on because I don't know what to expect and I just wish the doctors/nurses would let us know what is normal during this time.  Thank you so much for your kindness, I will let you know if I find anything out this week.  I'm praying for everything to go well.  Have a good Sunday!

      "Content": "Hi, I know this post is from 2011 but I thought I'd write anyways.  I'm also very sad to hear about both of your mothers.  My heart goes out to you both.  My mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2011 and she had chemo, then double masectomy, and then radiation.  It came back a couple months after the radiation, and then once again she had chemo and more radiation.  It then came back a month after that and she is no longer able to have radiation so they did a light dose of chemo because she also has a autoimmune liver disease which is a big problem because obviously they can't give her as much chemo because her liver is starting to fail... The past year it has slowly moved to her skin, but her PET scans continue to be negative for organs or bones.  Her chest is now almost completely covered in lesions and looks like a big scab and then it peels and will ooze and does smell a little bit.  She is the sweetest woman and says it doesn't hurt, but she does say that her legs cramp and she has excruciating bone pain because of the neulasta she gets after chemo.  She is constantly tired and I can tell it is taking a toll on her, she finally went on to disability this year because her doctor kept bugging her that she needs to rest and that she shouldnt be working... which I and my family agreed.  She has horrible chemo brain and she is very forgetful, how was this with your moms? I am just having a hard time because I feel she is deteriorating right before my eyes.  I find myself preparing myself for the worst and I just want to know if any of this sounds familiar to you guys and if there are any cues that I should look for or things to expect.  I just feel helpless and would love to have some support with this situation and it would be nice to talk about similarities just so I know what to expect or should expect.  Thanks in advance, Brittany",
