      "Content": "I finished chemo 1 year ago this month. I still have pain and tingling in my arms,hands,feet,and legs. All the doctors said it may subside and it may not. I am a diabetic and this added to the problem. I do believe that keeping on the move helps, but if you have to live with it at least you are alive. Good luck. Jacquie",
