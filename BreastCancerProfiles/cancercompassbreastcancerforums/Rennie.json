      "Content": "I had Breast CA, dx 10/2006, Triple Negative Disease. A lesion was found in my left arm hot on bone scan. It was biopsied and the results were negative. I was treated for Stage One Breast CA. I participated in a clinical trial so I had surgery to remove the cancer, did Adriamycin IV weekly and  Cytoxin oral daily x 12 weeks and Abraxane IV weekly for 11 of the 12 weeks, and had radiation, 37 rounds. I had back pain prior to the CA dx, especially at night and the early morning. I was injured 2 times during and after the chemo , with my back pain worsening. Now, I have back pain, rib pain and occasional right arm pain and ongoing left arm pain. I wake up in the night and the morning, it feels like I have a side ache but its in my ribs, it wraps around and my back throbs with pain, it almost feels like my back and abdomine are fused and the pain causes nausea, a deep breath causes my pain in my chestwall to worsen. I don't want to see the doctor because all my tests are always negative and I feel like I always cry \"wolf\". I don't know if this is just a normal pain or something different. I seem to have gotten a pretty stiff dose of chemo that affected my life severely which has lead to disability.  Thanks for your input.",

(colon and Hodgkins disease previousley all seperate times). My dad was 56. I am 36 and still morning him and just reallly can't believe that I, (1) have breast cancer. (2) they want to take my breast and (3) want me to consider having my ovaries removed. I have researched so much online that I am overflowing with info so now I need some survivors to tell me its not so bad losing your breast. That the reconstruction immediatly is going to help. So how bad is the pain of the R.S. and how bad is Chemo.  I'm sorry to hear you lost your Dad to CA. He must have been a hero to you. Three types of CA, wow!  I have met people that have survived CA it seems they have learned how to live their priorities, and maximize their living. I'm sure you have learned alot about coping from your Dad. Having BC isn't too bad, I'm 41 and surviving!. My surgeon said to approach Breast Cancer on a continum. Start with the smallest surgery you need to rid yourself of it, if it shows you need  another surgery then cross that bridge if you need to. Don't look to far ahead, take one step at a time. I had a lumpectomy w/ sentinel node excision. I was dx Oct 06. My staging lead to a bone biopsy which was negative but because of the type \"triple negative IDC\" and age premenopausal, I had chemo. I was on a clinical trial which was nice because it insured I got GCS-F when I got my chemo, adrimycin/cytoxin. GCS-F stimulates WBC production so I never got sick . I recommend allowing others to help you. My church regularly prayed for me and brought me and my family meals 2 times a week. Listen to your body, if it's tired rest. Eat 75G protein a day, this will keep your muscles strong. I backed off in the end and ended up getting very weak. Exercise a bit, walk or do isometrics, it gives more than it takes. I am getting radiation now because lumpectomy + radiation = mastectomy. The rest is up to Providence. Take care, I've prayed for you. ",

      "Content": "I went through the procedure twice, I live in the Northwest. We usually have a good wind storm in November, of course, this is when my lumpectomy was scheduled. I went to ultrasound for the wire insertion and then to nuclear med, for the nuclear tracer injection I received 1 shot in my nipple, Our yearly wind storm struck shortly after the tracer injection. I didn't seem to be bothered by the injection, they used lidocaine for both procedures to numb my tissue, but anxiety is always present, especially when your private parts are being exposed to such unnatural procedures. The storm hit and the power went out at the hospital just after I got my versed (antianxiety medicine) so I wasn't toooooo bothered by the cancelation and rescheduling of my surgery, the wire removal and those two lovely procedures in prep for the lumpectomy...Needless to say my good nurse had versed waiting for me when I arrived the 2nd time for my procedures and  lumpectomy... The second time I needed four injections because I had an older MD, so drugs go along way in helping us cope. It's amazing what we can do if we understand the importance of our choices. I also know that praying makes a difference.I'll be praying for you:) Rennie",

Does anyone have any suggestions. I haven't got much info on helping me cope with this. I think I'm more scared of the rad tx. compared to the chemo. I'm a RN and have treated pts w/ radiation burns and the damage is terrible. I have an appointment w/ a nutritonist upcoming, but I've found cancer survivors are the best teachers. Please help.

      "Content": "I am needing to take 2 weeks off of my radiation(RT) to get my daughter off to college. My MD is aware of this. When we discussed this he said it would help with my skin's tolerance of the RT, and minimize burning (I will have 12 RT before I leave). I started to consider the internal effects of RT and I figure it is doing the same damage internally, already after 2 tx I feel the breast and muscle tissure tightening up when I stretch. So I am considering taking off a week or 2 after my 26th RT, After that I'll have 11 focused RT on the cancer site and I'll be done. Is that reasonable? I'll run it past my MD as well. But I enjoy working w/ the MD not being driven by him. Are there any clinical trials for RT?",

      "Content": "Hello, I just finished up one year of treatment. I have stage one triple negative breast. I had to have a Bone Marrow Biopsy to rule out mets. I didn't have it but my Oncologist told me I needed chemo and radiation. Chemotherapy was tough, the worst part was I was on a trial and the SE from the Abraxane have left me with sore muscle and joints. I still have weakness in tendons and ligaments. When this all started I understood that I wouldn't be given more than I could take, as well as my family. I have stayed surrendered to God's complete and total will, I embraced the difficulty as my very cross, as Christ embraced his for our freedom, so we could cope though our troubles and difficulties and ultimately be redeemed. I have confidence and I want to give you confidence that our times are in His hands we need not fear or dispair because we will be given to tools we need to cope though any trouble. The pain of chemo after effects will wear on and off. Ask for special grace and walk in His confidence and care and you will find the help you need! In His Love, Rennie ",
