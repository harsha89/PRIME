      "Content": "Thanks for your reponses! I should clairify. I am definately stage 2B, since my tumor was larger than expected 3.5 and the two positive lymph nodes. When this all started I felt a thickening in my breast. I had been following this breast for a few years and the MRIs had always been rated a 3 and then we would ultrasound, two needle biopsies were negative. Then we saw some real changes this time and the tumors (2) looked small. Because it was multi-focal and the tumors were wide apart both doctors I saw said it should be a mastectomy as opposed to a lumpectomy. I was encouraged that if they were both small I might only need a short course of chemo or maybe none at all. I went through PET scans, MRIS, PEMS, etc and all showed no lymph node involvement. Slow growing, mid range aggressiveness. Fast forward to the surgery (only 12 days later) and the path report showed a much, MUCH larger tumor, higer aggressiveness, and then the sentinal node was positive so they did an auxillary node removal and there was one more node that came back positive out of 20. My surgeon was so encouraging before with the thought that I might get away with surgery and a short chemo, now is not so optimistic. She reported to me that studies show that young women with breast cancer have a lower rate of reaccurance if they are given radiation and chemo. All the doctors seem so upset about the positive lymph nodes. I am meeting with my oncologist on Tuesday to learn about my treatment plan. I will be going to a second opinion. I have great PPO insurance. I was also thinking of having my slides read by another pathologist since the biopsy report was so different from the surgical report??? Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone! I had a single mastectomy about two weeks ago. They thought it was stage 1 but I had two tumors, one was about 1 cm and the other was 3.5 cm. MUCH larger than expected. ER/PR +, Her2 -, and unfortunately two lymph nodes positive, K67 tests were 3 and 8???. PET scan and MRI negative for lymph and other areas, but I am really depressed. Doctors were telling me that chemo was a big maybe and now I am stage 2B and they are talking chemo, radiation and not so encouraging about my chances for survival. I am freaking out. I don't mind the treatment (had a port put in yesterday) but I want some hope to hang my hat on! Everything keeps changing for the worst and I don't trust anything anymore. Please give me some advice. I am meeting with my oncologist on Tuesday and can't stop crying. Â Best wishes to all.",
