    "Content": "My wife was diagnosed 10/13 with breast cancer, had a left side mastectomy 11/20, started chemo 12/20, and just finished her fourth round 2/10/14. She is as type A as they come, and I'm much more laid back, but the thing that is getting me is that she is SO angry, 24/7, at everything and everyone. Nothing is right, everyone sucks. She is the Pres. of her family business, I'm there too as a VP, and staff are coming to me saying they are ready to quit because of her behavior. I'm sick to my stomach as I write this. She's saying I don't support her and help her, but she doesn't ask (she considers it \"begging\") and I don't read minds and then she goes into bitch mode when things aren't perfect. Tell me you're going to lay down and I'll take care of the rest.Â Don't lay down and get furious when the kids are jumping on you and I'm downstairs. I have resorted to just staying away from her because of the nastiness. We have four beautiful, creative, caring, smart kids (10,7,5,3) who know about the cancer (Mommy's boo boo) but are often the focus of her anger if the house isn't tidy enough (when IS it with four kids?). I need some guidance here...I am NOT perfect, I forget things when I am extremely busy (as we are in the business), but I don't believe I deserve the daily blasts I get. I fear for the company (and our house) and our marriage.",
