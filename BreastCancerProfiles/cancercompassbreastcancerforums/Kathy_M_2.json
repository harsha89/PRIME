      "Content": "Laura, Since I wrote last, my sister has improved dramatically. It was only after visiting her former oncologist at Sloan Kettering in NYC that she finally got the right mix of meds for the clots. It was also determined that she was not on a large enough dose of coumadin in August. That's why she got the 2 other clots. I think the doctors were nervous to give her a higher dose because she has a brain mets and they were afraid of bleeding. The doctor at Sloan put her on 1 shot of Heparin per day which has made the difference in her quality of life. She is able to get around much easier now although not for long periods of time. I posed the question to her oncologist as to why she is getting the clots and bottom line is it's because of the cancer. Some people are more prone to getting them. The filter was put in as soon as the first clot was discovered. This has been a wonderful thing. Who knows where these clots would have wound up! Don't remember the name of it. I can find out if you would like. I wish you luck. If there is anything else you'd like to know I'll be glad to answer your questions. Kathy",

      "Content": "Has anyone had any experiences with blood clots in your legs? My sister has breast cancer and has developed 3 clots within the last month. She had a filter put in which has prevented the clot from moving to her heart. She's been on warfarin for about 2 weeks and was doing great until yesterday when another clot appeared this time in her thigh. Her doctor just said to keep off it and use warm compresses. I would just like feedback on anyone's experience with this. Thanks. kathy",

      "Content": "Laura, Reading your words I feel I am experiencing my sister's pain all over again. My heart goes out to you because 2 months ago I was in that same position. Watching her go through the pain was overwhelming to me and my family. Because we were there for her, also helped her get through these last 2 months. I am grateful I was able to be home (I work in a school). Be strong for your husband. I know it's very hard. We are the caregivers. I don't know if you have family around you or close friends but make sure you do. I have 3 other siblings who live out of state and they took time to come and help out. It was a godsend believe me. If just for a couple of hours. Please feel free of email me anytime. As for the filter that was one of the best things that came out of all this. It was put in near her groin in the large artery that runs to the heart. What it does is it prevents clots in your lower body from traveling to your heart. The filter breaks it down. It's called the IVC filter (it may be the same one you mentioned). It's in for life. It was put in after they discovered her 1st clot. It took all of 15 minutes to do right in her hospital room. Very non-invasive. She wasn't on a blood thinner then but I would think that because it is very small it would not pose a bleeding problem but certainly ask the doctor. The blood clots began in July and it's only since she was put on heparin 3 weeks ago that her legs have been feeling better. She just said to me today that she thinks the one in her thigh has broken up. So it does average at least a month, Laura, for the clots to break up. And there are no guarantees they won't come back but for now she is walking her dog several times a day and sleeps better too. Her appetite is something to be desired. We did the vitamins too. They did help for a while but then the clots came and she hasn't been on anything since July. Only today she mentioned about getting back to taking them again. My sister too has to go through chemo very soon. I'm hoping by Christmas we can look back at this horrible time in her life and celebrate the future. I pray that you and your husband have the strength to get through this difficult time too. God Bless.",
