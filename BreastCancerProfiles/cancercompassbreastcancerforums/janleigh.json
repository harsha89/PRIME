Four pics TOTAL!  As for the pain, well. it is different for everyone and the exposure takes mere seconds though it feels like an eternity.  This whole thing of the amount of radiation you receive is why you wait 12 months.  Most insurance companies will not pay if you try to go ONE day before 365 days.(Unless you need follow up work).  Radiologic technology has evolved tremendously since 1928 so I would not hesitate to get a test done especially if it shows calcifications that a ultrasound or MRI will not show.  Thermography can't localize it.  And just know that if you go spend a day at the beach-- forget about the amount of rads you get from a mammogram!  If I should ever have the pleasure of performing your test-- please don't ask about any new test because until the FDA approves it-- it ain't gonna happen!Ok it's four pics total. \"The pain is different for everyone\" You know it's a test not a procedure it shouldn't hurt. If a man had to put his private parts in a vise for \"mere seconds\" I can assure you the medical community would develope a new test fast instead of the vise. I did not get a mammo for 2 years because of the injuries I sustained from a mammo at a very well know chicago hospital. I had bruises across the whole top of my chest down to my breast then more under my breast and I was screaming in pain . The bruising was there for months. The hospital personnal shrugged their shoulders at me and so did my old doctors when I explained what was done to me and it had not been the first time. It was just he most severe. and your are right it ain't gonna happen!! Because no one wants to show what the techs do to you. I say the techs because that is who it's being blamed on it's being blamed on you. The doctor,nurse,respectionist,and  other techs say it's not the test it's the Tech that did that to you. I say BS. It's the test it's wrong and I will not have another. I attempted to last week and I had to stop it. She said she got it and she would have to do the side few,but it was going to hurt more than the last pic did. Then I stopped it.   As a mammo technologist I can tell you that not every tech is the same.   I get many patients who have gone to other sites and have been mishandled.  Like anything there are always bad apples.  I take the time to ensure that my patients are not in pain, or being pinched.  Some women are just more sensitive than others.  Some women take a sharp intake of breath when I lift their breast.  Some women have hardly any feeling at all.  MRI have a large number of false positives and that is why they are not the standard. For women under 40 however they are better than mammography.  Women under 40 tend to have denser breast the MRI is better than mammography.  Yes we miss cancers however it is still the best form of cancer detection that we have.  I will be the first to sing the praises of anything that finds a breast cancer better but for now mammography is still the best and suppliment it with an ultrasound if a lump is found.  Just remember that every test has its risk.  We don't know all the effects on cells from an MRI or the effects of ultrasound on tissue.  We have what we have.  Mammography is still the best and more women are finding cancers but also SURVIVING cancers because of mammography finding them sooner. ",
