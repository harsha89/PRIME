    "Content": "Hi all, After surgery, chemo and radiation, my onc put me on Arimidex. At first, my hands were just stiff, then they began to be painful, and after ten months, the pain was so excruciating in my thumb joints that I couldn't even sleep. I had no strength in my hands - I couldn't open jars, brush my teeth or even turn a door handle. The doctor took me off of Arimidex for three weeks, then put me on Aromasin. The pain subsided a bit during those three weeks. Now, after a month on the Aromasin, my hands are not as painful, but they are extremely stiff and my hips and thigh bones are painful. Sometimes they wake me up at night. In all, I guess you could say Aromasin isn't as bad as Arimidex for arthritis-like side effects. But it sure isn't a picnic! I hope all this discomfort will be worth it for cancer prevention. Nancy",
