      "Content": "Hi Lori, I suffered the same problem as you, and Lyrica worked really well but here in Australia it is too expensive to use continually.  I was then put on Gabapentin which is usually used for epilepsy and this, at 300mg - one small capsule per day, has managed the neuropathy quite well.  Now I no longer drop things and do not have night problems with my hands.  Best of all, all pain is gone!  So hang in there -- I've been on Gab for almost 2 years and the neuropathy is more an awareness than anything else.  They say 'time heals' -- well, in this case I think they are right.  Best wishes and give the meds time to take effect!!  Cath",

      "Content": "Hello sweaty lady, I have multiple myeloma and the severe hot flushes are a common symptom for many people with MM.  We do not know if it is the various medications that we are using or whether it is a factor of cancer in general.  The hot flushes seem to affect both men and women and are often symbolised by excessive sweating from the head -- a bit like a having a sprinkler operating just above the crown of ones head causing the water to run down in driplets like drops of rain!  This seems to be worse in warmer weather, when the person is in a stressful situation, and happens both day and night in huge amounts.  No one has a solution, but it would be nice to just 'know' if it is a general symptom of cancer in general.  I personally carry a dry wash cloth to use as a mini towel to wipe my constantly dripping head!!  Most people think that I have been caught in a rain shower because my hair gets so wet!!  Good luck in sorting this out -- if you hear of a solution please let me know.  Best wishes, Cath",
