      "Content": "I too went for X-rays and ct scan the only way they found out for sure was with a PET scan. That finally showed the cracked ribs. Push them a little more to find out what is causing it. Always better to exhaust all so you have no doubt. Good luck wishing the best. Radiation is the gift that keeps on giving.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in 2003 followed by 6.5 weeks of radiation. At that time my oncologist said that as a result of the radiation you can have cracked or broken ribs up to 2 years after. Well it was 2 years and I was pulling weeds in my garden and it happened. After many xrays and scans having a hard time finding what was causing the pain, she sent me for a PET scan that found the 2 broken ribs. I was then told that they never heal completely. This is true because when I do certain poses in yoga I can feel them pull and I have to change position to make the pain go away. Just the other day I was leaning over tying my tennis shoes and I felt another rib crack. So it seems that this condition never goes away. Unless you really, really need the radiation, I would recommend not to have it. My cancer was a stage 1 and if I had it to do over again I would not have the radiation and just take my chances. I hope this helps others.",

      "Content": "I'm so sorry you are having the rib pain. I have questioned this for years. I had my bc surgery and radiation in 2003. I had rib pain on the left side and after many xrays and scans they found 2 cracked ribs in the back area. After conferring with my radiation oncologist I found out that the ribs never heal (due to radiation) and that this can and does happen up to 2 or more years after radiation. At this time if I turn a certain way or do certain yoga positions I will feel intense pain forÂ a minute or so until I get out of that position and return to normal. It seems you just have to live with it. At least I know it was not the cancer that had returned. My suggestion is to have it checked further to make sure you are cancer free. It seems that this happens more than they are willing to acknowledge.",

To this day if I twist a certain way the ribs in my back will let me know not to twist that way. It hurst like heck until I get in a position where they are back in place. It is not as constant as it was in the beginning and I can live with it and even play tennis. Everyone doesn't need the radiation but if you do it may save your life.",

I'm now 13 years past and a survivor but still have the effects it. Please be aware that the prednisone you are on can be very damaging to your bones. We just had a daughter 46 years old die from its effects due to osteonecrosis of the hip. No blood going to the hip joint. During the hip replacement surgery she had a pulmonary embolism and died. She never fell and was told it was a pulled hip flexor until someone finally did an X-ray. She was only on it from February to May this year. Please ask your doctor about this and be very careful. Best of luck.",
