    "Content": "I had my annual mammo in May which lead, eventually, to a stereotactic biopsy for some microcalcifications in my right breast. The biopsy came back and I was told my my family doctor that it was 'normal' and that I could go back to my annual mammogram I got a copy of the biopsy results and on the pathologist's Final Diagnosis it states \"Ductal/Acinar Microcalcifications (rare)\" followed by \"non-proliferative fibrocystic changes\". I was told that the acinar microcalcifications can be a sign of Acinic Cell Carcinoma of the breast, especially since the pathologist listed them as 'rare' I do not know if I should follow up on this since my family doctor told me that the results were fine and to go back to annual screening. On the biopsy it does say that there was no sign of malignancy. I do not have a mass, tumor or palpable lump in that area. I am trying to find otu more information and if I need to schedule a follow up appointment with anyone. Does anyone here have experience with this or have any of you ever gone through this? Any advice or information is greatly appreciated",
