    "Content": "I started Anastrozole last month.  OMG. Does this drug cause gas?  I mean, gas that can last up to 10 seconds!  And it's constant.  I have never had this problem.  I tried taking Beano but that doesn't seem to help.  It's so embarrasing. I'm on so many drugs but this is the last one that I've been prescribed. I'm even too embarrassed to tell my doctor.",
