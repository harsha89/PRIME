    "Content": " I was diagnosed in February of 2010 with IDC Tubular cancer - grade one with no lymph node involvement. I had a standard course of radiation and then started on Femara. After 5 months I had severe joint pain. I then tried aromisin and lastly arimedex with the same results. I stopped taking the arimedex in February. After three months my symptoms have not resolved. I have severe pain in my hands and feet. I am concerned that it will never go away. I met with a rhumatologist and had a very extensive work up.  He feels that the pain is a result of the medication. Doesn't know if or when it will resolve. My oncologist has not heard of anyone having long term issues with pain but is OK with my stopping the drug. Has anyone experienced long term residual pain in hands and feet?",
