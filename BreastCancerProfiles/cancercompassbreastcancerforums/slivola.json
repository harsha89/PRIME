    "Content": "Sorry so to hear about your mom.  My mom had ovarian cancer and I joined an on-line caregiver support group through www.cancercare.org.  If you email them, they will assign a social worker to you via email who will ask you questions to match you with an appropriate group.  It might be a good support network... Has your mom looked into IV Vitamin C treatments in addition to whatever she's doing now?  Look it up online- the research is very promising and even traditional oncologists are now starting to recommend it!",
