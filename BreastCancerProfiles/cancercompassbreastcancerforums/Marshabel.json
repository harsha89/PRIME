    "Content": "Had lumpectomy and sent node biopsy 2 weeks ago.Lymph nodes and margins clear, HR and PR negative, grade 3, invasive ductal carcinoma, approx 3.5 cm. As for the HER2, it said no over expression. Not sure what that means. My oncology appt is still days away, and I am going crazy with the waiting and wondering. Feeling overwhelmed by it all, and don't know what to do about my job. I took a medical leave when this started, but don't know how to plan for a return to work until I know something more definite. Is there anyone out there with a similar diagnosis who can give me a clue on what  to expect? Marshabel ",
