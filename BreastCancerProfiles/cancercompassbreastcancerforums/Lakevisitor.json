Thanks for your input. I am a 56 year old woman.  For years my mamograms showed cysts they said were normal and not to worry.  This went on for about 5 years. Beginning of 2016 I could feel the cycts getting bigger (size of almond) and went back for mamogram.  Once again they said normal and did an ultrasound to be sure. Yep, normal.  I had to insist there was something wrong and it wasn't normal.  I found another doctor and he agreed, they were not normal and had a biopsy done on one breast. Came back as cancer.  Did and MRI and found lots and lots of tumors in both breasts. More biopsies and found to be cancerous.  Here is the clincher, it wasn't breast cancer, it was cancer of the appendix that had spread to my breasts.  They say you never know about the very rare appendix cancer until it spreads.  I had a double mastectomy done last week with reconstruction at same time.  Wow, it was a absolute walk in the park. No pain, very little discomfort. Had lymph nodes under each arm tested also. I was back to work on the 6th day.  My breast tissue was also very dense which made it hard to determine.  Docotor said I had been misdiagnoised for years.  Get it checked, don't wait!! Go to another doctor, only you know your body and pay attention to the signs!  I hope this helps and all goes well.",

Good Morning, I just had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and it is wonderful!  I had some lymph nodes removed under each arm and implants placed between the breast muscles. Kinda like a tag team, one doctor removing and the other implanting, side by side.  I have to say, it was a walk in the park.  I slept the first day, roamed the halls of the hospital the second day until they told me to go home.  I had the mophine ball removed on day four and no pain or anything since.  I will have the drain tubes removed tomorrow, no appt. available until then.  I went back to work on the 6th day. The day of the surgery, all I could think of was running out the door everytime I saw one. I was absolutely terrified of what was going to happen before, but now I am so happy I went through with it.  Good luck to you, I hope all goes well!",

      "Content": "Hi, If you touch my pride ID you will be able to read other replies that given more detail to my history. I am diagnosed as stage 4 neurondoctrine neoplasm carcinoid. My cancer is a slow growing type that chemo or radiation will not help. As the tumors appear, they will have to be removed. The cancer is determined by levels of some hormone in my blood. When levels get too high, I will require a monthly shot that will help suppress the hormone my body is producing. I have been a work in progress for about 41 years now. My first sign was a tumor in my right lung the size of an orange. Like I stated before, immediate reconstruction worked well for me. Unfortunately, everyone heals at a different pace as well as everyone handles pain differently. Best of luck to you.",
