    "Content": "I too have survived BC, lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. I was on Arimidex for 3 years, I finally asked to go without it for a month and all my aching legs symptoms went away, I felt awesome!! Then they had me go on Aromasin, 1 yr later I stopped that as I had the same symptoms again. Now I just started Femara this week for one year. If those same symptoms come back, I won't have to take anymore meds... Â Yes, the first 2 made me feel like an old person. Hurt to walk far, getting out of a chair was a chore and hard to lose weight when you feel like that. Now I am on a good road to recovery.....we shall see how this med works. How long did it take for you to notice side effects?",
