      "Content": "Please do what is necessary and what the dr suggest.  I was Stage 1 and 366 days my cancer returned and now I am fighting metastatic breast cancer and I only had a 10-13% chance it would even return.  I did everything the Dr wanted me to and now here I go again. Having side effects are very hard and learning to live with the new you is very hard because we will never be the same again but it's a very small price to pay to be alive and I wear those long term problems with pride because many did not get that Chance",

      "Content": "My understanding it's a receptor inside a cancer cell that helps cancer cells multiply. I was positive and it is not what you want cause it basically tell cancer cells to multiply faster. I was 365 days in remission, went in for my normal four month check up on 366 days and blood work came back with concerns. Found positive breast cancer on lymph in my neck. This time I am positive for ES which I had no clue that cancer cells can change which they can. Thank God I am not triple negative. Starting all over again with tx. My oncologist told me that a 1 cm tumor contains 1 billion cancer cells. My initial was a 6 cm tumor in left breast. That's a lot of cancer cells and not all of them can been seen with a microscope. So I pay this time my chemo and now radiation will keep me in remission. One more fact. A HERII positive result like I had first go round has a 20 to 30 % recurrence from 1 to 15 years.",
