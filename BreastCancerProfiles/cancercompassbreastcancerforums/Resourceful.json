How does one know under these circumstances how well the loped off breast is really looked at? Section A and Section B on the 1/2 page report said no cancer.  I would have preferred about 20-30 sections to be taken; however, too late.  I am sure they will turn this around and say I over worry etc.   The breast is gone, I do not trust the  path report of 2 areas; at least nothing jumped out and I am happy.  An inverted nipple alone gave me room for pause.  At last have MRI, CT, maybe bx of lumps and who knows? follow up again for sizing - if they grow you are in deep mess-follow the size.   Good luck    ",

Look up food inducers to arimidex, as inducers would prevent the arimidex from absorbing in your body at all thus you would receive no benefit period. I saw a list in breastcancer.org of Herbs with estrogenic effect I was rather surprised: (one does not want to ingest more hormones which you have just tested positive to ER&P+bc), flaxseed, dong quai, red clover, black cohost, ginkgo biloba, licorice root, reservertrol, rasberry leaf, red yeast extract, siberian ginsent, alfalfa, milk thistle, soy isoflavone, wild yam. You have to be very careful of taking vitamin and herb supplements as they may be counterproductive and I have found most times the people selling them really do not know the relationship to ER&P+ receptor bc. I just learned 3 days ago not to take vit & herb supplements with water as they do not metabolize, you have to have some fat or oil substance to promote metabolism - there are so many helpful hints for one to help themselves. All this hype on green tea-the original green tea from china was pure, but the mass produced high volume we get contains massive DDT enough so that it can be measured in a person's body--so I read. Read, and think thru the garbage, its your life.",

      "Content": "  On 9/16/2009 heythere wrote: One minute of radiation in the operating room (OR) could save the lives of thousands of women being treated for breast cancer in the US today. According to a growing body of research, a 60-second course of radiation therapy delivered during surgery dramatically improves results. But, until recently, logistical and administrative difficulties prevented most patients from receiving this crucial treatment until weeks after their procedures. Now, a portable, self-contained radiation therapy system, the Mobetron from IntraOp Medical Corporation (OTCBB: IOPM; Sunnyvale, Calif.), is changing all that. St. Joseph Hospital (Orange, Calif.), one of only 16 prestigious designated National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers, this month introduced the first ongoing intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) program for breast cancer. During lumpectomy surgery, St. Joseph's patients receive a high dose of therapy focused specifically on the tumor site, known as a \"boost.\" Given the benefits, other facilities are expected to follow suit. Felix Sedlmayer, MD, one of the world's leading IOERT researchers and the principal investigator of IOERT boost trials conducted by six European medical centers over the past decade, concluded that IOERT cut breast cancer five year recurrence rates dramatically, from an average of 5% to less than 1%. I would also like to know where the other machines are located.  I have often thought something like this would have been invaluable when I had my two breast cancers  (one in each  breast) and perhaps I would have not  had to choose an elective mastectomy in each breast so I could sleep well at night.",

I also had Dr. say not everyone has side effects and I LISTENED LIKE A FOOL. On 2/04 I found I had a right breast cancer and it had gone into my lymph node as I was totally resistant to the arimidex (a high percentage of women do not respond AT ALL IN ANY WAY TO ARIMIDEX AND THEY DO NOT TELL YOU THIS, THEY SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR YOU TO GET CANCER AGAIN). Since they sat back and let me get cancer the second time, on my own I sought out, found, paid for DNA p-450 cytochrome enzyme assay from the company Genelex ($800.) had 1A2, 2D6, 2C9,2C19 and found out I was hyperinductive to 1A2 which metabolizes Arimidex and in my case this said the Arimidex went thru my body so fast it did not stay around long enough to do me any good, and then this explain why the Arimidex failed me. How I wish I had been told this info at the beginning when I started Arimidex and I could have avoided the second cancer and the lymph node cancer - I am sick about it - There is another company now I find out that does even more studies - Genaissance in Morrisville NC and they also do 3A4 which is the enzyme which exclusively metabolizes exemestane (AROMASIN). My insurance did not pay, but it was worth every penny out of my pocket. The oncologist I see have nothing to do with DNA or gene or enzyme assays, so all this I had to do on my own - they told me I was ahead of my time - I feel they are behind the time because these tools are available now and patients should be afforded these cancer tests. Your note rang so many cords of my story, I had to respond - the main thing was your Dr. saying not all patients have side effects - I was told that and then I really got worse cancer - in the lymph node. Do not be passive and sit back and wait for more cancer. Help yourself and think for yourself. How I regret listening to the Dr. Your common sense is telling you something. Get tested for 1A2 and 3A4 at least now; if your dr. will not help you (mine would not - did not offer at all acted very threatened said there was no test available to help me) if your dr. will not help - help yourself - call Genaissance, get your primary care physician involved to draw the blood, then get rid of your oncologist - they are too narrow and ignorant. Sorry to be the one to tell you this - from one who has walked the walk...too late.",

I think it is unethical that these anticancer medications do not work for everyone and they know that, but there is no TEST they can give to see whether the anticancer medication is working or not.

At first I was always aware/self-conscious about it but eventually just got used to it and often forget about it completely, which is freeing!  I love not dealing with bras, and I wear any shirt/top that I feel good in.  I started off always wearing baggy shirts, but now will wear tanks, summer shirts, bathing suits, anything!    I wish you all the best! You are a strong woman!  Take care. Pinkribbonmar.This subject is so timely as I am pondering my second  elective mastectomy and trying to decide with or without restoration as I am getting as hassle from plastic surgeons as I had  radiation in the past in this breast I now want a mastectomy.  How do you \"flat\" ladies feel your  interrelationships with men are and are any of you single?  If any of you are married, is this awkward?  I hate to be personal but I would really like to know as I know no one personally to ask this question.  I apologize asking it here.   This is a huge step to take.   I have been wearing a form for the other breast, but with two breast either gone or trying a little harder to have the second one done with a restoration of some sort (I cannot have a implant).  I went to try to have the mastectomy side/axillary dissection side/radiation side have a restoration and PS refused as I had had  radiation.   I do not know what they will say about the other side that has a breast remaining but had had BC in past but only had lumpectomy and radiation---if that radiation will still rule me out from having a restoration still again.   DOES ANYONE KNOW??   I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW????  ",

My questions for the surgery revolve around: on my left side I had lumpectomy and radiation 3 years ago; however 2 years ago I had right mastectomy and complete axillary dissection (26 nodes - although only one node positive). the node was nonproliferating, noninvasive, the ca was 2.5 cm with all margins clear. I then had radiation. Having had radiation on both sides and an axillary dissection on one side, are patients ever accepted as being eligible for DIEP. I am sure if it was recommended to first get hyperbaric chamber I could get this. What is the likelihood the DIEP would be successful?",

Again reading between lines you did have help i.e. someone with you and you did not have to \"hoof\" it alone, there is a big difference. Also, I would think there would be a big difference between how many and how long drains would be in a woman with and without axil dissection, because a women with a prior axil dissection and to undergo any surgery on that side could be quite problematic. They tell me to not even have my blood pressure taken on that side or even blood. I have to assume there would be more drains and more time in hospital due to no lymph drainage/axillary dissection. Next set of questions: what info did you take up there for your initial/screening visit? copies of all mamos, ct's, mri's, surgical notes, path notes on all slides taken during surgery, or even the slides and/or blocks of tissue themselves. Of courese you came from CA and you may have had one straight shot, I will certainly have two and want two as I want to come back and ponder choices and make arrangements if I am eligible. You may have assumed you were eligible, I do not. I am also overweight and this would be the best incentive in the world for me to be accepted under the condition I lose xxx lbs before the surgery, which would be quite realistic. I am 48 lbs overweight and am uninspired to do anything about it as it is so awkward to be so asymmetrical, I have to do something to be the same on both sides. A bra rides up on one side no matter what and hurts because there is nothing to hold it from riding up -- even with mas form. However, I am alive despite all the odds and I feel vain to even consider this surgery. I do not want to put vainness in front of common sense. Thank you so many billions for info, you and I are at much different places but then share some fragments of sameness. Thanks again.",

You say you had rad to one breast and you had 3 areas of necrosis when you later had the DIEP, so what you are saying is that rad does have influence on DIEP. I have had rad on both breasts at one time or another, one has not had a mastectomy but the other has. Altho when I read between the lines you said you had aggressive ca and poor margins, so I expect they zapped the rad to you. I had clear margin on the right but I requested the mastectomy and also the axillary dissection as no one was psychic and could tell me how many lymph nodes were involved without taking them out (all 26), only one was positive and they said it was beautiful pink healthy looking and if they had to bet they would have bet it was not ca. Altho, as I said I requested a mastectomy and when they did it they found a \"trick or treat\" cancer they were not aware of at an entirely differnet place that had not shown in mamo or the CT or MRI from the week before, small, and DCIS. I do not know, but I suspect they zapped me with the rad as I know they were rad up to my clavicle etc. My \"trick or treat\" gave them a pause for concern and it is for this reason I want to electively have a left mastectomy before it is too late. I can't help but wonder tho realistically if a woman has had 4 cancers at one place or another in both her breasts if it is not too late. I am told I have not had metastatic. Could you have managed alone the bilateral DIEP surgery, left the hospital and traveled 400 miles back home alone on a plane or train? I don't want to pass out in some airport.",

They told me they could take care of that one positive node with chemo and rad, but I wanted axill dissect and mas - it was time. When they did the elective mast 3 weeks later they found another cancer at another place in that breast they were not aware of and MRI nor CT scan had not revealed and I had just had the MRI and CT 1 1/2 weeks prior to the surgery.

Aromasin is different than the other 2 aromatase inhibitors and it is also steroidal and supposedly does not affect bones like other 2 (so they say ???). There is a clinical trial soon to be over called CAT and they are giving Toremifene (sister of tamoxifine) and Atamestane (second generation Aromasin-this one is experimental now not on market), the toremifene is on market)- they are giving both at the same time to get the estrogen from both sides and consider if MORE effective in preventing cancer - This is the DOUBLE HORMONE TRIAL - I think the drugs are quite efficient - HOLD ON ----HELP may be on the way. People who have side effects need to get on their knees and thank GOD, the medicine is working.. 42% of women it is totally ineffective and they move on and get more cancer. Think of your choices.

On 2/2004 they saw another small lump right breast but said since I had been on arimidex for 2 years it must be \"the other kind of cancer but do not worry\", I had lumpectomy - they did not check the one sentinel node during surgery as it looked \"so pink and healthy\" sent me home. Four days later called me said I had positive sentinel node, do not worry they could take care of it with chemo and radiation. The \"lump\" was 100% estrogen + progesterone positive ---not the other kind. you figure it out - the arimidex was worthless I took for 2 years. I demanded total body CT and MRI because if there was more cancer I wanted to know as I also demanded in 2 weeks to return and have axillary dissection and a complete mastectomy. They said CT and MRI (with dye both of them) were negataive - mind you both 1 1/2 weeks before my second surgery. They did not want to do this second surgery but something told me things were not right. I did have my axillary dissection and when they did my mastectomy at the same time (this was 2 weeks after the CT and MRI which was suppose to be negative) they found more cancer at a totally different place unrelated to the original lump I went in for. I know, and I am also told, some women's normal tissue is such that it does not differentiate between normal and early cancer and so for this reason I am going to elect to backtrack and have my left breast removed because if a CT scan and MRI fail to show cancer and arimidex does not deter me getting cancer - I think I am in deep water. I have now completed chemo and radiation (very horrible experience) and they just put me on Aromasin but I question if it is working as I have absolutely no feelings of any effects from it --the same as the Arimidex --I felt absolutely nothing - no hot flashes, no hunger, total no sensation 24/7. I am very concerned I am resistent to the Aromasin also and want to be P450 cytochrome pharmacogenetic enzyme tested but cannot find a place to test me to Aromasin. I paid to have myself tested for the Arimidex and found out I was hyperinductive to 1A2 pathway and the enzyme was passing thru me so fast metabolically that the arimidex did not hang around long enough to do any good. Now I understand about the Arimidex. The Aromasin is a totally different enzyme pathway 3A4, but I have been unable to find even a research/experimental university affiliated place I can go to for a consult for my genetic makeup for handling of the 3A4. Can anyone out there help me??????",

I did not look this way before. Are you wearing anything constrictive, rubbing, or doing some sort of exercise or daily household chore that is using pulling muscle  of the chest that might be aggravating this? Could you have not gotten rid of it all (infection) to begin with? Have you had microbiology tests of the fluid to see what is growing? I really got a lot of run around and pass around and this kind of problem is a mess, and no one really knows what to do, I went from stem to stern and very very sick and really begging for help with a chest tube hanging out of me. I truly sat for 6 months too weak to move until the tube was taken out (really fell out when it got to 3 cc). You need to be using very safe antiseptic techniques at home, and wash your hands  often and scrub your fingernails; germs are coming  from somewhere.  What ages are your children.  Mine were gone. Think about irritants, or motions  conducive to irritation. Something in your environment, or on your couch,?animal. Don't wear tight bras, i just did not wear one; too much hassle.  Cellulitis is very serious.  Back step what you have been doing. Good luck.  ",
