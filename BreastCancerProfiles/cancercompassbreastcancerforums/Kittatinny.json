      "Content": "Greetings, I was diagnosed with M.S. 25 years ago. I retired from teaching 10 years ago and am on disability. In November 2004 I discovered I had a large (4cm) tumor in my breast. I had both breasts removed, a tummy tuck (for reconstruction) and chemo. I had conflicting advice on radiation, and I chose not to take it. The same with tamoxifen and other estrogen blocking drugs. It's a year ago I finished chemo and I am still quite tired. I hope to recover more of my former self. Any suggestions/advice? I am big on CAM and do not take any drugs (today I am 54 years old !!) My inclination is towards such people as Dr. Royal Raymond Rife and Hilda Clarke. Thanks, Marguerite",

      "Content": "Hello, Obviosly I am not a DR. and so I will only pass on what I have read dealing with my own health problems.. Have you heard of Hilda Clarke?? Many people feel she is wacky - but I believe she has much to offer. Her book \"how to cure all cancers\" is available on the web. Her basic premise is that all people who have cancer have both parasites and solvents (chemical toxins) within their body. That may sound far fetched and simplistic but many people feel she is on to something. I am working hard at eliminating these from my system. The best. Marguerite",
