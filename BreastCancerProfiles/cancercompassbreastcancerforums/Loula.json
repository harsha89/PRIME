    "Content": "Hi Rlinda, Just read your message about your DCIS.  I hope and pray for you that it is only stage 1and that it has not left the ducts.  It is so scary being told that you have cancer but you must decide to fight it and not let it get the better of you.  I know it is difficult to stay positive when faced with such a dreadful condition, however, it can be overcome - especially in its early stages!   If you are feeling very weak you need to have blood tests to determine any defficiencies and act accordingly.  Your treating doctor should already be on top of this provided you have told him of your weakness.  It is very important to eat lots of raw vegetables and take supplements to boost your immune system so that your body has the strength to fight the cancer and to help you recover from any treatment that you decide to have.  I'm sorry to say that I cannot advise you on what to do as far as what treatment to have.  Only you can make that decision for yourself.  What I can say to you is you can tegrate (combine) natural medicine with orthodox medicine quite well.  You might want to see a Naturopath and seek some help and guidence there?  When I was diagnosed 1 year ago it had already spread beyond the milk ducts to the lymph nodes and the right lung.  I have been doing only alternative medicine because I did not believe that I would cope well with conventional medicine since I don't handle pain very well.  When I was diagnosed my cancer marker (CA 15.3) was 59.  I managed to reduce it down to 35 (30 being normal) using alternative treatments only.  Until about 3 months ago I was managing it quite well but after some manipulation of the left armpit to aleviate pain, it seemed to get out of control and my cancer marker has been gradually rising.  I had a blood test done last Friday and I am anxiously awaiting the results.  Once again I wish you well.  Please let us know how you go with the rest of your tests.  Loula",
