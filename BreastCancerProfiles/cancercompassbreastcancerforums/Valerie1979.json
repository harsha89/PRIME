    "Content": "Hi everyone. I am really nervous right now, can anyone please help me? Thanks. I am a 27 years old female. I just finished my period today and I found a lump yesterday in my right breast (about 2 inches from my armpit towards the center of my body). It feels tender when I press on it and the tenderness last for a few minutes. I asked my father, who is a pediatrician, to examine it for me and he said it's moving and it's doesn't feel like cancer. However, this evening when I re-examined it, I found that the area between the lump and my armpit is slightly hardened and thicker than the the same area in my left breast. It's also a bit tender when I press it. I just don't know what that is...Could anyone please help me? Thanks again.",
