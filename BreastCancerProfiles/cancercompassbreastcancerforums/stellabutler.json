      "Content": "Hi Saraevens. I have been on Arimidex the same amount of time you have, and I too am feeling more of the side effects. The new side effects for me are the dry caugh, headaches, dizziness and most of all I feel more tired. I have always had the joint pain especially in my feet, but it seems worse at times. I am walking a mile a day and started taking an Aqua swim class which both of these have helped me. It hasn't effected my sleep and I hope it doesn't. The tiredness bothers me, but I push myself. I believe the side effects are cumulative. Make sure you keep up your bone density screenings. I feel thankful that things are not worse ????????. God Bless you! Stella",

      "Content": "Thank you Marep for the words of encouragement. I have been taking Arimidex for almost 2 years and have experienced headaches, bone and muscle pain along with feet stiffness. I have been walking a mile a day for over a year, which has helped so much with the bone, muscle and stiffness. Taking my vitamin D and Calcium daily hoping I can salvage some bone loss. My last bone density came back very good, but that has been over a year now. I sleep very well (praise God), but feel very tired in the evenings. I feel very blessed to have been one of the lucky ones to catch my BC at an early stage. Chemo was no fun, but I am alive and doing great! My mother also had BC but didn't have to have chemo or radiation. The difference in our cancers was that I was HER2 positive, and she was negative. I am grateful to be alive to talk about the experience, and appreciate hearing your experience with the Arimidex. Thanks for being so positive! Stella Butler",
