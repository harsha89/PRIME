You have the right to a complete explanation of the situation as well as the risk.  Your doctor should do that or you should get a better doctor. Good luck. Roseann",

I had a lumpectomy for stage 1 node negative breast cancer in my right breast.  I suggest you ask your surgeon about the OncoTypeDX test to determine whether you would benefit from chemo.  They send out a sample of your lump to a lab in Calif.  There is only one in the world that does this type of test at this time.  They will rate the sample as low, intermediate, and high for probability of reoccurrance in 10 years.  If it comes out Low, they will not recommend chemo.  I was on the low end of intermediate so they left it up to me and I decided to do only radiation.  I am 59 years old and the chemo only improved my chances by 3%.  Without chemo my probability of reoccurrance in 10 years is 15%.  The cost is 3,000 but my insurance paid for it.  They will check with your insurance company for you and have steep discounts for those who don't have coverage.  I think it is well worth it.  I had my first radiation treatment today.  I will have 6 weeks, 5 days a week.  I wish you good luck with your journey.

The meds are miracles themselves but meditating has been a real help to me.  When my cancer was first diagnosed, it measured 2.5 cm.  I did visualizations 3 x a day and in 10 days it shrunk to 1.8 cm.  The surgeon did her magic by removing it and so far so good.  Just wanted to let you know I care about what you are dealing with and to encourage you to hang in there.  A month before I was diagnosed with cancer (Feb 09), I met a woman who works for a pharmacutical company in reasearch and training for cancer treatments.  She said that they are working on something that will improve the survival rate for cancer.  She said it is an unbelievable advancement and it is around the corner.  Hurry up already! Your strength is inspiring.

      "Content": "Yes.  It is called the Onco Type DX Test.  The cost is $3,000 but insurance often covers it.  The company checks with your insurance company and will discuss it with you before they do the test.  If a family earns less than $70,000 a year, they give a big discount if insurance doesn't cover it. It is used for early stage breast cancer which is node negative. They send a sample of your tumor to a lab in California.  They use the sample to check the how receptive it is to estrogen, progesterone, and Her2.  They rate the chances of cancer returning in 10 years.  The rating is either low, intermediate, or high.  They specify that even a high rating does not mean it will definately return.  They also say that if it returns it does not necessarily change the prognosis.  Those who have a low rating will not benefit significantly from chemo and it is not generally used on them.  Those like myself who are intermediate have a decision to make because there isn't a clear cut decision.  In my case, the likelyhood or my cancer returning in 10 years is 15%.  Chemo would reduce that by 3%.  I decided not to have the chemo.  I am 58 years old and at my age I was concerned that I would have more trouble than a younger woman would at recovering from chemo with not much return.  I have made lifestyle changes which I hope will impove my results as much as chemo but who knows. I strongly recommend this test if you are early Stage 1 or 2 and are node negative.  My surgeon ordered it for me so I recommend you start there. Good luck. Roseann",

I have made some lifestyle changes as my cancer is estrogen positive.  I only eat organic foods and meats, eat lots of fish and have scheduled daily exercise.  I always enjoyed my red wine and have cut that out because I read that that can increase estrogent.  I am 58 years old so my own production of estrogen should be low.  By the way, I have been attending Bernie Siegel's ECaP meetings in Woodbridge, CT and recommend them to anyone with cancer.  He wrote several books (Love, Medicine & Miracles for one) so check him out.  He has meetings in several states.  If you go on the web, you can find what's available in your area.  He also has a retreat in Pa.  I would love to hear from anyone who had an intermediate score on their Oncotype dx test and what they decided to do for treatment. Thanks and God bless!",

Once my biopsy results came back positive, they ordered a cat scan, a bone scan, and a mri to be sure the cancer is isolated to my right breast.  The news was good so I could opt for a lumpectomy rather than a mastectomy.  When I had the lumpectomy, they removed my sentinal lymph node which is located in my underarm to check for cancer cells.  It came back negative.  They sent a sample of my tumor to Calif. for an OncoType DX test.  This test is for early stage and node negative breast cancer and will give your doctors information about whether you would benefit from chemo.  Years ago everyone got chemo but not so today.  Demand the information you need from your doctors.  If you are not comfortable with them, get different doctors.  Your peace of mind depends on being informed and confident in the care you are receiving.  Get the book, \"Just Get Me Through This\" which discusses what to expect with early stage breast cancer.

I am 58 years old and my female relatives are already at higher risk.  The doc said they would be able to get more testing 10 years prior to my diagnosis.  That would put them at 48 and they are able to get the testing done routinely at 40.

I don't know if they all work that way.  Ask your doc for a packet of information on genetic testing.  It comes with a CD with women talking about why they opted for the test.  That may help with your decision.
