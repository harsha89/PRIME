    "Content": "I was diagnosed with BC July 28,2003 at exactly 1:30 p.m. Had a mastectomy/reconstruction (left)on September 16, 2003 and started chemotherapy in November 2003. Had six rounds of CMF then was put on Femara. Had a \"routine\" PET scan in October 2004 which was clear. Had another \"routine\" PET/CT scan two weeks ago which showed \"extensive metastatic disease to the liver\" as well as three other places ... I started chemo, again, last Wednesday of Taxotere and Carboplatin as well as Herceptin injections. I go three weeks in a row for the chemotherapy and Herceptin; the fourth week, blood draws and Herceptin - then, lucky me, I get to do it all over again. I told my husband when I was first diagnosed that if I ever recurred, I'd want nothing done yet here I am, having more done. My questions are: Has anyone done EVERYTHING they were supposed to do after diagnosis, surgery and treatment and STILL gotten mets to other parts in the body? How do you cope with this news?
