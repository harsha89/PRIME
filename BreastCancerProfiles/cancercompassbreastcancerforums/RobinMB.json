    "Content": "Unbelievable.  I kept noticing a \"foul\" odor in my husband prior to his GBM diagnosis.  It smelled like rotting flesh.  I wish I would have acted on it.  But, he has recurrent GBM several times and I have not been able to smell it.  That seems strange to me.  I believe animals can smell cancer too.  Dogs seem to gravitate toward my husband when we are visiting people who have dogs.  They seem to want to just sit next to my husband and not next to anyone else in the room. I used to think I was crazy.  I'm glad this information has been brought to everyone's attention. Robin from NY",
