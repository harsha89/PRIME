    "Content": "Hi, Yes, I have a lot of nerve damage from the taxol. I was sent to a neurologist because I woke up one day two weeks after I ended the taxol and I couldn't stand the water from the shower touching my feet, or the cold floor, or i could't stand the touch of socks as I put them on or pants either. My hands can't stand to touch metal (try holding cutlery or pots and pans for cooking). The neuro said it was neuropathy that would either go away in about a year or it might not ever go away. I take 600mg of Neurontin 3X a day that helps take the edge off (Ican take a shower and get dressed without jumping out of my skin). I also have these Lipoderm (Lidocaine)patches that I put on my feet at night because the touch of the covers bother my feet. I put two pillows under the sheets at the end of the bed so the covers are raised up and don't touch my feet. For my hands I have foam things that I can put a fork or spoon end into and hold the foam instead of the fork. I bothers me to even touch the computer keys so I try to tap it out with my nails instead of my fingertips. You should ask to go see a neurologist to be tested for neuropathy. Taxol is nasty but strong andÂ effective against cancer. I still have neuropathy after eight months. I hope yours clear up sooner than that. Good Luck. Frenchy50",
