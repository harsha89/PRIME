      "Content": "Hi cancerkeys, yes you are right. Maybe treatment would be a better word, but as to me the meaning would be similar - going back to relatively healthy state. My wife has stage II breast cancer T1cN1M0. I think she is ER/PR-positive (although not 100% sure). As to the doctors, she must start a hormone therapy after the radiation ends. What do you mean by \"50 billion count probiotic\"? Is it something to restore the bacteria in intestines or just a phrase? As far as the food is concerned, it is a little bit better in Europe, but Exxx are everywhere. When I was a kid, cancer was a quite rate disease. I remember only one aunt, who got a colon cancer. Now it is at epidemic scale. My mother, father and almost all relatives, who passed away in the last 20 years, died of cancer. Luckily, the parents of my wife are farmers and produce enough natural food (fruits, vegetables, yogurt, cheese and meat). For now she doesn't eat sugar (but still juices fruits, red beet, carrots and adds honey), also no meet and milk. But, does diary free mean also no yogurt and cheese?",

      "Content": "Hi there, our family lives in Europe. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2014. She was then operated in September. After a while went to chemo, and then to radiation therapy. The radiation ends this month. In the meanwhile (as probably anyone here) I started researching the alternative cures. The information was so huge, scattered and contradictive that I decided to collect and summarize as many experiences as I can, and then make the results freely available online. It is a work in progress and the data volume is obviously beyond my processing skills, but here are the results so far, if someone is interested: http://ratemt.com Just wanted to share. And no, I don't sell anything. Greetings, R.",
