Months ago, during my 4 rounds of (yucky chemo), and the herceptin, I told the nurse that I was experiencing joint pain, especially in my knees and in my fingers and knuckles, but, no one really responded to that complaint, and at the moment, I am on medical leave, don't know how my body will react, if and when I go back to work. The other day, both my feet had swallon up, this happens from time to time, so I sit and keep them elevated until the swelling goes down. Again, thank you, and I hope and pray that you will survive this cancer, we need to bet it!!!! and not let it stop us.  :)",

I have been telling my ocon. this for sometime now, but, he never said one way or the other if it was normal or not, so, the past couple of months, I just gave up telling him, thinking it must have something to do with the drugs that I am taking, including the Herceptin. I still have about 8 or 9 more treatments to go with the herceptin, however, my ocon. did tell me that he may keep me on it alittle longer, we'd have to wait and see as time goes by. Happy to hear that you have had your final treatment, I hope and pray that you will be a cancer survivor 30 yrs. from now.  :)",

I think I may have slipped thru the cracks, cuz, I have told the nurse assistant a few months ago, and also my nurse, but, they never told me if this was normal, so that is why I am so glad that people here at Cancer Compass have been so kind to answer my questions. I feel like I walk like an 80 yr. old woman with arthritis, lol... Thank You",

We don't know how far along she is, but two things are for sure: 1) she will need surgery to remove the cancer (obviously) and 2) she will need chemo afterward because of the large size of the lump. She is quite upset about the prospect of losing her hair. She says she just grew it out long enough to \"play with\" and now she's going to lose it all. I know the chemo is at least 2 months away (possibly more, depending on how long the wait for surgery will be), but I'm already thinking of ways to support her. I figured that we could lose our hair together. When she shaves her head (which she will probably do or else her hair will come out in clumps from what I've read), I want to do that with her. What does everyone think of this? Do you think this is a good way to show my support for her and to convince her that she'll be beautiful in my eyes whether she has hair or not? I think it is wonderful of you to love and support your mother that way. My daughter offered to do the same for me, but, as for myself, I didn't want her to do that, I know that I had the love and support of my family already.  And, actually, the 2 months that I had before I had to have my chemo, gave me time to kinda get used to the idea of losing my hair.  When my hair did start to come out, honestly, it was a pain, it would just get on everything, and I went to my hair dresser to get it almost all of it taken off, she had tears in her eyes for me, but, as I said earlier, I had the time to get used to the idea, and now it was just driving me crazy, so that made it somewhat easier. I did go to the American Cancer Society, before my chemo treatments began, and they will give her a wig, they have all kinds to choose from (at least they did where I live at), and that helped me too, there is also a website that you can go to, and you can choose a silk head wrap for your mother, I did get alot of compliments on it, you need to go to: Goodwishesscarves.org . I wish your mother the very best, and she is so lucky to have a daughter like you, and I am sure with you by her side, she will be able to handle this situation well. There are 3 things I tell people that helps me with my cancer,  1) keep Jesus close to your heart,  2) having family and friends support, and 3) mind over matter (she needs to tell her brain and body to fight, and throw this cancer out of her body). Again, I pray all will be good, and I also kept reminding myself, hair loss is a small price to pay, it will grow back. And there were times when I would put my wig on, and I was ready to go, and there was my daughters playing with their hair after washing it, trying to style it.  Theres where I thought, heck, this wig thing is pretty cool... :) Take care    ",

      "Content": "I don't know if this may help or not, but I have breast cancer, and I am trying so hard to \"think\" my husband stilll loves me, it's a problem that I think us women either can or cannot deal with. I had to have my right breast removed, and also I had a a huge tumor in my uterus, long story short, I was in surgery for several hours, and my request was to have my other breast removed as well, but the surgeon said at the time, it would've too much on my healing process, so, he said we'd  do that later. But, I just can't help wonder if deep inside, my husband doesn't miss that part of me, he keeps telling me it doesn't matter, he just wants me to be well. But, as a woman, breast cancer does change our way of thinking, and in the back of our minds we do think that we less of a woman to our husbands. And, maybe, I don't know, maybe deep down inside your wife, she may have felt that she was less of a woman to you. I know my husband still loves me after 28 yrs. of marriage, but, it has been very hard on me to be as I was before this breast cancer thing came into our lives   But with the help of our Lord, I pray that maybe you two can sit down and open up to one another, always keep in mind, don't let this cancer thing take your lives away from one another, it is true what they say... \"Cancer doesn't have you, You have cancer\". So, keep that in mind, you and your wife need to have control of this cancer.  I hope this may help somewhat, like I said, I am going thru it too, this is easier said than done, and I have to remind myself of what I just told you too from time to time. Take Care, and Best of Luck to you both.      ",

I originally had a lympectomy and chemo, and started my herceptin, I had 2 treatments when the herceptin damaged my heart infraction rate to a near fatal low. They had to stop treatment. I still had almost a year of herceptin to go. Was this enough? I asked, no one knows, the human body is so unpredictable. My onclogist did a mammo before I started radiation and found the cancer returned in a more aggessive strain(double negative HER 2 positive). Here came the bilateral masectomy, what a way to get out of radiation. You must live and love life to the fullest, don't fear the things you can't control. I have had many set backs from the chemo, but I am proud to be a 7 year survivor and plan on being here at least that many more. thank you for getting back to me, I have been doing good so far, I thought I had this for the most part beat, and who knows, like you said we dont' have control of it.  All I know, is that I discovered that I had a discharge in my nipple back in 2007, in June of 2008, I had my mammogram, (my husband was getting ready to lose his job, due to the economy, and of course lose his insurance)  I had the mammogram, but at that time the doctor didn't see anything.  My next mammogram wasn't until Nov. 2011, and boom, there was my enemy.  But, the doctor did tell me with the type of cancer I have, I should've been dead a couple of yrs. ago, he was amazed, and I was thankful to the Lord.  Everytime I go in for my check up (every 3 wks.) for Herceptin, my blood work is good, now I am just scared every single day, thinking this is going to drop on me all of a sudden again.  But I pray everyday for me, for other people going thru cancer, and thankful for the work of doctors and sceintist trying to find a cure. Take Care, and Thank You again for responding.",

I had and MRI, done, biopisies, and a PET scan all done prior to my surgery, and when they took my breast and 18 lymph nodes, 4 of which showed positive for cancer, is when they staged my cancer, they said part of the staging process is knowing exactly how many lymph nodes have been affected with cancer and of course the size of the tumor. In my case, I was staged at 3, and since have gone thru chemo and 33 rounds of raditation. Hopefully this may help answer your question, I pray that God and his angels watch over your sister and that she will overcome this cancer and win the battle in the end.  Take care.",
