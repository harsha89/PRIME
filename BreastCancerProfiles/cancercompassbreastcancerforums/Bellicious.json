      "Content": "I want to encourage you to go with your feeling on this.  1 week ago I lost my mom to metastatic breast cancer.  She was told by several doctos that she had a non-cancerous hemangioma tumor on her liver.  Over and over again we asked if it was or could be cancer - we were told 'No No No'.  IF she would have had a PET Scan in addition to her Catscan and an MRI - I wouldn't have lost her. She was 8 years since her breast cancer - and not one doctor even took the time to quesiton if it was cancer - to take a step further and verify that what she had was a hemangioma.  I work for a cancer doctor and can assure you - that they give their patients petscan's every year for 5 years - and then depending upon the case, at least once ever 2 years.  Now I know that too many scans can be bad, but when we are talking about cancer, it's no laughing matter. I would give anything to go back and have gone to the doctor's office with my mom so they would have done these other necessary tests.  But does the average person know what tests to ask for?  Not usually - and so happened with my mom. The proceeded to do surgery to remove this 'hemangioma' and when they opened her they found her full of cancer - and proceeded to remove 65% of her liver, her adrenal gland, a tumor the size of a soccer ball, and her gall bladder.  They did this - without so much as telling us what they had found before they proceeded.  18 days later, she passed.",
