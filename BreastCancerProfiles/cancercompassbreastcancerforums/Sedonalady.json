    "Content": "Hello, I am a stage III ovarian cancer survivor of 11 years. After the 2nd surgery I started chemo. I started with Doxil. My MD at home who is into holistic medication recommended Mega Myers, which has a high dose of Vitamin C in it. It is true that Vit C IV is very different than the oral kind. Many of the supplement and vitamins are contraindicated with specific chemos, but you can't say that Vitamin C is interferes with all of them. With Doxil, the Oncologist told me that Vit C but a little \"nick\" in the active part of the Doxil hence making it less effective. Then, when I was put on Cisplatin, I could take Vitamin C. So...every type of chemo is different. I now get the Mega Myers 3 times weekly and am on a oral chemotherapy. I think the other vitamins and minerals in the IV make me feel much better as it has a complete boost of all the B Vitamins, Magnesium, Calcium, Vitamin C. I have read that IV Vitamin C turns into Hydrogen Peroxide when its in the blood and Hydrogen Peroxide kills cancer cells. It has absolutely no negative side effects. People who say that Vitamin C does nothing are usually talking about the studies done to discredit Linus Pauling's work, which was all done with oral Vitamin C, which by the way he got the nobel prize for. Vitamin C IV is really a totally different animal! Kathleen",
