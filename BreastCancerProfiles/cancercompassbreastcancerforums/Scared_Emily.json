I am going to a surgeon in a week so I want to know what to ask and demand if needed. Do they inject the dye for all breasts biopsies? Can they knock you out for that part too??? God Bless all of you for your inspiration and strength",

I felt the area I was experiencing the pain and discovered a LARGE lump. The weekend seemed extremely long, waiting for my Doctors office to open Monday morning. My PCP said the lump is thumb size and ordered a mamo and ultrasound. The Mamo shows a large growth, but the ultrasound...nothing. I am now waiting to see the surgeon. It seems like a long wait as I cannot get in to see him until June 11th, and that appointment is only a consultation. I have no idea how long it will be before I have the biopsy. I am very scared as both my mother and grandmother died from breast cancer. I will keep you in my prayers. I have met with the surgeon and he is going to start with just a core needle biopsy. This is good news for me since I am sooo scared of needles and IV's.  I have it on the 18th of June. I will let you know how it goes. I hope you get an appt. soon. Let me know how you are doing.I",

      "Content": "This is my first time at this site. I am 52 and had something show up on my Mammogram. I was sent for another one and Ultrasound.  The 2nd Mammogram got a better up close picture of it...but nothing showed up on the ultra sound. They said it is in my left breast close to the chest wall and in a place that is hard to get to ? So my doc thinks they will have to do a reg. sugical biopsy instead of a needle. I meet with the surgeon...and am overwhelmed with fear. Why are they just skipping the MRI to look at it again?  My question is...has anyone had this type of spot near the chest and had similar experiences? I have been blessed and NEVER had any type of surgery before. The thought of being in an operating room is scaring me ...and the thought of cancer is beyond what I can even think of yet. I also am hoping that if they do have to do such an invasive procedure...if they can have it tested and do the right type of operation right then and there...and not make me come back for more?! Am I naive? Any advise would be so appreciated. PS...I have severe Fibromyagia too so I expect that to complicate matters too. Thanks    ",
