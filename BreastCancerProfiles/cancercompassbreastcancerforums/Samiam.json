    "Content": "    My Mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She is scheduled to have a mastectomy soon. She is 88 yrs. old with dementia. The dementia at this point only effects her short term memory and is still able to live alone in a retirement community. She does not want to change her living arrangements and wants her independence. Other than this, she is very healthy.  She doesn't take any medicine.  If she did have to take meds, we would have a problem because of her memory. She does not want any further treatment after the mastectomy such as chemo or radiation. I completely agree with her and support her decision. I feel the quality of her life is equally important as the quantity of years she has left. I firmly believe, in the not so distant future, the dementia will be a bigger issue than the cancer returning. If anybody has had any experience with a similar situation, I would love to hear from you.  It seems the only info. I get on line is promoting chemo and radiation.  ",
