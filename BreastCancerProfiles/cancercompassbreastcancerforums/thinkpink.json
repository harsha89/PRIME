Girl, your message could have been written by me!  I finished my radiation in early June '08 after having done chemo and surgery.  I was anxiously awaiting the regrowth of my hair. It has always been SO thick and grown so fast tht I just knew it would come in fast! Cancer is full of surprises and my hair has been another one!  It is so thin on top that you can see my scalp, and just like you, about an inch long in the back.  I recently attended a program through our local cancer center support group and the chemo nurses said that Femara makes your hair thin, so I am thinking that might be why mine is coming in slowly. Are you taking Femara by chance? If so that might be part of the problem. I have been using root stimulator and Nioxin shampoo back since I started chemo last October, but I am not sure it has made a difference. For me, I miss my eyebrows and lashes as much as my hair!  Good luck to you.  ",
