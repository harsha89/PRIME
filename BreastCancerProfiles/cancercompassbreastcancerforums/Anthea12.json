      "Content": "I wonder if anybody has found any benefit in taking LDN?  I also have Hashimoto's and have been on LDN now working up from 1mg to 2mg within one month.  Since it involves Hashimoto's I was advised to start very slowly.  Although it has only been one month I feel that emotionally I experience more highs and lowsk than previously which impacts on the stress that I am aiming to reduce.  Unfortunately I am particularly prone to even small amounts of stress.  I have had breast cancer now for just over 5 years and have had no conventional treatment opting instead for a more natural approach.  It would be very interesting to read of others experiences.  Many thanks.",

      "Content": "I wonder if the LDN (low dose naltrexone) website would throw up any information; maybe worth a try as is anything aside from conventional therapy which as you've found can be so terribly hard to take.  You wouldnt mind if there was a guarantee at the end of it all that it would be the cure you want.  Look at reputable Cannabis oil websites, Salvestrols (Platinum 2000) as well as making absolutely sure that your diet is free of sugar, high GI carbs (go for Quinoa as replacement, you can get flour and grain); do lots of fresh vegetable juices and filtered water (loads to flush toxins away), have magnesium sulphate detox baths.  See Gerson therapy and related detox websites; meditate, do yoga to destress, avoid loud and ignorant people and be kind to yourself; your'e the important one now.  Sending you loving vibes and hope things are better for you in 2016.",

      "Content": "One in five cases of breast cancer are known as triple-negative, and are the most lethal form\u2014but a compound found in herbs such as thyme and parsley, and celery and broccoli, stops them spreading, scientists have discovered this week. The compound, luteolin, does what chemotherapy can\u2019t, and can locate the triple-negative cancer cells and stops them metastasizing, or spreading, say researchers from the University of Missouri. Triple-negative breast cancer cells are so called because they lack three receptors that chemotherapy drugs usually locate and latch onto, and so oncologists have to use very aggressive and toxic therapies to try to combat their spread. The researchers have found that luteolin does the job instead. In one experiment, they found that the compound stopped the triple-negative cells spreading to the lungs, and, in a second study, they blocked their spread throughout the body. The compound also kills the cancer cells. The tests have so far been restricted to animal studies, but the researchers are hopeful they\u2019ll get the go-ahead to start tests on cancer patients within the next couple of years. With around a hundred women in the US alone dying every day from breast cancer, they\u2019re hoping the regulators will move quickly. I'm not going to wait for another 2 years to find out whether these foods work.  I'm going for them now.  It wont be too difficult to include them in ones diet along with staying strictly off sugar.",
