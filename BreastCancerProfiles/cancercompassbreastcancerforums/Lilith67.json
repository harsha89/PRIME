      "Content": "I havent gotten to the doctor yet but will be going soon. I have found a non profit hospital that will take me without insurance or guarantee of payment. The lump however has changed and so now I am really worried. I will be getting to the doctor and having tests as soon as possible. Thanks to all of you again for your support and advice through this the most difficult time of my life. Although I am aware that it can get much worse......I believe that my will to survive is stronger than anything life can throw at me.",

I am going on Wed. to get done whatever they think needs to be done. My bf is taking me to the doctors that he went to during his battle with cancer. With the history of cancer in my family freaking out is a  normal reaction for me. I have prayed and cried about it. And the fact that it is already increasing in size just scares me even more. However a friend of mine had a mamaogram and ultrasound which both showed nothing. It was only after she had a biopsy done that she found out it was cancer. So I will do whatever is needed to get the answers I need. Thanx so much for your concern and your advice.",

      "Content": "Hi my name is Angel and I am 40 years old. 6 days ago I found a lump on my left breast. It is about the size of a penny I guess. Larger than a dime but smaller than a nickle. It is not exactly round but kind of oval shaped. It isn't sore and does not move. I have a history of cancer in my family.....(everyone I can remember dying when I was young...was from cancer). I am really nervous and scared. My boyfriend just finished chemo about a year ago after having testicualar cancer. So he is freaking out. I just moved out here to California in April to be with him.....so I have no doctor and dont know what to do. He is extremely anxious about getting me to a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. This however only makes me more nervous. Having a grandfather die of lung cancer, an aunt die from ovarian cancer, a cousin who had both her breasts removed and the list goes on. Does this make me more at risk for cancer? Could use some help here......just dont know what to do!!!!!",
