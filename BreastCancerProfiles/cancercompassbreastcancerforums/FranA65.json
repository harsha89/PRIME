I see the breast doctor next week but until then I am really concerned. I can't help but wonder what is going on.",

I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!! Hello all, I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 58, in June 2010. Left breast lumpectomy, sentinel lymph node positive, all lymph nodes removed from left.  I was on Arimidex for close to 4 years.  5% recurrence rate, I was in that 5%. In June of 2009 I was diagnosed again with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. My oncologist changed my medicine to Aromasin and I thought I'd share my side effects.  I'm 60 now and feel as though I've aged 10 yrs.  The bone and joint pain is almost everyday, in my wrists, knees, ankles and feet.  I just had a cortisone shot for trigger finger.  I want to get off this medicine, but my oncologist thinks it's best for me. I tire easily and I feel more depressed than before.  I'm not sure whether to switch or not.  Any suggestions?  Thank you.I was on aromasin for 4 months and developed trigger thumb in both hands and one middle finger is trying to do like the thumbs. My oncologist took me off the aromasin and put me on arimidex. I have not completed my first month of arimidex yet but my thumbs are not improving. I wonder if they will in time. I have a lot of swelling in my hands in the mornings.",

With them I had joint pain, a trigger thumb, heal spurs and heel pain. I felt like a much older person overnight. When I went off all cancer drugs for about 6 months after taking them for about 6 months, my energy increased and I had no discomforts. My oncologist suggested I try Tamoxifen which I've been on for 4 months. My body feels older and I have less energy but I haven't had any other discomforts.Did your trigger thumb get better and go away, if so how long did it take?",

My radiation oncologist recommended physical therapy with a therapist that specialized in hands. I did that for 3 months and the triggering stopped. Since discontinuing the aromasin my oncologist put me on arimidex. I have two more years to go on it. ",

      "Content": "I was on Aromasin from May 2013 until September 2013. While on Aromasin after about two months I developed trigger thumb in both thumbs. The oncologist changed my medication to Arimides in September 2013. In November I began physical therapy with a specialized hand therapist and for nearly a month now I have been able to bend my thumbs normally with no triggering. I still have swelling in my hands in the morning but fortunately that goes away once I am up and moving around. I periodically put my hands in hot wax and then wrap them in plastic until it cools. I do have more aches and pains all over than I had before I began the aromatase inhibitors but right now I can tolerate them. I told the PA at the oncologist's office that I feel ten years older than I am. I have noticed that my blood sugars are running higher so I am really trying to get that down but I am having a much harder time doing that than I normally do.",

My hands, feet, joints were so painful, I have seen 90 year old women were more sprightly than I was on the drug. The Docs know the compliance rate is about 50%, I stopped them.  My quality of life crashed. Stage 4 at diagnosis, HER2,E+,P+, yes mammos every year. In the mornings my hands are so swollen I can hardly bend them. After I move around they are better. My hips hurt some if I sit too long in one position. My oncologist does not want me taking ibuprofen or aspirin. He only wants me to use Tylenol which I don't do cause it won't help the inflammation. Right now I am getting mammograms regular, the right breast every six months and both breast once a year. I too was E+ an P+. Best wishes on your journey.",

Oncotype testing came back with a low score of 4. Next course is radiation and I've been presented with the choice of brachytherapy or 4 weeks of EBRT. I am small breasted so the surgeon and radiation oncologist were determining if small device would fit in tumor cavity which is small. Radiation oncologist said recurrence rates similar for someone with my type of cancer and age, 53. Has anyone out there had experience with either? The brachytherapy does appear to be more invasive- risk of infection but not sure other than convenience ( 1 week vs 4) effects.I had brachytherapy two years ago this coming April. It is uncomfortable but I was glad I did not have to have radiation for 5-6 weeks. I went twice a day for five days for the radiation. Best wishes to you and your journey.",
