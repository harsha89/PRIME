It's not fun but it's better to be sure all the cancer is gone.  My surgeries were in 2004 and I'm a 5 year survivor now.  Good luck to you! Thanks so much, that's what I was afraid of, that the surgeon didn't get all the cancer.. I wonder, for the re-excision did your surgeon use the same incision as in the original surgery? It's encouraging that you are a five-year survivor. Good for you.  ",
