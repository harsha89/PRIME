    "Content": "Barb, Sorry to hear about your condition. I don't know much about Lymphoma--I am here becasue of my Dad's cancer (Esophageal). Anyways, I wanted to post a reply to you about your question based on my personal experience with doctor visits. I have a pet peeve regarding taking my kids to the doctor. It seems like every time I take them in for little things, a few days later they come down with the flu. Or a cold. Or strep throat.Â  I am sure everyone has experienced sitting in the doctors waiting room next to someone hacking and coughing their germs all over the room. Anyways, with this in mind, if it was me--I would bring this up with your cancer team. They probably need to know anyways, and from what little I know about starting chemo therapy, you are supposed to protect yourself from viral infections and such. Anyways, good luck to you!",
