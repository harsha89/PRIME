      "Content": "Yes i noticed it. I thought it was just a problam i was having. It drove me crazy. i started changing clothes constantly and taking like 4+ showers/baths a day. Its not just the cancer that has a smell cause mine was enhanced once I started the Chemo and radiaton treatments. Now that imn doing my own thing its so much better. it hasnt gone away completely yet but i eat very health even tho I ate healthy before. Tons of veggies, fruits and mostly everything was organic but i started eating meat with my husband but I am now trying to get off that and back to just the seafood and good stuff!",
