    "Content": "Telling your parents is extremely difficult.  I called my brother and let him tell them when he went to visit them a day later.  They immediately wanted to fly to Atlanta to be by my side.  I couldn't deal with them worrying and asking me questions so I told them I felt great, I would beat it and not to worry. After all you are their child and they believe no matter how old you are they need to protect you.  I found out I had invasive lobular breast cancer in November of 2007.   My mother is 87, my dad is 89.  I'm divorced, live alone and travel for my job.  My advise to you is tell them as little as possible.  Tell them when your next doctor appointment is and how well the treatment is going.  No details as they will worry and it could affect their health.  It's tough to do but I don't think they can take it at their age and I couldn't take dealing with them worrying about me.  While they still look at their little girl, I'm not little anymore.  Good luck.  It is extremely hard dealing with elderly parents.  I want mine to believe I doing okay and by believing that, I am okay.",
