I insisted they do the ultrasound because that is what my doctor ordered.  They weren't thrilled and they certainly didn't take much time doing the ultrasound.  The quickest one I ever had.  So now I don't have the results of ultrasound yet but by her words she is saying nothing showed up again on the mammogram.  I know I will be sent back to the surgeon and he will say the same thing.  That I can wait and see or I can have surgery.  I feel like they keep putting me between a rock and a hard place!  What can be done?  Are there any other tests that can be done and determine if it is fibrous tissue or something else?  Or do I just need to have an expensive surgery for peace of mind.  Any help would be good!  From what I read, cancer and tumors don't always show on mammograms and ultrasound so I can't believe they act like it is not a big deal to have bigger lump and a new one beside it but if it doesn't show it doesn't exist to them.  :/ had a lump in my armpit.  All tests, MRI, breast biopsy, ultrasound, were negative, however, lump in armpit was cancer in lymph node.. Have never found source of cancer in my breast. SO.................... absolutely have a breast MRI.",

My previous mammos showed small clacifications in left breast they watched for 3 yrs.  Then I skipped my mammo for 3 yrs. However, my breast surgeon said it was probably a good thing the lump popped up in my underarm otherwise we might not have caught it.  After a petscan, breast mri and ultrasound, needle biopsy of the breast, they could not find the source of my cancer in the breast.  I had chemo, axillary lymph node dissection with 17 nodes removed 1 positive followed by radiation.  I still am afraid the cancer will return elsewhere since they could not identify the source.  I guess they think it is coming from the calcifications in my breast (which do not biopsy positive)",

But the worst side effect that I can only attribute to Arimidex is all over itching with no rash etc. I quit Arimidex with my doctors permission and none of the pain or itching have gone away yet. I have been to a dermatologist, allergist, oncologist, gynecologist, rheumatologist and my primary care doctor. None could find an answer or help for the itching other than taking up to 8 antihistamines a day!! So I decided I'd see a neurologist. She put me on Neurontin and it kicked the itching immediately. So I did some research and found that Progesterone is lowered as well as estrogens, by Arimidex. When progesterone is too low, GABA is lowered too. GABA is a neurotransmitter. It is a calming neurotransmitter. In lowered levels it can trigger systemic itching. Now for the interesting part. Neurontin's generic name is Gabapentin. It increases GABA in the transmitter world of the body. It also helps with nerve pain. My sciatica is a little improved and the itching is gone as long as I take the Neurontin.. I will not take anymore of the cancer drugs. My oncologist said I probably would do worse on tamoxifen so I passed on it and another one. I am working on my diet and exercise to hopefully deter the cancer from returning. Has anyone else experienced this horrific itching? I pray it can be reversed eventually so I can stop the Neurontin too. I hate medicines. I have Lupus and have had it for 20 some odd years. I had about 10 years of horrible illness and meds with that and am happy to say it is under control now for the past 7 years. So now you can see why I hate meds! Well, I have rambled enough. Let me know if anyone has experienced itching. Thanks! YES!  I itch every day and uncontrollably miserable from it!  No rash but sometimes hives.  I think it is the arimidex too!  My oncologist doesn't think so but..............I also am having trouble with a hip!   ",
