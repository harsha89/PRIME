      "Content": "I recently found a pea size lump in my breast. My ob-gyn thought it was a cyst, but it didn't show up on the mammogram or ultrasound. The radiologist dismissed the area and life carried on. But, the lump is still there. I went to see a surgeon today who didn't seem to worried. He says come back in a month and then if it is still there suggests an excision biopsy. I am rather nervous about having surgery, that will result in a scar and possible dimpling of my breast for a lump that everyone seems to think is nothing. Any advice would be appreciated.",
