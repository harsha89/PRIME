    "Content": "Dear Holly, I experienced mood swings, anxiety and some depression with my chemotherapy. It progressed and after the last round of chemo was the worst. The cancer disappeared and my physical health was improving dramatically as I went through six rounds of chemo so I didn\u2019t associate the depression to bad news. People have different side affects from the chemo and the same person can respond differently at different times. My liver got bogged down several times during chemo. I did kidney and liver cleansing to help these organs function more normally. I also was on steroids as part of my chemo protocol, which had a huge influence on my mental state. The difference in anxiety and depression you are experiencing may be caused by your reaction to chemo. I did multiple things to support my body and mind and if I had a particular problem I'd look for something new to address it. Take care and many Blessings, Brian M.",
