    "Content": "My good friend has stage 4 breast cancer metatsicized to bone. She believes in alternative and traditional medicine being used together and decided that CTCA in Zion, Il. was the place for her to go. At first they led her to believe that she was in the right place for the \"best\" treatment. Two months into treatment her calcium levels rose  to 13 (normal being 7-10.5). Her doctor at CTCA told her to stop taking her calcium supplements and come back in 3 months. She then began to feel very fatigued, disoriented and completely lifeless. When she tried to get an earlier appointment then scheduled  her phone calls were not returned promptly and she was told they could see her only three days  before her next scheduled appointment. Her doctor never called her back and she felt as though she was being brushed aside. His \"advice\" via his nurse was to get an ultrasound of her kidneys. Finally her friends made  her go  to an emergency room where after describing her symptoms she was immediately put on a heart monitor and given intervenious treatment to flush the calcium from her blood. Bottom line- with out this treatment she would have lapsed into a coma and died.  Needless to say she is now receiving the best care possible at Froedtert hospital in Milwaukee, Wi. and is looking forward to many more healthy years ahead.   Her avid advise - do not go near the center in Zion.  E-Mail her at --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
