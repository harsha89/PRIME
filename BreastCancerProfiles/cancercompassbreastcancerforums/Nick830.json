    "Content": "Julie, I agree. Ty Bollinger's book is amazing. I finished all 450 pages in only 2 nights. The \"personal touches\" such as the story of his mother and father made me really connect with his mentality and understand his motivation to write the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for the TRUTH about viable alternative treatments for cancer. This book is a MUST HAVE for anyone who has cancer. As Bill Henderson states in his review of the book on Amazon.com, \"Just Buy it...you won't be sorry.\" Nick",
