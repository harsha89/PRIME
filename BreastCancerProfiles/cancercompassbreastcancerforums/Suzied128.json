Here it is:   1/4 teas. turmeric and 1/4 c. water ...bring to boil and boil down to almost a paste...Add 1 C. almond milk, 1t. honey and bring to boil..Remove from heat and whisk in 1t.almond oil...sprinkle with nutmeg or cinnamon and Voila...It was good!  I'll try drinking this every evening and I'll let you know. I had been having tremendous pain in my knees but have found regular exercise is helping.  I use the recumbant bike or elyptical machine at the gym 3 or 4 times a week and my knees haved improved quite a bit.  My hands are very painful.  The thumb joint is very inflamed.  Anyone have a suggestion for this?",
