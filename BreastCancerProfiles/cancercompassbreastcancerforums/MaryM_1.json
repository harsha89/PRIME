The hurt with a mammogram is short lived, the hurt from breast cancer hurts for a long time....  PLEASE get your mammograms !!! Don't listen to the stories about the pain.... Remeber one thing, you might be saving your own life.... Lorraine You know I am sorry for your cancer. I pray you recover. But you have to agree that it a man had to do this to his privates ,there would be a different test. Sorry I guess I will be at risk and this is my CHOICE.",

Four pics TOTAL!  As for the pain, well. it is different for everyone and the exposure takes mere seconds though it feels like an eternity.  This whole thing of the amount of radiation you receive is why you wait 12 months.  Most insurance companies will not pay if you try to go ONE day before 365 days.(Unless you need follow up work).  Radiologic technology has evolved tremendously since 1928 so I would not hesitate to get a test done especially if it shows calcifications that a ultrasound or MRI will not show.  Thermography can't localize it.  And just know that if you go spend a day at the beach-- forget about the amount of rads you get from a mammogram!  If I should ever have the pleasure of performing your test-- please don't ask about any new test because until the FDA approves it-- it ain't gonna happen!Ok it's four pics total. \"The pain is different for everyone\" You know it's a test not a procedure it shouldn't hurt. If a man had to put his private parts in a vise for \"mere seconds\" I can assure you the medical community would develope a new test fast instead of the vise. I did not get a mammo for 2 years because of the injuries I sustained from a mammo at a very well know chicago hospital. I had bruises across the whole top of my chest down to my breast then more under my breast and I was screaming in pain . The bruising was there for months. The hospital personnal shrugged their shoulders at me and so did my old doctors when I explained what was done to me and it had not been the first time. It was just he most severe. and your are right it ain't gonna happen!! Because no one wants to show what the techs do to you. I say the techs because that is who it's being blamed on it's being blamed on you. The doctor,nurse,respectionist,and  other techs say it's not the test it's the Tech that did that to you. I say BS. It's the test it's wrong and I will not have another. I attempted to last week and I had to stop it. She said she got it and she would have to do the side few,but it was going to hurt more than the last pic did. Then I stopped it.  ",
