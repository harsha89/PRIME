I HAD TO DISCONTINUE USING MGM-3 WHEN I HAD A SEVERE TOTAL BODY RASH REACTION. A WORD OF ADVICE: IF YOU ARE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY TELL YOUR ONCOLOGIST THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE SULPHA TO PROTECT YOU AGAINST A DEADLY DORMANT BUG WE ALL HAVE IN OUR BODY CALLED PNEUNO CYSTIS, THE DISEASE PEOPLE WITH AIDS DIE FROM. AFTER MY FIFTH ROUND OF CHEMO THIS DISEASE ALMOST KILLED ME. IF YOU RELAPSE WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER CHEMO, FIND A CLL SPECIALIST. MOST ONCOLOGIST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TREAT CLL PROPERLY. HARVEY",
