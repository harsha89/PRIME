    "Content": "Hi---I had a bilateral mastectomy in July.  I have been on Arimidex since August. I ache some, but my cataracts are really getting worse. I am tired, but I can't sleep well. I take Boniva and calcium with vitamin D to ward off osteoporosis--I have osteopenia already.  Arimidex is a nasty drug with many side effects.  My aching is could also be due to my Fibromyalgia.  I am trying to get back to exercising and to eat right.  Good to know about the glucosamin and chondroitin helping.  I hate this drug, but the idea that there could be more cancer cells in my body makes me take it regularly. ",
