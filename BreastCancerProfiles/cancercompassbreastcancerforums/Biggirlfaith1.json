      "Content": "Hi. I have not quite gotten there yet. I had my right breast removed with reconstructive surgery 1st then I went through 12 weeks of A&C Chemo and now I am on Taxol for 12 weeks every week. I have 5 more to go. I was stage 2 Her2-neu/positive. I am wondering what happens when I finish. I am in a study where they monitor me for 5 years but that is only every 3-6 months. I would continue to try to keep myself healthy and research more and more about the disease. I would keep track of how I am feeling and be sure to call the doctor when something is not right.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer on September 28, 2004. I had a mastectomy with reconstruction on October 25, 2004. I am Her2 positive overexpressed 3+ and I am struggling with treatment options. I am a canidate for a randomized trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide followed by Taxol to that of Adriamycin and Cyclophosphamide followed by Taxol plus Herceptin. In my research I have found that if you don't get Herceptin with the first time around, the cancer normally comes back and Herceptin with the reoccurrence. The problem: (1) I was randomized in the arm without the Herceptin. (2) My current doctor will not give me the Herceptin because she does not know what the long term effects are from the Herceptin. If you have any suggestions and/or comments please respond.",
