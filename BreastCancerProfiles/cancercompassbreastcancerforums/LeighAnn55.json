      "Content": "Hi! My name is Leigh Ann. I have recently taken a position in a new breast surgeon's office, as office coordinator in Greenville, South Carolina. Up until now, Greenville (a very large city) didn't have a specialty breast surgeon, so this is very exciting for our community. I really enjoy working in this office; however, there are days when things are unbearable...seeing patients diagnosed with breast cancer. I have seen ladies in their 20's and up being diagnosed, and it's terrible that we haven't found a cure. Wouldn't it be wonderful if 2008 were the year for the cure? It breaks my heart, especially seeing the women with young children being diagnosed with this dreadful disease.  My question is...does anyone know of any group of ladies who like to sew, knit or crochet for the cause. I have seen in other offices, where they have the little pillows for the pt's to take home after having axillary dissection (this is where they take many lymph nodes from under the arm). This is a very painful procedure, and normally this patient is unable to rest their arm against their body for quiet some time. The pillows are very useful, and serve as a great purpose...and I'm sure most patients end up keeping those for the rest of their lives as a reminder of a turning point in their lives....when they began the fight. There are many things that crafty ladies could donate...ex. chemo caps, pillows, ribbon pins....etc. I'm sure there are many I'm not aware of.  If any of you have any ideas, resources, advice...etc, please email me at --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

For it is people like you who make me want to fight harder for the cure. I am so happy you are a survivor, and I love you positive attitude. I have no doubt that your positive attitude played a great role in your winning against the BC.",

Thank you! I will definitely look into that.",
