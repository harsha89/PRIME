      "Content": "hi!! my sister was just diagnosed before thanksgiving and it has spread everywhere. they are hoping for remission and nothing more. it is in her spine and lungs and liver and in lymph nodes. she is also ER+  and will have her ovaries removed. i am flying to see her thurs and she just had her first chemo treatment today. she said something about her2 and she had to have a different chemo and take a shot every week. Do you know anything about this?  I am so worried and scared for her. i don't want to loose her to such a horrible thing. How long can this type of cancer stay in remission? She is only 36. So i am hoping she will stay alive for a long time. I just don 't understand all the terminology they use. Thank you for any advice you can give me to help me better understand this disease. I wish you very well with your remission.  ",
