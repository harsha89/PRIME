My husband has been very supportive through all this but i feel guilty putting him through this. We have been married just over a year and now all this. I don't know that I want to go any farther with treament. I have been cut open 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I am feeling very sick when i look at my scares, I know they are new and they will fade but right now I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to scream.  Intamacy has become a thing if the oast since all this has started and I think that is the hardest part of all this, I need to feel close to my husband, i need hito touch me and love me the way he used to before I got sick. How so I relay this to him without pushing him. It is going to happen sooner then later that I will not physically be able to love him and feel close to him but now while I can he is scared. Does anyone have any advice for me or encouraging words of wisdom. I need something to hold on to right now.  Thanks for listening. Hello, I know how you feel. I have been battling breast cancer for 14 years. I was in remission for 7 of those years but still having check ups yearly. mine came back in 2001 and I have been on several protocols and meds. I found out in Jan. that it has metasticized in my brain, lungs, bones, and liver. I had 10 rounds of radiation recently and am now taking Novaline. I met a wonderful man just 8 months ago. Told him to find a well woman to date but I can't seem to get rid of him. He has stayed with me through all of this and were not even married!! Surround yourself with positive, loving people. You can love him in many ways and you will get your sexy self back. Just not now. Im sure he understands that. Never give up! I get down a lot but I always think of my girls and all the people who love me. You are sooo blessed. I have this quote from Abraham Lincoln on my computer that says \"Its not the years in your life, but the life in your years\". Abundant love sent your way!!",
