      "Content": "I was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma after having a risk reduction mastactomy. I  have just finished  my first treatment of Taxotere and cytoxon. THis form of breast cancer is rare. I was not willing to take a chance that it had spread . The treatment is not bad. I had Chemo 20 years ago for Hodgkins disease and this is nothing like that.  It takes a while for the final diagnoses. There is really not much info out there. You need to talk with your Onc and Make a decision as to what you are able to handle. The treatment is only 4 times. For me, I needed the insurance thta I would be here to see my kids graduate. I was also node negative. 1.1cm and triple negative. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I had my first treatment of taxotere and cytoxen 2 weeks ago. It is not bad. I had chemo 20 years ago and I can assure you this does not have the same toxic effect. I was also node neagative with a 1.1 cm tumor. This was found after I had a risk reducing mastactomy. I needed to know that I had done everything to assure that this cancer was not anywhere else in my body. My husband also questioned the chemo, but honestly it is your wife decision  and it is what can she live with. As for the side effects on the internet-- GET OFF. THey have to list everything!! Call 1-800-4 Cancer, they will send you the list of the common side effects. Tell your wife to talk to her Onc.- they truley know.Good luck",

My nodes and margins were all clear. I am presently undergoing 4 treatments of TC. I am also triple negative. They seem to treat this aggressively because they no so little about it. I was diagnosed at memorial  sloan kettering in NYC. Hopefully we will be able to give the drs some answers so that other women will have better treatment choices for this type of cancer. It is nice to Finally met someone else with this rare cancer. Good luck to you. Please let me know how your treatment is going.",

My brother lives in NY and wanted me to go to Sloan Kettering for treatment - but I opted to stay here in Florida close to home.  When I have my mastectomy in 2 weeks, the research center, that is also my treatment center, is taking what's left of my cancerous tissue to study and do research into the causes and most effective treatments.  It turns out my oncologist is heading up  this wide-scale study.  I'm hopeful that this donation will help others in the future.  I hope that chemo is going well for you.  Fortunately, I had an easy time with chemo and managed to keep the side effects minimal.  Fatigue, loss of appetite, and a totally messed up taste buds were my biggest problems.  My last chemo was 3 weeks ago and everything is pretty much back to normal.  I even have little, light-colored, fuzzy hairs all over my head now! I wish you the best! Chris    Good luck with the mastectomy. I had mine done with reconstruction and was back at work 3 weeks later. It really is not bad. My tissue is also being used for research at Sloan. I hope they figure out what the best course of treatment is so other women at least have some info to fall back on. Again- good luck with surgery.",
