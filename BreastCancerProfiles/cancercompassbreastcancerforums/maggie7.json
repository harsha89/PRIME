    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I'm also a breast cancer survivor and had problems with my hair after chemo (which I completed almost three years ago).  I have male-patterned baldness, similar to the way others have described it.  I also have hypothyroidism, and I am currently on Femara.  I'm curious if all of the survivors with hair not growing back after chemo have hypothyroidism.  I'd also like to know if anyone has had any success in growing their hair back.  I haven't found anything that helps -- except hats and wigs!  Take care, Maggie",
