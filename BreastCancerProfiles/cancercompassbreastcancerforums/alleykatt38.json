    "Content": "Hello everyone and God Bless. I too found this site by search engine looking for \"exposed jawbone\". I am a 47 yr old woman who has never had any biopphosponates nor have I had cancer. I have exposed jawbone on both sides of my lower jaw. Very painful and it makes it hard for me to eat as I cannot eat hard foods. I don't understand why I have this, my dentist is stumped and has referred me to several oral surgeons, of which I still have to be seen. If any of you have even the tiniest clue as to why I have this, please respond. Thank you so much!",
