Inflammatory breast cancer can present as swelling, itching, burning, and pinkish coloration, to name a few symptoms. There would not be a lump in the case of IBC. You should see a breast specialist immediately.    thank you very much for the information, i'm seeing a specialist next Monday. I just pray that i'm catching it early enough if cancer is what it is.is there other breast conditions that can cause these symptoms",
