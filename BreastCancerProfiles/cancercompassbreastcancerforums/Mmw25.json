    "Content": "Has anyone heard that song by Amy Pehrson called \"All Aboard\"?  It is the most inspiring song of hope I've heard.  Although it's hopefull and upbeat it brings a tear to my eye every time I listen to it.  I find myself listening to it at least a couple times a day just to make it through.  If you haven't heard it, you should!  I'm sure you can find it other places, but I found it at www.allaboardforacure.org.  There's a tab at the top called \"The Song\".  She is amazing!",
