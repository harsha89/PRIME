The side effects have been very difficult especially the fatigue and joint pain.  Please hang in there everyone on these drugs. Beat breast cancer. I will post again after about 4 months to tell of the changes after the drug. Regards to all. Hormone receptor status is a main factor in planning breast cancer treatment. Some breast cancer cells grow with the help of estrogen and/or progesterone (female hormones produced in the body). These cancer cells have special proteins inside, called hormone receptors. When hormones attach to hormone receptors, the cancer cells with these receptors grow.   A pathologist determines the hormone receptor status by testing the tumor tissue removed during a biopsy. Hormone receptor-positive (or estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive) breast cancers have many hormone receptors Hormone receptor-negative (or estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative) breast cancers have few or no hormone receptors Hormone receptor status and hormone therapy: Hormone receptor-positive breast cancers can be treated with hormone therapies. These include tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors, anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara) or exemestane (Aromasin). Hormone receptor-negative breast cancers are not treated with hormone therapies because they do not have hormone receptors. Estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptor status: Breast cancers that are estrogen receptor-positive also tend to be progesterone receptor-positive. And, cancers that are estrogen receptor-negative tend to be progesterone receptor-negative.   Sometimes, a breast cancer is positive for estrogen receptors, but negative for progesterone receptors. Because current hormone therapies are designed to treat estrogen receptor-positive cancers, these cases are treated the same as breast cancers that are positive for both hormone receptors.",
