    "Content": "Don't know if this will help at all, but it may be worth a try. In his book, Beating Cancer with Nutrition, Patrick Quillen (former VP of Nutrition for the national network of Cancer Treatment Centers of America for 10 years) suggests doing this before chemo: 16 IU Vit. E daily, aloe, Vit. D ointment. I know this is way after chemo for you, but maybe these things would help you grow it back. I am sorry you are dealing with this. If I were in your shoes, I would feel the same way you do. Hope today is a good one for you.",
