After seeing a neurologist for more than a year and little help, I switched to the pain clinic. My present doctor has managed the pain much better, although I can still not walk more than 20 Min. I take Neurotin, Tramadol and Venlafaxine for the pain and Aromasin for the cancer not to return. I have 2 small children and I am pretty much in despair about the chronic foot pain. Sometimes it gets so bad I can barely walk around in the apartment. I used to be a very energetic person, very active, always traveling, but now I feel very vulnerable and isolated. I barely go out and I cannot imagine to grow old like this. The kids is really the only thing that keeps me going. Has anybody found a method to help chronic neuropathy in the feet?Hi there, I saw your post about having chronic pain from taxol. I have breast cancer stage 3A and finished Taxol in October 2010 Last year. Ever since the 2nd taxol (out of 4) I have been in sever pain My entire legs and arms burn and sometimes pinch. Most days My body feels like a garbage truck is running over me. I just say \"my blood hurts\" I don't sleep because of the pain. The only Thing that works is Morphine every 4 hours and a 12 hour slow release Of Morphine as well. On the start of the 5th hour I am in pain again Someone help me! What is going on? My pain clinic says it may be A form of myalsia. Help me! I have 2 little girls, 7 and 3 and I used to Be athletic and active also. Now I'm down all the time and also sick to My stomach from pain meds. I cannot return to work. I used to manage Hotels and brought in decent money. I'm trying to fight disability As of right now. Any one relate?",
