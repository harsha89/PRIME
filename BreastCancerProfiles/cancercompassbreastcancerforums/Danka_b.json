      "Content": "I have a long history of fibrocystic disease and have had continual tests over the years including several core biopsies. In 2004 I had my first MRI that detected a suspicious mass. A surgical biopsy showed no malignancy. 3 months later a mammogram detected another problem. The mass had to be removed surgically and again was benign. My doctors tell me that mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI utilize different technology to detect cancer and can show different areas of concern. High risk patients have a need for all three. I was also told that the masses that were removed could have caused me problems in the future if left alone. I believe that you cannot be too careful. Why are you waiting to see a surgeon? These tests are used for early detection, but a biopsy is necessary to get the final answer. You have to be your own advocate and may want to tell the doctors that you are in charge. One of my male doctors, early on, told me that I was \"over the top\". I had to find a woman surgeon who has been extremely supportive and proactive. Good luck. Danka",

      "Content": "One of the tests that was considered for me was an MRI guided biopsy. The Radiologist told me that it's extremely complicated. Because she was able to locate the problem area on the ultrasound, I underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy. It was much easier and rendered the same results. If you are \"full of tumors\", have you considered an elective mastectomy? It's an extremely controversial subject. One you may be offended by, if so please forgive me, no offense meant. I did a lot of research on it and had the doctors lined up. If in the future my condition progresses, I won't hesitate to have the surgery. There is not a lot of information on it out there. But there are some very fine doctors who believe in it and have a lot of experience. One of the procedures is called a DIEP Flap Mastectomy. It utilizes the fat from your belly for the reconstruction. If you're a candidate, the reconstruction is done just after the mastectomy and you wake up with natural looking breasts and relatively few scars. The doctor has to be an expert in it, someone who is experienced in microscopic connecting of the blood vessels. You don't end up with implants, so there is not risk of hardening, etc. If you want to find out more, you can get on the John Hopkins web site. They have a world famous specialist on staff. The coordinator of their program is a woman by the name of Lilly Shackley (you may want to check the spelling) who had the surgery herself. There is also a doctor in Louisiana, one in Texas, one on Long Island (NY) and another one in Miami. John Hopkins also has attornies who are experienced in \"fighting\" insurance companies to pay for these surgeries. There is another procedure that is called a TRAM Flap. My understanding is that it can have some side effects because it compromises your stomach muscles. I don't know if you had genetic testing. If you need information on it, there is a lab in California and Utah (I believe) called Myriad Lab. They are the pioneers in the field. If you were to be tested, and it turned out that you have the gene, then a decision to take more drastic steps would be an easier one. Good luck in whatever you decid to do. I will keep my fingers crossed. Danka",
