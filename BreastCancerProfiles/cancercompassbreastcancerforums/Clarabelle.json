    "Content": "Hi from NZ I am big breasted, I have had mammograms every 2 years since I was 50, I am now 65. A mammogram feels as though you have shut your breast in the fridge door, leant heavily against it for a second or two and that's that! I don't ever feel much more than a second or two of discomfort and I would NEVER skip my mammogram. For a few seconds of discomfort think of what the alternative could be????  Be brave, smile, grin and have a laugh, it's over before you know it.    Clarabelle (daughter fighting colon cancer with mets to liver & lungs)",
