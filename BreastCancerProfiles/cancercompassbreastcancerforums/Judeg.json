    "Content": "July 31,2005 found lump. Ultrasound showed it to be 3.2cm x 1.2 cm's. Started taking large doses of Vitalzyme and ordered ellagic acid 1000mg. During the time for ellagic acid to arrive, the tumor felt as if it was changing. Started taking ellagic acid the 3rd week of August. On 10-6-05 lumpectomy done. Pathology result - tumor's largest dimension was 1.3cm. Don't have final pathology yet, but have insisted that my surgeon get all tumor characteristics, i.e. dead cancer cells, scar tissue etc. from pathologist. Will know more later next week.",
