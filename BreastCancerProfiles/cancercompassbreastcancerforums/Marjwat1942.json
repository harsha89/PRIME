    "Content": "I'm new here. Used to post on another anti-Arimidex blog in 2010 after my 2nd mastectomy, the first for which I received chemo. Something different is now being posted...bone loss. I followed my oncologists's advice and started Arimidex. After 3 monts and hobbling around in pain worse ghan my 92-year old mother I made the well thought-out decision to stop taking the debilitating medication rather than endure 5 years of agony, essentially throwingawa the best remaining years of my 68-year old life. I preferred to live a quality though possibly shorter life rather than waste those 5 years not really living. Quality over quantity. When telling my oncologist why I quit, I asked her why my HMO prescribed such a debilitating drug? Her answer was simple: standard protocol. What I've experienced after only 3 months on Arimidex is first, trochanteric hip bursitis and cortison shots that quickly no longer had any effect. Next, lumbar pain and stenosis, And loss of cartilege in my knees, having one knee replaced. I next went to a collapsed lumbar disc, L4-L5, low. Then the disc herniated and pushed my spiinal cord backwards into a loop that displaced 2 backbones. I've been recommended for a spinal fusion for over 4 years. Then other adjacent discs bulged, at least one has collapsed. My brother's back is worse than mine, but so far he's convinced me to avoid the spinal death nell of surgery, instead walk and excercise my muscles and core back into strength sufficient to support my bones, not my bones supporting 50 extra pounds. It's already coming off. I was also just diagnosed with osteopenia, borderline minimal lumbar bone loss, which began due to chemo. So zi walk, do yoga, tai chi, have a doctor who supports exercise over surgery. Btw, I've taken recommended doses of calcium and D3 for over 30 years. Exercise is do-able as compared to taking Arimidex, no comparison. So I'm somewhat disabled, enough to have a handicapped tag for my car, and I use a cane when I go out just for stability. Hope this lends some insight.",
