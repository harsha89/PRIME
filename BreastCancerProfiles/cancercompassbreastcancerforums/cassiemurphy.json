My breast is also still very sore and I am wondering just how long to expect this pain. I usually heal very quickly and this is disturbing to me. They make it sound like its nothing but if I had to do it over, I would have refused the node removal, for many reasons. Yes, they do downplay it, dont they? And I find that attitude very offensive and unproffessional. my armpit still gives me grief, 2yrs 6mnths later. has improved slowly, but is a constant effort to stop it tightening. try to find a good physiotherapist, as that is why I have almost full range of movement back. you will get through this, I did! Bottom line is any surgery to the underarm is painfull, this area is sensitive. As for the breast ,my 1st took years to settle, 2nd is still in progress. Good luck!!!!",
