    "Content": "help! I'm only 16, and I have a clear pus coming from the pores around my nipple. It's clear, and there is NO odor at all. Sometimes it comes on it's own, and other times...not. Well, it seems almost like a pimple, but it doesn't have the look or feel of one. It doesn't have the white or top part of a pimple, but it does become red. My nipples also itch. I don't want to talk to my mother or anyone, because it is too embarrassing for me. Please help!!",
