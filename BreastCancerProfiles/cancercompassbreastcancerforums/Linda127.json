Your mom's sense of what her body needs and doesn't need is important when deciding what treatment course she should follow... along with the particulars of her cancer. I've had 3 primary breast cancers since 2000 (I'm now 63) and had radiation the first time. If I had to do it again, I'd skip all \"standard\" treatment other than surgery, and turn to a nutrient dense diet, as well as supplements through a Naturopathic Doctor, to strengthen my immune system.  Depending on how aggressive the tumor was, the likelihood of your mom having a recurrence is about 15% over the next 5 years. That means there's an 85% chance she'll never get another breast cancer \u2014 without any further treatment than surgery. It comes down to a choice between quality vs. quantity of life. If your mom's life is uncomfortable because of the side-effects she's experiencing, it seems reasonable for her to stop taking the drug and follow whatever diet makes the most sense to her. You might want to check out www.breastcancerchoices.org \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breastcancerchoices.org \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.breastcancerchoices.org for info on a variety of treatment approaches being used by many women (and some men) who've opted not to follow the \"standard of care\". The upshot \u2014 IMO \u2014 is that your mom will be fine without the hormone blocker. But I refused to take it myself, so I'm biased. Thank you all for sharing your knowledge and experiences! I have been taking Arimidex for three full years. I switched from Tamoxifin after a year becuase the latter caused migraines. I had some depression at first, but that subsided. This past year I have developed some serious spinal problems: two herniated discs with degenerative (lower) spine disease, severe athritis in both hips - and some knee problems). I am overweight, but it's hard to move around when you are in varying levels of pain. I am going to PT three times a week now and am able to move a little more freely - so excited I can put on my right sock by crossing my ankle over my knee again (this has eluded me for almost a year or more!). Prior to PT I was nearly doubled over. Until now, I thought this was just normal aging for a 60-year-old woman who is somewhat overweight. After reading your posts, I'm fairly convinced that arimidex is my problem. My end date is January 2014 - but I am seriously considering stopping now. We do have some breast cancer in my family, my aunt died from it in 1976 when they didn't have early detection. However, my sister had it some 15 years ago and it never returned. She had radiation but was never given any long-term medication. She is now 75 and gets around great - much better than me. So I'm wondering why do I have to keep taking it? Other types of cancer runs in my family, so I am concerned. Five of six siblings have or have had some kind of cancer (breast, pancreatic, colon and skin). So the Big C is an ongoing concern. My family doctor leans towards holistic treatments (but not always) and has recommended Estrodim. This supplement, according to him, is an effective estrogine inhibior, but without the side effects. Has anyone ever heard of this? Does anyone know anything about this? if so, please share them! Aso, are these side effects of Arimidex permanent???",

      "Content": "I was supposed to take arimidix for 5 years but the pain was so great that I just couldn't get myself to take another pill. So stopped at 4 years. While some of the immediate symptoms subsided, I am left with severe arthritis in both hips and my back hurts every day. But I can still get around, just have to be very careful. To the comment about an unnecessary hysterectomy, my gyno wanted me to have one when I was in my late 40s, pre-cancer (56) because I was having unusually heavy periods. Had the surgery scheduled and everything. Then I had a chance to talk to my family doctor who is more wholistic. He said STOP! Change your diet first to see if that works. We excluded everything from a cow: red meat, dairy, everything. By the next period I was back to normal so I canceled the surgery and have not had a problem since. My husband and I noticed that every time I ate red meat, my period would kick in in about 2 days, regardless of my last one. So it wasn't my imagination. My point is, surgeons only know how yo cut. That's how they make their living. There are times when it is essential, and we are grateful to them, but sometimes a knife is not the only answer. Research dietary options because that's what we are are of. I also drink tea with Tumeric which helps reduce inflammation from the arthritis.",
