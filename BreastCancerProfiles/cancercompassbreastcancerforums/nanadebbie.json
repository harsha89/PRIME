    "Content": "My heart goes out to you. I am watching my dad go down everyday and it breaks my heart. God will get us through hard times. I pray for God to hold my hand and give me strength and can feel him holding me up. Be strong and I am sure your sister fully understands. You are doing the right thing by staying with your husband and I am sure your sister totally understands. Stay strong in the faith and he will guide you through the hard times.",
