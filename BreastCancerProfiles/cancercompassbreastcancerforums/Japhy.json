    "Content": "Just got the same diagnosis after a biopsy. I was sent to an oncologist who recommends that I take tamoxifen.  I am a little concerned about the side effects.  I am 56 and in good health.  It doesn't seem like there is any other choice other than to take one of the two medications or do nothing.  I need to decide by Nov. 10th, so I thought I would look for others in the same situation.",
