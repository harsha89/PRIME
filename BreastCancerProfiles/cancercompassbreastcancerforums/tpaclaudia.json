      "Content": "I am a breast cancer survivor for 8 years.  In the beginning, I was put on Tamoxifen.  After 3 years, my Oncologist put me on Femara because it was new and he said was having great results.  My joints starting hurting so bad, I could hardly move so we changed to Arimidex, with no change.  He then put me on Aromacin and that was just as bad.  They decided to try another new one called Faslodex.  It is given in the form of 2 injections in the rump once a month.  I was in hopes this would be the one.  IT WASN'T.  I talked the doctor into putting me back on Tamoxifen because it was the only one that worked for me.  It has just been a couple of weeks since the change so I can't say it is going to work but I hope and pray that my life will get back to some sort of normalcy.  I had a fall last September that resulted in compression fractures.  The procedure I had for that (twice) was called Kyphoplasty.  The first time a biopsy was done and there was no cancer.  The second time the procedure was done the biopsy showed traces of bone cancer.  I had 2 weeks of radiation for that, so I am back on the \"wait and see\" list.  Life is a roller coaster and we just have to keep going up and down. I hope I have the same results as the others in this BACK TO TAMOXIFEN STRUGGLE.",
