We want quality of life, not to be like vegetables. Gppd Luck~ I noticed you posted in 2011, and it is now 2015.  What is your present health? Yes, it is 2015 & I'm alive & well.  Just today, I had an appt w/my oncologist.  So far, the breast cancer has not returned, but still I'm plagued, on a daily basis, with the Arimidex side effects.  Initially, my GP told me this would last 6 months..., but here we are.  As I am a very active nearly 65 yr old (09/07/50),  I have not allowed the lingering effects to lay claim to the qulaity of my life.  We have a gym here in the house & I workout at least 3 eves/wk....1 1/2 hrs each...hand wts, bench press, elliptical, Bowflex and treadmill.  Most days, I'm OK until between 11a-1p, when I take my pain med, Nucynta.  It's a wonderful, non-constipating opioid. Then, I take the second one about about 5 or 6p.  However, there are other days when I awaken with this burning/throbbing/tingling annoyance, about a 3 or 4, on a pain scale with 10 being the worst. Those mornings, I take Nucynta when my feet hit the floor, about 7:20 & it's out the door to walk the dog.  The second pill is about noon & a third about 6p.  This really sounds nuts, but the heating pad on my bottom is helpful getting me thru the nites, when the days start like that.  A few times, I have awakened in the night with discomfort.  It is focused on the soles of my feet, in my hands & at my butt. Never had anything like this before Arimidex. Am resigned to the fact, I'll have this forever & the only way to keep disabilities from becoming a way of life is to exercise. As long as I'm moving, I feel good, but when I stop, I feel it.  Even the EverReady Bunny has to rest sometime!  I also do 4 hrs of yard work every Saturday & volunteer 4 hrs weekly in an ER.  To stop/decrease activity allows for stiffening to set in, which then begins to limit range of motion & the less active I am the more pain I have. So, that's me in 2015. So, how are you doing?   Thanks for responding! I am 79 years old and have been on Anastrozole (generic for Arimidex) for 4 years. For about the past year, I have been so sore that I could hardly turn over in bed. Mentioned this to my oncologist, but received no help there. It finally dawned on me that medication might be causing this soreness. I got online and found your post. I stopped taking Anastrozole about 6 weeks ago. Today I feel like my old self again....not having the depressive feeling either! I have not consulted my oncologist, as I have an appointment with him in early October. I had gotten to the point that I thought I could not walk, and developed sciatica. Since not taking the Anastrozole, the sciatica is under control. You can only take so much Ibuprofen!!! I'm hoping this good feeling continues!",
