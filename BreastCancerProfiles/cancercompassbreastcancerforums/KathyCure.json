    "Content": "I\u2019m Kathy LaTour, a 21-year breast cancer survivor and editor-at-large for CURE and Heal, award-winning magazines that take you through the cancer experience. I wanted to share with the breast cancer community what we\u2019re doing in December at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, one of the largest breast cancer meetings in the world where the latest in research is reported annually. This year, the CURE and Heal staffs will be there, reporting and blogging on the breaking news and advocacy issues. To get our daily reports and webcasts, sign up at www.curetoday.com/eupdates. If you sign up before Nov. 1 we\u2019ll give you a free year\u2019s subscription to Heal: Living Well After Cancer, the magazine for all cancer survivors. We\u2019re excited about bringing you the news that may bring us one step closer to a cure. We hope you\u2019ll join us. Kathy",
