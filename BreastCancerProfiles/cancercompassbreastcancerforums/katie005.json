    "Content": "I discovered a lump on my left breast close to my sternum. When found a few weeks ago it was quite small in size. Since it has grown to about the size of a quarter its hard and doesn't move. It is also tender and the skin above it is red. Any idea what this could be? I'm 22 year old female. I have a family history of breast cancer. My grandmother passed away of it in her 40s. And mother had a gynecological cancer before 30. I'm seeing a doctor this week but am very impatient. I know there is a very low chance of this being cancer but It could be possible if I carried the brca gene which I will be tested for as soon as possible. My question is what should I expect by visiting the doctor for this lump ? What kind of tests? Also does anyone know the statistics of someone my age and history to have this disease?Â ",
