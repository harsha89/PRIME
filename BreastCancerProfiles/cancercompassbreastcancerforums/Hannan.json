      "Content": "I have searched a lot about it, but I have not been able to find a single study for prevention of breast cancer through peaches. Is this article really worth appreciation, let me tell you title is Peaches Prevent Breast Cancer In Elder Age! and one can read it easily at this link: http://onefaceinamillion.com/57543/57543/ What I want to know about is authenticity of information since some patients want to hear about it from me. I have read studied fundamentals, but can't make solid decision regarding whether peaches are exactly as reported, or otherwise. ",

      "Content": "Well, some good products are in the market that can reduce this sort of problems. What I have heard the most from the people near me is a product named \"Sandhi Sudha\" which is made from Indian Herb. It grows the leg functionality back to normal and even works on knees and back pain.  What they say in its advertisement, seems to be quite true from tales of people that I have met personally so far. ",
