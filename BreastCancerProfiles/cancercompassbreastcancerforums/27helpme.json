    "Content": "I am 27. I have researched ibc and its sypmtoms. I feel like something is wrong but have had clinical breast exams by my ob/ 1yr 2 monthes, 6 monthes, and 3 monthes ago. She insists that everything is fine. I feel like it isn;t. When i look in the mirror and stretch the skin on my breast it shows like ridges or something in the skin on the sides. They say to always compare it to the other breast, but that one does the same thing. I have tried to find pictures or more info on what they mean by \"ridges\", but thats about all it ever says. I have no redness or itchyness. And again the ridge looking lines that appear when stretched happen on the sides of both breast. Has anyone else ever had this symptom. I am thinking of going to a different doctor.",
