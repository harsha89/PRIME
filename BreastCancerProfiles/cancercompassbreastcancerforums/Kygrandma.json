Have ferritin iron issues (too high along with calcium).  Hair has become thin on top - noticebly so.  Was put on Arimidex until last week.  I walked with a cane all winter.  Extreme joint pain and stiffness with bone scans showing agressive arthritis.  Very little problems prior to Arimidex.  Just been changed to Aromasin.  I hope this is better.  My 81 year old mother got around better than me(54).  I hope someone can help.   Thanks",

Let me know if you decide to change medication and you find one that you adjust to better.   Cindy    Thanky Cindy, My next appointment is this coming Monday. I'm going to discuss it with him.  I have also noticed a lot of hip pain.  If he changes my drug I'll let you know. Some days are more tolerable than others.  I'll keep you posted.   ",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed last year with breast cancer and underwent radiation. I was then placed on Arimidex. I encountered numerous problems with stiffness of joints, agressive arthritis, and tons of muscular pain. Recently(thru a change of doctors) I was placed on Aromasin.  I am beginning to have more joint stiffness but am still trying this med.  There is a very noticable difference in my hair.  It is really thinning out.  Anyone with any suggestions?  Or has this impacted any one else???  I sure don't want to feel like LoneRanger.",
