    "Content": "Hi. The problem with soy is that is a plant (phyto) estrogen, that is, it is in some ways interpretted by the body as estrogen. If your breast cancer is estrogen sensative you should avoid soy.  Also, you should not take soy or phytoestrogen for symptoms of menopause if your breast cancer is estrogen fed.....    good luck. auntB",
