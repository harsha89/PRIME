    "Content": "I'm sorry that cancer has been diagnosed. I've had metastatic breast-cancer since 2004. That was after having had a mastectomy and a stem-cell rescue in 1996.  I've had different chemotherapy regiments, and they have all been very tolerable, however, I've had the different treatments because when one cancer treatment isn't working as well against the bone cancer, my oncologist always is ready with another one. I'm on Ixempra now.  This month I started another 6 month cycle with it again.  It seems to be holding the bone cancer from progressing too agressively. I don't seem to have any bad side effects, other than losing my hair, but I love to wear my different wigs! Keep your faith, you CAN live on with this  stage of life. ",
