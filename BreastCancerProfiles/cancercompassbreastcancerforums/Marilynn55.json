    "Content": "I had the double mastectomy and had stretchers put in at the time of surgery. They slowly filled what I called the water balloons to stretch the skin. They removed the expander once the skin was stretched and put in implants. If I had to do it all over again I would not have done reconstruction. I am 62 which makes a difference in my decision. The plastic surgeon can create nipples and tattoo. I am still not used to the implants.",
