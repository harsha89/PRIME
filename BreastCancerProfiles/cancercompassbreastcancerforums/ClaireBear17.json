    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 2 1/2 yrs. Prior to commencement l had bone density scans which were ok. I had previous right knee problems but nothing major.l got the whole bod checked out. Scans and x-rays which showed mild arthritis in right knee and toes. All other joints ok. After 12 mths of taking this drug l had grade 4 arthritis in my left knee and after 2 years l had grade 4 Arthritis in both knees. I have a 1.2 cm pothole in my left patella. Ortho specialist is now talking double knee replacements. Breast Specialist has pulled the blind down on it having anything to do with Arimidex. Am l confident enough in that 2% increase in my chances of a return of the big C for another 2 1/2 years of all of these wretched side effects, turning me into a cripple by playing Russian Roulette for 6 mths to see what happens if l stop taking it ? Â I dunno *sigh*",
