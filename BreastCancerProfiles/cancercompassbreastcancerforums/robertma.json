    "Content": "caseye: Suggest she discuss this with her doc.  A lot of going thru chemo is tolerating/reducing the side effects.  Remember that we are essentially calling down poison on ourselves.  We just hope we tolerate the poisons better than the tumors do.  There are a lot of good migraine drugs, some to prevent, some to deal with the migraines.  Each have some side effects of their own.  She may have to try several to arrive at benefit vs side effects decision.  Best of luck.
