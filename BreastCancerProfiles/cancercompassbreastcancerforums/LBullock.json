    "Content": "I have had breast cancer twice, the second time in 2005 with double mastectomy and reconstruction.  Recently I discovered a hard bony lump on my sternum that seems to be growing.  I'm waiting for my currect physician to obtain my records and so I can have a chest xray and/or biopsy.  Has anyone else had this?",
