This may be her request and the family is just not handling it in the most respectful way to others.  This is all new to them too.  I would ask them directly what their reasoning is.  Do you need to shorten your visit time, keep it more quiet, not bring children, not stay to eat?  These are important things to consider and ask about when you talk to them. You will have to accept  their response and may have to turn to notes of encouragement being sent to her.  There are so many emotions flying as all go throught the death process. It is easy to be hurt and get grudges over the \"unreasonable\" things that are said and done.  Be careful to not get caught in that trap. My dear sister was exhausted with just the basics: eating, bathroom, washing her up, talking etc.  We put a note on the door to limit visits to less than 15 minutes for her sake. If we didn't, neither she nor the family would get what little rest was possible. HTH ",

      "Content": "My sister felt a lump a few years after similar treatment as you.  They did remove the 2nd breast before trt. since hers was a very aggressive cancer.  She actually felt a lump and was held off for 9 months before the surgeon or oncologist would do anything.  When she insisted, the surgeon rudely replied to her he would only do it if she twisted his arm. As he did the biopsy, his face changed enough for my sister to know it was cancer before labs came back.  I agree with the other poster.  If you are nervous, do not hold on to that for months.  Insist on getting it checked.  Your situation is totally different than my sister's other than the stress involved in knowing there is a question waiting to be answered.",

      "Content": "You may have to work hard and fast to help your mother.  One option is to see if there is a Cancer Treatment Center of America near you.  They have one in Illinois and a few othere states.  They do pay for transportation and lodging for a patient and a caretaker.  I do not know much about them, other than they will work with you from all aspects:physical, emotional, spiritual.  They use conventional trt. along with supplemental to help boost the immune system.  I like this approach. You may find out more about them by doing a search online. When my sister went through this with her daughters, she lived like she would stay here but planned like she may leave.  As she went through trt.. she eventually could not work but had enough energy some days to sort pictures, write notes, and organize paper work.  The notes show so much insight for her children and husband no matter what their age when they read them.  It is a difficult balance to allow the emotions to show and yet to be practical in what has to be done.  Talk to your mother and ask her what her priorities in the coming day, month, year, years are.  Use that as a guide to help her accomplish them.  Some days it will be to just fight the ugly beast of cancer. Other days you may have fun taping her doing things with you and others you love.  If we only did things that way all the time, most families would be much stronger.  Your conversations may go from crying to laughter to hugs to silence. You will cherish every minute as you decide the path that is to be taken. God bless you and your mother. Patti ",
