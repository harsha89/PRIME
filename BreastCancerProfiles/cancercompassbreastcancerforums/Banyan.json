It's cotton with an 8-hook closure and gathers or shirring along the hook panel.  In the store they're sold on hangers singly for $7.94 each, but I also found it on the Walmart website in 2-packs for $15.19 for two, https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fruit-of-the-Loom-Comfort-Front-C I bought two sizes because I wasn't sure.  The larger size is a little longer, doesn't ride up under the breast and ia a little more comfortable for me.  It doesn't offer much compression so I wouldn't recommend it for vigorous exersize.  It's soft and doesn't lift my sagging 70-year old breasts, but it's working well for this purpose and it's much more comfortable than the tighter real sports bra I was wearing before. Many thanks! ",
