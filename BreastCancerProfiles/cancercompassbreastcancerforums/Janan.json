I don't need heart problems on top of everything else! Thanks Dear Madame, I have been on tamixifen for a year. I have experienced hot flashes. To take care of that problem, My Doctor put me on a antidepressant EFFEXOR. About a month ago my blood pressure spike and I got a very bad nose blee. My doctors feel that the bleed had nothing to do with my cancer treatment and that i had developed a sensitivty to a cold medicine I took during an international flight.. My pressure is usually 120/20 . It piked to 162/80. the problem only lasted one day. Eveythiing is back to normal now. I hope that this bit of info may help. Regards, DC",
