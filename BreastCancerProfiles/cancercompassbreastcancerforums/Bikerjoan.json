The surgeon had said to do exerise till she gets full range of motion, which she did after the first 15 days in January. She then did not do the exercises. Her chemo subsequently began in the end of January, and was 8 sessions. In April she started exercising again. About a month ago she started experiencing tightness in the surgical area. The Last couple of weeks it has turned into an excruciating discomfort.  These are the things she is describing:  -The tightness is like an iron bra that is pulling and tightening where the mastectomy happened -The tightness has recently spread to the underarm (armpit) area -It feels like the skin is sticking and pressing against the chest wall, and the ribs. Almost as if its constricting her lungs.  -She also feels like the muscles are contracting in that area, and feels like there is a rock under the skin, and everything is a frozen block.  She is on round the clock pain killers to handle the discomfort (excrutiating discomfort not \"pain\"). She was on Percocet to manage it before, but it stopped being effective. She is now on Dilaudid.  The pain doctors at stanford have felt that it is potentially a nerve issue, and prescribed neurontin and desiprimine. The pain doctors at UCSF feel its more of a muscular issue. So she has also just recently started physical therapy.  We read in a previous post from 2009 on a forum, that some of the symptoms we are describing may be caused by scar tissue adhesions. None of the doctors have talked in depth about this aspect. But it sounds like it can definitely be that, with maybe a combination of muscles issues. We just feel so frustrated and helpless, since we arent getting any clear answers.  Though her tightness and pressure began 4 months after the surgery. Did you guys also have to take pain killers? Also after how many sessions generally should she start feeling some result of the physical therapy? We arent sure if who we have is good/the right one.  The UCSF pain doctor also recommended trigger point injections, and if that works then botox shots, to relax those muscles. Thoughts?  Her radiation just started this week as well, so she cannot undergo any procedures with injections till after it is over. We are worried, because radiation is just suppose to increase the tightness, and she is already starting in such a bad condition!  PLEASE HELP! Extreme tightness after mastectomy is something I have lived  with for almost 26 years, but your story is the first I have heard that sounds like my experience. .  I did what they told me to do. After healing for awhile, doing exercises, etc. I started swimming 2 or 3 times a week, stretching out, doing laps, for at least a half hour. I asked questions of everyone.  No one could tell me anything. Doctors never mentioned it. It was like my problem didn't exist. It wasn't painful as much as tight all of the time. The tightness didn't start until the healing process was several months on. Then my expectation of improvement, always stretching with swimming went on for 3 years. It never got better. I learned to live with it. I was 53 at the time.  Now I am 79. As I age it seems to get tighter and sometimes painful, like a tight band over my heart and under my arm. I keep telling myself I am lucky to be alive---but it is difficult. I see you went to the expert specialists but even they did not know what it is.  I think your suggestion that it is scar tissue adhesions is right. So what can  one do about it 26 years later??? I doubt much.  But the issue should be addressed as it effects the quality of life. Have you had any success since June, 2013? ",
