    "Content": "Hi, Jen...  I just discovered this forum today.  Seems like a good support place! I have just finished up 5 years of taking Tamoxifen.  I experienced minor side effects:  hot flashes, some achiness (but not much at all, mostly at the start), and sometimes a slight vaginal discharge.  The hot flashes varied in intensity and frequency, but have not bothered me much.  Don't know if my response to Tamoxifen is typical... but hope it's as easy for you as it was for me! 5 years... and, I'm still deemed cancer free.  I was stage 2B when diagnosed in 2002.   Now, my oncologist wants me to start Femara, but I honestly don't know --based on research and reading posts here-- if I want to take it.  My husband makes Essiac tea for me.  I've been taking a small cup of it every evening for the same length of time as Tamoxifen.  If you're not familiar with it, it's a 4 herb blend that was given by an Ojibway Indian to a nurse in Canada some years ago.  It has helped me and several people I know.  Free advice?  I'm rambling...  :-)   Blessings to you!  --Bunny   ",
