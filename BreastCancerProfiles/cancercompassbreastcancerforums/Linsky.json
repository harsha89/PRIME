      "Content": "Message: I had surgery to remove a cancerous lump from my right breast March 2008. I have quite big breast and unfortunately I got sever burns underneath my right breast, although the lump was removed from the top of my right breast. I was in total agony and was blistering and seeping, but the radiotherapist's still kept giving me the radiotherpy. I went to see a skin specialist who said it will never heal anymore than it has, and I am still in pain after 2 years, my skin is now like tissue paper, very sore everytime I move. I have tried creams, powders all sorts nothing helps me, can someone please suggest something that can help me heal and get on with a normal life once again.",
