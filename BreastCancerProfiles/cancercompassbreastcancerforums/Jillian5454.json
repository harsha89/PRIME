    "Content": "Hi there! I just finished reading your letter and felt I had to write to you. I am a 46 year old woman who 3 years ago did indeed have a prophylatic mass. On top of this, the very same day, my 2 sisters had the operation also. In my family like yours quite a few of the women did have some sort of breast cancer. The problem was these same women who would have sonnagrams and mammagrams every 6 months were informed that \"By the time the cancer would show up on the mammagram, it already had spread into the lymph nodes\". Needless to say. I was literally freaking out! I did a heck of a lot of homework on the subject of having ones breasts removed without having cancer. I PLEADED with my 2 sisters for a year, (they thought I was just a little crazy). I finally said to just go to a cancer genectic doctor. There we were all informed that we SHOULD have the surgery. By the way, NONE of us tested positive for the brca gene test. Neither did my mom, her 2 sisters and their neice, (Who ALL had breast cancer at the time, ALL NEGITIVE RESULTS! Five days AFTER the operation, the doctor called us all up on the phone and informed us that the patholigy results were back. (Remember, we all had PERFECT mammagrams a week prior to the surgery) I was CLEAN, but they did indeed find a small tumer in BOTH of my sisters patholigy. Needless to say, the doctors removed the tumers, and they were infeormed if they had NOT had this operation, the tumers would have grown. They were also told that they would not have shown up on mammagrams because they were so small. Yet, in 5 years of time they would have been in their lymph nodes. I'm so very sorry this note is so long. I too have two kids, 14 and 21. When I asked my husband 3 years ago if he thought I should have the operation his answer was \"I want to grow old with you\" and that said it all. Please feel free to ask questions or if you just have the need to vent. I'm here. JILLIAN",
