      "Content": "My mother had herceptin treatment two weeks, and on the second week she had a skin reaction.  The herceptin was supposed to be every week for a year, and chemo every three weeks.   Now the doctor is considering Tykerb.  She has Her2 positive cancer.  She says it is invasive ductile cancer, but at one point early on she said inflammatory.  Can it be both?  Also, I live 10 hours away and I don't know exactly what I can do to help.  I've called more and sent cards, but this does not seem like much.  I visit next week, and I am afraid of being too emotional when I see her for the first time with her hair loss.  I want to be strong for her.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.",

Laughter is a wonderful healer!!  Draw close to God.  If you don't have a personal relationship with Him, seek Him out.  He is there for you.   Thanks for the comments.  I found out this weekend that my mom will continue the herceptin treatment because it is working extremely well.  The doctors will give her medicine to prevent the reaction she had.  Both my mom and I are Christians, and this most definitely gives us strength.  We also have support from others.  It is comforting to know that all the struggles we face are temporary.  God bless you as you continue with your treatments.    ",
