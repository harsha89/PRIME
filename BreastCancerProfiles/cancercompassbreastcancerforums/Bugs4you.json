      "Content": "My mother went through a Breast Cancer misdiagnosis nightmare. In Oct (2013) she went into the emergency room because she had a lump in her breast that she thought was a boil. When the first doctor looked at it they suspected it could have been breast cancer and wanted her to get more tests. My mother went back the next day for another doctors opinion and he ended up lancing it because he said it was a boil. About 8 months later it grew back and my mother once again got it checked and they got a biopsy and confirmed it was cancer. They started her on Chemo (my mother weighs 98 lbs.) and gave her over 15 different meds. The chemo weakened her immune system and her heart and she ended up having to get a blood transfusion to improve her T-Cells. They released my mom from the hospital about 4 days later. Because of the extensive chemo and all of the meds my mother was back in the hospital about 5 days after her blood transfusion suffering with 4 heart attacks within 2 days as well as a seizure which landed her in ICU for a week and in the hospital for 2 weeks after. She recently had surgery for a permanant pacemaker and by the grace of Lord she survived it all and is now taking chemo pills which are shrinking the cancer and is planning on getting the mastectomy in June. My mother almost passed away because of poor negligence caused by an incompetent doctor who never even took a biopsy to test the lump for cancer. I thought most doctors should know these kind of things. It upsets me that women like my mother have to go through these kinds of things when a doctor should be trained and know how to diagnose someone especially when it's an evident suspicion. I really am praying for everyone and keep hope alive like my mother. Lots of love, Reg :)",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Raider Girl. My mother is doing so much better now and is my hero. It makes me sad that most doctors are more concerned about their pockets than they are about ones health and most show no sincerity. I thank God everyday my mother overcame the obstacles she went through and she is now an advocate to help others go through and fight what she went through. I wish you the best. Reg",
