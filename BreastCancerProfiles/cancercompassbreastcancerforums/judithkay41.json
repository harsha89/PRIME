    "Content": "Hi Sabine I am just 4.5 weeks out of the Whipple procedure for pancreatic cancer.  While I am a believer in alternative treatments, I am finding I can do both and still have some peace of mind.  I will be beginning chemo treatments with gemcitabine on April 26th and all the while taking Chinese herbals and homeopathics as directed by my homeopathic/TCM practitioner.  I am not looking forward to the side effects, but the statistics on pancreatic cancer are frightening.  I do not want to leave out any options that may prevent this from re-appearing.  I do know that there are many people out there who have had the Whipple and are still cancer free after many years.  The chemo is simply a precaution just in case there is one aberrant cell out there that might come back in the future.  I do know of one patient that the Drs. in WI gave her 6 months: she went to Moffett Cancer Center in FL and they did chemo and a clinical trial study as well.  She has had no recurrence for over 4.5 years.  Have you checked with Cancer Treatment Centers of America?  Blessings for a complete recovery.",
