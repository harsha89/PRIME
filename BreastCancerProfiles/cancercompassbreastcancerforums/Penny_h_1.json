    "Content": "I had an abnormal mammogram in Nov. 2004, in July of this year I have had 2 mammograms, 2 sonargrams, and spot compressions (I have atypical lumps, 1 each breast), after the last round, the doctor I was seeing for my breasts told me to wait till Jan. and go through it all again to see if it has changed. My PCP doctor (a very good caring doctor) is not happy with that and thinks that I should have a biopsy on both breast to be sure. Can anyone give me some advice please? Should I wait (it will be a year since the lumps were first found) or should I move ahead and get the biopsies? P.H.",
