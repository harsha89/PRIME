    "Content": "i went for my first mamogram at age 40 and the radiologist found clusters of calcifications,  she said it was probably nothing but we should do a biopsy just incase,  lobular breast cancer grows flat like a pancake so you have no lump.  well with the biopsy i found i had lobular breast cancer,  no axillary lymph nodes were palpated as hard or suspicioous, but after my mastectomy i found i had 26 involved lymph nodes positive for cancer which placed me in stage 3.  take the calcifications serious and have this checked well, preferably with actual section biopsy and not just needle biopsy.",
