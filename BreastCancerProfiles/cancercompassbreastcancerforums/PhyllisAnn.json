That breast is now two cup sizes larger than my other one. My doctor has said let's wait and see as well. He said the swelling may never go down and that the only real risk is the possibility of infection. He did say that breast massage may help, however I have not tried that. At this point it does not cause me any discomfort except if I lay on my stomach. I did have to purchase a lumpectomy prosthesis to fill out the other side of my bra. Unfortunately I don't seem to have any more info than you do. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I had never heard of anyone else who had experienced this, and my radiation oncologist told me she had never seen it before. Please let me know if you recieve any more info! Jennifer I hope everything is going well for you.  You posted your message in 2002 so I'm hoping you can tell me what the outcome has been. Did the enlargement of the breast continue, was it cancer, did massage help? I finished radiation treatment after a lumpectomy in November and my breast is now two cup sizes larger as well just on the treated side.  The doctors don't think it is cancer. My recent MRI was normal, but it concerns me that my breast is still enlarging.  The only symptom I had before I was diagnosed with cancer was that my breast was enlarging. It enlarged for a year and a half before I finally convinced a doctor to look into it. The only thing that showed on the digital mammogram were very small calcifications but because the breast had been enlarging, they decided to do a biopsy. It turned out to be an invasive form of cancer that did not show up other than the calcifications on the mammogram, nothing showed on ultrasound and the breast felt normal.  If you have any information I would greatly appreciate it.  Phyllis  ",
