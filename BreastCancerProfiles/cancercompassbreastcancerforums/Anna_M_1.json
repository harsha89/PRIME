    "Content": "I myself just found out in August I have metaplastic carcinoma. Just went through a mastectomy and recovering okay.I will chemo in a couple of weeks and so terrified. i dont want to lose my hair but dont want to lose my life either. I hve two beautiful daughters to take care of since i am a single mother. I dont want them to see me sick and and i know I must stay strong in order for them to be strong. My tumor was 7 cm and thought it was due to an injury i sustained in december 07. I know what yall must be thinking........stupid!!!!!And youre right. i really believed it was just an injury. But now i know otherwise and must deal with it on a daily basis. I am a pretty strong person and have a wonderful support group right there beside me. I dont know what i would do without them. Whats funny is its my ex in laws that are helping me. I lost my parents several years ago. I also need to mention that I am 45 and have no clue who my biological parents are. I m now in the process trying to find them which is not easy. I just take one day ata time and smile each day because I am so very THANKFUL for it. Have a wonderful day and God bless to all!!!",
