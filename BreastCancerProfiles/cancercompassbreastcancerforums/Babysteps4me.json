      "Content": "Honey..just want to tell you a quick story....7 years ago I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer...only lumpectomy and radiation...no chemo, no medicine.  At least that is what they told me...Two and a half years later.....it had spread to my hip, requiring a hip replacement..and early stage...with no cancer found in my lymph node....jumped to stage 4 which I have been battling ever since...with many more speads to different bones, including my spine....lots of different medications and many rounds of radiation.  I just want you to know that you can be early stage with node negative diagnosis....and still something may have slipped though.  Please get a second opinion....I wish I would have. I was only 36 at the time with 2 small children, it may have been prevented if I had done a different treatment.....much luck to you......Kathy        ",

      "Content": "I felt a strong need to respond to \"cancer sucks\" screen name...regarding her doctor saying she had short time to live, given her dx. I have been battling stage 4 metastatic breast cancer to the bone...and bone only. I have been living now, over 7 years...with many new area's of mets to spine, lumbar, sacrum and ribs, along with mets to hip requiring a hip replacement. I have had many different treatmens, rounds of radiation, anit-estrogen medications, removal of my overies, monthly infusions of zometa to keep my bones strong and now recently started on Zeloda, due to a tumor on L5 which is pushing the disc out. When one treatment stops working, there is another one to try..keep the faith, you can battle this disease..although very hard. Do not look at statistics....we are all different.....try everything, and do not give up hope.....God bless...kathy (babysteps4me) PS...I am 47 years old....",
