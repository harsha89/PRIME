    "Content": "help!  i was put on tamoxifen and after about 1 year i began to get PAIN. i was a runner and tried running in between chemo treatments and recon surgery, etc, but the pain in my hip and butt kept me down.  i found absolutely NO literature that tamoxifen causes any of the pains i was experiencing.  then after taking tamoxifen for about 1.5 years, i began to get BURNING in my thighs and calfs, along with wrist pain, thumb pain and when i sat i felt like i was sitting on two very sharp pieces of glass. it became unbearable.  please note that all along i had MRI's, bone scans, work up for RA, lupus, lyme ds, etc, had two epidurals, on and on and on and on.  in the meantime, my oncologist ran some tests to see if i was post menopausal and i was so he switched me to aromasin.  OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!  the symptoms i had increased 100 fold.  i was in agony and actually felt like chemo was a piece of cake compared to what was now happening to me.  that's when i found this site and started reading everyone elses history.  i stopped taking aromasin after only two weeks.  now my oncologist wants me to try tamoxifen again, even though i was having symptoms with it.  i agreed cos man, i want to live!  so that's my story.  i will go back on tamoxifen next week.  (he wants me off all drugs for 4 weeks).  has others stopped taking all meds altogether???  that's what i think i'll be doing because i do not think i'll be able to tolerate the tamoxifen again.",
