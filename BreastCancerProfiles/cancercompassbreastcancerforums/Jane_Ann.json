    "Content": "Hi, I just read your message of 7-02. I have been on Faslodex for about 9 months because of bone mets. My tumor marker keeps elevating. I am having no symptoms, I feel fine with no aches or pains. I am to have another bone scan in July to see if I have any further involvement. I think my doctor is thinking about putting my on another pill. I had great results with Arimidex, lowering of tumor marker, but wonder if I have no symptoms if Faslodex will eventually show positive reults. Did you have good results with your Faslodex treatments? I would be appreciative of any information you could share with me. Jane B.",
