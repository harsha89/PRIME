      "Content": "I just started on femera one month ago and I am already experiencing severe side effects. I was walking across the room and it felt like someone stabbed me in the leg with a lance. It was enough to send me to the floor. The nausea & diarrhea keep me indoors most of the time. They say this may go away in time with some people. Has anyone else felt this? If so, how long did it last? I had a double mastectomy with nine lymph node involvement. They stopped my chemo when they started me on Taxol. That sent me to the hospital. It almost killed me. I could not handle the Taxol. This is my second battle with cancer. The cancers are not related. If anyone has had any of the above, please let me know how you are doing. Doctor's never tell you how the rest of their patients are doing. Barbara",

I hope that your journey ends with a complete remission and no more pain. I wish you all the luck in the world. Take care. Barbara",

      "Content": "Hi Bobbie, I have heard a lot of different responses to femara. One person said that the pain was so bad that the doctors put her on oxycontin, oxycodone & celebrex. I started femera last month. I stopped twice and went back on again. My pain is intermitent. I can get a sharp pain in the bone in my calf that has sent me right to the floor. My feet were pretty much destroyed from chemo, so it is hard to tell what is causing my foot pain. I am in the process of loosing my toe nails. When a doctor tells you to live with the side effects you know the alternative. I just have a stiff drink once in awhile. It does not hurt or help, but what the hay. You ask how? You do it until you decide that you have lost your quality of life. Everyone has a different thresh hold. Hang on as long as you can. Life is worth it. Try to get out more it helps not to dwell on it. Now all I have to do is follow my own advice. Ha! Take care, Barbara",
