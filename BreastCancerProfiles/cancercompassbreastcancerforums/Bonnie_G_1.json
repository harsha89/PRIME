      "Content": "Hi Julia, I had just finished with my treatment of breast cancer and 3 months later I show up with Liver, bone & lung met. I had to go to radiation for my bones because I was in so much pain and that helped alot. The 1st chemo I had only helped me for 3 months and my liver count went up. Than my Dr. got me into a study at UCLA. I also have been taking Herceptin and this study was for that, well I lasted 6 months on that one. Now I am back to Chemo and that is Navelbean and herceptin so far it has been 6 weeks and I am doing good. When my liver tumors started growing I really hurt that is one way I knew what was happening. Now after this chemo I have one more left than it will be studies. My breast tumor was 8.2 and my Dr. had told me that I would have a good chance of it metastasising and gosh he certainnly was right. All I have to say is that the chemo's I have had so far are not nearly as bad as the ones before. I don't know if you have heard of Xeloda I had it with Taxatere but I had a bad reaction as I usually do with every chemo. But anyway they have had really good results with Xeloda, I know girls on it for 2 years already so maybe you will be one of the lucky ones. good Luck and don't give up what ever you do because there is so much out there.

I am currently on abraxzin(sp. wrong), so I now have only trails ahead of me, so don't give up as long as you are a step ahead you are okay. My spread to my bones and liver which the liver keeps getting more tumors. Also Xolota has worked for alot of my friends with stage 4 and you still have alot of chemos ahead.
