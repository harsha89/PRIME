I found my cancer when I was scratching my breast.  I had a 2cm tumor very defined.  Easy to grab.  Mammogram missed it 6 months before.  At 48 I had gotten lazy on self examines.  I had lumpectomy and 2 lymp nodes removed.  4 rounds of chemo, and 61/2 weeks of radiation and I take tamoxifin because my cancer was estrogen +.  That was 2 years and 3 months ago since my last radiation treatment.    So far So good. Kimarie  Thankyou so much for responding; anything and everything positive makes me feel better!! My Mother is a very passive, quiet person who has always been a big worrier, so I am sort of the agressor in us.  I am learning so much so fast.  We are going to Foxchase Ca center in Philadelphia PA  for a second opinion, but if we can get into surgery first we will do the surgery asap.  So far so good is right, and I'll keep you in my prayers. Thanks again for the response, it makes me feel better to hear good news with this horredous disease.  I am a nurse and I have already started telling every female I come in contact with about the inaccuracy of these supposedly prophylact mammograms. ",

      "Content": "My 52year old mother is stg 2b  with 1+ lymph node 4.5cm in size!!!- had total R mastectomy in oct. 2007- had only a 1.5cm tumor in breast.  She found the lump in her r armpit and then they searched for the primary site, and that minimal tumor is her R duct was it!!  She has a low grade, ER/PR+ cancer and she is recieving chemo, radiation and then hormonal therapy.. I am a  new nurse practioner and I have been a nurse prior to that for years, worked in hospice for years. Chemo is the standard with any lymph node involvment-period.  Radiation is typically not used with a total mastectoy; but it all depends on the size of a tumor; she is warranted due to the size of her +lymphnode (4.5cm!!) which was not a mass or a tumor, just her enlarged, cancer ridden lymph node.  I took my Mother to foxchase ca center, hopkins and our local ephrata pa cancer center and they all gave the same dx, prognosis, and treatment regime- just possibly tweaking the chemo( 6 tx of 3 chemos- taxatere, adriamycin and cytoxan  all togehter vs. 4 tx of adriamycin and cytoxan together followed by 4 tx of taxotere alone, then radiation, and then hormonal therapy). This is to some considered the typical protocol, but to have benefits later, if God forbid there is a recurrence or mets- then to be benefited from xeloda or gemzar, you have to have been treated with these protocol chemo regimes.  Stg 2b is a good prognosis-I have all the hope and faith in the world that this will be a rather large bump in the road, get through it and enjoy another 20+ years together.  I don;t even want to be on this earth without my Mother at this time; that is where I am now!! I have researched EVERYTHING to the utmost and I think that a second opinion, as long as it doesn't hold up tx for long, is always important.  I also will take my Mother to the Mayo clinic in Jacksonville Florida if recurrence/mets occurs- I truly believe and am imformed they are one of the best. Eat broccoli, boast shakes, fresh fish, eliminate red meat ( their is a hormome in it-lehmans terms) and be positive.  Hope and pray for all the best for everyone!!! hang in there- you don't have pain and you have a good prognosis!!",

My mother is a very healthy 52yr old woman.  I just know that now in hindsight I wish that an MRI and an ultrasound had been done when her discharge started 2 years ago, even if possiby the CA was not there then.  Also just an FYI to all the women who read this :MY MOTHER'S CANCER DID NOT SHOW UP IN A MAMMOGRAM EVEN YESTERDAY!!!-even though the radiologist and we already knew it was there from the MRI of the breasts!! We need to push for yearly ultrasounds and at some point MRI of the breast for all high-risk breast CA women; the mammograms are not doing the job!!! Anyone with positive news ab breast CA- invasive ductal carcinoma with some positive lymph nodes involoved PLEASE!!! RESPOND!!.  My prayers go out to you and to everyone fighting this horrendous disease!!",

      "Content": "My mom was dx with stg 2B ductal carcinoma in Sept 07.  After mastectomy and removal of R armpit lymphnodes (she had only 1+ but it was 7cm in size!! That was how we/she found this cancer! the area in her breast was only 2cm in size and mammogram and Ultra sound did not show it- only breast MRI showed the primary breast cancer)...anyhow, after a mastectomy, 8 rounds of ATC chemo, and 36 radiation treatments, she is now on Tamoxifen (her cancer is ER/PR + and herceptin -); she has horrible pain every day!! She is 54 years old, and up until she got cancer was in great health. No smoke/drink, just works a physical job for U.S. Postal Service.  She had \"bad knees\" prior to the chemo/tamoxifen treatment- her Mom had a knee replacement and we figured sometime in her distant future she also would need knee replacements.  Now, she has such bad pain in her knees- just had cortisone shots with no effect, we will try another new, non-invasive shot/treatment, and then the only thing left to do is the knee replacements.  She also has pain in her back, and all her joints-supposedly from Tamoxifen-as that is a major side-effect of the Tamoxifen...But, she also had such bad pain in her R hip and through her lower back that she went over to the Cancer Center, and they did some bloodwork and an MRI of the area, prior to when her next scans/bloodwork were due.  MRI just showed Degenerative joint disease, and a fatty cyst like older tumor or area at her hip...So they referred her to ortho MD and physical therapy and gave her flexeril.  By the time we went to ortho, the pain was that bad she could barely walk/work, was using a cane, and was miserable with her pain! She is only 54 years old, walking with a horrible limp and a cane!!  I was so paranoid/worried sick that this was bone mets.  But, just had a PETS scan that was clear, and also a bone scan that was fine. Ortho said that the pain was from a pinched nerve in her back, and was shooting down her legs.  Said it was mainly from the degenerative joint disease....they referred her to pain mng.-who said it is her knees, and gave the cortisone shots about 3 weeks ago.  that is where we are now....but she is still in constant pain- always her \"bad knees\"- arthritis, but also through her hips, lower back and pelvis on an irregular basis.  2 years ago, prior to the treatment and being on tamoxifen, she had NO PAIN!!  I think it is part the tamoxifen, and part post-chemo.  Are you on tamoxifen, or an aramose-inhibitor?? How much chemo did you have? and whay type? Also, if you don't mind me asking generally what is your age? I pray for you, and hope your pain gets better!  Have you consulted with only one MD, who I guess is the one who told you this pain was/is from chemo.  When did you finish your chemo? I will watch for your message, take care and I will continue to think of you and include you in my thoughts and prayers!! Hang in there!! -Danielle",

Terms to know are things like ER+, ER-, and many others. The oncologist office should provide you with a book that informs about treatment options and side effects. Generally speaking in America chemo is the standard of care. I can't afford and didn't want to go elsewhere so I didn't do much research. China, Germany, France and Spain are countries that appear in internet articles a lot. I'm going to tell you about my chemo experience because I wish someone had told me. My intent of course is to reassure you. Some of what I say is scary but chemo and cancer are scary. Some people go through chemo with no problems but hair loss and fatigue. Losing the hair was nothing; I wore scarves or went bald when it was hot. Lots and lots of people continue to work during chemo. I am stage 3 ductal and invasive ductal with 18 positive nodes and my tumor was 96% ER+ ( estrogen receptor  positive). I am overweight, 64 and I have been in remission for a month. My age and weight probably increased my fatigue. I could not have worked for my first 7 days after  each chemo but could have worked the next 14 days until the next dose. I had 8 doses total so that would have been 8 weeks off work. Chemo was harsh but you will manage like all the rest of us if you have to do it. They give nausea meds so I was never sick. I did have cramps a lot. You have to take the nausea meds and they control them cramps too, so you won't have cramps either. Drink water!! Lots!! If you drink water you will be fine, if you don't you may irritate your bladder and intestinal track. I drank 50 to 64 ounces daily. Eat your protein so you can build muscle. I ate 50 to eighty protein grams daily. I got most of mine in milk whey powder shakes. I lost a lot of fat ( 52 pounds ) but no muscle. The weight loss was a choice because I only wanted fruit and milk. You will find the things you crave and create your own special menu's. I lost my toenails but it didn't hurt. They just got dry and flipped off. I've been off chemo 6 months and they have already grown back, along with my hair. Exercise is very important. Chemo was tough but the more you know and do, the easier it will be. Go to the american cancer Society on the web and start to study and find support groups. They are a big help. Good luck, Linda      Linda- I am curious- you are only stg III but had/have 18 positive lymphnodes??",

      "Content": "My mother finally got scheduled for her mastectomy and lympectomy on Oct 3- they did an initial core biopsy,( along with MRI, cat scan, pet scan bone scan and ultrasound/mammogram) on her mass she found in her R armpit.  Now they took 2 more core biopsies from her R breast and they both are also positive, which we expected because we know it has invaded out of the duct and into her breast and lymph.  The weird thing is they type your cancer- not only the type it is but they rate it with a number as to how agressive it is- the numbers start at #1 (low grade) and go up to at least 3-5 but it may be higher; I don't know that much about it yet.  Anyway my Mothers cancers is a type #1-or low grade on that scale, but yet it has invaded through her duct, into her breast and now into her lymph system ( which is the mass thankGod she found at her R armpit).  Pathology doesn't lie and it is a type one according to that, but even her surgeon said it is strange and \"not the norm\" for this type to move/spread locally to where it has, or at all.  This leads me to know/believe that she has had it for a LONG time, probably two years ago when that supposedly benign polyp was removed from a duct in her R breast, after she had a discharge from her R nipple, that the cancer may have been there or was at least starting then and missed.  It did not show up in a mammogram even 1 week ago when we knew it was there from the MRI and biopsies. What I don't understand with your case is this: what doctor with a medical degree, (and I am a nurse who has experience with a trauma unit, ER, nursing homes and hospice in-patient unit) would not immediately address a discharging nipple or questioning diagnosis concerening a breast with a patient with a maternal familiar history of breast CA.  Where do you live and are you now going to a cancer center or a surgeon?? I don't understand that they postponed your biopsy/extraction because something came up in your MRI, but then they used the terms something came up hot; that reminds me more of a PETS scan, and they would know when they spoke to you and a radiologist has already read your tests where the cancer/abnormal mass is- MRI's are very clear and they are a very good diagnostic tool, they could see from your MRI where a mass or abnormal cell production would be and if they where unsure they would have to biopsy that area.  Just live for the day, ask questions, be persistant.  Dont wait for anyone, or even an appointment.  Call and see if they can do anything earlier. I pray for you and every women with this horrific, deadly disease. Nothings fair!!!! Hope for you and my Mom I will think of and pray for!!",
