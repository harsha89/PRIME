    "Content": "Hi Everyone, My name is Annette and I'm new to this website. I just now had a blowup with my mother over the phone. It was one of those emotional release conversations, lots of crying and screaming.  She was diagnosed with metastatic stage 4 breast cancer about 2 months ago.  She had known she had a tumor in her breast for about 8 months and never went to a doctor. I ask myself why?!?! everyday, but it's killing me so I've stopped... I'm just so sad and mad and overwhelmed. I pull it together pretty well, but lately she's been in and out of the hospital and they keep finding things wrong with her...she seems so sickly lately it even changed her tone of voice.  I just want to hear stories of how other people deal with this. I write in my journal everyday and listen to music.  Lately I've been playing tourguide and devoted girlfriend and haven't had a minute to myself. I think that's why I had the breakdown on the phone.  Any input is greatly appreciated!  <3  Annie",
