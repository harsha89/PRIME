      "Content": "I'm wondering if anyone has come across anything recently that offers a really fresh or innovative perspective on breast cancer in the big-picture sense. My mother battled breast cancer and so far seems to have won since it was caught very early on and she proactively had a double mastectomy and has been cacner-free in the years since then. I, however, continue to be deeply affected by it even though she seems to have moved on. I have this nagging question: How can decades of awareness and research by the medical community still leave our very sickest patients (Stage IV) without effective treatments that don't do as much damage as the cancer itself? What is the entire medical community missing here? Sometimes I keep hoping that somehow they've just missed something really basic about what cancer even is. I keep researching, looking for answers, but so far have come up empty-handed. Does anyone out there have anything to offer that's different from the standard information? Looking forward to replies. -- Sherman Morrison",

      "Content": "Thanks to SpringFlowers and Nancy for contributing to this thread. SpringFlowers, wow, your message is both inspiring and eye-opening. I totally agree with you that just because we don\u2019t understand fully why a particular treatment works is not grounds for not using it or approving it so that others can benefit as well. As you said, everything to gain, nothing to lose, especially for late-stage patients. So I was surprised when I did run across something that represents just the kind of fresh perspective I have been looking for. There\u2019s a doctor by the name of Frank Arguello who has a whole different approach to what cancer is. Because in his approach he sees cancer cells as behaving more like the single-celled organisms from all life evolved, he\u2019s actually treating cancer with common antifungal and antibacterial drugs, and it\u2019s working! What I found was a series of before/after photographs of patients, mostly with late-stage breast cancer, who underwent his special treatments and found them to be very effective. Talk about inspiring some hope where there often feels like there is none! These photographs are pretty graphic in showing late-stage cancers, but it\u2019s worth looking at them to see his successes. I don\u2019t know of other oncologists who are willing to go that far in showing how confident they are about their treatments. The photos may be viewed at http://www.atavisticchemotherapy.com//content/cancer_treatme and the other areas of his website talk about what the treatments are based on and why they are working. I hope others find this information useful and view it as a source of hope!   Sherman Morrison",

      "Content": "Dear Vickie: I have to say at the start that I empathize with you! It's obviously a LOT to deal with, so it comes as no surprise that you're on an emotional roller coaster. When my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer years ago, I was in a state of shock for days. Then I kicked into gear and started doing some research. I was saddened by the lack of effective treatments for women in Stage IV. My sadness then turned into anger. After all, how could we still be so far from better treatments of late-stage cancers with decades of research from the medical community? My mother underwent a double mastectomy, which was successful in that she has been cancer free in the years that have passed since the surgery. However, every time I read a story like yours, I feel all the same feelings of powerlessness and anger that better solutions are still elusive. I continue my search for answers. If I come across anything that I think might be helpful for you and all the other brave women facing Stage IV breast cancer, I will be sure to post it here. In the meantime, stay strong and get the support you deserve to manage your ride on the emotional roller coaster. With best wishes -- Sherman Morrison",

      "Content": "Dear Vickie and the others who have replied to this thread: Reading the various replies that have come in to Vickie\u2019s original posting has been both difficult and rewarding. You are all such brave people in dealing with your Stage IV situation. It made me renew my efforts at finding better treatment alternatives out there people like you. What I came across was really very interesting and could offer something new for Stage IV patients. It\u2019s called Atavistic Oncology. Dr. Arguello is the oncologist who is developing this new direction in cancer treatment, and it really looks like it is worth checking out more fully. What I first found where a series of before/after photos of various patients who had all undergone his new style of treating even late-stage cancers. And he\u2019s doing it with common drugs that are already FDA approved. His approach is based on the idea that cancer cells are actually behaving more like single-celled organisms such as fungi and bacteria, which helps explain why they are so successful at reproducing and spreading. So he\u2019s treating cancer with antifunal and antibacterial drugs. What the photos show (and they are difficult to look at, at least for me) is amazing progress in patients struggling with even Stage IV cancers, and most of them are breast cancer. You can see these photos at http://www.atavisticchemotherapy.com//content/cancer_treatme I find this particularly helpful since most oncologists are not willing to show what effects their treatments really have on patients. You can also look at the other parts of his website that give more information on the basis of his innovative treatments and why they are working! My heart goes out to all of you, and I hope this might give many of you hope, or at least a new treatment option to explore!  Sherman Morrison",
