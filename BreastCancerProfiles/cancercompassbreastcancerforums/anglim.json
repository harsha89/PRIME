    "Content": "Has anyone been treated with Taxotere.  Was wondering what your side effects were?  I'm starting Feb 10th.  Did you have steroids to take for three days and or anti-nausea meds?  2004 I was diagnosed with stage 2b her2 positive, invasive bc.  I had a dbl masectomy.  After 4 months of Chemo I was clear for 3 years. Now it has metastasized to liver and both lungs.",
