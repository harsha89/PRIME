    "Content": "Despite what appears in the media, the majority of women with breast cancer DO NOT HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY. As for soy consumption, remember that women in Japan have a relatively low incidence of breast cancer despite a high intake of soy. Often that correlation led to people being encouraged to increase their consumption of soy products. As a Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist; I would recommend a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy products and lean proteins especially fish high in omega 3s. If you prefer to be a vegetarian that it fine too. Just educate yourself. It is best to rely on \"whole foods\" rather than tons of supplements. If you can afford organics, go for it. On a limited budget? There are places on the internet where they list the top 10 foods to spend the extra $$ on for organic (like berries which you can't really scrub...) good luck and lots of healing energy for a quick recovery. Consider yoga as part of your recovery.",
