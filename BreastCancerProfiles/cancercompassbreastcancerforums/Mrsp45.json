Have never found source of cancer in my breast. SO.................... absolutely have a breast MRI.I have also had a lump in my armpit for about a year now. It gets bigger and it hurts. I felt another lump in my left breast(same side as lump under arm). My dr sent my to my annual mammo and MRI, I also get an ultrasound with my history of dense breast tissue and cancer history in my family. I have no living relatives, they have all Passed from some from of cancer. My mom was only 50. I first saw the breast dr and she said she thought the lump under my arm was a fatty tissue. Confused because I'm not over weight and not indulged up there I believed her. At that point in May I was 5'3\" and 112 lbs. on the heavy side for me, normally weighting around 103-105. But w few meds I feel have had me put on weight. This past June I went for my annual breast testing. All came back ok. Her office called and said that she would see me in one year. Since than I have lost 15 lbs give or take totally unexplained! As of today I weigh in at 96 lbs. the armpit lump they thought was fatty I figured would \"go away\" it's fat right? Nope it's bigger! I have another lump under the same breast as the other lump before and it's different. It's harder and fixed. The right breast also seems to have a little lump. I generally feel crappy. But I figured it's the stress in my life and other issues medical I have. Yesterday I had an EMG on my left wrist because after a scaphoid break in my left hand it never healed and now my wrist has severely atrophied! The EMG dr determined my nerves were fine but that based on the fact he's done numerous EMG tests over the years on me that I seem to be \"wasting away\". In fact I had a consult for psychological to have a stimulator placed in my body for pain. I have severe RSD in my left foot. I doubt he'll recommend I get it because mentally I'm a mess! I'm a full time caregiver for my disabled husband who was blown up while in Iraq. It's exhausting! I spend 24/7 caring for him. I feel like I'm ignoring myself...... I have this fear I'll die young like my mother...... Should I push the breast dr to do a biopsy? Can they run bloodwork to see if I have maybe lymphoma? Anything? Or I just crazy?? Help I'm at a loss and any advice would help me at this point.",
