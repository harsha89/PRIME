    "Content": "Hi, I am 23 years old and have a family history of breast cancer. In January this year I noticed a change in my left breast. Being on the careful side due to my family history I went straight to my GP and was then referred to have an ultrasound. The results came back normal and was described as harden breast tissue and hormonal. It is now April and my left breast is now noticeably bigger than my right and the 'hardened tissue' can still be felt. I am wondering of there is anyone else at a similar age that has had similar symptoms and has been diagnosed with cancer? Elle",
