Lor Hi, I have been battling breast cancer and chemo related problems for the last year and can relate. I was told I was clean of my breast cancer w/o a pet scan being done.  I had severe reactions to many of the chemo drugs and doctor felt it would be in my best interest to stop chemo 3 sessions early.  I too, have been having severe bone pain and my stomache always seems to either be nauseas or in pain on my right side under my ribcage.  I was in the hopsital for several days for the pain that they  blamed on an obstructed bowel.  I started getting high blood pressure and edima and after finally having a pet scan ordered, they found another mass that is quite large behind my sternam and between my spine.  They believe it is cancer and are doing my biopsy next week.  Keep on your doctor about this,  I have no cancer markers in my blood, but neither did I when they found my stage 3 breast cancer.  Good luck and be persistant!!!",
