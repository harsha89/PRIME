    "Content": "Just saw your request....don't know what you decided but I'm sure you made the best decision for yourself. I had a double mastectomy with immediate tram flap reconstruction at age 68...almost two years ago. The recovery was no picnic ..longer than I anticipated probably my age and less than fit condition had something to do with that...I'd say 8 weeks.. I am very pleased with the results...though not perfect...some leakage after the surgery left a Scar and lump...but that's ok...only me and my health professionals and husband will ever notice! I think I look great....and my husband thinks so too..though he would have been happy with any decision I made. After we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary (a year ago) We decided moved to Maui...we sold almost everything and now we swim nearly everyday and are learning to play tennis! Good luck to you...I'm hoping and praying for a perfect fix whatever you decided. Mele Kamikimaka! Sue If I can be of any help please feel free to email me!",
