    "Content": "Hi. was diagnosed just recently. Starting my Chemo treatment tomorrow. My physician wants me to take Taxol. I have consulted another doctor online who reviewed my case and my biopsy reports, who specializes in the kind of tumors I have and he said that he would go with Taxotere as this is more common for my type of cancer mutation. I went back to my doctor and she was very unhappy with the fact I talked to other doctors. But on the other hand - she told me that both drugs are fine and its a \"trial and error\" process where we need to find to which drug my tumors reacts better. By the way - I didn't pay anything to the other doctor... I am on this app called BELONG for cancer patients. which is pretty cool. Anyhow - I don't like the fact that its a \"trial and error\"... but seems like in many other cases its how things are. Starting with Chemo X... not responding ? OK. Lets go to Chemo Y... but time is the one resource I assume I don't have enough of... How do you make a decision here ? How do you make your physician listen to other opinions and take them into consideration for real ? Thank you all.",
