How ling does the burn take to heal? The doctors say 6 weeks but not everything they say is accurate. Hoping he'll be fine once he passes that pain. Thanks The doctor is using his/her best estimate based on experience and statistics.  But each individual's experience will be different.   They should be paying attention to his pain and giving him whatever he needs to tolerate it.  This is especially important if he is not using a feeding tube, because in that case nutrition is tremendously important to his healing.  He needs lots of calories and lots of protein.
