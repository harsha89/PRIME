    "Content": "I had chemo, mastectomy, then radiation. My pain started 2 weeks into radiation. My ribs feel like they  have been injured in a car accident. They hurt all of the time. I can point to an area on my back on the side of my mastectomy that has a nagging, nawing kind of pain 24/7. Under that side shoulder blade feels like the tendons or muscles are being twisted and pulled on.  By afternoon I am so worn out from wrestling with the discomfort that I have been feeling all day. Oh, and my spine hurts. I've tried massage, acupuncture, lidocaine patches and they don't work for me. Currently taking 3 darvocets a day, 1200 mg of neurontin and ambien to sleep at night. Ice packs when in bed. These meds help me to function but my patience wears thin.  This has been going on for 1 year and 1 month. I am open to anything. I don't drink or smoke and have never tried drugs but at this point marijuana seems like an option. On a brighter note, I am thankful to be alive and here for my four boys, husband and aging mother.",
