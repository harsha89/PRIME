    "Content": "Hello all, I\u2019m with the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Our nation is facing a dire shortage of qualified oncology nurses. That is why we must take immediate action to educate and train nurses to meet the increasing need, or we will face nothing short of a crisis. That is why we have launched a grassroots advocacy campaign at www.ActNowEndBreastCancer.org where public can speak out. Will you join me? The number of cancer patients is expected to increase significantly over the next fifteen years. At the same time, the number of qualified nurses is projected to drop sharply. Thousands of qualified applicants are being turned away due to inadequate resources to train the next generation of nurses. These shortages will be felt by the most vulnerable - cancer patients. Please visit www.ActNowEndBreastCancer.org to send a letter to your members on Congress urging their support for increased funding for nursing programs. Thanks so much for your help, Amelia F. The Susan G. Komen Foundation",
