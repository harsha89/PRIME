    "Content": "I was taken off Neulasta because of severe pain that radiated in my back, chest and into the skull of my neck. I called the emergency on-call oncologist and he advised ibuprofen, which helped.  I was taken off Neulasta and placed on a series of seven Neupogen injections daily after chemo.  The neupogen caused pain in my knees that seemed to shift to my shin bones, feet or back.  I could control the discomfort with rest and Extra Strength Tylenol, or when it was bad, I took pain pills.  The pain and/or discomfort would last for a few hours...then subside to less discomfort.  Some times were worse than others. I would be alarmed with your symtoms, especially the numbness, and advise your doctor to do something about it or seek another opinion.  Maybe the seven injections I received were at a lower dose than the three that you are receiving.  You may ask about this. I am no longer on neupogen injections but continuing on one of my chemo drugs (Herceptin) until May of 2008.",
