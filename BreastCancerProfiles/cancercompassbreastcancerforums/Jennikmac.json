      "Content": "I would really like to see one of the experts reply to this topic.  Why would a doctor offer tamoxifen if there was no cancer diagnosis?  And furthermore ever refuse to do a biopsy on any \"palpable abnormality\"?  I was under the impression that was more of a medical term for \"I can feel a lump\".  Personally, I have no experience with cystic breasts so I am unfamiliar with any of its characteristics, and I really hope that is what this is.  Please let us know as those of us who reply are interested.  Those of us who urge you to get further testing done and sooner rather than later, do so not to scare you or encite panic, but rather because we know first hand the devastation that can be the result of waiting when we should have been more persistent.  I allowed a surgeon with 20yrs experience continually put me off and not do a biopsy because they were \"absolutely positive\" my lump was not cancer, I was too young, I was breastfeeding so it was just mastitis, or just an abcess, were the assurances they gave me.  I now have metastatic breast cancer. I am now leary of any assurances, without the cold hard evidence of a pathology report which only came from a biopsy, not a mammogram or ultrasound which I had and still yielded no definite answers. ",
