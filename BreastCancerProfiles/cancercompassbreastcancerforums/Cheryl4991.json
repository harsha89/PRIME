    "Content": "Appologies in advance this is a long posting as I am new to this site and am posting for the first time. I want to share some of my symptoms & diagnosis in the hopes of gaining some relief and helping myself as well as others. I was 33 years old when I found the tumor (borderline) stage 1 aggressive estrogen positive breast cancer. I had the tumor removed and was told that I had no positive sentinel lymph nodes. I was told to treat it aggressively and underwent chemotherapy (adrymyacin)and underwent radiation to the lymph nodes and breast tissue for several months after which I was placed on Tamoxifen. Except for an occassional mammogram and some simple blood work. I was written off as being in remission with a very positive outlook. December started with the loss of my oncologist (who moved on to brighter herizons)I resumed with a new oncologist at Dana Farber after a mamo and tests in June that showed nothing. I started having difficulty breathing during simple tasks in the summer. Also my stomach started to ache. Having had long time G.I. problems and asthma I wrote it off so I could enjoy the summer with my two children. Then about 4 weeks ago I developed overwhelming fatigue, pain and nausea. Most notably pain in my right side and back. I literally felt like I was quickly dying of malnutrition and anemia. Two and half years after the initial diagnosis I had an abdominal CAT scan and Ultrasound which showed unusual unnumerable shaped tumors in my liver some large some small. The preliminary biopsy showed that it is cancer although it is not confirmed whether it is breast or estrogen positive yet. I am scheduled to start chemo tomorrow and would love feed back on various types of treatments. Also to combat the malnutrition end of things I have noticed that even though food has absolutely no appeal to me. That if I can force the 1st few bites in I tend to feel somewhat better. I have tried to make wise decisions as to what to eat to make me feel better. If I feel weak and tired I usually try iron vitamin c, b and D. Amazingly enough this seemed to help. I also found that sitting in the sun for a few minutes each day helped me feel better (this may sound a little crazy) I have even taken to exposing my abodomen for short periods of time. It may have to do with the vitamin D and C are processed in the liver. I am not a doctor but I feel whatever works for you is best if you listen to your body it will tell you what it needs. The other thing I have done is literally force myself to get up and move. I have been trying to exercise every chance I get. I find this helps greatly with the gas, bloating and constipation. I have encouraged others to force me to do this so that I don't become a lump with no muscle mass. Believe me it is not easy and I struggle every day with it. A great book if you can get your hands on it is a nutrion book called Nutrition for Life by Lisa Hark, Ph.D & Darwin Deen,MD. It is very extensive with information on everything for everyone. It has a section that deals specifically with cancer but I have found it extremely helpful it figuring out what nutrients my body maybe lacking. It is published by DK. If anyone has any other tips that would be helpful in reliving the G.I. symptoms caused by swelling in the liver I would love to hear from you.",
