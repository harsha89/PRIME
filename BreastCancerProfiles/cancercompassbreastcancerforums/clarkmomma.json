    "Content": "  Hopefully by now, you will have gotten more info that you need, but in case you didnt, here is a good point to start http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/CRI_2_3x.asp?dt=28 a good and dear friend of mine fought off breast cancer.  He said the hardest thing was having a disease that is so normally associated with women. Kinda stung his male pride I think. He developed a good sense of humor about it though and recently wore a pink t shirt to his FINAL chemo treatment! He is doing amazingly well, considering the outlook was none to bright for him at first as it had gotten into his lymph nodes.   All the best for you and your hubby, Stacey",
