      "Content": "Thank you SpringFlowers! I am recovering well from the lung collapse. There is a spot on that lung they are watching closely, however. There is a lot of scar tissue due to the surgiery in that area, including two chest tubes (for 21 days). But, I cannot complain and take it one day at a time. Yoga and deep breathing help a lot. Just had fresh apple / carrot juice with a touch of ginger for breakfast. Yum!",

      "Content": "Hi tambrown72, I was on  Taxotere and Cytoxan for 8 cycles (six months). Both drugs attack the immune system. I received Neulasta shots to boost my WBC count. Even with the shots, my WBC counts were steadily getting lower, but still within normal range. My oncologist explained that Neulasta has saved the lives of many patients who would have otherwise crashed on this extremely virulent therapy.  At the same time I was taking herbal supplements, accupuncture, relaxation and massage therapy. In addition, I was on a low fat diet with whole grains, juicing and berry smoothies. I trust you are hanging in there and looking into all possible avenues of care...Best,",

      "Content": "@SpringFlowers, Your reply really touched me, because I have also had bad experiences with doctors. I nearly had unnecessary surgery. And, one doctor wanted to do surgery, even though I was not a candidate at the time, which was why he and his team did not want me to consult with my doctor. It is true, that one must careful to choose a practitioner that you feel you can trust. However, as you said, at the end of the day, you are responsible for your health. Electing to take chemo was a hard decision that I had to pray about. I worked at a cancer hospital for a breast oncologist (go figure) many years ago. I saw so many of his patients \"crash\" during, before or right after chemo. That was in the late 80s, early 90s. I was suprised that the drugs have not changed very much. However, the management of side effects have. I had massage therapy and accupuncture during infusions and in between. Herbal supplements and lots of good food. A nutritionist said something very interesting when I first met with her. She emphasized the importance of nutrition, because malnutrion is a matter of life and death for cancer patients.  In spite of the disease, I guess we still are what we eat. I have done a lot of research to make sure I am not feeding the cancer and giving my body a fighting chance. I have food lists of things to avoid and cancer fighting foods. I worked very closely with my naturopath, making recommendations for myself and consulting with her to make sure there were no contraindications. For example, I wanted to take priobiotics for about six weeks to rebuild my colonic bacteria. I wanted to take iron to build my blood. We agreed that one pill three times a week should do it. Now my Hg and Hct are in the normal range and I am pretty regular in the elimination department. It is hard to be positive when the doctor gives you news that makes you want to run for the hills. But, when I wake up every morning, it must be for a reason and that reason keeps me fighting! Thanks,",

      "Content": "I also was diagnosed with Stage IV Breast Cancer in 2010. After nutritional / wholistic/ naturopathic treatments with chemotherapy and currently on Aromasin, I am doing much better. Lung collapsed in 2011 and had pleurodesis. Lots of scar tissue to deal with because of the issue with the lung, breast and chest wall. However, blood tests for 2/12 are great. CA-15-3 is at 14.8, down from 42 in 2011 and CA27-29 was 55 in 2011. Sixth month on Aromasin which continued to shrink the cancer, so that it is not detectable on PET scan. There is a spot on my lung that they are watching closely, but, it may very well be scar tissue. Mets is gone. I believe in God. I believe that \"positivity kills cancer.\" Hang in there and do not give up.  ",

      "Content": "Yes Spring Flowers, I experienced the slide card/tab, cookie cutter approach to cancer care. The first surgeon that did the biopsy refused to release my records to my primary doctor. His staff member insisted I come in for an additional consult first. I decided I did not want to deal with a surgeon could so casually withhold vital info. The lady on the phone said, \"you should come in it's very important!\" Duh! I have advanced breast cancer! LOL!I caled patient advocacy line at the hospital, they called the surgeon, but seemed helpless. In the interim, my condition worsened. When I had my second consult at a well known hospital in Center City, the surgeon released the records. My second surgical consult and first oncology consult. The surgeon wanted to perform \"palliative surgery\" and then the oncologists would give me the chemotherapy. They seemed so excited to get going (probably trying out a new drug). At the same time, they were not showing any concern for me as a person or explaining the risks involved. They acted like I was too stupid to comprehend what was going on, or to detect their coldly clinical approach to my situation.  They expressed suprise at how heathly I was despite my diagnosis. Juicing and herbal treatments (and most definitely prayer) was the reason for that. I told them that I did not want chemotherapy. That upset them very much and so they scheduled a meeting with me. Up until then my family was not around, but they showed up in force for this meeting. Which, obviously was when the team was going to try to scare me into treatment. Like having cancer isn't the scariest thing a person could experience?!  Anyhow, I did not let them treatment me. I continued with holistic medical treatments. Which were working, but not aggressively enough againsth the hyperaggressive cancer. So after praying about it, I agreed to chemo and the rest that story is on this thread somewhere. Well, that you for sharing because it has been very informative. I am still pro-holistic medicine. But, I have learned that you have to be opened minded. However, it is so important to pick clinicians that you feel comfortable with and that understands how your mind works. I was hospitalized in Md when my lung collapsed> My primary doctors is in DC and he took me to the ER from his office. The oncologist there was the first person who understood me and gave me a chance to digest what was going on, she also saw to it that I was given copies of all of my records. My CTCA oncologist also explained the treatment options, gave me a  package with info about the various options and the drugs, its side effects and what it does. He also gave me my blood tests and others results. Then he asked that I get back to him with a decision when I am ready. I think you should get as many opinions as you can before deciding what to, plus it is very important to feel comfortable with your doctor.  Fortunately, my primary doctor is the old fashioned type. Both of my doctors are over 60, hmmm...",
