    "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 8 years ago and has one breast removed as well as completing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The cancer had gone away but in the past two weeks a tumor was found on one of her ovaries. After having surgery to remove the tumor (which burst during surgery) they now believe she has ovarian cancer. Although the pathologist seems to feel that it may be breast cancer again. We won't know for 3 weeks. I'm looking for stories about women approximately her age (57) that have had breast cancer and survived, and then had ovarian cancer. We are looking for advice, stories, hope, anything! thank you! Also, I am a 28 year old woman and now wondering what steps i should consider taking in preventing this for myself.",
