      "Content": "Hello, I am new to the site. To make a long story short I had breast cancer stage II in 2003 right breast, bi-laderal mastocomy, no nodes involved (they thought) no chemo or radiation or hormone treatment. May 2005 had a sore lymph node, had 3 nodes w/tissue removed. All had cancer. Had 4 A/C and 4 Taxol chemo session done. Then 19 lymph nodes and fatty tissue removed from under my right arm. All came back clear. Now they want to do radiation on my right chest which scares the heck out of me and then put me on Arimidex instead of Tamoxifin since they think the chemo put me into menapause. Tamoxifin scared me in the first place but now reading about the crippling affects of Arimidex! Is there any hope out there? Jill",

Just type in Jill Harrigan Record Eagle and it should take you to her columns. She also has an email address if you care to email her on the bottom of the page. She will talk with anyone about what she has gone through. Keep going, Gary",
