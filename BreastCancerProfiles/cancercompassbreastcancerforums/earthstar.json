    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy early in November, followed by 10 sessions of brachytherapy with a Mammosite catheter. Everything went smoothly. Now I have developed some edema in the same breast. My doc also says we'll watch it. It's not uncomfortable yet, but will a sports bra keep it from getting worse? Does activity (raking, working out) make it better or worse? Thanks for being there.",
