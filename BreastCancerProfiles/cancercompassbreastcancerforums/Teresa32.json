      "Content": "I have been taking Femara for almost 3 years. My oncologist feels his patients have fewer joint/bone pain problems with it as compared to other aromatase inhibitors. I have had pain, especially first thing in the morning. It seems to go away during the day. I think exercising, walking and light strength training, helps me have less pain. I can put up with the pain, since it seems to be keeping my cancer from reoccuring. I have a friend who just started it and has no join pain. Good luck. Glad your oncologist is willing to work with you.",

      "Content": "You need to seek a second opinion on your case and follow-up!!! Much of what is done depends on whether your cancer was estrogen receptor positive or negative. There is a cancer test that my oncologist uses every visit CA27-29. I believe there is some difference of opinion on whether it is a valuable test or not, but my oncologist is always happy when my \"number\" is in what he considers the good range. Please don't just accept what you think may be substandard care. You are the one who must advocate for yourself. You need to have confidence in your care givers. Go find the best Dr. you can. Do you know anyone else who has had breast cancer? Ask for a recommendation. I wish you the best.",
