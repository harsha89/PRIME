    "Content": "I am sorry to read of your well justified concern following this very big surgery.  Would you consider seeking another opinion about the situation? Twelve years ago Mum had a masectomy as a result of an invasive carcinoma in her left breast.  She was given the all clear on her lymph nodes, but still was offered to have chemo if she wanted.  Mum chose not to have any treatment at that point and continue her regulary check ups.  After three years a small lump was found on the chest wall - the same side as the masectomy.  Mum never had reconstructive surgery which turned out to be a good thing because who knows whether that lump wuld have been found so easily if she had opted for reconstruction.  After this occurrence Mum had radium treatment to that area of her body and because the lump was oestrogen receptive they advised the removal of her ovaries.  Sven years after this the cancer returned in the form of secondaries.  What I have gleaned from reading the journey of others on this site, is that it is important to seek another opinion and keep asking questions.  A friend of mine who had breast cancer but was able to have a lumpectomy rather than the whole lot removed was told by her doctor that there are a million cancer cells on a pin head and he advised her to have chemo following the lumpectomy - even though they went in twice to get clear margins.  Do take care of yourself and I hope you are able to get some advice you feel more comfortable about.",
