      "Content": "I went to see my GYN to talk about recurring endometriosis and wasn't exspecting her to find an enlarged lymph node.She said it is 1-2 cm.I call tom. to get an appt. for my first mammogram.This is very concerning.2 months ago I was dx. with fibromyalgia.My pain was mainly in my right ribs,that is the same side the lump is.There is pain there all the time. Can cancer start out this way?Has anyone had cancer in the lymph nodes under the arms. I am worried mainly cause I have been very sick for several months which I do believe is fibromyalgia but I can't help but wonder does this pain in my right rib have any connection to this enlarged lymph node. Oh , she said it was mobile.Is that a good thing? I sure hope so. Thanks for any advice. SHeila",
