    "Content": "Hi, my friend has cancer and it started in her right breast and spread to her liver and right lung. She has been having chemo since the week after she found out which was only August 6th 2006. It had already spread to all of these other places and then she found out it was in her lymph nodes as well. She has been so strong and has been fighting so hard. She has been in the hospital 4 times already and had her lung collapse, chest tube stitches burst and fluid drained off 3 times. (her lung) Yet, she is amazing!!!!Still going strong and fighting very hard and functioning daily as normal except for weakness some days. She had one very bad week right after her second chemo and since then has done so well. My concern is at the moment, that her cancer growth has stopped, but is not shrinking at all. The doctors have now put her on a new chemo once a week for 3weeks then off for a week. More agressive to try and shrink it in her breast. Then they want to remove her breast. I am just wondering if any one knows much about this type of cancer, she is only 37 and is at 110 for her weight. She was 145 in May and by August, she had gone down to 135. Now she has lost more. I want honest and up front information that I can use for her husbands benefit and for my family's. You see, she is the mother of my two stepchildren, hence hte screenname, I chose, \"Oddcouple\" because thats kind of what we are. Please if you have any information to share or ideas on how to better help her or even bad news and rough times stories to tell, let me know,We are trying to help her AND prepare for whatever is in stoe at the same time. Thanks, K",
