      "Content": "  On 2/27/2008 Linda Lou wrote: Hi Mietie, I take Femara after taking Tamoxofin for two years after treatment.  So far, now 5 years out from treatment, I am cancer free.  Most likely, you probably won't experience hair loss from the Femara.  I did, but I understand the chances are low.  My hair was almost to my shoulders again after chemo.  When I started Femara, I had a slow thinning and loss of lustre of my hair.  It got bad enough that I had to get a short haircut again, which I wasn't happy about.  But, my body must be adjusting to the Femara, because my hair is growing back in and is almost back to normal, not quite, but good enough!  My breast cancer is hormone receptor positive.  Your's must be both negative and positive?...because of taking Herceptin and then Femara??? Don't worry too much about the chance of hair loss with Femara...it probably won't happen to you...even if it did...we are still here.  Best of luck to you with your treatment.  Keep your chin up and enjoy every day with or without hair. Best Regards, Linda Lou Thanks Linda for the quick response.  it is not so much loss of hair I am worried about; I do not have my hair back yet after chemo - it did not even start to come back as I am still suffering of the effects of the Taxol I had - I just wonder if it will have a chance to come back with having to start on the Femara immediately.  I know it is for the best: my tumour was oestrogen, progesteron and HR  (  is that what it is called, I am not sure!) receptive and it was the second time I had it, but the idea of never getting my hair back is very unattractive as I can not wear a wig without getting a headache.  I suppose I'll just have to wait and see and hope for the best.  At least your hair came back when still being on treatment and that gives me hope. Take care of yourself, and thank you again for finding the time to think about me,  all the very best, Annemarie  ",

      "Content": "I just completed 4 months of chemotherapy, am still getting Herceptin till the end of November and have now been told to start on Femara.  With the chemo I lost all my body hair; the NHS did not provide any information about the possibilty to prevent that.  At the moment some of the hair - lashes, eyebrows - is starting to return, but when I collected my Femara I noticed that one of the side effects is hair loss too.  Will that mean that I will not get my hair back at all? ( I have been told that I will probably be on medication for the rest of my life). ",
