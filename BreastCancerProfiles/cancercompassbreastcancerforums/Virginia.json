    "Content": "Dear Tammy, I'll keep you in my prayers. Last year my one sister was dealing with metastatic breast cancer, the other sister with a rare sarcoma, and my best friend with pancreatic cancer. My sisters are still with us, but my friend Stephanie died peacefully after a valiant fight of 10 months. My mom is a two-time cancer survivor. My mom is an R.N. She says: \"Live long enough and you get cancer.\" But your parents seem young, just like my sister and best friend who were all in their 40s. It sounds like you need to do a family history to ascertain how this will affect your own health and that of your brother. It could be an environmental factor, life stresses, genetics or some combination. Since you are on this website, I know you are taking charge by becoming informed. My sisters are still here because they went to cancer treatment centers (OSU in Columbus, Ohio and Baptist Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida). My friend Stephanie went to the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. If we had only known about them sooner, she might have gotten positron beam radiation and a longer lease on life. Bottom line: giving you a guess at life expectancy for your parents is just that, a guess. Don't be afraid to recommend a clinical trial to your parents. Should they find one at the Nationcal Cancer Institute, the only cost is getting them there. Everything else is paid for. Hope some of this helps. Virginia",
