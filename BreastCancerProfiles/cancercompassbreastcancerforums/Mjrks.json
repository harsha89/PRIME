    "Content": "Hi, After 2 years on Tamoxifen, my oncologist recommended switching to Exemestane based on recent clinical studies. I've been taking it since mid-May and noticed shortly after that I began to have stiff and achey feet, and this has since spread to include my ankles and knees. It's particularly worse at the beginning of the day. After I've been mobile the symptoms seem to lessen, but if I'm sitting still for an hour or more, my feet and knees will stiffen up again. I will inform my oncologist about this at my next visit. When I was on Tamoxifen, I didn't have any joint pain, but I would get the most incredibly painful muscle cramps in my toes and calves. So far I haven't had to use any painkillers. Guess it's a bit of a toss-up - muscle cramps or join pain.",
