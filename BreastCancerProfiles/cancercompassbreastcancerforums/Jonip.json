    "Content": "I was on arimidex for a year and began suffering severe bone pain in my knee joints and in my hands....so the ONC switched me to Arimidex, and while it seemed slightly better for a month or so, it is back again to being very painful....now the suggestion is Celebrex...however I see no reason to take another $200.00 a month medicine to counter the effects of a medicine that is supposed to help prevent the return of cancer....what happens if I stay off all medicine. Am I tempting fate. I was lucky first time, the lumpectomy seemed to have gotten it all and I had radiation and no chemo (it had not gotten into my Lymph nodes) but because I was estrogen positve I was told I needed to be on something for 5 years!!!...I feel worse now that before the surgery....any thoughts out there???
