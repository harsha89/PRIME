You are all so brave to come off the medication.  I am in my 6th year on Aromasin, having had a lumpectomy and radiation in 2005, no spread to lymph nodes.  if I stopped Aromasin I would be terrified the cancer would come back.  My doctor says I should take it for at least 10 years as I tolerate it quite well compared to many women.  I have put on 10 kgs since start of treatment, have alot of the side effects mentioned but nothing too debilitating, poor bone mass and joint pain, chronic insomnia, hair thinner.  Weight gain bothers me the most as I was always so slim and proud of my figure.  If anything would make me stop taking Aromasine it would be that but I know I will not stop it.  You're a braver woman than me if you do.  Tell me what you decide.   ",
