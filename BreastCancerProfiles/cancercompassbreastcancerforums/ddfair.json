      "Content": "The reason you would not have a lawsuit is because you would have to show a connection between your use of estrogen and developing a cancer that was estrogen dependant(estrogen positive receptors) However, if there were enough scientific evidence to support that we would have already seen millions of successful lawsuits years ago.  Bad things happen in life and we can't always find someone or something to blame or to sue.  Fact is one out of every three women will get cancer in her lifetime and one out of every two men. We already got it so we can cross that off our to do list.",
