    "Content": "While I do not have breast cancer, I DO take Zometa for bone metastasis.  It has helped GREATLY with the bone pain.  I, like you, did not like the side effects that were listed on the drug info.  However, I did notice that I began to bruise VERY easily and my skin would get blood blisters and sting a lot when that happened.  My onco said it was not related to the Zometa (of course), but I decided to take myself off of it.  I only made it about 2 months when I called them begging to have another infusion.  I wish there was an alternate to Zometa so I too am interested in hearing what others may offer on this subject.  Good luck to you!  By the way, I take Zometa every 2 months now (it had been monthly prior to that).
