    "Content": "When I had to have the dye injected for the snb I was in a room with a male tech and no nurse to hold my hand. This guy had no compassion for what I was about to go through and I was not offered anything for the horrible pain that I had to go thru. I was crying it was so painful and I let my surgeon know that procedure needs to be changed and there should be a nurse in there to hold my hand at the very least! Now I may be facing this procedure a second time because my mammo showed something along my scar from my first quadectomy!",
