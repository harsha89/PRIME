    "Content": "After 7 years, recent xray for rib pain lead to a chest CT scan and bone scan which revealed a number of fairly small mets locations on rib, spine, skull, collar bone, pelvic bone and one nodular in left lung. Had biopsy of lung nodular yesterday and mtg with onc in a couple of days to discuss treatment. I panicked at first, started hearing the clock ticking. Until I viewed the scan images myself and also read some of the postings here from you amazing survivors. So I'm gearing up for a fight. Any suggestions regarding treatment options? What's worked, what hasn't. Anyone with this particular combination of mets? Should I be concerned about other possible mets in liver or elsewhere in body?
