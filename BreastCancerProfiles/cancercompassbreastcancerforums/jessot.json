      "Content": "Hi Andij, I'm new on this site and want to share my experience with Arimidex.   Like you, this May will be my 12th month on this drug.  So far, no one that have seen me would ever suspect that I was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer.   I can do my daily activities, no hair loss, no nausea, no fatigue and no joint pain.   This is what I take daily, 9Kmg. Vit. C; 3 500mg. of B-17; 500 mg. of Iodoral; 8oz. of Ensure or Boost; Minerals such as Boron, Zinc, Strontium, Calcium, Manganese, Magnerium, Potassium, Vit. D3, Vit. K2, Copper; Krill; Turmeric; MSM; 11 grams of Hydrolyzed Collagen(very good for your bones, hair, nails and skin).   Added to this, I have been taking IP6-Inositol 24 capsules a day on empty stomach and today, will be my 6th week.  Would like to ask Dr. Kim if I should continue with this IP6 & Inositol or rest for a month first.   I do light exercises on my arms and legs and I sleep soundly. My only complaint is I am having cognitive dysfunction. My breast cancer is estrogen receptor related kind.   I started with a large mass on my right breast and now it has shrunk to almost half the size.  What helps me with the shrinkage is I apply daily DMSO on the tumor itself. Google search everything I take and see if you think you this will work for you.  BTW, I still take Arimidex.",

      "Content": "Hi jacru,  I would speak highly in taking IP6-INOSITOL by Cell Forte.  I've been taking 24 capsules a day as advised by Dr. A. Shamsuddin.   After just 3 weeks in this IP6, the cancer marker from my blood test went down from 32 to 18.   I am now on my 8 weeks and I can do my daily activities with no pain whatsoever.   The Arimidex that I've een taking since May 2016, had shown vey little decline in the cancer marker and I dread the fact that it affects negatively  my cognitive function. Stay well.",
