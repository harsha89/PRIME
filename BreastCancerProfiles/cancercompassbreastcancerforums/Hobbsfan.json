      "Content": "My dad was diagnosed with grade 4 glioblastoma. Had the surgery last June, been struggling to get off of the decadron ever since. Currently he is at the Spaulding Rehab in Cambridge, but it has been a month now and he is still struggling to walk. I'm looking to find an alternative to decadron for him to try. Any help at all is appreciated and encouraged thanks",
