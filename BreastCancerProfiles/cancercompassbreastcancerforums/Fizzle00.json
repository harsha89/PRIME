    "Content": "Yes I had breast cancer and three lumps on my breast that were between 3 and 5mm and they did not find them through mammogram.  I had to have a breast MRI to locate the lumps.  My breast cancer was found by accident when I went in with kidney stones and they saw a shadow on my liver and found that I had a tumor on my liver which was from breast cancer and the cancer cells had traveled to my liver.  If it wasnt for a case of kidney stones, my cancer may have never been found.",
