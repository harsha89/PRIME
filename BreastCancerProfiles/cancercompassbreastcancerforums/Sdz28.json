    "Content": "Dear Dixie, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July, 2004. I had a lumpectomy (no lymph node involvement) with a follow-up course of radiation. In answer to your questions: 1. Since you found out you had breast cancer, have you ever asked yourself, why me? If so, what were your conclusions? Oddly enough, no, I never thought why me? I attribute this to not being really shocked at having cancer since my mother died of breast cancer at age 36. I have more or less expected (not in a morbid way), that I'd probably get it too. I do remember feeling as if I was in a \"vacuum\" when I received the results of the biopsy, so many thoughts run through your head. 2. Since my diagnosis, I have made the following changes in my life: I try to keep a healthy mental balance but I do try to live more for today. And I have had a will drawn up and made certain arrangements that we all tend to put off. 3. The most important being: That I find myself less inclined to commit to a long-term committed relationship... probably because I don't want to put anyone through what I saw my father go through with my mother. 4. When asked what the meaning of my illness is, I would answer: I see it as a \"wake-up call\" to stop worrying so much about the day-to-day \"crises\" and take some time to smell the roses. A brush with death is a powerful motivator to live life to the fullest while you can.",
