    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in July 2003, then radiation for 6 weeks. My breast has been swollen and tender ever since the radiation. About a month ago I started leaking from the nipple. I have even noticed a few drops of blood. I saw my oncologist and he put me on antibiotics for 10 days. Then he sent me back to my surgeon to see if I would have to have more surgery (breast removal). My surgeon is going to wait a month to see if it clears up. He said because the breast tissue has become so hard that the only thing he can do is remove the breast. This is not what I wanted to hear. Has anyone out there had this problem? I appreciate anyone responding. Jan",
