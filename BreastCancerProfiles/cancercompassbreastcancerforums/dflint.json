    "Content": "I am also cycling through the available AI's.  I'm surprised to read how many people have torn meniscus in their knees with these drugs.  I suspect the tear may have been there, but the pain is increased on the AI's.  I've gone from regular exercising to one lap around the block due to hip and knee pain.  I see a Naturopath who gave me Modified Citrus Pectin to reduce the chances of metastasis and ECGC (green tea extract) and also recommends DIM to reduce your estrogen levels.  Its definitely wortth seeking out a Naturopath.  I'm not feeling optimistic about Tamoxifen, but that is probably what will be recommended next.",
