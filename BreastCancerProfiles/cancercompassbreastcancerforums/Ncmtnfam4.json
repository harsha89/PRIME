      "Content": "On July 10,2006 my mother lost her battle to breast cancer. I was by her side til her last breath. This was the hardest thing i had to face, But i had to be by her side til she went to be with the Lord Jesus. I had greived over this inevietable event for many months. My mother was first dx in 1995 it spread to eye bone and ? on liver in 2001 she continued treatment and was ok until sept 2005 it went to the sack of the heart. This scared us tremendosly but drs still felt chemo would help after she underwent surgery for heart window to drain fluid. Then the first of june she started getting weak and short of breath. Drs almost sent her home from hospital check saying couldn't find reason. We pushed them for further tests and it showed the cancer spread through out both lungs and liver was swelled. 1 mo later she passed. Thank God for the answered prayer she didn't suffer pain. Just weaker and weaker. I didn't want to give her up but the night before she passed i asked God if it was his will, to please take her so she wouldn't lay there suffering. That was so hard But i have no doubts she is with Jesus and it better off. its just hard to think of living my life without her. we talked everyday sometimes several times a day. May God bring Peace to all who have lost loved ones to this dreadful diesese.",
