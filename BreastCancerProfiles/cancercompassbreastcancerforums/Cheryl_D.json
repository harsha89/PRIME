    "Content": "Dear AJ, Sorry about your mother-in-law. When you're researching remember that bone and lung mets is treated differently than primary lung or bone cancer. I don't know how extensive hers is. I have breast ca. with mets to the bone and lungs. I have had a great response to a combination of Femara (pill) and Zometa with is given intravenously once a month. Some of the nodules in my lung have gone away and it has so far kept the bone from spreading. Good luck.",
