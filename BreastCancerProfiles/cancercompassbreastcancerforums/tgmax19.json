    "Content": "I'm new also. I've been on Arimidex for the past 8 years and I am noticing changes. My legs and shoulder have been killing me in the last 6 months. A friend of mine who has had breast cancer twice confirmed my suspicions. She takes Arimidex and had been told side effects happen after long use. Please don't stop taking it. It is a lifesaver. I have stage 4 breast cancer in the bone since 2004. It's dormant and staying at bay. I'm crediting the Arimidex for this miracle. Will take the pain if I can keep on going.",
