      "Content": "Hi to Everyone Who has Responded Here:   I want to thank everyone for their kind support and information. Due to other issues I was unable to return here until now.   However, I want to give you an update:   After her bilateral mastectomy (with reconstruction the same day), my wife had the chemo treatments. She kept her hair until the third (of four) treatments\u2026 then it started to come out\u2026She did a couple short hair cuts (She\u2019d had long hair since 9 and wanted to try a couple shorter looks) for a few days\u2026 Then we had a \u201cGI Jane party\u201d \u2013 we rented the movie and watched it while she and Demi Moore got shaved. Due to the recent surgery, one armed push-ups were out of the question\u2026.    She bought a very nice wig, but only wore it once. The rest of the time she wore berets \u2013 very stylist I might add. About six weeks after her last treatment her eyelashes fell out \u2013 she was very bummed-out because she thought all the \u201cloosing\u201d was over. However, they are growing back pretty quickly. Her hair is also coming back \u2013 mostly black with a few \u201cgreys\u201d for wisdom.   One night, after listening to her obsess about her hair, I asked her why, given every thing that was happening, was losing her hair so important. She stopped, wiped her tears, looked at me and said, \u201cIts so much easier to worry about my hair than it is worrying about dying.\u201d After that, I never questioned her \u201cworrying priorities\u201d.   Farah truly has been an inspiration to me and our two young children. She has made difficult decisions wisely, and has kept an incredibly positive attitude throughout. With a few exceptions (days 2-4 after treatments when she was quite tired) she has gone to the gym everyday (she\u2019s done this for the last 28 years) \u2013 rather than run, she walked on the treadmill. Now she is back 100%, except for pectoral muscle-related exercises (i.e. pushups). She has been kind to her caregivers and supportive of all the other patients at the cancer center.   Bravely, she has returned to her modeling profession (she is an artist model (often nude)) with great support from the artists (mostly women)  -  This was huge for her. In my eyes she is more beautiful than ever.   Tomorrow she is going back in to get nipples. She is very happy about this, as she sees it as the completion of the surgical process.   She will continue with Tomoxifin for the next five years. So far, she has had no ill-effects.   This is only one experience. But I wanted to share it with others.   My prayers and best wishes to all, Jim",

      "Content": "My beautiful 48 year old wife just had a bilateral mastectomy. On the oncologist's recomendation she is going to undergo Cytoxan and Taxotere therapy (4 treatments at 3 week intervals). Among other things, she is concerned with hair loss... if she is going to lose it she  wants to act proactively -  cut it off first- donate her hair -  shave her head- have it henna \"tattooed\" and wear it proudly....   This is clearly about her keeping control of her life, her appearance and her femininity. her first choice, of course, is to keep her hair. She asked me to come on line and find out what she should expect as far as hair loss goes... does anyone know what percentage of women on this therapy regime experience hair loss?  Bless you all, a loving husband",
