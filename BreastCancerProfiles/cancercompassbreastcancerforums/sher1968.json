    "Content": "Hi I had a lumpectomy with intraoperative radiation about 4 weeks ago, since then I have had slight fevers with excessive drainage.  I went to a clinic over a week ago and was found to have an infection and was started on a high dose antibiotic.  After a few days my incision suddenly exploded with foul smelling, yellow, slightly blood tinged drainage.  I believe that it was the infection coming out.  Since then I have a hole in my incision that is not healing, I have had to delay my port placement and chemo already and I am afraid to have it postponed again.  I was diagnosed with invasive mammary carcinoma, and I am terrified of chemo and if anyone else has gone through any of this has any advice I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.",
