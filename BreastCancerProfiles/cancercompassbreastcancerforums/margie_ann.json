    "Content": "Hello Everyone!  I just started Aromasin in Sept 09 and am just starting to feel its effects so thought I'd get on the computer and see if I could find more detailed side effects and found this site!  Dr. told me I may have joint pain and should take conglusamine. I'm still getting stiff. Especially if I've sat for a while then get up, My neck & knees especially are stiff. My question is has anyone noticed being lathargic, depressed or overwhelmed? I cover 4 counties in my job and receive a lot of emails. I'm starting to feel \"scattered\" in my thinking. I already take a generic synthroid and an anti-anxiety & depressing pills..altho all are low mg's. Appreciate everyone's thoughts.. ",
