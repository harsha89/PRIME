      "Content": "Thank you for posting. I hope you feel like yourself real soon! I, too, am scared of not taking it. But I feel the quality of life is more important than than the quantity of life. As, I said before, it seems I have NO life now with these side effects after being on it for so long. My eye sight is also affected, and my prescription needs to be changed again. This medication has cost us more money trying to get some relief. My husband finds me on the floor sometimes cuz I my knees gave out. I have been going to see Other doctors, going to the E.R. ( about every 2 or 3 weeks when the pain is so bad I can't move), and searching the web for others who had this adverse reaction also. I sure hope someone would post that the side effects would go away soon. I have been around 110 lbs. all adult life ( except when I was pregnant ) and last month, I weighed 89 pounds. Every Dr I went to went thru the same scenario -------- blood work, cats cans,x-Rays, MRI, etc, they all said I was fine. This made me start researching.on my own. I have heard there is an 8 percent chance of the breast cancer reoccurring staying OFF this medicine. Hope this helps. The decision must be yours, tho. I eat all the time. My weight is now up to 96. Yay! Sure hope it will get back up to 110!",

      "Content": "I have never written on here but felt compelled to write. I have been on anastrozole for a little less than 4 years. I go see my oncon. every 6 months. I tell him I feel worse and worse these days. I told him I would like to get off the drug. He said he would switch me to tamoxifen. I told him I didn't want ANY drugs. He talked me into staying on the anastrozole, so I did. I began feeling worse and worse. I took myself off the drug 5 days ago and the awful side effects are still with me. I feel as if I have no life. Here is what I am experiencing. Severe joint pain, muscle pain in legs, headache, memory loss, have trouble getting words out, tiredness all the time, nausea comes and goes. I am a VERY active, funny, optimistic 67 year old. I am no longer that person. I have to crawl up the stairs to our bedroom at night. I also don't use my iPad to keep in touch because I don't want my kids to see me while we are on FaceTime. Thanksgiving was worse ( yesterday) than awful. I could not invite my out of town children, nor could we go to their homes. My husband was helping to spare the kids the knowledge that t feel so bad also. It took almost an hour to type this. My hands are hurting too. PLEASE, if your Dr recommends this to you,study the side effects first. I don't think it's worth taking anymore,I have NO LIFE. I hope this will help someone. I also hope someone these lasting side effects would go away.h",
