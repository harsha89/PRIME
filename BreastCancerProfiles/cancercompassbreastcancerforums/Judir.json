    "Content": "I have only been on aromatose inhibitors for less than one year. I took Arimidex for several months and the joint pain was so bad. My oncologist switched me over to Aromasin and said it would lessen the joint pain. I have been gradually getting worse. I am wondering what I would be like if I was still taking Arimidex. I am afraid to see what I will be like in a few months. I now almost have no use of my hands as the pain has gone into my hands/joints where I can't bend my fingers anymore. I had none of this before Arimidex and Aromasin. I am going to my oncologist within the next few weeks to see if it this quality of life is worth it if you can't even pick up a pen or hold a can of food in your hand to open it. I am dropping things as I pick them up, etc. My feet hurt so bad that when I get up in the a.m. I can't even walk down the stairs without holding on to the handrail. I go down slowly with one foot on the stair and then the other just like babies do when they first start walking down stairs. Is this worth it???? I can no longer work outside the home as no one will hire me with the problems I have. If you can't even hold a pen in your hand, how can you complete paperwork or even write out a check. I have also been taking a 4-herb tea called Essiac tea which I feel has been a life saver for me. I feel I would be a lot worse if it weren't for this tea, but even though the tea has Montana Yew Tips which is for arthritis and people who have cancer, it doesn't help the joint pain but does help my immune system as I haven't been sick since I started taking it 2x a day a year ago. I haven't tried Celebrex, but it might be a choice I might have to consider. My oncologist suggested just taking ibruprofen when I first complained about joint pain and said to make sure I take plenty of calcium so I am taking coral calcium and calcium citrate. If that's helping, I don't know at this point. By the way, I am 57 and have never had problems with joint pain or a family history of this problem. I would like to hear from others who are experiencing the same problem.",
