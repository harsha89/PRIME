      "Content": "Good Morning!  My wife was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in October of 2013, just when we thought things were going well, chemo was done, double mastectomy was done....all we had was reconstructive surgery and then the healing would begin.  At our appointment after surgery we were told she was HER2 positive and would need another year of infusions.  Just recently she has given up smoking, the Tamoxofin has kicked her into menopause and her emotions are raw.  We argued Christmas Day because once again we were doing all the traveling and no one came to our home.  I said it'always us why can't they come out here?  Well now she says her family sucks, she doesn't care and to hell with it crying off and on all day. I also said it would be nice if she appreciated what I try to do for her/us once in a while.  Just a simple Thank You.  Now she says she doesn't know what to do, I said she was fine and to just focus on herself.  I know I was wrong to bring it up, I became frustrated and spoke w/o thinking.  Now it's crying every day, yelling at me, I have prayed to God for an answer and will continue to do so.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I never meant to hurt her feelings or to suggest any negativity.  I have failed my wife and see no avenue to change it. Thank You, Doug",

      "Content": "Thank You for the kind words, I appreciate them.  We are fine now and basically had the talk you suggested. She is on Effexor, but a low dose.  We are also working with integrative health....diet, meditation, accupuncture...etc.  Hopefully this will help also.  In over a year I only missed 2 appt.'s due to work.  Her Father was able to stand in.....they were consults with plastic surgeon.   We are united but stressed...lol.
