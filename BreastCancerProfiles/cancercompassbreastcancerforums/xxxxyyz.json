      "Content": "Well, I can tell you from my perspective I think its great that people are calling to check in on you. maybe they are ignorant, but maybe they really care and don't know how to word it properly. I for one lost 3 or 4 very close friends when I was diagnosed because they couldn't even bother to pick up the phone and ask me how I was doing, they were just too involved in their own lives. maybe the \"C\" word scared them and they didn't know how to respond, but this made the whole illness twice as traumatizing.  I sure wish they would have called, even if it was an awkwardly worded conversation that they had to stumble through. How would you feel honestly if nobody called? Maybe you're just bummed out and nobody can do anything right for you right now. That's okay to be down and go through that. You have every reason to be a little bitter for a while. Just be willing to give these people the benefit of the doubt - maybe they can help pull you out of that funk. I was surprised to see who ended up being there for me and who was no where to be found when the s&*t hit the fan.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a double mastectomy 4 yrs ago. It's hard to compare situations without actually seeing and talking to your mom, but I can tell you that only recently have I gotten to the point where I have no pain at all that concerns me. I did not have any issues with the incisions themselves although I experienced really bad itching for about 6 months after the surgery, and could never scratch them. It felt like it was underneath the skin.  I had some phantom pains where my original lumpectomy was done and still occasionally do. I also got bad keloid scars on one breast but not the other. Another thing that happened after the surgeries (I had 6 reconstructive / mastectomy surgeries) was that I lhad serious memory problems. I would go to the grocery store, come home and forget to unload them out of the car. I mailed people wedding gifts I didn't remember buying. I couldn't do simple math for 6 months. and I could not tolerate alcohol at all - if I had 2 drinks I would throw up violently. Also I couldn't get out of bed, I was just exhausted. This went on for almost a year.. I did some research and saw an endocrinologist and was told that my endocrine system had crashed - I am now taking a number of different hormones believe it or not including thyroid. Especially for the first year after the surgery, every time I did anything that stressed the muscles, I had strange pains that made me think my cancer had returned. That could be pushing something heavy, lifting myself out of a pool, or attempting to take an exercise class. Most of the pains were in the chest muscles deep in the chest beneath my implants. I tried to get back in shape and start exercising again, but every time I did anything that involved my arms i would get strange pains and end up getting sent to the hospital for a CT or MRI just to be safe. Eventually I gave up using my arms in exercise for several years because the stress of wondering what the pain was caused by wasn't worth the benefits. The scars healed well; I was and still am puffy around the chest and under the arms from the surgery and have been told that will never go away. For example my elastic jog bras don't fit anymore - they dig into my skin - and it is tough finding a regular bra that doesn't do the same thing and still gives me some sort of shape. I'm happy to report that I started just now taking a weight class at the gym, and had a few flickers of pain the next day the first time around but no recurrences which I am very excited about! Every time I have even the slightest health problem I worry it's cancer related and end up in a doctor's office to be reassured. Even getting a mole removed is a scare now. In fact I found this site because I have had lymph node pain in my groin and was wondering what this could be symptomatic of. This is part of the process and unfortunately necessary to stay healthy!! I have just tried to get used to it. I wish your mom the best. Tell her not to push it too hard and that if she notices she seems exhausted months after surgery to get her thyroid checked!",
