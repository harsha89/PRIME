      "Content": "Rads are targeted therapy for known lesions  (tumors). If cancer cells have entered the blood or lymph fluid, as it would with stage 4, systemic treatment would be needed in the form of chemo to kill those cells. I don't know of any studies or trials that show cannibus oil has any effect on tumors or cancer cells though it can be very helpful to some people i n control of symptoms and side effects of treatment. Make sure the dr knows all the drugs or supplements your mom uses as they can usually have some interaction with prescribed treatment.  If you don't feel the dr is treating your mother aggressively, go with her to an appointment and ask if there is a reason.  Perhaps there is a trial or study she would qualify for.  Or the dr may say she is on the appropriate treatment plan for her condition.  Push the dr for answers. If you don't get info you need,  I've found nurses can act as a go between of patient and dr. Prayers to you and your mother ....",

      "Content": "My dr prescribed gabapentin (neurontin) for pain and really prefers it to opiods. Will say it worked for pain and insomnia.  However I had to discontinue after just two weeks because it caused me to have suicidal thoughts. (I am NOT depressed or suicidal normally! ) my husband has degenerative disk disease and he tried it with the same results.  So I guess what I would say is make sure someone is keeping an eye on you if you try this drug. I'm sure not everyone has depression as a side effect but it's definitely a possibility you need to be aware of.  ",

Still not sure if I would have chosen to treat or not treat. Really need to consider this for the future, but right now just enjoying the days on earth and taking the grandkids to a hockey game tonight! Life goes on...... for awhile yet anyway. HA!",

      "Content": "Thank you for the sermon. I am a child of God, washed in the blood of the Lamb. Hopefully someone who doesn't know God's promise of salvation will read your post.  I'm not afraid of death ( the dying part, sure)  but I do worry about my husband. And I still enjoy being on this earth. It's harder when you still are given options than to just be told \"we can't do anything for you,  it's palliative care now\". I know I'll have to make a decision. I'm just not sure what it will be yet. God bless you for your message! ",
