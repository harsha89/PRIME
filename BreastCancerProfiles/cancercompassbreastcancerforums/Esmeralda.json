    "Content": "HI Pat, I've missed your surgery by two days.  I hope that you are doing well; although you migh be real sore.  I too will be undergoing double mast. with immediate expanders in place.  You are the first person I have spoken to via email.  Although I did contact \"IN YOUR SHOE\" and spoke with two wonderful women whom were able to ease my mind somewhat. I don't know if you did receive your \"Post Surgery Camisole\", but I was given one prior to my surgery to take with me. My surgery is schedule for Wednesday, February 4.  I sent you God's blessings for a speedy recover.  You might not be up to responding anytime soon, but it would be nice to hear from someone else undergoing the same thing.
