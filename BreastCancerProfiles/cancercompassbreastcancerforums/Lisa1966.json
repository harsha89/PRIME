I was told the half life is 3 weeks so you should have no effect until then it takes 6 weeks for it to be totally gone. I have super fast metabolism and felt it in three days. I got very depressed but a little efferix (sp) anti depressant helped that. It was like super bad PMS. I only took the anti depresant for one day but it did help. Make sure some one you trust watches out for you next week.",

Vit e and massage worked well. Take it easy and take care it could be a year of recovery.",
