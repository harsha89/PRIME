Something different is now being posted...bone loss. I followed my oncologists's advice and started Arimidex. After 3 monts and hobbling around in pain worse ghan my 92-year old mother I made the well thought-out decision to stop taking the debilitating medication rather than endure 5 years of agony, essentially throwingawa the best remaining years of my 68-year old life. I preferred to live a quality though possibly shorter life rather than waste those 5 years not really living. Quality over quantity. When telling my oncologist why I quit, I asked her why my HMO prescribed such a debilitating drug? Her answer was simple: standard protocol. What I've experienced after only 3 months on Arimidex is first, trochanteric hip bursitis and cortison shots that quickly no longer had any effect. Next, lumbar pain and stenosis, And loss of cartilege in my knees, having one knee replaced. I next went to a collapsed lumbar disc, L4-L5, low. Then the disc herniated and pushed my spiinal cord backwards into a loop that displaced 2 backbones. I've been recommended for a spinal fusion for over 4 years. Then other adjacent discs bulged, at least one has collapsed. My brother's back is worse than mine, but so far he's convinced me to avoid the spinal death nell of surgery, instead walk and excercise my muscles and core back into strength sufficient to support my bones, not my bones supporting 50 extra pounds. It's already coming off. I was also just diagnosed with osteopenia, borderline minimal lumbar bone loss, which began due to chemo. So zi walk, do yoga, tai chi, have a doctor who supports exercise over surgery. Btw, I've taken recommended doses of calcium and D3 for over 30 years. Exercise is do-able as compared to taking Arimidex, no comparison. So I'm somewhat disabled, enough to have a handicapped tag for my car, and I use a cane when I go out just for stability. Hope this lends some insight.You are doing great things to support your health. Getting rid of excess fat is the number one way to reduce your risk of hormone-positive breast cancer because your fat cells can produce estrogen from testosterone using an enzyme called aromatase \u2013 hence the use of aromatase inhibitors to block this process. You should also try to eat at least 5 teaspoons a day of ground flaxseed, which acts as a weak estrogen and binds to cell receptors, blocking estrogen. Start slow with just a teaspoon a day and work up to 5 teaspoons because it can cause bloating (food for normal bacteria in your gut). You can put it in yogurt, hot cereal, smoothies. It's also important to support your body's natural detoxification of estrogen. The best way to do this is to make sure you get all the B vitamins, sulfur from onions, garlic, and cruciferous vegetables, and important compounds found in cruciferous vegetables called Indole-3-carbinol and diindolylmethane (DIM). The most potent potent source of these compounds is broccoli sprouts, which you can easily make yourself and eat daily. Unfortunately, once broccoli is picked and shipped to stores it loses a lot of its important compounds. For additional bone support, I recommend that you take vitamin K-2 and magnesium in a chelated form like citrate or glycinate. I hope this is helpful to many survivors.

      "Content": "Seeing all the replies to the original message compelled me to respond. As a functional nutritionist and breast cancer survivor, I'd like to offer options for those who cannot tolerate aromatase inhibitors. First, you should know that the studies on this drug established 1 mg as the dose that would be effective for all women, no matter their body composition. The way these drugs work is to block an enzyme called aromatase that is made by the fat cells and converts testosterone in our body to estrogen. Women who are not overweight likely can take 1 mg every other day and achieve the same effect. You should also know that we have estrogen receptors in many cells in our body. The aromatase inhibitor prescription drugs are nonselective and blow up all of our estrogen receptors, leading to all of these horrible side effects. Chrysin is a natural aromatase inhibitor that does not cause side effects and you can buy without prescription. I recommend the Jarrow brand, 1000 mg taken at dinnertime daily. You should also consume at least 5 teaspoons of ground flaxseed every day as it is a weak phytoestrogen that will sit in the estrogen receptors to block estrogen from entering. You should start with a teaspoon and work your way up by increasing every few days. Estrogen is seen as a villain by oncologists because they don't understand what we are dealing with is estrogen gone rogue. We need to support our estrogen detoxification pathways by eating high-quality protein (organic), taking a high-quality B complex vitamin supplement, eating plenty of cruciferous and sulfur-rich vegetables, and adding a cruciferous extract supplement at dinner. I highly recommend a product called Cell Guardian by a company called Natura Health Products that provides the building blocks your liver needs to detoxify estrogen. Take at least two capsules twice daily at lunch and dinner. Also, get rid of all the sources of exogenous bad estrogens in your life: most makeup, body care products, plastics, chemical cleaners, etc. contain estrogenic compounds (parabens, phythalates, sulfates) that your body has to find a way to detoxify. My story supports the power of adopting a regimen of 1/2 dose aromatase inhibitor, Chrysin, flaxseed, and liver detoxification. I started this regimen after surgery and one round of chemotherapy that was too toxic for my body to handle. At that time I was ER+ PR+ HER2+++, stage 2 with no positive nodes. Two and a half years later the cancer came back in my liver and spine but it was now ER- PR-. Obviously when I was originally diagnosed, micro metastases already existed in my liver and spine. But the cells that were driven by estrogen and progesterone did not replicate and turn into tumors, only the ones driven by her2 neu. The reason I know is because I insisted on having a liver biopsy as well as sending my blood to Greece to have it tested for circulating tumor cells. Both the biopsy material and my blood work were genetically analyzed and tested against different pharmaceutical and natural agents. I chose to buck traditional oncology and pay out-of-pocket to have low-dose insulin-potentiated chemotherapy in Nevada. Much to my local oncologist's amazement, I was cancer free within four months of treatment with minimal side effects. I did choose to receive Herceptin and Perjeta because these monoclonal antibody drugs have few side effects and are really effective against her2 neu. Two years later I'm cancer free (I have blood drawn every 9 to 12 weeks to look at tumor markers). I also follow a low-carb, organic, gluten-free diet with plentiful antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables. Other than the neuropathy from my original chemotherapy, I am healthy and strong. No one needs to live a life of pain and fear. Find yourself a well-trained functional medicine dr. and/or nutritionist and find out all of your options. Yes you will have to pay out of pocket. Insurance-based medicine has not caught up with the latest treatments. Check out my website for more resources at www.healingnutritionofsonoma.com . Warm wishes to all, Maria",

There is ton of information on the internet suggesting that aprioct kernels work like miracle in treatment of cancer. Please post if you have used apricots seed to any benefit.Â  I watched \"World without cancer\" and also followed Jason Vale's story, but it would be helpful if I come to know of people for whom apricot seeds did not work.I had circulating tumor cell testing done in Greece, which showed my tumor (Breast met to liver) was sensitive to B-17, or Laetrile. Apricot seeds are the source of B-17. Not all tumors are sensitive to it. If you can't get proper testing, then any treatment you do, including conventional treatment, is a crapshoot. I do know that you need to take both the B-17 supplement and apricot kernels to get the best result. I am having great success with the treatments I received, both conventional and alternative, based on three different types of testing I had done: two on two more samples from a liver biopsy and one from my blood. It was expensive, but I did not want to suffer needless side effects from useless treatments. Dr. James Forsythe, the integrative oncologist who did my treatments, believes that we should use the best of both conventional and alternative agents. He does not feel that most alternative agents are effective enough on their own to eradicate a tumor.",
