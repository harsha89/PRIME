No discharge, but a rash at times with a scaly look. No lumps, so I am told there is nothing wrong. My gut says otherwise.  There is a strong genetic link to breast cancer in the family. Has anyone else every experienced this?  Hi I know your concern   , follow your mind , and I pray for you that it is nothing.....let me know",
