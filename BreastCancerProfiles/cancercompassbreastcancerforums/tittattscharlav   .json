    "Content": "My cancer did not show up but there was a 'shadow' area that was dismissed as nothing.  Several doctors read the xrays before my gyno finally called and said that because my breast tissue was so dense, he would feel more comfortable if I had one more oncologist look at it.  He said the same thing- \"probably nothing\" but agreed to a biopsy. When I arrived, they started to prep the wrong breast because there was a swollen mammory gland there.  I knew that and wasn't worried about it.  However, I INSISTED they biop the other one, right under the nipple.  They found a lump about the size of my thumbnail. Very aggressive.  I had a modified radical mastectomy with reconstruction.  Since it was also in many of the lymph nodes, they followed up with chemotherapy.  (adriomycin and cytoxin)  I hated it.  Got very sick.  But I am well and write on the subject now.  It was 9 years ago!!",
