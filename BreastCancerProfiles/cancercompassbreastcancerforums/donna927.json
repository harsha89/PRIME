    "Content": "I am 40 years old, I have three boys, ages 20, 9 and my youngest is 4.  I nursed him for 13 months ending in 2006.  I still can get milk out of my right breast when I squeeze the nipple.  I cannot get any out of my left breast.  I am also having pain now in my left nipple area which has lasted about 6 months.  It has gotten much worse over the last three months and it is really bothersome to me.  I had my first mammogram in the summer and all was fine.  I am hoping it is nothing.  I heard that the cancer usually begins in the ducts though so I am scared.  Has this happened to anyone before?  My grandmother on my moms side had breast cancer but she smoked.  I do not.  I am going to my doctors in the morning.  I was just wondering if this was common in the early stage or nothing too common?  I also want to say to all fighting this cancer, I hope God blesses you will a speedy recovery.  Thank you for taking time to red my post.  ",
