    "Content": "My friend\u2019s sister was diagnosed with breast cancer 3 weeks ago. The doctors say see is already in stage 2 to maybe 3 cancer. They also say there is crystallizing on the cancer cells, which they have never seen or know what it is. They are sending her to Chicago on Monday. My father is in the health insurance business and has a close friend that over came Colin cancer and says he owes his life to MD Anderson in Houston TX. my question is has anyone heard or know about crystallizing cancer cells and is MD Anderson the way to go over Mayo in Minnesota or Sloan-Kettering in Chicago? Any help would be greatly appreciated. This young woman is in her early 40's and has 2 young daughters who need her THANK YOU!!",
