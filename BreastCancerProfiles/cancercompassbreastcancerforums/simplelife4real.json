      "Content": "I am so sorry this has happened to you.  I agree with every one's comments to try to not do too much research on the internet until you know exactly what is going on.  I actually designated my SIL as my official researcher the first couple months.  It helped to have someone pre-screen the data for me.  I'm three months into my diagnosis now, and just started doing my own research a few weeks ago.  It really takes time to adjust. There's a group specifically for young women with breast cancer.  http://www.youngsurvival.org/  I think you will find a lot of support there as well as other places.  If it turns out you are triple negative which many young women are, I also recommend http://www.tnbcfoundation.org.  You are not alone as a young woman with BC.  There are many many young women were I get my chemo infusions. Also, I so agree about not listening to other people's horror stories.  If you end up getting chemo, they are so much better at controlling side effects.  I'm amazed at how good I actually feel most of the time even after 9 weeks of weekly chemo infusions. Lastly, I hope you are able to go somewhere for treatment that is highly specialized in each kind of cancer.  I live in a small town and decided to go to a major city with a research institution two hours away because I wanted to know that the medical team caring for me really knew what they where doing and saw cases just like mine every day, all day long.  I am really happy with my caregivers and I hope that you feel the same way about yours. At first, I felt like everything had to be done in a rush.  Now, I realize that a few weeks here and there in terms of treatment really don't make a big difference in the long run.   I wish you the best.  Truly for me, and for almost every other cancer patient that I've talked to said that the initial days and weeks after diagnosis were the WORST emotionally and mentally...waiting for test results seems to be the hardest part for everyone.  I actually slept better the night after they called and told me that my biopsy showed cancer than all the days and nights before while I was waiting for the biopsy results.  Once you are through all the intial testing and have a treatment plan in place, you will actually feel better....trust me.
