    "Content": "Hi Cookie, I have this same edema and the docs act like morons without explaining it.  Here is what I found online so far: Edema The upper extremity may show edema immediately after surgery or as a late complication; this condition is often associated with pain. Some degree of immediate postoperative swelling is expected and should resolve spontaneously. Persistent (more than a few weeks) or worsening swelling should prompt evaluation for seroma formation, wound infection, or skin/muscle flap necrosis. Late onset of upper-extremity pain and swelling in the postmastectomy patient can indicate cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, recurrence of tumor, or lymphedema. Diagnosis and management of these conditions is discussed extensively elsewhere.14Lymphedema may predispose patients to a number of other musculoskeletal pain syndromes, including rotator cuff tendonitis, adhesive capsulitis, lateral epicondylitis, and de Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis.15  ",
