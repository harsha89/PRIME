    "Content": "I am 61 years old and was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer with no node involvement in August.  I had a lumpectomy (with clean margins) and am currently in the middle of radiation.  Fortunately, I did not need chemo based on results of a oncotype dx test.  I am also estrogen/progesterone receptive.  My question is this:  I am very reluctant to begin a regime of arimidex based on all I have read about the side effects.  I would like to address my hormore inbalance more holistically through diet, exericise and alternative medicine approaches.  I would welcome any advice.",
