She said she had relief in a couple of days.",

      "Content": "My story is similar to yours.  Ductal no lymph nodes 198 years ago.  One surgery to remove but, labs said they did not get clear edges so another surgery to remove more tissues.    Same thing 30 some radiation treatments....no drug given. Of course I have followed up faithfully (wll mostly) with a yearly Mammo and all was always good.   Till Dec 2017 and family doctor has to tell me Dec 23 that she is sending me for ultrasound and more mammo.  That was done on Jan 12.  That day they did them and I asked if I was up to have the ultrasound guided biospy right then.  Of course I was glad to get it done.  I was booked with a surgeon before I left the Breast Cancer Clinic that day.    But, here the difference it was an Estrogen Fed cancer not the same at all.  But, was told there was only 5% chance of a person getting any cancer in the breast after the surgeries and treatments I had. In the end they did mastectomy    and removed 3 lymph nodes.  I am told like where that a lumpectomy and radiation were not an option because I had already had radiation.  Bone scan was all clear, CT scan all clear, 1 cancer cell in one lymph node,  testing done on the cancer says there is a very low chance of recurrance and chemo would not likely make a big difference (supposedly on 6% chance but, with my track record on this who knows ...lol..). Have been put on Estrogen blocking drugs and not having really bad side effects. I did not opt for reconstruction and that has to be each person own decision. So at 70 years of age I am trying to just move forward and to glad it was caught early. Wishing the same good results it does sound like they have caught it early and you are getting get care.",

      "Content": "I am 70 and put on these drugs 4 months ago.  I will say they do scare me but, it is very hard to tell if I have any new or different pain.  I had a ot before and because I was not as active while recovering from surgery, is that the problem.           My doctors have did new bone density so they would know how they were before I started these drugs.  It shows I am already am osteopenic.  They will be starting me on a monthly bone strengthener.  I am taking steps to help myself with bone strengthening excerise/walking, taking Vit D. I really don't like adding yet another drug but, don't see too much choice.  Good news other then this I am healthly and well.",
