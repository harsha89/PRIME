Carol Hi Carol,  I don't know if you received my last message or not, I'm still trying to find my way around this site.  I too am having Dr. Kinney do my surgery on Feb.1 and I too am nervous. However, I am very much looking forward to having this over with. I alway say,\" I wish it was a month from now and 3 weeks into my recovery.\" It sure is nice to hear  the good things that you heard about Dr. Kinney and his nurse. Fell free to write....we can compare note! I'll keep you in my prayers Toni",
