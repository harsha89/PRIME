    "Content": "Diagnosed Nov. 2008. Do you have brown hair?  I did and I also have hypo-thyroid problems now.  I'm also wondering age group.  I am 51 and have been using rogaine found out when I was 47.  Not much love from the rogaine but I keep hoping. I did see a specialist in SF, CA.  Sorry no help there. You can still see my bald spots with the male baldness pattern.  It is very difficult to live without hair and I feel for everyone of you.  I didn't take the the five year pills caused extreme moods for me.  I love the water and swimming was something I enjoyed, I don't swim now.  Best to all",
