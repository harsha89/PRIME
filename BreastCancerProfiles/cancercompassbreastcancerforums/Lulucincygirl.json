    "Content": "Hello, You said this right on!! No one deserves to get cancer and it's unfortunate that many people get this disease. Stay strong and believe that you WILL get through this!! I am 21, was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease when I was 19, and am now a survivor. I found that staying positive and keeping a good attitude about it changes everything!! If you go through this with a negative attitude, then it's really hard to get through it. For me, positveness and being strong was key! Cherrell, how are you doing?? What kind of cancer do you have? If you would like to talk please don't hesitate to contact me. I'd love to be able to help you through this! Hope all is well and to hear from you! Keep your head up! :o) -Laura",
