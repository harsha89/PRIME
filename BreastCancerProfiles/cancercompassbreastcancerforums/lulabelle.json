    "Content": "Dear AKT, Thank you for the wonderful advice!!!  My onc. tends to talk only about therapies with which he is familiar: chemo and the various pharmaceuticals that mitigate side effects.  Early on in my visits, I wanted so much more from him..., in  particular, to be given a more active role in my healing.  I sought and found an oncologist who practices integrative medicine.  She supports western medical treatment but her scope of inquiry and her knowledge base is much broader and she offers a healing path that complements the standard treatments.  She actually deluged me with information and I had to be selective.  But the addition of this doctor to my team, as well as the contacts she provided, has empowered me tremendously.  As I near the end of the traditional treatment, I believe there is an even greater need to move into the alternative therapies as there is little that the doctors can do between no sign of disease and the evidence of tumors/lesions on scans.  I think your advice, AKT, applies beautifully to this stage of healing, too.  You are so correct about maintaining the strength of the immune system and caring for one's emotional wellbeing.  I am glad you wrote in your suggestions.  Sending you love, laughter and strength.  ",
