      "Content": "My mum was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in mid august this past summer, and so far has had a lumpsectomy, lympsectomy, and 3 chemo sessions. In all honesty, I have been there trying my best to be supportive, cooking, cleaning and trying to keep my younger brothers in line, oh and not to mention pressures of senior year, but it's just so hard. Sometimes I feel as though I can't breathe, when I see her, it is just so heartwrenching. It breaks my heart to see someone who was once stronger then me mentally, physically, and emotionally, not be able to endure in just the simplest activities involved in daily living. I know it may seem bad, but I try sometimes to get out the house, stay a little longer at a friends, go shopping or participate in extra curriculars. These small distractions I feel are the only ones keeping positive and infact, sane. This isn't me trying to run away from responsibilities, but just a break. I feel as though I am running out of hope and positivity, I don't want to assume the worst about my mum's situation but I do ponder. As much as I want her to get better and beat this cancer, I'm in this neutral mode of \"whatever will be will be\", but at the same time I'm contradicting all my morals and advice, and going out of my mind everytime I see my mum. I love her dearly, but because of the way I feel, and the amount of confusion I feel just in general, I feel as though I am of no use to her or anyone. I don't know if it's because of her cancer, and the whole journey of it all that's doing this, but I've changed quite a bit. I used to be a person who would happily cry infront of strangers and speak my mind. But from the start of this semester (september onwards) I've experienced a huge loss of confidence, optimism and sheltering my feelings; I essentially put on a mask. But lately, I'm finding it alot harder to smile, a lot more difficult to joke, and feel as though half the time I'm ranting. Sometimes happiness does not even feel like an option. If anyone reads this, I would kindly appreciate if you could suggest any activities, exercises, prayers or advice that could help me become more positive and confident so I can not help myself, but my mum and those around me, thankyou.",

If you don't mind me asking what type of cancer did/do you have? ",

      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear that, I cannot even begin to imagine how hard it was and still is for you. But honestly, through all the feedback you've given me, you are tremendously strong and positive, and it gives me hope to know that regardless of what happens, I need do the same.  So far my mum had bounced back from her third chemo, which took a bit of toll. So far she is just enjoying whatever energy she has, and just making the most of it before the next session, which happens to be on christmas eve, but oh well, we're going to celebrate it early! So far things are getting better, I feel myself being more at ease now, and it comforts me to know that she is back on her feet, even though for a little while. Thanks again, amara x",

      "Content": "Thanks again for the advice! And with asking people, it's not really a pride thing why I'm reluctant to asking, I just hate having to put the pressure on anyone (besides myself), and I guess I just feel bad having to impose on others knowing they're busy with their own lives. But nonetheless, this habit needs to break, so starting from now, I'm going to ask more.",

My dad does try his best, but I can see he is struggling, especially with my brothers. But only just this friday gone, my grandma and her parent flew over and since then, the pressure's eased a alittle. But you know what, I'll definitely look into the support groups for caregivers, still trying to keep positive; surrounding myself with nature, good music and love. Thanks again mate x",

My mum has just had her fourth chemo session, and it's taken its toll. I find it especially hard right now because even though my grandmother is here for a while, I'm stressing with uni applications and exams are up soon, and well for the first time in a long while I've realized I'm my own for this one. My dad, is stressed and is the only one working, and my brothers are younger then me, and kind of frail from taking an responsibility. ",

You're right, there is no such thing as \"getting over it\" because they're people we love, memories we cherish, and emotions that were once expressed with ultimate passion because of that person, and I totally agree with what you're saying when it comes to going with the flow. Merry christmas! -amara x",
