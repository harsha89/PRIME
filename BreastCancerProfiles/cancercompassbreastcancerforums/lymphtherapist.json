    "Content": "I was dx DCIS grade 2, ER+/PR+. MRI showed that it was NOT multifocal or multicentric. As a lymphedema therapist, working with patients sustaining problems with radiation, lumpectomy and SNB, I was very clear with MD's that I wanted wide excision with 10mm margins.  I do not want radiation. I will agree to tamoxifen, but I will be vigilant with mammos and ultrasounds.  IF it returns, then I will undergo simple mastectomy. Most of my patients have issues from radiation therapy that you describe, as well as range of motion issues, scapular dyskinesis, postural imbalance, skin alterations and post lumpectomy pain syndrome.  The doctors are following the recommended practice guideline.  What you have experienced is the norm from my point of view as a lymphedema therapist specializing in breast cancer in a Cancer Center.  I would encourage you to seek therapy for manual lymphatic drainage, myofascial release, kinesiotaping and low level laser therapy.  YOU WILL obtain relief physically and emotionally.  Good luck",
