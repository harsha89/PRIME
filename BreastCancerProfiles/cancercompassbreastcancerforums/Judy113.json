    "Content": "Hi Snane, I'm almost in the same boat as you. My surgeon assures me that a lumpectomy is the way to go. I too am struggling. However during my pre-surgery MRI they saw something in the other breast. Had a biopsy on that today. So depending on results, my decision might be made for me. Did they tell you what your treatment would be with either the lump. or mast?Â  Keep us updated, and I hope that you come to a decision that you are comfortable with. Judy",
