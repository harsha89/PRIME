    "Content": "I get something similar. I was treated with radiation and chemotherapy and about 6 moths post last treatment i started feeling what I call a \"buzzing\" sensation . It occured about every 3-6 seconds and it started in my left arm and stayed for about 4 months, then reappeared in different location (ear lobe, right jaw, left thigh). It begun to decrease in frequency, and it totally disappeared for about 3 weeks, but yesterday it came back to my right jaw. Hope it goes away again soon. Like you say, not painful but annoying! I asked 4 doctors and none can agree on cause, though 2 said it might be due to the Chemo. Hope this helps and yours goes away too! Ches",
