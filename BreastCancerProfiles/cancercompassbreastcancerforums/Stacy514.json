      "Content": "I'm not a psychologist just a survivor, it sounds to me like that's just your mom's way of dealing with her breast cancer. I made fun of my cancer (stage 3) you know, put me in front of the line \"I have breast cancer\" things like that. It's very tramatic, more than anyone other than the person can believe. I'm sure your mom will calm down. I'd love to hear more from you, i'm trying to compose a book of stories from the child/children on how they are dealing with the diagnosis of their parent having cancer. I think it would help a lot of other children to know that they are not alone in their feelings. Any interest? If yes, email me directly to --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed. Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html ---- and in the \"message\" box put \"Cancer story\" include your age now and when your mom got diagnosed, feelings, guilt, anger (even at your mom's behavior) See if my book was out, you'd know if anyone else's mom did what your mom is doing. That is my purpose for my book. Do you think you can help? Thanks a lot, Stacy And good luck",
