    "Content": "This is a very rare and fast spreading cancer. Please seek treatment for your wife. My mom was diagnosed with this type of cancer in April of this year. She had a lumpectomy and and was undergoing chemo. She passed away July 29th. She had a PET and CT scan on July 28th. We received results back on Aug 1. The cancer had spread throughout her entire body. Her heart and thyroid were the only two places in her body that were cancer free. I beg you to seek treatment, as this cancer is very aggressive! The loss of my mom has been devastating to my entire family. Please do something rather then nothing. -",
