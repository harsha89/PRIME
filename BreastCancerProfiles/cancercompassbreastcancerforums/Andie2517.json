      "Content": "Hello. This is my first time on this site so here it goes....My mother is 48 y/o. She was first diagnosed in 1998 with just barely stage 2 breast cancer. She had a left mastectomy, underwent a full round of chemotherapy, and went into remission. She took Tamoxafin for 5 years, then switched to Femara. Now, just this past August, after watching her CEA rise for 6 months, her Oncologist did a scan and found mets in her hip bone. She did a round of Adriamyacin/Taxotere with no effect on the tumor, underwent 25 radiation treatments, also to no effect. This last scan revealed that the tumor grew slightly but has still remained only in the one location. She is now on monthly injections of Fosladex and due to start more chemo next week. She is already disqualified from many clinical trials because of the Taxotere but I have heard of the antiangiogenesis drugs that are in Phase 1, 2, and 3 but have not been able to find any that she qualifies for either. Has anyone had any luck getting into any of these trials? Where is the best place to look, rather than calling each institution itself. Also, can anyone offer any outlook on this situation? I am 24 and am absolutley terrified of losing my mother. I know that Ive heard of women living for a while with mets, but what if the tumor does not respond to anything? I could really use a miracle......",

      "Content": "My mother is ER positive too and was in remission taking Femara as her maintenance therapy when she had a recurrence of mets to bone. This does not mean that she is not ER +, but just that nothing is 100% effective for everyone. I am guessing that because she is 70 maybe she does not want to go thru chemo? Sometimes chemo or radiation is needed, not just the hormone therapy. Maybe ask her doctor about other options such as radioation. The most important thing is to stay strong and positive. Positive thinking and prayer have brought my mom a long way! I would always suggest a second and thirs opionion too. Since treating cancer is such a guessing game, it always hellps t o have more brains in the mix!",
