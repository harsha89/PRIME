      "Content": " This is part of a message my friend e-mailed me. She is finishing a year of being on herceptin. As you can see she has been feeling nerve pain for a while. She has had all kinds of tests done. Has anyone had trouble like that, and any suggestions I can give to her?  \"I am experiencing continuing pain all over my body and we don't know why (it should be improving, not getting worse).  I still have the pain from neuropathy, but that doesn't explain the pain I feel in my back, hips, knees, etc. (it is joint pain, muscle pain and tissue pain all combined)\" Thanks,  Mike",
