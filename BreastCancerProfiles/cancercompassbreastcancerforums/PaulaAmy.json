Then if the news is not good you need to spend quality time with your mom and tell her you love her and dote on her. I am a mom and we understand that our kids have lives too. I am sure she is super proud of you for attempting an MBA. Put that on hold for now cos the time with your mom is precious now. Its going to be hard but if you give your mom your best and loving attention in her last days, you will not feel guilty if she passes. Try and find a clinical trial for her. Ask your doctor who to call. Dont be put off by doctors saying she has little time. My mom was given 6 weeks and she lived for 9 months. My email is if you want to chat. I have cancer too. Best wishes Paula",

The tiny layer of subcutaneous tissue between the skin and the implant actually must have contained a few cancer cells after chemo! I was gobsmacked. But the tumour was easy to remove and I managed 10 years of remission. Hang in there! Paula.",

      "Content": "Hi. Be very careful of alternative meds. All medication that is used to fight cancer by law has to go thru Clinical trials for years before it may or may not be used, based on the results of the trials, ie how many patients lived and how many died. Researchers, doctors and statisticians all check the results and then the results have to be rechecked by experts who had nothing to do with the trials. With alternative meds, anecdotal evidence is the only \" proof\". That means people who claim they are cured or who claim they know someone who was cured. This is not scientific. In the 1970's apricot seeds also known as B17 or Laetrile were hailed by some as a cure for cancer. My mother had end stage ovarian cancer in 79 and in desperation we gave her this meds. She died 9 months after diagnosis aged 48. Since then apricot seed cures have been disproved and debunked. Cancer is a very complicated disease and operates in a highly specialised manner, it will not be beaten by alternative meds. Be careful, you will part with a lot of money with no results.

I get tendonitis regularly, I cant use a pull up bar at the gym, cant use weights either. Basically from the research I have done, mastectomy seems to re jig everything. It messes with nerves and tendons etc. I too am an athlete, runner, tennis player, in good shape for 56, but it is what it is. You have to learn to live with it! Better to be over the hill than under it! Best regards Paula",

      "Content": "Just fyi, the latest research on cancer shows it secretes an enzyme to fool the immune system so that T cells dont kill the cancer cells. When cancer cells move from breast to lungs, they have to change and \" think\" in order to move thru lymph nodes, the blood stream and membranes. Cancer cells work out that chemo is killing them and they change their RNA to become immune to chemo. If you underestimate them, they will kill you. Building up your immune system is a myth. I am a 4 time cancer survivor. Chemo, radiation, double mastectomy and Arimidex have saved my life. Good luck Paula",

Exercise is the key, keep fit and sleep in a very dark room at night. No light at all. Latest research shows that Arimidex works better when melotonin is made at night in your body and that is only made when its dark. Google it, sounds daft but it's true. I am 57, dont drink, run 3 times a week and sleep in the dark! My onc just shakes her head cos all my tests are beautiful and even the nurse asked \" what are you doing here!\" Love to all",
