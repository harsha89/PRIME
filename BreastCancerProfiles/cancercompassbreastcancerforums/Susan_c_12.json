      "Content": "Hi Cher, It has been my experience that restoring the immune system is critical to getting better. Because they are so hard on the immune system, I am not a fan of chemo or radiation, and have never taken them myself. I believe that everyone should make an informed decision on this for themselves. I did have surgery for my ovarian cancer, and other than that, have only done alternative methods to get better. I have tried so many things over the past 12 years, and would put glyconutrients at the top of the list. I believe they have prevented any metastasis by strengthening my immune system. To learn about glyconutrients, go to www.glycoscience.org and click on the \u201cGlyconutrients\u201d link. This will take you to several well documented articles worth investigating. There are also several other important nutrients that I have found to complement the glyconutrients. A month ago, a friend of mine was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer that had metastasized to her lymph nodes and spine. She was in tremendous pain and on the maximum pain medicine. After four weeks of taking large amounts of these nutrients and making certain lifestyle changes, her lymph nodes are clear, she\u2019s almost off her pain medicine, her appetite is improving, and she is showing signs of steady improvement. Her doctor is amazed that her cancer marker is much lower than expected. Anyone wanting to know what she is doing may contact me. Susan C.",

      "Content": "Dear Gail, I can understand your fear about the cancer coming back. I believe that the best thing is to do as much prevention as possible. Even if it does come back, don't ever lose hope, as it can be overcome. It's important to be a fighter and never give up hope. Your immune system is your best defense, so do everything possible to strengthen and build your immune system. I believe Mangosteen is very good, as well as the glyconutrients. There are some other nutrients that have been very effective and helpful in supporting my immune system, such as Transfer Point Beta Glucan, and Platinum Plus Essential Amino Acids. There are many factors to consider, such as getting the proper nutrition through foods and supplements, avoiding toxic foods or products, drinking adequate pure clean water, getting lots of rest as well as some exercise if possible, and addressing stress or emotional issues. I also have found Far Infrared heat to be very good for me. I would love to be of any support or help to you, in any way possible. Susan C.",

      "Content": "Hello Ann, I have been dealing with stage 4 ovarian cancer for over twelve years and have had very good success using a combination of conventional and alternative methods. Right now I feel great, have good energy, and other then a CA-125 that has dropped to 104, am symptom free. I am thankful to God and various means He has provided. If you would like to know the many trials, failures and successes, please let me know. Take care, Susan C.",

      "Content": "Dear Shanna L, I have dealt with ovarian cancer for almost 14 years now and the doctors are amazed that I have done so well. Other than surgery (which actually can be advantageous with ovarian cancer usually) I have not done any other conventional treatment, but only alternative/nutritional approaches. I have never taken chemo. I believe the glyconutrients have helped prevent any metastasis, as well as help improve my immune system better than anything. Harper\u2019s Biochemistry (medical textbook) 25th edition, chapter 56 titled \u201cGlycoproteins\u201d, explains the necessity of these 8 essential sugars for health, yet most are missing from our American diet. (This is only considered \u201cAlternative\u201d because mainstream medicine hasn\u2019t caught up to this research yet.) To learn more about the science behind these essential nutrients, go to www.glycoscience.org, and then click on the glyconutrients link in the left-hand menu bar. If I were to take chemo, I would only take it in the form of IPT Therapy (do Google search to learn more about it). As an alternative to chemo, if it was me, I would either go with Graviola, or else with liquid ionic Cesium chloride supplemented with additional ionic potassium (not Graviola and Cesium at the same time, as you don\u2019t want too rapid die-off of cancer cells, as the body needs time to detoxify). If my condition was more critical and didn\u2019t have much time left, my first choice would be the cesium; also if I was in a lot of pain, I would take cesium, as it targets cancer spots and turns them from being acid to alkaline, and therefore tends to eliminate pain within just several days. My experience with cesium found this to be true, and I found it very effective. However, I did not take the liquid ionic form, which I now think is better; although it may cost more, it is worth it. Also, one must be very careful taking cesium, to have their blood potassium level checked often and monitored very closely by their doctor so it doesn\u2019t get too low (my potassium level dropped too low while on cesium, because I wasn\u2019t being monitored, nor was I taking enough additional potassium, so I came dangerously close to dying from too low of potassium)\u2026.only to say, be careful, do it right with close supervision of your doctor, and I believe it can be an excellent way to go. Eliminating the cancer is just half of the matter. Though the causes of cancer may not be completely understood, we need to do all the known preventative measures possible. Again, we must do everything we can to balance and correct our immune system and not suppress it. Otherwise, cancer will likely come back again down the road. There could be a lot of factors involved: refined white sugar, synthetic or artificial food or supplement products, unhealthy oils (see book \u201cFats that Heal, Fats that Kill\u201d), nutritional deficiencies, too low Vitamin D levels, poor immune function, estrogen dominance, low thyroid function, chemicals, pesticides, toxins, parasites, fungus, etc. Educating yourself, working with your doctor, and having a good alternative health practitioner to work with you on these things (if possible) are very important.",
