    "Content": "My friend has breast cancer but for some reasons she's experiencing unusual signs that she nor I understand. A very dry uncontrollable cough, lumps down her arm, her side and even in her back. The doctor has not given her her chemo in over two months because her blood count is too low. She just finished 6 weeks of radiation. Her arm and hand is so swollen until it doesn't look like a part of her body. She's 55 years old and weighs 78 lbs. Have anyone experienced these symptoms. It seems to me like the doctors has given up on her.",
