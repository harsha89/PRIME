I cant see her facebook page either and any remeberance messages because she unfriended me when i was a bit slow on replying to a message. It's far from her not liking me but more down to the releationship we had. We was soul m8s i think. Death has never hit me like this and i am lost and dont know what to do this is the most devestating thing i have ever had to do. We had a relationship a few years back and we lived together did a lot together but in the end we was not right for each other, but we still had very strong feelings and a relationship as friends. She was and is a shining star in the darkest night skies, she dedicated her life into helping the disabled and people. Even throughout the cancer she kept smiling like she always did and never let it get her down. She was only 41 and i feel like i have lost a big part of my life. I just dont understand how she died so suddenly its beyond me. I never thought when i went out with her, i would lose her 7 years later. I wish we found the cancer then. Any advice woule be good as i am broken,destoyed and sadness is not even close to how im feeling right now. I lost my soul m8 to Cancer and it sucks. Death is the beginning. Death is the passage to the eternal. Death is certain and is always with each of us. The problem lies within us, our culture, and our lack of knowledge. We live in a culture which shuns even a casual conversation about death. Few of us are comfortable with this very simple question. Do you know, for certain, where you are going at your death? Like I said, it is a very simple question. Why is it then, that we fall apart when what we know will happen, actually happens? So, as you grieve for your friend, and grieving is important, ponder my opening statement. Death is the beginning. I know this with absolute certainty. When I hear of a death my question to myself, is always, \u201cWhere did that person\u2019s soul end up\u201d? I know where I will end up, however I do not have the ability to look into another\u2019s heart; for it is there the answer could have been found. As you grieve, maybe, just maybe, you might think about honoring her death by starting a conversation, as I am starting one with you. Ask yourself to answer this simple question. If I died today, do I know for certain what would happen to me? The answer to that question will change everything about you; how you view the world, other people, and yourself.  Your friend exists somewhere as I write this note. And even more important is the fact that she chose her eternity, just as you and I will do by what lies in our heart. \u201cAbove ALL else, guard your heart, for in it are the sources of life.\u201d Proverbs 4:23 Every journey starts with the first step. What a wonderful way to honor her memory. I sincerely want you to know what has been revealed to me, however, like me, only you can do it for yourself. I pray GOD\u2019s Blessing on you.     Clint                  ",

      "Content": "Good Morning Evebarry, First, let me address you. Receiving a diagnosis such as you have is highly stressful. My brother recently remarked that one of the few positives that he has taken from his own battle is the fact that he no longer wonders how he would react to the words \u201cYou have cancer\u201d. Yours is not an easy road. Nor was it for the early Israelites as they prepared to enter the \u2018Promised Land\u2019.  Moses has brought them as far as GOD will allow. The road ahead would be hard, this we later find out in the Book of Joshua. Through Moses, GOD makes the following promise \u201cThe LORD Himself goes before you, and will be with you; He will never leave you or forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged\u201d. Deuteronomy 31:8. This promise applies to you as well. Second, please fill out some more information about yourself. Before I respond to any post I make it a rule to go back and read past posts as well as other pertinent information about the person. I do that out of respect, since comments can be taken many different ways, and often are, in a supercharged atmosphere such as is on a blog site like this. Last, but not least, thank you for your friendly rebuke. The phrase \u2018god crap\u2019 was not of my own making. This particular thread quickly spiraled out of control, as I recall. I love atheists; however they are often very self assured. This person was adamant that there was no hope to be gained by touting \u2018god crap\u2019. My words were merely a reflection of the atheist\u2019s mantra. Sometimes when one sees their position laid out in their own terminology it gives them pause. Unfortunately, in this case, it did not. Please feel free to skim over my past posts. If it assists you in creating a clear picture of me and my intentions then it may very well be worth the investment of a few minutes May GOD Bless you and may the Peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you in this, the struggle of your life.

I have stage 4 and I am not deluding myself thinking GOD will provide a \"cure\", If that magical thinking is comforting to you, indulge yourself. I don't find any of that GOD crap useful, helpful or worth a second of my time. This is a real thread about dying, I doubt you have ill intent, but please take it somewhere else. To BreastCA4, This thread and your comments bear the marks of someone who knows much about the subject being discussed. I have no doubt that you talk from the heart when you give a stinging rebuke against giving people such as yourself who are terminal any hope. Stage4 is terminal. You are stage4, therefore you are terminal. Knowing that, you may find my comments to be useful as you prepare for what lies ahead. You sound as though you have done quite a bit of research on the subject of being terminal. There is another who recently died of cancer whose last book discussed this matter in great detail. His name was Richard Dawkins. I think he is best known for his book entitled \u201cThe Case against God\u201d. According to Mr. Dawkins, as a person advances towards terminal, they pass through five (5) stages. The first is DISPAIR. This is often accompanied by anger towards those who would attempt to give worthless encouragement. After all, the person is terminal. The second phase is DESPERATION. This phase occurs when all actions to ward off terminal appear to no longer work and all seems lost. The third phase is DEPRESSION. This phase is fairly self explanatory. When any hope of recovery has evaporated, then the end and what that implies leaves the person with no other choice than to become depressed, clinically. The fourth and fifth stages should really be lumped together since the first initiates the second. They are DEATH and DESTRUCTION. At the death of the body there comes with it a destruction of everything that was, just a moment before, that person. The end is total annihilation. Nothing that was is now there. It is as if that person never existed; if it were not for the memories still harbored by those still breathing. Richard ended this expose with a warning to anyone who might find his findings a bit too morbid. To them he said, \u201cGet over it\u201d. So, there you have it from one who knows where you are going. Now, there is another book which gives quite a few people hope, however it is not for the faint of heart. It is simply \u201cThe Bible\u201d. It talks about GOD \u2018crap\u2019, so I would recommend that you stay away since it demands an open mind and a hopeful heart. I hope you find my words helpful as you prepare for you own annihilation. Clint    ",

Good Morning Evebarry, When events seem to be bombarding us faster then we can imagine, words of encouragement are hard to come by. We mean well, however there is a sense that we are increasingly powerless against this invader called cancer. YOU WILL BE HEALED. How do I know that? Simply because GOD gave me a short glimpse of eternity, and for that I am extremely grateful. I have two (2) very frail parents whose lives have been reduced to a minimal existence. I find it eerily ironical that while they long to be taken home, we fight desperately to push that event off into the future. I learned a great truth this past weekend. Simply stated, GOD has rights, too. GOD created each of us and GOD retains superior rights to His creation, in this case, YOU. We are told that long before Genesis 1:1 we were chosen by GOD to exist with Him forever. The fall, as described in Genesis 3, did not negate or change GOD plans for us, or in this case, YOU. Therefore, YOU WILL BE HEALED. Your healing was ensured the moment your name was added to the Book of Life. Like me, you did nothing to deserve this entry; rather you simply accepted GOD\u2019s gift by Grace through Faith. Jesus did all the dirty work, and it is with Jesus we will live FOREVER. That said, GOD (Jesus) has first rights as to when, how, and where you will reside; be it on earth in this body, or with Him in a new body.  Either way, YOU WILL BE HEALED. A more immediate issue is the matter of physical pain. This is an earth based issue; however that in no way minimizes its toll on our body and our mind. Cancer treatments cause a great deal of pain. Maybe one day it will not be so; however today that is the reality. As humans, we often chose to accept this pain as a reasonable price to pay for healing. For some, it even brings them closer to GOD; however that, I believe, is not in play with you. You have given your life, your heart, and your soul to our Creator. Enduring pain is not a prerequisite to obtain redemption and salvation. Why? Because the pain endured by The Lamb of GOD was enough. He told us that from the cross with these words \u201cIt has been accomplished\u201d. Lord Jesus,  Thank you for giving us, your precious children, the gift of eternal life; with you, in your Kingdom. Please comfort, this day, your servant Evebarry as she endures pain and suffering to stay in this body. It that is Your will, so be it. If not, please let her know. In your precious name, a name honored and glorified above all others in Your Father\u2019s house, we pray. Clint                       ",

      "Content": "Hi Alice, Welcome to CancerCompass. We have been waiting patiently for someone like you to join this site. In addition to your love for all, it appears we may have a new sheriff in town. We are all made better when someone takes on the awesome responsibility to critique our words and our actions. Charles, you are to be commended for coming in to back Alice. Alice, even though you are new to these parts I have already learned much. First of all, I did not know that this site is Christian based. To be quite frank, as I became acquainted with the cross section of humanity who frequented this site I came to the opposite conclusion. GOD was rarely mentioned. Even more interesting was the lack of any spiritual connection with those folks suffering mightily on the physical side. I even thought that, much like in our society, GOD was quietly being asked to leave the premises. I, for one, welcome someone who will critique my every word. How else can we grow in our faith and our obligation to be the light of this world? That said, may I offer a couple of ideas which may aid you in being a successful sheriff. Before I make any comment, I first go back and read the past posts of the person to whom I am going to address. That way, I hope to avoid coming off as having an agenda. Since we have only the other person\u2019s words to examine, it makes sense to give them the courtesy of at least having read what they took the time and energy to write. For example, by the time I met Diana last fall, she had authored over 1200 posts. I took over an hour to \u2018get to know her\u2019. This has also given me the opportunity to witness how a specific person has evolved over time. In fact, when I go back and look at my old posts, I can see specific progress in some areas and some areas that deserve more attention Second, it gives my some insight into the heart of that person. Blanket critiques, while useful, have a tendency to do little good since they are generally met with skepticism. Let me give you an example. GOD is Love. That is both true and is stated as such in the Bible. However, GOD is also Just. God is also Holy. We are to love each other. That is also true. The problem begins when we make love GOD\u2019s main attribute. When I first heard those words (GOD is love) I believed that GOD loved me so much that under no circumstances would HE allow me to find myself in Hell, after all He is a loving GOD. I think you get my point.  Charles, telling someone to just go to church may not garner the results you desire. Many of our churches no longer are true to the WORD. A more appropriate command might be to go and spend more time in the WORD. I would also recommend a specific book and/or chapter since telling someone to go back and study the entire Bible may sound condescending. Again, welcome to CancerCompass. We look forward to your input. Clint                    ",

I look forward to meeting you some day. And I will. People often, and Christians more often than not, mistakenly think that believers are somehow immune to suffering. Well, you definitely dispel that falsehood.    If you would indulge me for just a few more sentences, I feel led to share something. 35 years ago I had a very short, and very intense near death experience. Over time memories fade, and mine has as well. But this I know. Should you be called home before you would have planned, you will experience LOVE on a scale which is unimaginable. Language is so inadequate that you will just have to trust this stranger, for there are no words for what I experienced. Jesus will take care of your husband and your children. His plan for them will not be altered, rather it will be a part of His plan.  Trust me, I know of what I speak. GOD loves you, and in my own very inadequate way, I love you too. They are not comparable. You will one day chuckle when you remember my feeble words. GOD bless you. We will meet someday, and I will feel honored to have met you before, if only digitally. Clint ",

      "Content": "Hi Jgreen, Welcome back. I read your posts and noticed that you posted once in Nov 2012 and then there was a gap of three (3) years until you posted again. I now know why; after looking down the extensive list of cancers which have attacked your body. Insight, I have none. Nobody in their right mind could, unless they had gone down the same road. However, you are not alone. Our bodies come with an expiration date; did you know that? Once we can reason, we cling to our bodies at all costs, for that is all we know. So, what difference does it make? Well, today, as you read this response, some 250,000 or so bodies will stop working. That\u2019s a fact. The only one who knows the date and time is the one who made you, your Creator. That\u2019s also a fact. The operating manual for our bodies is all we have, and it tells us that yes, indeed, the body will eventually die. Now, you are asking if it is time to just give up, stop all the life extending procedures you are enduring for your husband and your kids, and then let nature take its course. The answer depends. If you do not know what is to become of you once your body ceases functioning then I would continue to fight on very aggressively. There is a part of you which is in grave danger. Here to, you are not alone. Read many of the posts and you will find that most are fighting because they are deathly afraid. Their fears are not misplaced. Their fears would be eliminated if they studied the operating manual. Common sense dictates that a legitimate creator would provide such a document, just as virtually everything else you possess which has some internal complexity comes with one as well. Our operating manual is also known as The Bible. In it, we find that we consist of more than just flesh and bones. In fact, our flesh and bones are the only part of us which wears out. Our Creator, Jesus Christ is infinite. Therefore, anything which is created must have possess the same property, it must be infinite. It tells us that as well. We have an infinite part to each of us. GOD is Spirit, according to the Bible. Therefore we have a spirit. Now for the really cool part, we also have a soul. It is our soul which goes to spirit with us when our body stops functioning. The answer to my last question will determine IF you should continue fighting and HOW you continue fighting against this terrible beast called cancer . It is more important than your husband, or your kids. \u201cDo you KNOW for certain where your soul is going after you breathe your last?\u201d If you know for certain that it is the place set aside for the children of GOD, because you accepted the gift of eternal life from Christ Jesus, then do not sweat it. Jesus promised his people that \u201cI will never forsake you or leave you.\u201d Are you covered in this promise? If you are, then put your fears, frustrations, and weariness in His hands, for He is always in control. The Bible will renew your the confidence you seem to being questioning. If not, then you are at a crossroads. You can either keep on this path for as long as your body cooperates, or you can pick up that same Bible and ask Jesus to come into your life. It is really all that simple. I pray these words will be received in the way the Spirit of GOD led me to write. Clint ",
