      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this site, but I still have my port in, had to take Herceptin everyweek for a year after the chemo drugs. It takes some getting used to, it will settle in and be less of an albatros LOL :). The swelling and pain will go away and you will barly know it's there unless you touch it of course. But it does not hurt when they access it, no more than a prick in the finger. It will take some getting used to at night, especially if you like to sleep on your side. My Doctor also will not do lab draws from it, even though some do. That way it is less chance of an infection. But if your veins are bad, they may do them thru the port. I've seen the alturnatives, You made a wise choice having the port put in :) Hope this helps :) Sondra    ",

      "Content": "I too have pain in my joints and muscles. Hands and feet too. one time I woke up with my hand locked in a loose fist position. also swelling in my hands. I take 1 percacet in the morning to be able to get moving. Once I am, I'm okay till I stop for an hour or so. Almost feels like I need to be in perpetual motion all day at work :) And I am also so exhausted after work. but the dull headaches have went away! But I have found when I spend 1/2 hour on the treadmill walking, till my hips start to hurt :). About an hour later, I do get relief from the joint pain for maybe 2 hours or so. Weird..I know.
