    "Content": "I have been on Anastrozole for 4 years now.  I am considering stopping the drug for the following reasons. 1. I have aches and pains constantly.  Not excruciating but enough that it is becoming bothersome. 2. I have to take Lopid because my triglycerides shot up so high that my PCP was horrified. 3. My BP is out of control.  4. My weight is a joke.  Gave up on that a few years ago.  Would I be mistaken to quit taking the Anastrozole?  I ask my Oncologist and he just says 1 more year. My PCP says nothing as oncology is not her field, she just continues to treat all the health issues that keep coming up.  I think I need new doctors (but that is another discussion).",
