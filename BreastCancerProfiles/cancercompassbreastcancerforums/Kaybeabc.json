      "Content": "Hi I know what you are going through I lost my mom a week ago Friday and at times it is hard to cope. I find the suggestions here very helpful I like the idea of a memorial book, praying in the morning and evening to get through. Right now the family is in the numb stage, grieving stage and angry stage. She was in a lot of pain in the end and she died of a secondary infection pnemonia which came on suddenly, but in truth her body could not fight anymore. After her dignosis of stage 4 b/c in December she went home for a week to start treatments she went in for her treatments in so much pain, massive weight loss, and the cancer was spreading rapidly she even lost use of her arms and hands to a degree by the end they moved her into pallative care a week ago and she passed away by week end. It was hard to go through, hard to watch, like Lesli's mom my mom got phnemonia and her immune system was also too weak because of her 5 radiation treatments and her bad health, weight loss, not eating, constant pain and cancer in most everywhere in her body the doctor said, she too was unable to fight back. Blessings to everyone who is going through this loss my prayers are with you and a big cyber hug I am so thankful for these boards to help get through this. Blessings",
