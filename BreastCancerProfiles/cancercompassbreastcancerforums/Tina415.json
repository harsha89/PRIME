      "Content": "After almost 13 years being cancer free, I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer in the same breast. With the original breast I had a lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, 5 years of tamoxifen and another 2 years of Femara. I'm facing a mastectomy and anguishing over the decision of having the right breast removed just to eliminate the possibility of going through this again. I'm a month and a half shy of being 68 years old and have no other medical difficulties. I'm reaching out to anyone that has faced similar circumstances.",

It seems from all I can read or tell that for estrogen positive cancer there is no limit to how long after treatment a recurrence can happen. I'm only 2 1/2 years out from my dx and I'm still cancer free, but it sounds like I will be on femara for the next 10 years and then something else.Hi, my original cancer was estrogen positive. The sentinel node was positive for cancer; they removed 7 more and all were negative. I really thought I was out of the woods with 13 years behind me. That's why I'm considering the double mastectomy.",

Your insurance should pay for that. Thank you for your prayers and I, too, will include you in mine.",
