Well after the ultrasound, mammogram, catscan and petscan they now have the results. They said normally when the catscan finds cancer then it would show up bright red, well they said they found 3 light pink ones on my mom( one in the neck and two in the chest area). So they dont know why it came out that color but they said that there about 95% sure its cancer , but to make sure she has to have a biopsy.  Also i thought cancer lymph nodes are not suppose to move? Well the one in my moms neck moves and the docter said when cancer comes back it normally comes back in the neck or under arm.  Plus my mom has been having alot of headaches and feels like something is pulling something in the back of her neck?  Im so worried now more then ever!!  Ive been in another world for wks now.  And all my poor mom can worry is, how is she going to be able to work?  If anyone has anything to share w/ me, please do b/c i feel i cant talk to anyone but people on this website. Thank you My cancer came back in the lymph nodes above the collarbone, I am 66. I am having pet scan next week. My lymph nodes did move, so I do not believe that they do not move.....I read a previous message here today, that a doctor told someone that they have 2-5 yrs to live....wow that is scary....I do not want to know and I hope my doctor does not tell me that. I think someone would give up hope...I think only God knows when, even though there are stats, we are all individuals and may react differently. I spoke to a women who had 7 recurrences and she is going strong and working. She think of metastasis as a chronic disease...she has a good attitude. anyway I hope the best for your Mom, and there are about 15 chemo's for advanced breast cancer",
