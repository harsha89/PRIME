    "Content": "My Primary Doc found lump a year ago, had Mammo/US/MRI nothing found. I am 36 with family history of breast cancer. I was told I simply have dense breasts and don't worry. Fast forward one year, started having breast pain in Dec. Waited two months, made appt wit doc, had another mammo, US and nothing once again. Four weeks ago, started having armpit pain and arm pain on same side as lump/breast pain. Went back to primary doc and was told I had a swollen lymph node and was referred to surgeon. Had appt. with surgeon, she said all diagnostic tests showed nothing, lymph node no longer swollenÂ and the lump feels like just dense breast tissue. Said she could not explain armpit and arm pain. Recommended I take a gamma linolenci acid for 4 weeks and if pain persists to return and have possile MRI on shoulder to find out about armpit/arm pain. Surgeon said she would biopsy lump if I wanted but did not recommend a biopsy at this point. Has anyone here that has been diagnosed had these symptoms? Should I wait or go ahead and have the biopsy?",
