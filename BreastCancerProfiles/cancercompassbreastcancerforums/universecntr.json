    "Content": "I'm newly diagnosed w/ breast cancer.  Head still reeling actually. I understand what's expected to happen next...surgery, chemo, the side affects have been discussed.  Yet whoa! Slow down a second.  Can anyone tell me what happens if I opt to do nothing?  What is the process that happens to my breast then?  Or is it too painful to discuss?  Or is it just not done?  Everyone immediately says 'yeah, cut off my breast!'  I guess I need to hear the gruesome side to go w/ the scary side so I can weigh my options.  Thanks for letting me rant & and thanks for any answers.",
