      "Content": "Long story short, 9mm mass, had needle biopsy instead of core. Now doctor wants a core biopsy and MRI. Yes to the MRI, but I don't want a core. Lumpectomy and bilateral mastectomy is what I want. I don't want to worry abouut it returning. I already had stage 3 colon cancer 3 years ago and I can't think of chemo again and more tests. Is low grade a good sign? Is this considered DCIS or another acronym. So confused? I called Sloan Kettering, I want them to take over my case. Waiting and nervous!! Got divorced last week, then came home and got the breast cancer diagnosis.    ",

      "Content": "I am so glad I found this post. I had a breast reduction after a lumpectomy of a 9mm stage 1, Ilc mass in October. Two months after surgery I felt a hard, golf ball size lump on the breast (left) that didn't have cancer. Had a sonogram and having a mammo/biopsy next week. Docotr said he feels it is a hematoma but wants to be sure. Here I go again, not a day goes ny without worry for me. I am also a stage 3 colon cancer survivor since 2007.",

I know the odds are not in my favor. I had a breast cancer tumor blood test and that was perfect. Is this a good indicator? Nervous/scared",
