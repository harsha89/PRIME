      "Content": "I had 6 rounds of CAT T=taxotere, over an 18 week period; one every 3 weeks. When I arrived for my first treatment, the nurse was surprised that I hadn't been taking a steroid 3 days before treatment. No one had prescribed one. She gave me the treatment anyway. Three days later I developed large boils all over my face. I found out on my own that this would have been prevented if I had steroids before treatment. Swollen legs, feet, and hands were almost always with me. My feet swelled enough one time that I couldn't wear shoes. My Dr. prescribed support stockings that helped. My toenails started turning purple, and one of them started bleeding. I learned that I was probably going to loose them, as this was a sympton of the taxotere. They continue to get worse after finishing my chemo in November 05. My treatment was always on a Friday, and without fail, I went back to the hospital the Saturday after and received a shot of Neulasta. I suffored from significant bone pain, but I believe the drug kept me out of the hospital. Almost forgot, hours after I was administered taxotere, I contracted a bladder infection. Every single treatment. Don't they call Taxotere the \"Red Devil\"? I wish you luck with your current treatment. I've finished chemo, and 6 weeks of daily radiation. I'll find out in the next couple of weeks if I'm in remission. Hope this helps. --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.

      "Content": "My edema was not as serious as yours; I'm sorry I can't help you there. I would like to know how everyone felt after teatment. I finished chemo, radiation in Jan '06 and I'm exhausted all the time. It's all I can do to get out of bed some days. It's so depressing. Would love to hear from others.",
