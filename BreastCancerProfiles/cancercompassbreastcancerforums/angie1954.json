    "Content": "  I had a sentinel node biopsy while under general anesthesia for a partial mastectomy.  The needle you might be referring to is the needle that injects material into the breast that allows the mapping of the sentinel nodes prior to the biopsying of those nodes.  That needle does not go into the nipple, but on the side of the breast.  There is slight discomfort, but it is not that bad.  What I found troublesome was staying in a fixed position while images were being taken for the mapping. I used imagery to stay completely still. Best of luck, Lisa  ",
