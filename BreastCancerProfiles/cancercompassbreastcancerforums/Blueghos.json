    "Content": "I lost my mother in 1991 to something very similar to ovarian cancer.  And now I'm about to lose the home I grew up in, the home she bought for us, and left me.  A beautiful waterfront home in an upper income neighborhood.  It'll be like losing her all over again.  On top of that I suffered from acute depression, and am working two minimum wage jobs to try to keep the house so I don't have to get ushered into a neighborhood with a bunch of crazy people.  I watched my mother die in my arms.  She fought to hold onto life.  She was only a ghost of her former self during the last two weeks she was in the hospital.  She did so much for me, and I could not save her.  I tried.  I really tried.  At one time I had some negative thoughts of her, blaming her for my depression, but that was wrong, and I've regretted it ever since.  When the doctors and she told me they had taken out %90 of the tumor, and the rest they were gong to treat with chemo, I thought she was cured.  I really did.  That's what I took it to mean.  Now, recently, that I've revealed my negative depressive thoughts about my my mom, friends and family probably think I wanted my mom to die.  I didn't.  Yes, I thought about it, but no, I did not want that.  And now, like I say, I'm about to lose her again.  Five years of being put through the ringer to get me over her death, I finally am, but am now about to lose her again.  This is awful.  I wish life were fair.  But it isn't.  She was my only immediately family, other than my dog who really belonged to my mother.  And now I'm going to lose both of them all over again.  This is a lot of pain to bear.  All I wanted was a full time job and lady friend.  But instead I'm going to lose my house.  Thanks.",
