      "Content": "It's O.K. to be scared.  We were all scared, especially in the beginning when we didn't know what to expect.  It will get better.  Your Mom may have surgery, chemo and radiation.   She'll have days when she's tired or sick and days when she'll feel better.  It will take time but eventually she will probably be back to her old self. There should be counseling available at her surgeon's office from a nurse oncologist or a professional.  Tell your Mom you need to talk and perhaps you can have a few counseling visits together. Millions of us are living past cancer and your Mom can too. It's good to talk to friends but in this case it may be better to talk to adults who are informed about what your mom will go thru.",

      "Content": "You're bound to be lumpy if you just had your surg. at the end of Feb.   You can't start chemo or radiation until you heal - that's the delay.  They have a schedule that works best for you. Try not to be afraid until you know what you're dealing with exactly.  It's unlikely that a lump would have grown that much in such a short period of time and I'm assuming you had a mascectomy with lymph node removal.  There should be someone at your surgeon's office like a nurse oncologist who can examine you and put your mind at ease. I have been very lumpy and swollen and it's been a year since my surgery.  I had my surgeon check lumps just last week and it's nothing. Before surgery, they likely did mammograms and a breast MRI.  The cancer would have shown.",

      "Content": " I was like this too and nothing seemed to help but rest.  I just didn't make any plans other than chemo, radiation and doctor's appointments. Fatigue is a common complaint.  If I could take a shower and make something to eat it was a good day.  I lived with  it for many months and it finally got better when I was done with radiation. I was leg wobbly after my mascectomy too.  If your mom is very weak she should have a walker so she doesn't fall.  Just getting to the bathroom can be exhausting. I know you feel sad.  I felt sad too and afraid but it does pass.  It is a temporary side effect of her treatment.  This is when she has to just stay home and be kind to herself and rest and sleep.  She will get stronger.  She's still healing from her surgery and the chemo drugs.   As soon as I got stronger they put in in radiation which caused more weakness but you just do what you can do. Her oncologist should be notified about the bathroom problem.  I had towels down on my chair and often wore Depends. Hang in there.  This is just a bad time that will enable you to both have many good times in the years ahead.  ",

      "Content": "I was mad at the world too.  My family doctor told me anyone going thru cancer should be taking an antidepressant.  He put me on Zoloft and it really chilled me out.  Funny my surgeon or oncologist never suggested it.  It's very early days for your wife to be back at work.  She's not even healed yet.  She needs to stop working and get some rest.  She also needs help around the house and with the kids.  It was a good day for me if I could shower and make somethig to eat.  Does she have any family or friends who can help?o She no sooner recovered from surg. and they slapped her in chemo and she'll likely have radiation yet. I know you don't deserve to be yelled at and the kids couldn't possibly understand.  You guys need help and possibly close the business for a bit if she feels it can't run with out her. Get someone to take the kids on the weekend - cook dinners - clean - get her meds - do anything that will help and she'll soon turn around.  ",
