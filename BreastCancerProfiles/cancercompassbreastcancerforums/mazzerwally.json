Would radiation be harder on me than someone with less sensitive skin? Thanks in advance for any input. I had a lumpectomy and radiation. I also have a type of lymphoma which affects skin and my skin is fragile and fair.  I had 27 treatments  over 5 weeks and only burned in a minor way at the end.  I did use masses of moisturising cream and kept as cool as i could, although tiring i found radiation quite manageable.The question of mast/lump is really how you feel about yourself and your illness. (also what sort of rapport you have with your dr.)Whichever way you go, i hope it works for you. I am in my early 60s tooAll the best Mazzerwally ",
