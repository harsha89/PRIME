    "Content": "I am a three-year survivor of STAGE IIIÂ TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer), NO family history, and NO BRCA1 OR BRCA2 mutation. My tumor was 8 cm and was removed and treated by lumpectomy, chemo (A/C and T), and radiation to the left breast. My cancer showed up as a cyst in my left breast, they tested the fluid (which came back negative for cancer), and they finally decided to remove it because every time it got drained, it would just come back bigger within a week. They didn't find out it was TNBC until they disected the lining of the cyst and disected one axillary and one sentinel lymph node. I was a really weird case though (as I was 22 when I got my diagnosis), so I wouldn't think the same thing would happen to someone else. My surgeon turned it into a case study and presented it at the tumor conference in NYC in 2014, I believe.",
