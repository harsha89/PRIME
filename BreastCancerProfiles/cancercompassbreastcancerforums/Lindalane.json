      "Content": "I am 42 yrs old and a few days ago, I began having left breast pain- tender and heaviness. It felt bruised in the 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock position. Then the next day, I developed a pinkish- redness in the same area. It feels hot to touch and hard also. My areola also appears pinkish in color.  I called a surgeon who I have seen in the past and am scheduled to see him on Thursday. I have read about inflammatory breast cancer and am frightened. I want to make the most of the appt and was hoping someone could give me some suggestions. Should I insist on a biopsy-if for nothing more than to ease my mind? Thank you. Linda    ",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I am scheduled for a biopsy on Mar 1- if the shadwoing is still there. The confusing thing is you hear different opinions about shadowing. Some docs say it is nothing to worry about , others say it could be a significant finding etc. It really is frustrating. Good luck to you, also. Linda",

      "Content": "I posted in a earlier topic about finding a lump in my breast. I had an ultrasound that showed a cyst and also an area of shadowing that was of great concern to my dr. I had a mammogram that showed \"something\" but I don't have the official report yet. I saw my surgeon again yesterday who did another u/s. The cyst is gone but the area of shadowing persists. He said if the shadowing is related to the cyst then it should resolve itself. He wants me to come back on Mar 1 for another u/s. If the shadowing is still present, he will do a biopsy.  I asked him if he thought this was a malignacy and he said he didn't know. He also said he is not comfortable waiting any longer than a month to see if it is resolved. Just curious if anyone else has had \"shadowing\" on an u/s and what it meant for you. Thanks for your help. Linda",
