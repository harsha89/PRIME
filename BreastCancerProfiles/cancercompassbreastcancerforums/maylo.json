      "Content": "After 2 1/2 years on Tamoxifen, I was afraid to switch to Arimidex because of all the stories I had heard of the bone pains.  I already had knee and hip arthritis and spinal stenosis.  I have now been on Arimidex for 9 months without any pains.  We will all react differently to these meds, but don't automatically blame them for new problems.  Be sure to be tested to rule out other conditions.  I attended a lecture just a few nights ago where an oncologist recommended 1)  switching to a different AI to see if pains subside or to Tamoxifen, and 2)  try 1000 mg D3 supplements.  Also, for those of you with severe hot flashes/sweats, after I didn't have improvement when taking Effexor 75, 150 or even 225 mg, I now take 0.1 mg Clonidine and have greatly improved  (no, I'm not normal, but I rave about the difference) !",
