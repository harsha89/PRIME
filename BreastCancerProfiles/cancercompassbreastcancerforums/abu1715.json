Springflower. Thanks. Have taken fucoidan capsules/ufn but only for 10 days. Just managed to raise enough money for 120 more capsules. Have little money. What amount do one take daily? I took 6 each day at one time for 10 days. Am on Xgeva and also doing 12 ounce Noni Juice daily, 4 ounces every 6 hours???? Am also waiting for Oleander/Roselaurel opc. Any advisemhelpful. Diagnosis: Lung Cancer, Stage 4, bone metasis. Anyone can respond.",

Thanks SpringFlower for response. I am NOT in UK, never been there. I spelled the name of the drug incorrectly. It is Tarceva. I take ot once daily and receive Xgeva monthly. You mentioned fucoidan/Limu Juice and my concern is how many of the uf/n [capsul form] should be taken at one time and each day. I too am 68 years old and am familiar with the site cancertutor.com \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cancertutor.com but have seen no answer to this question. Can you help? Ahain, thanks.",
