      "Content": "Vicki325, you are absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I started doing that arm exercise after reading your posting and already my arm is more than 90% better.  The tightness is gone and I have an exceptionally increased range of motion and no pain.  Thank you so very much for your help with this.  I hope that every woman who is experiencing this proble reads this posting and does what you have suggested.   I do this exercise every morning while showering and then several times while I am at work and again before I go to bed. I can not believe the difference.  Again, Vicki325, thank you so much. You are my angel. Shirley",

I sincerely appreciate it.    ",

      "Content": "Hi  I had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed (11, I believe) in July 2007.  Starting on May 9, 2008, I have something that appears to be either a \"tendon\" or a hardened vein\" in my upper arm going to my arm pit. It is very uncomfortable and feels like its getting \"tighter\".  I had gone through my chemo sessions (8) of them and 33 radiation treatments, which ended on March 6th.  I went to see my radiation doctor and she had no clue what it is and she called my oncologist, who also had no clue what it could be. They just told me to use warm compresses and take Advil. She also advised me to follow up with my primary care physician. They didn't suggest CAT scan, x-rays, or anything like that.  I am naturally very concerned because this is all on the same side that I had the surgery on.  I just don't know which direction to go to get some help.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this or does anyone know what it could possibly be?  I would appreciate any input that's available. Thank you so much.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2007 and had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed, followed by chemo and radiation. I finished my radiation in March, 2008.  I just had a three month mammo and they did an ultrasound after the mammo. There had been a cyst in my left breast which my surgeon removed the same day he did the lumpectomy on my right breast.  My radiation oncologist told me today that the ultrasound showed two cysts in my left breast and 1 cyst in my right breast (the breast that had the cancer).  She said that we will follow up with another mammo in six months.   Is this normal?  If you cysts after having been treated for breast cancer wouldn't a physician be more pro-active in treatment and not take a \"sit and wait\" attitude?  Now I am on pins and needles and going crazy thinking that the cancer is already coming back.  Can you please give me some of your thoughts, as I just feel lost and don't know what to do or how to approach my oncologist. Thank you so much",

      "Content": "I finally stopped taking the Aromasin after 4 1/2 years because I was in so much pain and becoming totally disabled and unable to work my full-time job.  My cancer physician wanted me to start Tamoxifen to see how that would effect me.  I have decided to stop all of these cancer meds. Yes, there is a risk that the cancer will return, but I want to live my life, not be in constant pain and miserable.  Besides, there is no guarantee that any of those meds will keep the cancer from coming back.  I have been off Aromasin since November, 2013 and bit by bit the pain is letting up.  My knees feel fantastic again and the only real problem I still have is the neuropathy in my feet and toes, and I think that that is even improving bit by bit.  At least I can work my full-time job without any difficulties any more and I feel almost completely pain-free.   These physicians should be forced to try these meds and let them see what it truly feels like to be in so much agonizing pain day in and day out. ",

      "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for about 7 months and I experienced extreme joint pain, mostly in  my shoulders and knees.  My doctor started me on Lyrica 300 mg. daily and the pain has totally stopped and I feel great. They apparently use Lyrica for joint pain and fibromyalgia and diseases like that.  It has worked wonders for me and I am pain-free for the first time in months.  I have had no side effects from the Lyrica at all.  Ask your doctor about Lyrica and/or Cymbalta for your joint pain. The difference it makes is astounding.  Shirley",
