      "Content": "You are not going nuts hon. You are having a hard time at the loss of your mom. I am 52 years old . I can understand how you feel tho. I have 4 sons that are worried about me. Maybe you can talk to your doctor and ask for something to help you through this time. You are depressed and sometimes need meds to get you through. Try to find a counselour to talk with. It helps to talk to them and they are so willing to listen. I am so sorry the relatives are acting the way they are.Do not let them take advantage of you at this time They should be ashamed as your mom told of her wishes and thats how they should be. She wanted you to have her things,or she would not have said so. I wish I could talk to you but you poray and be strong . Youe dad should not treat you like this either. I am so sad for you .That is YOUR home not his! PLease try to find strength .God will get you through this! My prayers are with you! Sandie",
