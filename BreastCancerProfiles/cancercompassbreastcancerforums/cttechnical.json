      "Content": "I started taking Femara in January 2005 after five years of Tamoxifen. About June, 2005, my hair started to fall out in massive amounts by September I had bald spots on my head. I used to have very thick hair, now I look like a scare crow with scraggly thin hair. I stopped taking the Femara for about a month now and the hair is still falling out. Although I must say that all the bone and joint pain has stopped. I used to feel like my feet were just stumps on the bottoms of my legs. They were totally numb and I had a hard time walking. That has totally gone away as well as the knee pain and other aches. I've seen a number of doctors about the hair loss because at first I didn't associate it with the Femara. No one seems to know why this is happening. Anyone else with this problem?",

      "Content": "Yes, I had a blood test and my thyroid was normal, however, my doctor noticed that my iron levels were low, 11.6. So I've been taking iron supplements (38 mg 3 times a day). The only other meds I take are Fosamax, calcium supplements and a multivitamin. I've always been somewhat anemic and my iron levels have always run low, so this is not a new thing for me. Even after taking the iron supplements now for about 3 weeks, the hair loss is still happening at an alarming rate.",
