    "Content": "I am a 16 year breast cancer survivor having had two mastectomies - 13 years apart.  I found out in Sept. '08 that the cancer has spread to my bones, and I am stage 4.  I did chemo twice, and in Oct. '08 did radiation to relieve the pain in some of my bones.  I am taking Aromasin now, and other than weight gain and some depression, have not really had other side effects listed in the Walgreen's insert I get with the Rx.  I have been getting hot flashes since 1992, so when I get them, I am not too bothered by them, and they are much less intense than they were when I was on chemo.  I have had no joint pain from the Aromasin.                                 I do not know how well-known Aromasin is, but all the docs seem to know about it.  I don't know if it comes differently, but mine is a teeny, white, 25 mg pill.                                                                                       Cancer drugs are expensive - my insurance covers most of it.  Pfizer (they make Aromasin) has a program to help out women who are not insured or can't afford the Rx.  (www.aromasin.com)   I have not been hospitalized because of Aromasin, and don't expect to be.    Another responder mentioned Dr. Susan Love's books which are great, and Susan Love also has an excellent website.   Re:  Your first question:  All cancers, no matter how small, are serious, and all surgeries are invasive.  Aromasin supposedly helps stop estrogen production which is bad for breast cancers.  If it's possible, a second opinion can be a big help to alleiviate disconcerting feelings.  Nothing is written is stone- if your mother-in-law takes Aromasin and has a negative reaction, she can just stop taking it.  Maybe she could benefit by having others in the same situation talk to her directly - most hospitals have outreach or support groups, and many just by phone - at her convenience.  If she does not live near a city that has a  hospital such as M.D. Anderson, Sloan-Kettering, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Dana-Farber, Johns Hopkins, etc., she can still get on their websites or call.  People are usually so friendly and helpful.  Much luck to you.",
