      "Content": "Hi Lori, I know how scared you must be feeling right now. My cancer was found in a routine mammogram ten years after my mother died of the disease and neither of us had the gene. I couldn't tell my children until after the biopsy because I wanted to be strong for them. I did find that having support from co-workers and even my customers (I work with the public) gave me a great deal of confidence in handling all that came next. The more people talked to me about their experiences with cancer, the stronger I became and the easier it was to go through treatment. Opening up to others really helped me. I pray that you will be getting good news. Linda",

      "Content": "I started with Arimidex and after 4 months could no longer bear the severe joint pain. My doctor switched me to Femara but it was just the same. Now I am on Aromasin. It has only been 1 month but the side effects are greatly reduced. I still have stiffness and occasional moderate joint pain but nothing like the other two drugs. My doctor explained that Arimidex and Femara's chemical makeup are very similar. Their chemical symbols form a long line. With Aromasin, the symbols form more of a circular cluster. I guess my body likes circle more than line. I do find an occasional Aleve relieves the discomfort. I just hope this continues because I was ready to stop all the drugs. Quality of life is as important as length of life.",

      "Content": "Josie H. After my lumptectomy, my surgeon said that two areas of my tumor had close margins. There was definitely good tissue but not as much as he thought was medically advisable. I had a second surgery two weeks later to redo the questionable margins. He made me believe that this was a normally acceptable practice (he is with a major cancer center hospital). I still needed chemo and radiation but I feel all the treatments together have given me a greater prognosis. Many other women told me their margins needed to be redone also. Talk to your surgeon.
