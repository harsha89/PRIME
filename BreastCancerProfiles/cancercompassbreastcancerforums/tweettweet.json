      "Content": "Hello, I'm Theresa and had a stage3 breast cancer(HER2-POS) in 'o8..had chemo and radiation 14 months. then Arimidex. I would see my oncologist(real nice guy) for follow-up and I would ask how will I know if the cancer comes back. With my breast it was a no-brainer-felt lump thought it would go away...mascectomy. But, what if it moves. Well, of course they would do blood work...but I stopped going this pass Feb. My decision, not doc's. So now I am asking for anyone who may have been in this situation-how do you know if what you're feeling is cancer. Stupid question I know. But, I stopped going to doctors because I do not feel well, but nothing ever showed up. For instance I have had a pain in my back (behind the breast that had cancer) before the surgery. All say it is nothing. Now I just feel foolish, but still do not feel well most of time. I cannot explain all here.  I feel silly even asking. But, maybe someone has been in my shoes. Thanks.",

      "Content": "I sorry you can relate but, I am kinda glad you can. It is exactly what I feel. Most times the docs don't even order any kind of test. It had gotten to the point when I would have a doctor appointment, my husband would give me 50 questions, why, how come, etc. and going to the doctor he/she would say nothing to answer my question. I did have melanoma and basil cell carcinoma. I almost felt vindicated. I'm 55 been married 35 years, my sons are grown. I am not worried so much about the cancer coming back or any other sickness. I would like to feel well. No one believes me either, it is embarrassing. Please do not feel you are losing your mind...your not..I have chronic depression, I feel like it is all in my mind but then when I feel really bad...well I bet you know that feeling. Now I say nothing. If you do have panic, maybe talk to the doctor about that. Maybe it will get his attention. I feel bad for you..I guess I didn't think anyone would relate. Sorry you do. I will go to doctor if something happens that really knocks me off my feet. Please don't be on pins and needles. Hope you have a pal to talk to. If not, I don't just write me back. Thank you for easing my mind tonight. Theresa",

      "Content": "Awww...so sorry to hear that your husband had this happened to him and of course, you being his wife, it happened to you too. Well, I feel really lousy today...but I always do try to remember that the are others going through their trials and are worse than mine. I do know of phantom pain...I think that I will call my doc and see if he will order battery of tests...or just bear with it and if something gets really buggy, I will go then. Maybe thet will have something to go on then. Enough about me. Take care, please, and thank you.   tt",

I am always adjusting something to see if it makes a difference. The doctors have poo-poo'd my worries saying that all cancer patients worry and I say something like yes so lets check it. Well, yes and even those who never had it. Well, I hope that you are riding your bike all about and enjoying life. Thank you again.",

      "Content": "Hello, After reading from others I think that it is the feeling very bad and not being to get help that is so troubling. I am 55 and I do wish I could do what some 70 plus can do. I also feel shame and also don't tell others anything anymore when I do not feel well. When I do I bite my tongue. My husband and. Other in law think I do all of this so I don't have to look forward. Another shame. I don\"t work. I think I feel bad for us. Well, now I am confused...I don't know what to do. For all who have written, keep going to the doctor. Remember we pay them they don't do it for free. I guess they work for us. I hope all is well. Hope your day is wonderful. Thank you everyone. If ever you want to vent, write me, I certainly don't mind and think iknowwhere you're coming from. Take care and live today.( oh, now I sound like Oprah.) See ya, theresa",
