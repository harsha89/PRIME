    "Content": "I'm in a similar boat. My main problem has been bone thinning (broke both my feet) and concentration. I had a bilateral mastectomy too and have a very strong family history. No BRCA. I'm at the 5 year mark and now read 10 years is possibly better. I would really like to stop but the potential alternative is a road we're all trying to avoid. I'm curious what kind of feedback you get on your question and hope for a lot of replies.                                                                         All the best.",
