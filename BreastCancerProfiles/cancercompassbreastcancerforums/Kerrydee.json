    "Content": "Hello everyone. My mother was diagnosed with lung cancer recently but previously she was also diagnosed with breast cancer. She had treatments previously and is currently receiving chemotherapy. She is very ill. Last year they found a lump in my right breast and an ABBI biopsy was performed. The lump was tagged and surgically removed and found to be benign. The surgeon however warned me their were precancerous conditions present. Could anyone tell me if they have had success with specific foods to combat the cancer  with or without chemotherapy. I have read several things regarding licorice root and beans and even confusing info about soy. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",
