      "Content": "Actually they where suppose to give me the glute When I started my A/c,,,(they for got to tell me) It is suppose to help your muscles and joints through any Chemo. I don't know if you can get it at Walmarts. YOU can get it at a health food store or at a GNC. GEt the powder. You can take the pills but they are big and you would have to take to many of then a day to get the dosage you need. YOU take 2 teaspoons of powder(I mix it in orange juice)3 times a day. I just mix it in less than half a glass of juice. I will probably use it the rest of my life because it is good for the joints and muscles. HOwever I don't really know if it has helped me or not with the chemos. THe taxol I am taking now I have had alot of pain with my bones and muscles. But I have only 1 more treatment Thank the Lord!!!!! THen it is on to radiation. My prayers are with you through your ordeal. Hang in there!!! Steph",

      "Content": "I had my first treatment this last tuesday of taxotere. Thursday same week the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet turned so red to almost purple couldn't walk which upset me since that was all I had to do for enjoyment since starting my treatments of a/c then this taxotere. I thought it would be a walk throuh a park compared to a/c boy was I wrong. I also broke out into a sever rash.Mu husband went to my treatment center Fri,morning to let them know I needed some help they told him to go buy some L glutamine to keep me form getting further damage to my nerves. Which I started taking immediatly, But Mon, was no better, so I went up there and showed the Nurses what was going on plus I was also throwing up. when they saw me I think it scared them, They immediatly put me in treatment chair and started an IV of nausea medicine and steriods. Then sent in a subscription of steriods for me to take. I am feeling alot better now thank goodness. But the Nurses said that they are sure my oncologist will do something different at my next treatment which is a week from this Tues, He better cause I don't think I can go through all that again, Do any of you know of an alternative to taxotere other than taxol. THey are to much alike I think.",
