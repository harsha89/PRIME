      "Content": "Hi, I am so sorry you are going through this.  I finished chemo 6 weeks ago and I too have noticed my fibromyalgia (diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic) increasing in challenging pain. You are not crazy!!  I too am searching /googling for the connection and what proactive things I can do to work out of this cycle. I seem to feel better after walking, good sleep of 7 hours +, the normal supplements for fibro, drinking lots of water, careful healthy, whole food diet. And prayer! :) Blessings! Hang in there!
