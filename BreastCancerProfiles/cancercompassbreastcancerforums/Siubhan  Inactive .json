I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years now, having had a mastectomy in November 2003. Firstly I had hardly any side effects and slowly but surely they seem to be building up, some days far worse than the next. I have never had nausea though, thank goodness. The main side effects which I am experiencing now are aching bones and joints, mainly while trying to sleep at night. Also tiredness and seem to want to just go to bed to rest from as early as 8 in the evening - this is sad as I always went to bed late before my breast cancer. I also contemplated coming off the drug but decided that as the cancer hasn't come back at all in almost 2 years then perhaps I am doing the right thing in taking it every day. lear.Was on Tamoxifen for 2 years and changed over to Arimidex about 6 months ago. I am getting aches and pains which are getting worse and worse. GP has checked me for all the usual things - athritis, etc but all showing up clear. Now it's really bad - back is sore all the time, shooting pains in hands and shins and upper arms.  At night it is particularly bad. both my hands go numb at night with pins and needles and lack of sleep is driving me insane.  Oncologist is suggesting I go back on the Tamoxifen.  Anyone else having these symptoms?  ",

I no longer have joint pain...Irene Braedon - I have only recently started taking Arimidex after 2 years on Tamoxifen. I have struggled with joint pain and shooting pains in my arms and legs. At night my back gets sore and both my hands get pins and needles at night.  My back is so sore now that I am being taken back off the Arimidex and onto Tamoxifen.  I'm assuming the Tamoxifen is as good a drug for me and, apart from flushes, I was coping fine on the Tamoxifen  ",
