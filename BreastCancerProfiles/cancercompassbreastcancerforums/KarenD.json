      "Content": "Dear Scared, In my experience and all I have learned since my diagnosis is that once you have your surgery they can get a clear view to how extensive the cancer is and get an accurate pathology report to identify your receptor status.  This is instrumental in determining the best course of treatment for you.  So until that time they cannot be sure what is right for you, so I would say have your surgery and go from there.  It will take time for you to heal from surgery and that will give you the time to ask questions and review all of you options because you will then have a specific diagnosis of the actual cancer that is in your body.  I did not have radiation due to the fact that the cancer had already spread to another organ in the body through the blood stream, so there was no purpose being that radiation is usually given at the place of origin to keep the cancer from spreading. This is a very scary time for you and there are so many emotions you are feeling and you don't know quite how to filter them, this is normal.  It does get easier, but for right now give yourself permission to feel every emotion and deal with them the best way for you.  It IS ok to cry, feel scared, feel lonely, and feel it is not fair.  Its ok to have good days, and to have bad days,  Its ok to feel sorry for yourself, or to feel angry about your diagnosis.  The only thing thats not ok is to get stuck there.  As long as you can still keep going and keep fighting you are going to have ups and downs.  You absolutely can ask for a prognosis, however it may be too early to tell, again after sugery they know so much more about your specific diagnosis that the doctors can answer your questions better.  I will pray for you not only to get healthy but for your emotional well being through all of this because I think sometimes thats the hardest part. God Bless you and I will be thinking of you, Karen",

      "Content": "I am 43 yrs old and was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer in June 2007.  I had a be-lateral mastectomy and 15 months of 5 dfferent types of chemotherapy.  The cancer has spread to the liver, bone, lymph nodes, and now a tumor in the pec muscle.  The bones affected are the spine (all of it), the hip bone, and arm bone.  I stopped taking chemo in November because it was only making me sick and was not killing the cancer.  I then tried a homeopathic regimen and the cancer still spread and grew.  I am now looking at a clinical trial at John Hopkins in Baltimore.  I have recently developed intermittent high fevers (highest was 103.6), severe sweats, liver pain, severe nausea, and chest pain.  The doctor has ruled out infection of any kind and says that this is simply \"progression of disease\".  She calls the fever \"tumor fevers\" and says the pain in the stomach and chest are caused by the liver swelling a putting pressure on these areas.  The sweating is also a side effect of the liver becoming damaged.  They are treating it with Naproxen (for swelling and fever), and pain killers and that is all that can be done.  I have been getting the fevers and pain for a month now.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Can any of you off any information in regard to this?  There is very little on the internet about \"tumor fevers\".  I appreciate anything anyone has to offer. I just found this site, so I am brand new, but I like having a link to people who know how I feel and what I am going through. Karen",
