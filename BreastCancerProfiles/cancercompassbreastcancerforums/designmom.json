      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy early this year followed by a week long session of intense radiation twice a day.  My right breast has also formed a very hard lump that the doctor said is the size of a small grapefruit.  It is painful all the time but especially if it is pressed on in any way.  My right arm is also very tight but has loosened up with stretching.  My breast sits very high and has some dimpling because it seems like it is pulling and constricting.  I have been working with a physical therapist and a scar tissue massage therapist. I finally met with a plastic surgeon specializing in breast repair from cancer and she has suggested that I wait a few months to see if it softens at all because the reconstruction would be so intense because of the large area affected.  She said it would be the equivalent to repair from a mastectomy.  If it doesn't soften on its own she wants to try the same needling technique your doctor did.  She says I will have to have to reconstruction on both breasts to try to make them match because we will need to reduce the size of my unaffected left breast. So many of these comments on this board are older and I am hoping to get some follow up from all of you.  Could you please let me know if you have had success with any kinds of treatments and what has happened with your hardened breasts over the last few years?  I don't know anyone who has dealt with this and even my doctors seem to act like this is very unusual to be so large.   Thank you for sharing!!   ",
