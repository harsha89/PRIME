    "Content": "I am caring for someone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer first and then three years later a Merkel cell skin cancer. A cyst appeared like a benign cyst on my back but doubled in size over three months and a biopsy revealed Merkel Cell Skin cancer which is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer. What is worrying is that treatment options for Merkel cell cancer is still very limited.Â  Does anyone here have the unfortunate experience of dealing with breast cancer and then another type of cancer?",
