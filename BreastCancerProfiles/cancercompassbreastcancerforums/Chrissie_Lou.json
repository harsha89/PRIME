      "Content": "Hi there, I was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma breast cancer last March.  I had a 5 cm lump with no nodes involved.  I chose to have chemo first - 6 rounds of Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Cyclophosphamide administered every 3 weeks.  The chemo reduced my lump to 1.8 cm, but I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy anyway since it is such an aggressive cancer.  I also had 33 radiations treatments to my chest wall after the surgery.  It has been 3 months since I finished everything and I am feeling 100 percent again.  I just saw the oncologist this week and he said everything looked good.  I am quite content with the bilateral mastectomy and have no plans to get reconstruction.  I don't mind wearing the protheses during the day and my husband has been very supportive of my decision to not reconstruct.  I see no reason to have more surgery.  I know all too well the frustrations of trying to make the best decisions with so little information out there about this type of cancer. I can only tell you that after reading many books, communicating with others through this message board, and deep soul searching I made the decisions about my treatments and chose never to second guess whether my decisions were the best ones.  I had to do what felt right to me and you must do the same for yourself. I'm sorry that you have this fight ahead of you, but I am living evidence that the battle can be won!  Stay strong, look for humor every chance you get and keep in touch.  I wish you the very best!  Chris      ",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm so sorry to hear about your diagnosis.  I was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma in my right breast 11 months ago.  My lump was 5 centimeters.  Mine had not spread to the lymph nodes and my scans were clear.  I had chemo first (6 rounds of TAC).  The size of my lump reduced to 1.8 cm. so the chemo was quite effective.  I still chose to have a mastectomy (bilateral) and am glad I did.  I didn't mind having chemo first because it gave me time to really mentally prepare for the mastectomy vs. lumpectomy decision.  Due to the size of the lump I also had 33 radiation treatments to the chest wall.  I finished all treatments in November and just had a follow-up visit with my oncologist.  All is clear now and I am better than ever!   I know that it's scary knowing what you face ahead of you, but hang in there.  I am a success story and have confidence that you will be, too! Please let me know if I can answer any other questions for you or help in any way.  There are several of us on the message board that remain in contact with one another who have had metaplastic carcinoma and are doing well.   Best wishes, Chris",

      "Content": "I have not heard of Chondroid cartilage, but I was diagnosed with Metaplastic Carcinoma in my right breast in March of this year.  Since then I have had 6 rounds of chemotherapy using TAC.  I am now finished with chemo and the original tumor, which was 5 cm, has reduced in size by more than half.  Although the tumor reduced enough to be eligible for a lumpectomy, my husband and I (along with the breast surgeon's agreement) decided that it would be best for me to go ahead and do a bilateral mastectomy.  I am scheduled for surgery in a few weeks. I will still need radiation because of the original size of the lump.   Like you, I had a very hard time finding information specific to metaplastic carcinoma.  None of the multitude of books I read had anything about it.  The only place I found information was through the Internet and that was lacking, too.  Some of the things I read were very discouraging and then other items I read resulted in good survival rates.  After getting totally frustrated I finally had to tell myself that each case is different and I really didn't know all of the facts so I couldn't compare myself to them.  I'm just me and I plan to beat this and be a long-term survivor!  This discussion board has been the most interesting to me because at least I know there are a few people out there with the same type of cancer who were just as confused and lacking information as I was. I had to put all my faith and trust in my team of doctors, who have been wonderful. Personally, I have responded very well to chemo and was not too bothered by the side effects.  Being 48 years old and in pretty good shape, along with a positive outlook has helped me get through these past 4 months without too much trouble.   It sounds like your tumor is pretty small and you caught it early, which is great!  I hope that can find the answers you are looking for and that all goes well with your treatment.  Please feel free to keep in touch with me, ask questions, or just vent your feelings if you need to through this discussion board. I've been there, am still in the process of being there, and am willing to help you in any way I can! I wish you the best. Chris  ",

      "Content": "I can understand why your daughter might think a mastectomy is a rather radical move if your lump is small and in an appropriate place to easily do a lumpectomy.  But lumpectomies generally require radiation afterward.  I have read a lot of personal stories and talked to a few woman who had a lumpectomy and then ended up with a mastectomy later on when they had a recurrence.  On the other hand, I saw some studies that proved that the chance of recurrence is no greater with a lumpectomy than a mastectomy. My surgeon said that with metaplastic carcinoma the recurrence rate is perhaps about 2% higher with a lumpectomy, but not a significant difference. I think it all comes down to personal choice and what you feel most comfortable with.  I am choosing to have the mastectomy because I feel (and my husband does, too) that my breasts and my looks are less important than my life and I will feel more comfortable knowing that the cancerous breast is totally gone. I am having the healthy breast removed also because I am large breasted and it throws you off balance and can cause back pain if left there.  Also, it will be easier to match breasts during reconstruction if I choose to reconstruct later on. As far as your needing chemo after surgery, I don't know what to tell you.  Every case is different and you really need to listen to what the oncologist tells you, but question him/her as to why he/she is recommending this path for you.  If you are uncomfortable with his/her recommendation then by all means seek a 2nd opinion.  I never got a 2nd opinion because what my doctors were telling me went right along with what I read in the books I have.  I first purchased Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and that provided me lots of useful information about every topic imaginable regarding breast cancer.  There are many other good resources out there also.  My doctor also had a couple of woman in the area call and talk to me about their experiences. It is my understanding that chemotherapy is not used to treat the local cancer in the breast - but rather to kill any cancer cells that may have spread to the rest of your body to keep it from metastasizing elsewhere. Chemo may seem scary, but they have so many drugs to counteract the side effects that it is a whole lot better than it used to be.   Please keep in touch and let me know how you're doing.  Again, I wish you the best!

      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear that you are depressed, in pain, frustrated, and miserably sore!  I have not heard of lymphnodeatosis, nor does my web browser recognize this word.  I do know that lymphedema is a condition that can develop after lymph nodes have been removed that causes swelling and pain. Are you black and blue as in bruising?  When my skin turned blue after the dye injection for my sentinel node surgery, it looked totally different than a bruising type of blue - it looked like medium blue tinted skin.  (My urine was that color for a couple of times, also!)   I am having my bilateral mastectomy on Friday (Aug. 22), so I'll be able to identify more with the pain you're experiencing after that.  My doctor said that it would be over a week before the drains could be removed - they could be removed once the drainage was less than 30 mL for two 24-hour periods.  Every case is different, so there is no telling how long that will take.  I'm sorry that it is taking so long to get back your test results.  It is my understanding that biopsying the lymph nodes helps to determine if the cancer has spread, but it isn't full-proof.  So your doctor is correct, he/she can't tell you if it has metatacized until the test results are back.  From my research, I gather that in most cases, with metaplastic carcinoma, the lymph nodes are negative.  Mine were, but we still did chemo to treat the rest of the body in case the cells had spread to other parts of my body.  This was because my lump was so large (5 cm).    I do hope that every day you are feeling better.  I've been trying my best to keep optimistic and positive about my upcoming surgery.  I know it will be tough, but I'll just take it one day at a time.  I can't question the choices I made to have the surgery and chemo because there's no turning back.  I just have to keep moving forward and work on healing.  I hope that you can do the same. Let me know how your test results turn out - I'm hoping for the best for you! Chris        ",

I have had a wonderful team of doctors at Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida.  At no time have they discouraged me or given me any reason to believe that my chances of recurrence are much greater than most forms of cancer.  However, I will say that I did not have any lymph nodes involved nor had my cancer metastacized anywhere else.  All of my recent check-ups have been positive and my doctors have gone so far as to say I'm currently cancer-free.  My lump was large (5cm) and the chemotherapy did reduce it considerably (to 1.8 cm) before my surgery.  I could have had a lumpectomy, but I chose to go ahead with the bilateral mastectomy anyway.   Every case is different so it's hard to say what will work for your sister-in-law.  You said she was diagnosed over a year ago.  What type of treatments has she had so far?  Has the cancer metastasized  or spread to the lymph nodes?   I wish for the best for both of you.  Please let me know if I can answer any other questions or be of further support for you.  Chris",

I am 48 years old.  I was stage IIB and all my hormone receptors were negative.  I had a rare form of BC - metaplastic carcinoma.  My lump was 5 cm. and they treated me with chemo first (6 rounds of TAC), then surgery, and finally 33 radiation treatments. Chemo reduced the size of my lump to 1.8 cm. - but I chose to have a double mastectomy anyway - just a personal preference - though I could have opted for a lumpectomy.  I was glad to have the chemo first because it gave me time to research and consider surgery options.   I finished all treatments in November and do not take any hormones. I will see my oncologist for a follow up visit next month but so far all seems to be well.  Though not pleasant - I handled all of my treatments well and I am extremely grateful for the care my doctors gave me.  It was all scary at first, but with a positive attitude and great support I made it through.  I am actually astounded at how quickly the months flew by.

I meet with the breast surgeon next week to discuss and schedule surgery - that's my big worry right now - but I think I've worked through my mental issues with it.  I also have to have radiation, so I won't be able to have reconstruction immediately.   My hair has been gone since I buzzed it in April.  I love the cool, bald look at home.  I live in Florida and the bald head keeps me cool, especially during those hot flashes that chemo created when it put me through early menopause!  My wigs are great for going out. It takes just a couple of minutes to put one on, brush it, and head out the door.   I decided to buy 2 different looks, short, and shoulder length, and 2 different colors.  It's fun to play around with the different styles.  I've had so many compliments on my wigs that I'm going to take them to my hair dresser and tell her to make my real hair look like my wigs when it grows back.  I found great, inexpensive wigs online at the American Cancer Society store Website.  Their service was quick and easy and I even easily returned a 3rd wig I ordered when it caused my son and husband to laugh at my new Tina Turner look. I must admit, I didn't care for it either!  So, don't worry about the hair loss - it's a chance to have fun with your looks!  I've also worn a lot of scarves if I'm just running out for a quick errand.   Chemo has been tolerable - the anti-nausea medicine and steroids for 3 days each cycle have really helped.  I haven't been sick at all!  I hope you have wonderful results.  Good luck with your reconstruction and hysterectomy.    Chris",
