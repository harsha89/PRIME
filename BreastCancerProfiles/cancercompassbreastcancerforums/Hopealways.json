      "Content": "Hi, I just joined here today and saw your message. I too have extreme bone/joint pain from arimidex, my onc recommended glucosamine/chondroitin which helps a bit and I find exercise also helps. Fatigue is also one of the side effects which I'm sure you know so I hope your ct turns out fine and this all it is. At least you're doing the right thing by having it checked as early detection does make a difference. My friend had bone mets which did travel to her brain but had surgery and rads a year ago and is doing well. My best wishes for benign results. Hope always!",
