There are more cases of uterine cancer amongst Tamoxifen patients than in the general population but taking Tamoxifen is NOT a sure fire way to get uterine cancer. It does mean that a pelvic scan should be done every year to closely monitor the uterus. We need to be careful of the message we give to people here as many people read this board. Our doctors are best placed to have the judgement and knowledge to decide between Tamoxifen or Arimidex. Best wishes, long life and good health to you too!  Dochas",

I am nearly 3 years out from a stage 3 breast cance diagnosis, located in Europe and taking Tamoxifen for the past 2 years. Based on what I read on European cancer-related web sites, Tamoxifen IS being widely prescribed in Europe. I know many ladies taking it. I guess doctors chose one or other treatment depending on age, risk factors, general health, cancer type and many other reasons we are not aware of. For some people Aridex might be the most appropriate treatments, for others Tamoxifen. I don't think we can make blanket statements about these treatments. Dochas",

      "Content": "Hello Momismyhero, You have got some good advice here! One thing that was not mentioned I think is how important it is for your mother to stay as active as possible. Physical activity reduces the side effects of the treatments and lowers the risk of recurrence. As well as keeping her healthy in many other ways too. http://www.dana-farber.org/For-Adult-Cancer-Survivors/Expert http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232406.php There will be good days and bad days during treatment. She should make the most of the good days to lead as normal a life as possible. Cancerkeys's message brought up a few points that I think need some further explanation. Going out is important but your mom needs to be very careful of the sun. Chemo makes you sensitive to the sun. So she needs sunglasses, a hat, and to cover up with clothes or sunscreen to protect herself. If she has radiotheraphy she needs to really reduce her expose to the sun and get her outside exercise in the early morning or evening. Radiotheraphy will give you as much radiation in 6 weeks of treatment as an average person gets in a year. Treated skin must be covered, including the exit area on her back. If she has Taxotere or Taxol she needs to use very dark nail varnish to protect her nails from the light. To start with two clear varnish undercoat layers, then two layers of dark varnish. And to only use removers that ARE NOT acetone based. This will reduce the damage to her nails. I have never heard of not eating fresh fruit and vegetables while on chemo. It sounds like a sure fire way to end up with even worse constipation. She needs to wash any produce she eats raw. Cooked fruit and vegetables are easier to eat and digest in the first few days after each chemo. I was devastated to hear that I had cancer and even more so to hear that I needed chemo. I can honestly say that it was no walk in the park for sure but definitely not as bad as I had feared it would be. I hope your mom's treatment goes as well as possible. Sending best wishes to you both Dochas",

In many cases surgery is enough but it is impossible to be sure so depending on the type and grade of the cancer most doctors will recommend other treatments as well as surgery to lower the risk of recurrence. With respect, you cannot generalize that what worked for you would be OK for everyone.  Dochas Dochas ",

Even if the depression seems to have kicked in with Tamoxifen, it may not be directly linked to it. If you have not done so already, it might be better to try to treat the depression by counselling and medication while keeping up your Tamoxifen.  Exercise helps with depression as well as protecting you from recurrence. It might be worth doing a little more if you can. Take care Dochas",

      "Content": "Hi Sarah, Welcome! Though of course I am sorry you had to join us. A word of warning. It might look to a newcomer here that there are many people successfully treating cancer with alternative treatments. Yes, there are many people TRYING alternatives, but very, very few who post back with credible cure or remission stories.  But there are many inspirational people here who reach out to others, listen and can really understand what you are going through. My advice would be to follow the advice of the doctors especially as your mother has other risk factors to be taken into account. A risk of blood clots is not a risk you'd ever want to take. If you want to try supplements make sure you get agreement from her doctors before starting treatment. Best wishes to you and your family Dochas",

Sadly there are cancers that continue to resist all efforts to find a cure. Who knows, maybe the ultimate cures will come from what is today an alternative treatment. Believe me, I would be only too delighted if that came true. If there is a cure behind the Greek treatment, then why is it not published? Your doctors should be writing medical articles rather than you writing a book. In the meantime, I cannot but find the notion of our doctors being \"evil\" totally offensive. We are all free to take conventional treatment or seek out alternatives.  There is no need to be offensive or insulting. Dochas",

In every country in the world. Just not credible. For people interested only in money there are easier ways to earn it than years of study, long hospital hours and the life and death issues doctors face every day. Sadly, there are indeed people preying on vulnerable cancer patients but they are not conventional doctors. Many serious diseases have been pretty much eradicated in the past, TB, smallpox, polio to mention a few. The health care industry has not suffered from this. There are several other lines of research that could be persued if cancer was eradicated. It is unjust and offensive to challenge the knowledge and ethics of the people who have helped so many of us here on CC to be here in good health today. Dochas",
