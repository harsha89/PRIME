Had maste,chemo 6 months, then went on tamox for 3 months, started getting blurred vision, switched to arimidex and then the real pain began..could have used a cane for walking...quit that..My oncolgist is really unhappy, but I dont believe that it is necessary to take those specific drugs to live...am doing alternative medicine for aromatase inhibitors like Dim, melatonin, vitamin d, mangosteen juice, green tea extract, maitake d mushroom extract, fish oils, little to no dairy, organic everything as much as possible walking 30 or more everyday........cant live the other way Hello Diane, How long have you been on your non-chemical regeime? this is very important to me. I quit Arimedex after 6 years of depression, weight gain and lost libido. I told my husband I wanted off the drugs and we would just take our chances. This was April 2008. By December 2008 I had gone through a blood clot relating to a lymph node involvement (cancerous) and diagnosed with BC in my lung. Just finished chemo last month..  my current onc. says that it came back since I quit the aromatase inhibitors. I was doing some organic methods with fish oil, curcumin, mangosteen, etc. but it did not work he says.  Now I am feeling like I will essentially be committing suiside if I stop taking Aromasin and trying to go natural. Very confusing.        Yes, I also have no choice re taking of the aromatase inhibitors. I had right breast mastectomy, 4 sessions of chemo and radiation. I have researched the effects of all these drugs and it is not an easy choice. I would like to try tamoxifen, but cannot do so since I have a uterus and ovaries and it can cause uterine cancer. The research favors the AI but there is also research that shows that Tamoxifen works long after it has been stopped. I also take natural supplements i,e. Vit D, Aloe, rasberry, Q10 plus am researching artemsin (sp) which is being studied as an alternative to chemo.   A woman who monitored me in the hospital said she had lobular cancer and has survived taking the anti-estrogen drugs. We can offset some of the side effects but we have to be constantly vigilant. -s      -    ",
