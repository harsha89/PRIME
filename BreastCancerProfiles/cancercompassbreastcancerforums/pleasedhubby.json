      "Content": "Just rec'd your plea for help.  Laura's treatment worked so well, her immunsystem began attacking her own bone marrow.  She died in February.  As for Xeloda, I believe the answer is yes, because that was the back-up treatment for Laura.  Check with you oncologist.  I still believe in Dr. Har-Noy's Allostim and Allovax treatments.  They simply need to be refined.  It is currently being looked at very closely at University hospital in Denver, University of Arizona, and Northwestern in Chicago.  Google his name and Immunovative therapies.",

      "Content": "Try googling Immunovative Therapies, Dr. Michael Har-Noy (Haddasah University, Israel), Dr. Emmanuel Katsanis (Unversity of Arizona) and their combination of Allostim with CRCL.  This is no joke.  It appears they may well have found the real treatment for many if not all cancers.  Dr. Har-Noy has a clinical trial in Carlsbad, CA soon to begin, but restricted only to colorectal.  My wife has breast-to-bone, and we are currently in Bangkok recieving treatments.  This is amazing science, not quakery.  Dr. Har-Noy's background is in bone marrow transplant and has found a way to avoid graft vs. host toxicity and by linking his patented Allostim (living donor T-cells) with CRCL monoclonal antibodies, it is a deadly combination for specific cancers.  Not just a cure, but also a vaccine.  In other words you won't get it again.  Amazing.  My wife, like your mother, has been battling recurrences for some time.  This appears to be the \"holy grail\" all have been searching for. ",
