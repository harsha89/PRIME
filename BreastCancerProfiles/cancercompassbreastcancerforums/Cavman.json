      "Content": "Yes,she is Her2 Positive. She is a little frail so the doctors recommend Herceptin, no chemo and they say they will moniter her heart because of previous strokes (2) and previous irregular heartbeat. The pill proposed is a Hormonal Therapy medication. She says with her age (74) and condition she doesn`t want any more medication to make her feel more tired. She is kind of giving up and I am so depressed about it. I recently fought a stage 4 tonsil/lymphnode cancer and I want her to fight as I did. Ron (her son)",

      "Content": "My mother was originally diagnosed with Stage 0 Breast Cancer. She went on the doctor`s advice and had her one breast removed 3 weeks ago. She was told with a lumpectomy that she would have to have radiation and possibly chemo afterwards. The breast was removed and now she is told she is a Stage II. They give her 3 choices for treatment. (1)  Some type of pill and I can`t remember the name. (2)  Herceptin given by i.v. every 3 weeks for 15 months. (3)  Chemo once a week for 2 months. She has had a stroke and has a couple stents implanted. Of course with each choice increases chances of surviving more. They recommend the Herceptin for 15 months. My mom wants to take the pill. Has anyone taken the Herceptin and if so what were the side effects please? Anything anyone can tell me or advice will help tons.  Her son.....Ron (stage 4 cancer survivor)",
