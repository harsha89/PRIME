      "Content": "Hi Carol - Just wanted to send you a note to say keep your chin up.  I am 18 years out from my first occurrance and 6 years out from my second occurance.  I know what you mean about feeling old and your brain not quite being what it use to be.  Hang in there.  One day you will suddenly realize that \"Hey I don't feel that way anymore...when did that happen?\" It is slow, but try not to be discouraged.  I am 50 and a couple of years ago I felt 90....but now I no long have many effects (I can not longer add numbers in my head - but according to my husband I never could anyway - I just thought I could - Ha!)  Hang in there, be patient and God bless. ",
