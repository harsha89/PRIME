    "Content": "Just had a callback for a repeat mammogram after my usual annual check.  Had further views and ultrasound.  Radiologist told me it was just cyst, no need for further tests or to have it aspirated.  I've been menopausal for 3-4 years and never taken HRT.  I've since read that cysts are almost unheard of in postmenopausal women and should be treated with suspicion.  Family history of breast cancer (sister, premenopausal breast cancer) but no cancer myself.  Any menopausal sisters out there with cysts?  Thanks!",
