My gyn dr. said it's nothing that the other dr. who read the report is just being cautious. I did have thyroid cancer and had surgery this past January. A little nervous. Thank you for any help and advice.  ",

Thank you for any help and advice.   I was informed today that I also have complex cyst, and a biopsy was also recomended, I meet with a surgen next week and I assume I will get set up for a biopsy at that time.  I'm alittle nervous too, but from what I read on line, a  maligant complex cyst is rare, so I would rather be safe than sorry, so good luck to you and try not to worryThank you for writing back. Just a little worried since I had Thyroid surgery in January for cancer. I thought the Thyroid cyst I had was nothing. Will be going for a fine needle aspiration at the end of September. Not really sure what a complex cyst is? I did read the same. Rare the time it is malignant. Can't wait to get this over with. Good luck and positive thinking. Please let me know and I will do the same.",
