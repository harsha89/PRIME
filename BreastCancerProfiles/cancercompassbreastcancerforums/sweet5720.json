      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed just a few days ago with breast cancer.   She was told it was stage 9 invasive, which I have not heard of stage 9.  They did say it was the worst stage.  Does anyone know what that means?  She just had her MRI yesterday and we'll get the results when we meet with the surgeon on Monday.  I am just numb.  I can't even imagine the thought of losing my mother.  I have a 5 year old son that thinks of her as his second mom and an infant daughter.  I am the strong one in our family but I am having a very had time holding it together.  So far so good though.   My next question is about donating my hair.  I have very long hair that I was actually getting ready to donate to locks of love prior to this happening.  Now I would like to donate it for a wig for my mom.  Does anyone know how I could get something like this done?",

I am 58 and had no problem with my decision nor did my husband who only wants my life.  I am lucky in that I think!  Your mom needs to seriously talk with her oncologist - and if he or she doesn't give her the answers she needs, then she needs to get a different oncologist.  I consulted 3 oncolcogists before I found the one I felt comfortable with.  Believe me, they are used to it, regardless of how the receptioness may make you feel.  YOU are paying for this and YOU are in CHARGE. Ask all the questions you have and don't stop until you have all the answers you want.  I don't know where you live, but where I am ( in Iowa) I have acess to a Cancer Clinic Counselor who has helped me so much to navigate the cancer system.  I'm sure you have a similar system where you are - if you can't find it, let me know - I will find it for you.  There is help for us - it's just not always easy to find!  Love  to you   Robin Hi Robin.  Thank you so much for your reply.  My mom recently has found what is possibly another tumor above her mastectomy scar.  They did the biopsy yesterday and we will find out tomorrow if it is cancerous or not.  She only had her mastectomy 10 weeks ago and they told us the entire tumor was removed.  Anyway, you said something about a Cancer Clinic Counselor.  My mom has not been comfortable with her oncologist and if we need to start this process over she would like to find a new one.  I have tried to find a counselor such as what you were speaking about but with no luck.  Can you help me?  We are located in Southern Indiana.  Take care, Kristen",

      "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer in December of 2007.  She has gone through 2 different sets of chemo treatment, just had the masectomy and is starting chemo again.  She has great doctors but I am just confused on what life expectancy of someone diagnosed with what she has is.  From what I've read about the different stages, she does not completely fall into stage 3.  She did have a very large tumor, 7 cm I believe.  It had spread to 3 lymph nodes, but not to anywhere else in her body.  When they removed the tumor the outside of it texted negative for cancer, which means they removed all of the cancerous tissue successfully.  The doctors don't offer much information other than when her next appointment is (and I know they can't predict anything) and my mother is terrified to ask questions because she's scared of what the answers will be.  I am just looking for anyone who can offer me any opinion about this.  I know it's just an opinion, but I am desperate for someone to tell me something about what she is going through and what the final outcome may be.  I am looking for any information or maybe someone with a similiar diagnosis.  I keep thinking that she has to make it through this because they removed all of the tumor, it hasn't spread and it was only in 3 lymph nodes.  Thank you.",

      "Content": "My mom had a radical mastectomy about 7 weeks ago.  Recovery for her has been awful.  The wound healed fine, however the worry that something is coming back is awful.  She was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer and a very fast growing tumor and there were 10 lymph nodes involved.  A few weeks after her surgery she felt another lump above her incision and when she went to the surgeon he said it felt like a little bit of fluid and some breast tissue and was just probably a cyst.  Now she is having pain, somewhat feeling like a pulled muscle and it appears to her that it is more swollen.  She is terrified it is her tumor growing back.  I have searched for anything that says how the body heals after a mastectomy and cannot find any information past when the staples are taken out.  Can anyone who has been through this help me?  I would love any information about how the body changes and what the wound and around the wound will look like weeks after surgery.  Thank you so much in advance.",
