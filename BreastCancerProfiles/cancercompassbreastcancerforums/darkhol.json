    "Content": "Hi, my mother (66) just finished her treatment of Tamoxifin for 2 1/2 years then Aromasin for 2 1/2 years for breast cancer. She has been off of Aromasin for a week and half. She has been complaining of being very tired and dizziness, light-headed and not feeling herself since being off the medicine. She never had any problem while she was on it besides joint pain.   Did any one here  have any side effects  of going off of Aromasin. Thanks in advance.. Cindy D",
