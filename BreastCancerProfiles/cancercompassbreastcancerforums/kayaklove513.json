    "Content": "Hello ladies, I'm new to this message board and found you when I did a search about side effects of Femara.  I started with Arimidex in January, 2015 but switched to Femara about 3 months ago to see if the joint pain would be less.  I am in terrible pain now.  I called my oncologist's office today and spoke to the nurse who contacted the doctor.  I have decided to take myself off of the Femara for a few weeks and see if I improve at all.  They understood that I want to see if I improve, however, after reading some of  your posts I wonder if I'll see any relief in only a few weeks time.  I've had osteo arthritis since I was 31 and now I'm 62, so I started this process in bad shape.   The terrible weight gain is the other reason I want to take a break from the Femara. I've gained over 10 lbs since January.  How do you excercise to lose the weight when your knees, legs and feet are in so much pain?  It's a visious cycle.  Even my regular \"gentle progessive\" arthritis swimming class caused knee pain.  It has helped me to read your stories -- now I know that I'm not going crazy.  I'm already on Celebrex for arthritis so I'm not supposed to take Advil or Aspirin.  I'll be asking my doctor about that. Thank  you for your input and sharing your stories. blessings, ct",
