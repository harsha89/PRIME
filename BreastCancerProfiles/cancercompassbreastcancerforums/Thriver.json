      "Content": "Hello Francis: I have been to have a \"live blood test\" which is fascinating if you ever get the chance to have one. The person who gave me this test, markets Innerlight products for Alkalinity and he is very knowledgeable about alternative medicine. He told me that Apple Cider Vinegar will make you alkaline, however, not in a constructive way. He said that when you take it, that it is such an acidic shock to your body that calcium is leached out of your bones, in an overreactive manner in order to alkalize the acid shock to your body, that the Apple cider vinegar causes. He said that Dairy is the same way, as it is Lactic Acid. There are more constructive ways to become alkaline that do not effect your bones. Following, are a couple of pretty interesting websites. I have recently started to become more alkaline by taking Nature's Way Coral Calcium. I take 2 or 3 scattered throughout the day and then 3 at night when I go to bed. You can order it from Natures Way online or buy it at Vitamin Cottage. Other health food stores may have it as well. I had tried other brands but Natures Way is the only one that works for me I also take PH Balance one pill 3 times a day. I spit on a piece of the PH test strips and also pee on one first thing in the morning. The strips I like come in a roll and are by Enzymedica. You can also get these at Vitamin Cottage and online. If you buy PH Balance, they have some in the bottle. I do believe that the Natures Way Coral Calcium (http://www.naturesway.com) has made the biggest difference as I had taken other brands of Coral Calcium without good results. I do believe that Brand makes a big difference. cts,(http://www.innerlightinc.com) which I may start again after I am finished with the Purity Vitamins and greens that I have ordered. I will always continue to take the Natures Way Coral Calcium regardless of what vitamin program I settle on. The website that I spoke of that had a very good explanation about PH is: http://home.bluegrass.net/~carrie73/coral_calcium.htm it does specifically address cancer. Let me know if you have any trouble accessing it. Another one is http://www.essence-of-life.com Also of note, Dr.Lorraine Day, cured herself of advanced breast cancer. She follows a very strict diet, and prays quite a bit. I have some of her videos that I purchased. She is a Doctor, but refused chemo and radiation and cured herself through diet, faith, moderate exercise, sunshine, drinking a lot of water. She has been on Oprah, Larry King and has an info-mercial. She does not talk about alkalinity specifically, however, the diet she follows is an alkaline diet. Very interesting stuff. Dr. Lorraine Days website is: http://www.drday.com I unfortunatly got some bad news on my PET scan yesterday. I am going in for MRI's tomorrow to investigate 2 areas that showed up as \"hot spots\" If this goes south on me I will probably go to the wellness center \"Optimum Health\" in Austin or \"Hippocrates\" in West Palm beach, as they have helped a girl in my support group that was diagnosed with a Stage 4 reoccurance. I hope that you have a healthy and happy Holiday Season. Take care",

      "Content": "I am a 3 year breast cancer survivor. I went through convential methods, surgery, chemo, radiation after being diagnosed with Stage 2a breast cancer. I have recently been researching preventatives so that I may minimize my risk of a reoccurance and try to eliminate the side affects of my treatment. One area that is consistently coming up and makes good common sense is maintaining a balanced (slightly alkaline) PH. A woman in my survivors group was diagnosed with a Stage 4 reoccurance. She went to Hippocrates Wellness Center in West Palm Beach for treatment, mainly diet, and is now in remission. A fellow patient with MS was remarkedly improved after his stay. Tapes by Dr. Lorraine Day, an MD who chose treatment through diet rather than western medicine, is a survivor. Diet is very strict, green and sprouted foods mainly. Coral Calcium by Natures way had helped me get Alkaline. I highly recommend looking into this. Search for PH and alkaline PH. Some conflicting info. on diet, stay away from Apple cider vinegar and dairy as some sites recommend, as they are so acidic, they make your body alkaline by leaching calcium out of your bones. Most other recommendations good. Good luck and love and appreciate each day !",
