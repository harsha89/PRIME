The prognosis offered was grim. What can I do/say to best help her emotionally/spiritually after the initial shock wears off and she is ready to begin discussing/dealing with it? And if she chooses to completely ignore it (which she may well do), am I to respect that as her choice? Or does my duty lay in encouraging her to fight? TimJay, I just happened to be on this site replying to someone else when I saw your message come up.  I have just gone through the exact thing you are experiencing - August 15, 2007, my Mom was diagnosed with Stage 4- she is 80 years old and a real fighter!  She started chemo treatment - it was rough - three long rounds of avastin and taxol, and after those treatments they re-did the scans and it was working. The tumors were shrinking!  Her hair fell out and she felt terrible but the chemo seemed to be working.  The doctor decided because of her age to try a less 'toxic' form of treatment - navalbine and she has had 6 treatments of that.  They re-did the scans last Monday and we will get the results next Tuesday. I tell you this because I don't want you to lose HOPE.  HOPE is everything - the will to fight and live is everything.  I don't know how old your Mom is but no matter how old she is, try to encourage her to fight. Her fight may be to do nothing and let nature take it's course  or it may be to go to battle with it (treatment, etc.) - ask your doctor lots of questions - ask about all the treatment options, side affects, etc.  Although you have to be her voice at times, try to let her make the ultimate decision about treatment.  I have five brothers and sisters - we all wanted Mom to fight and she has.  She decided to give up the fight the day after Christmas - she decided NO MORE treatment.  Her faith is strong and she is putting it back in God's hands.  She tolerated all the chemo she felt she could.  Even then, the doc assured her that if she changed her mind he would help her with a treatment option if it comes to that. I know the road ahead is terrifying and that you feel alone right now.  Remember that there are thousands of others going through exactly what you are dealing with right now - doesn't make it any easier but at least you can pull from those people advise and support! My heart goes out to you. I have a feeling that you are a young man trying to come to grips with the possibility of losing someone you love so dearly!  Don't give up hope.  Keep faith and remember that God will not leave you comfortless, he will come to you -just ask.  God Bless!  --Jennys Mom",
