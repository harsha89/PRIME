    "Content": "Hello my name is Michelle. I know this might seem weird but I am on here for my mother. Im trying to find a way to pay for her treatments. She refuses to take any support from me and I am lost I live about four hours away from her so it's a bit harder helping her out but if you have guidance to give on the financial part of it please let me know I appreciate it. Good Luck and God Speed!",
