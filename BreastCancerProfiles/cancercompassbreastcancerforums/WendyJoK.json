      "Content": "Hello. My sister has breast cancer and has been using Protocel. She is in such terrible pain! It's like she has road rash on her breast (mainly nipple and aereola). There is an infection, so she had to go to an MD and get antibiotics. She got pain meds, but they make her sick. So she suffers on with the pain. She has not worked in 10 weeks, has no insurance and is very frightened. Has anyone else used Protocel for breast cancer? Please share your experience as far as side effect, success and/or failure. I am concerened we are running out of time and I feel like we need more answers. Also, any discussion on masectomy. She has had no surgury, radiation or chemo. Thank you.",
