    "Content": "I have asked in swedish forums but noone seems to have the same problem as I. I have gone through chemo, radiation and operation. They took only a part of the breast. They have later on said that I still have cancer in the breast tissue that is left of the breast. Since a tear ago I have wounds on the breast. It smells awful and sometimes it bleeds. I am now going through new chemo and hopefully the tumour will shrink so they can operate the hole breast. But I still wonder, is there anybody out there with the same problem, these wounds? Did you operate? Did the go away with chemo? What can I do?",
