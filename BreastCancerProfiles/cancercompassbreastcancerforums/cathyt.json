He had already had it set up she gets the biopse done and again was contacted by another place for ceamo she went to get her results and the doctor couldn`t even tell her what stage she is in and again pushing the ceamo. is this right? my girlfreind has been freaked out for weeks now, what do i do? Sorry your going thru this, get a second opinion is what I would do,  your Oncologist should have answers for you and if they don't seek elsewhere, most insurances are covered for another opinion & few days won't hurt will only settle your heart.  Hang in & follow your instincts, Chemo is very hard on body and you need to know everything about it b4 receiving it as well.  Prayers to you and your girlfriend.
