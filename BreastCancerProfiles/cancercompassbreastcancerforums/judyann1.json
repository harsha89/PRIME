      "Content": "Because the cancer has spread to my bones, I guess I will have to be treated for the rest of my life.  I have read that the meds usually work for a few years, then stop working, but there are about 5 meds that can be used for this.  When one stops working, they change the medication to another one.  There are posts on this site from women who have had BC that spread to their bones, liver, and lungs, and still get treatments and are doing ok.  I hope the meds work as well for you as they are for me.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in May 2009, surgery in June.  My bone scan in July showed mets to bone, and I've been on Arimides and Zometa since.  I had a bone scan the week before Christmas, which came back normal.  The doc told me the tumors are still there, but have gotten so small the bone scan can not detect them.  So, the meds are working, and I hope they keep working for a long, long time. I have gotten a great deal of hope from this message board, and I am writing because maybe my message will give hope to others.  I feel for all of you, this is a nasty disease, with nothing being certain, but celebrating each positive outcome helps.  My prayers go out to all of you, and I hope you all get good news very soon!",

      "Content": "With the first infusion of Zometa, which was the same day as my first Arimidex pill, I woke up at about 3am with a low grade fever, aches, and no energy.  It lasted about one day, and I have never had it since.  They are the usual side effects, and the paper work given to me stated that if they do happen, it's usually only the first time.  I always take the Arimidex with my dinner--eat a little, take the pill, then finish eating, and I've never had a problem, so I don't really have side effects.  Good luck to you, I'm sure you will do fine.",

      "Content": "I also have stage IV invasive lobular bc, with mets to my bones.  I did have a lump, but no other symptoms, and I'm still symptom free.  I also get a monthly infusion of Zometa, but take Arimidex daily.  I was diagnosed in May, and had another bone scan last month.  The bone scan was normal-my doctor said the cancer is still there, but the meds are working, and have shrunk the tumors on my bones so much that the bone scan could not detect them, so I will continue on the meds I'm now taking. There are messages on this site from women who have had bone mets, and some also have liver and lung mets, and are doing well after 5-7 years.  Hopefully they will see your post and respond.",
