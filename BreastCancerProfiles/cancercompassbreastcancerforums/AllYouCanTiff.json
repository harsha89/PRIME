      "Content": "I'm 29, diagnosed with Stage 2 Triple Negative Breast Cancer, tumor size 1.3mm X 1.9mm. Lymph nodes probably not infected but will know for sure after my lumpectomy 8/6/14. I have changed my diet and lifestyle since the morning of the Dx. I used to eat everything in sight, though tho I'm naturally skinny so never thought anything of it. I've been completely vegan since that morning and have been adhering to a strict alkaline diet and exercising everyday and feeling great! However, I just want to be fully prepared for the possibility that I may need chemo if indeed it has spread. My research has been so mixed, deciding between chemo or alternative treatments involving B17, eating only fruits/veg... vs. chemo.  Does anyone have any personal experience with either success or failure after refusing chemo? I have heard many success stories myself, either friends' moms or aunts but I haven't heard any failures (except Steve Jobs but even his wasn't so much a failure as pancreatic cancer is very deadly and he survived another 8 years post his initial Dx when only 4% survives past 5 years)...",

      "Content": "Hello, thank you so much for this post. I have a hard time digesting the fact that chemotherapy only works on about 30% of the people treated. Though it works extremely well, 95% of them are disease free survivors, the relatively high failure rate of chemo when combined with its side effects are really hard to swallow.  I am due to have lumpectomy so I'll know my diagnosis better afterwards, particularly to see if my lymph nodes are positive. Would you still recommend chemo if lymph nodes are negative? Many doctors recommend yes to \"clear out the remaining cancer\" but... if recurrence rate isn't too high (on low end, 7%, on high end 30.5%)... i'm not sure i should be going through chemo to slightly decrease it. ",

      "Content": "Hi Ben.  I was in a similar situation as your GF. I just turned 30 years old and I am triple negative stage 4 right now. When I found my lump a few weeks after my 29th birthday, I opted for the lumpectomy but nothing else at the time. I know triple negative has extremely high recurrence rate, even with chemotherapy.  I went after every natural therapy possible. I changed my diet to everything free (gluten free, sugar free). I quit dairy and meat for the most part. I ate organic chicken sometimes because I'm naturally skinny and the otherwise vegan diet was making me malnourished.  I even went on cannabis oil for 3 months hoping it would mitigate recurrence. It did not. I took out mercury fillings, I I meditated... I tried many different diets, I juiced and even did coffee enemas everyday for the 3 months. About 3 months after the lump was removed, more tumors popped up. I kept trying more natural therapies. I was convinced the chemotherapy success rates was so extremely low for triple negative (about 22% pCR) that I would not benefit, in fact it would tear my immune system apart and leaving me to an even quicker death. I obsessed over medical journals and statistics. I am a journalism major and I was resourceful enough to find whatever proof I needed to keep me believing that chemotherapy is not for me. I was also deathly afraid of chemotherapy because I haven't even began thinking about kids yet. The natural therapy people make chemotherapy sound SO BAD that I lived in perpetual fear of ever having to succumb to it. Then, I started feeling the pain. The pain quickly took over my entire upper body, chest, arms, back and neck. Before I knew it, I went from Stage 2B to Stage 4 within 1 month.  So I started seeing western doctors again and started listening. They told me chemotherapy would definitely help me with the pain and with the new drugs, the side effects are very minimal. I didn't have a choice at the time any longer. The pain was so bad I couldn't sleep. I began chemotherapy 2 weeks ago... And guess what?! I puked about 1 day total, I don't think that was even from the chemo but from too much morphine! I am on lipodox, this drug doesn't even make my hair fall out! I have almost zero side effects. So far, chemotherapy has been SOOOOO easy breezy and I just want to tell you to let your GF know to NOT live in fear of chemotherapy. The natural therapy sellers have you believe that chemo is the most evil thing on the planet but hey, it's saving my life right now.  The tumors are shrinking. My breast which had swelled up to double the size has reduced massively! It's SO visibly working that I have to say, chemotherapy is my savior. I urge you guys to reconsider your stance. I would definitely do all the natural therapies alongside but I would not discount western medicine when it comes to cancer. The big conspiracy is made up and blown way out of porportions I think.  I started writing a blog for release: http://ittybittycancertittycommittee.tumblr.com :) you sound like a wonderful bf. hope everything works out <3",
