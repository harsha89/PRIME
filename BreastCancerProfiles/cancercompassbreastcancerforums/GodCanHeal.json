    "Content": "Hello, My aunt is dealing with breast cancer. She is experiencing A LOT of pain due to the spread of the cancer to her lungs as well as her spine. She had her lymph nodes removed and radiation in the area....this is where the bulk of her pain is coming from now. If you haven't had radiation, BEWARE before you go that route. Do as much research as possible before taking the word of any oncologist, etc.",
