      "Content": "After finding a lump on my breast in Sept 2011, I went to get a mamogram that was compared to the yearly ones I get every year as my mother had breast cancer 2 times.  Shes 81 and cancer free.  The mamogram showed normal.  I went to my family Doctor him thinking it was a cyst and was going to extract the fluuid from my breast.  I didnt think that was a good idea so I asked for a ultrasound and sure enough thats when something showed up. After 2 biopsys, I was diagnosed on Nov 2, 2011 with Stage 2B Ducto carsenoma breast cancer, ended up with a masectomey and a auxillary dissection of 16 nodes removed with one cancerous, and now half way thru chemo, now on taxol with 3 more to go.   Id get a second opinion.   ANDREA",
