      "Content": "Andy73, Son you need to do your homework on the subject of men and breast cancer.  Men can and do get breast cancer.  In fact they are more apt to die from BC since there is less chest tissue.  This is my first time on this massege board but I am here to tell you before you come out with your garbage ckeck the facts.  Leave your sales pitch off a board that is so critical to those who are in search of the most informative  and correct information on this subject.",

      "Content": "Hello.  Just wanted to share my story with all.  I was dx with bc Jan., 1990 at the age of 41.  Three invasive cell types with primary lession 7cm x 4cm with had spread thruout my entire right breast and underlaying muscle.  Breast and muscle removed.  ER-, PR- with high s-phase, moderate margins and stage IIIA.  I was told that I had this growing close to 12-15 years before dx.  I poured over every medical book I could find info as to making a choice of receiving add'l treatment after the surgery.  I came to the conclusion that it is not how long I would live, but the quality of life I would have while living.  So I decided against the add'l treatment.  That was 20 years ago.  I never second guess myself on this.  At that time if a pt. lived to the ten year mark the graphs actually showed the two meeting.  I was given a 65% chance of living for five years and the doctor side the chemo would only increase my chances at 3%.  Wasn't enough to put myself into doing chemo. I was told that it's not if the cancer returns but when.  I have lots of other medical problems now and not able to work.  I am on strong pain meds. now so excuse the gramar etc.   Attitude and a streak of stubborness has helped me   Prayer and leaning on God  has helped the most.",
