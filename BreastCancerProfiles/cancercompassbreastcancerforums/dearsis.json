      "Content": "My feet hurt also. I am taking Aromasin.  I took Tamoxifen for 5 years. At first I had leg cramps and hot flashes. But that went away after a few months then I had no side effects.  I wonder if I can go back to Tamoxafin. I'll have to ask my doctor.  I noticed this Aromasin leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",

      "Content": "I also had bad leg cramps when I was on Tamoxafin. Also toe cramps. I was on tamoxafin for five years. The side effects didn't last that long. Then my doctor put me on Femera. I don't know if this is one of the side effects but I had migraine headaches often. Now I am on Aromasin. No pain yet just fatigue and lots of it. Sometimes I just want to quit taking these breast cancer drugs.",
