      "Content": "I also only took Premarin and had BC. I took Premarin for 14 years and was dx last year with Infiltrated Lobular Carcinoma. I had a bilateral masectomy and chemo., now on Tamoxfin and still suffering with severe bone pain as side effect. I am ER+, PR+ and HER2+. I had genetic testing done and it was negative for the CA gene.  It seems that the only lawsuits are for Prempro, and I strongly believe my cancer was caused from the Premarin. I also had a hysterectomy 14 years ago. Please let me know if anyone knows of any lawsuits for Premarin patients.  My life has been affected so much due to this drug and something needs to be done to prevent others from having to go through this nightmare. God Bless and Merry Christmas Denny1 in Mississippi",

      "Content": "Is there a law suit for Premarin only patients? I took Premarin for 14 years, was DX with infiltrated lobular carcinoma 4cm, ER+, PR+ and HER2+, I had genetic testing and do not have the gene for breast cancer. I had bilateral masectomy/reconstruction, and chemotherapy. I am on Tamoxfin now and have not known one day without severe bone pain since chemo, I feel as if I am 90 years old. It doesn't seem right that if you took Prempro you have grounds for a law suit but not if you took Premarin. I have no doubt that Premarin caused my breast cancer. Any advice would be helpful. What is the statue of limitations on this in Mississippi? Denny",

      "Content": "Hi, I am a 1 year BC survivor, never took the drug you are taking but did chemo and now tamoxifen. I have had hip/pelvic bone pain continuous since, I hate taking so much pain med but don't know what else to do. I am 49 yr old and I am in nursing school, it is getting unbearable so next week I am going to a chiorpractor and am thinking  about discontinuing the tamoxifen until I finish school at least. I wish I could give you some encouragment. I'll let you know how the chiorpractor goes. Denise",
