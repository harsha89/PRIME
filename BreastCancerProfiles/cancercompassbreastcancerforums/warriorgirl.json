      "Content": "My mother is looking for others like her, who have had hearing problems after her chemo. Her message is below. thank you in advance,  \" I had adriamycin and cytoxan for 4 treatments.  Then I had 12 treatments of herceptin and taxol.  This was followed by a triple dose of herceptin at 3weeks interval.  After that I had a hearing loss, ringing in my ears and amplified background noise.   Is there anyone who has had hearing problems after receiving these drugs.  Thank you for responding\"  Email    --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

      "Content": " Did they attribute it to any of your chemo drugs? Could you tell me what your chemo program was like? thx wg  On 9/28/2007 Leemg wrote: I was diagnosed with stage l BC 4 years ago, no chemo but on Femara and diagnosed with thyroid cancer this past June and just finished treatment for that.  Back in April for no known reason I started having a swooshing sound in my right ear which was actually my heart beat and moderate hearing loss that went along with it.  Went to two ENT and they said I experienced sudden hearing loss which could be attributed to a virus or some unknown cause.  Unfortunately, if it is nerve related as in my case there is nothing they can do short of recommending a hearing device.  Sometimes there is no real rhyme or reason for this problem.  ",
