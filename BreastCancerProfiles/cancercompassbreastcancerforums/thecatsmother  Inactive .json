      "Content": "Hi i hope i can get some clarification here, Ok i dont want to think this way and its eating me up but i think my Niece is lying about having Breast cancer, ok the back story is she has always been a drama queen even as kid, A few weeks before this she even spread it all over Facebook and horendously she seeemed to delight in the fact that her 4 year old daughter was being tested for leukemia(luckily this was ruled out)Well any way as i said a few weeks later she started posting(on FB) about she was dreading results, feared the worse,ETC, we thought it was still about her daughter, Well a week or so after this i bumped into my Sister(her Mum) and she told us it was Breast cancer and she had had her third chomo (seemed real quick dont you think?). So i text her said sorry to hear about the news and hope she was ok, she text back and said she didnt want ANYONE else to know at all and that it was very bad and the doctor said she was looking into have both breasts removed. Meanwhile i have family at the doctors we both attend and i know its wrong but as we were suspicious i asked if he knew anything, he said she had not been into see the Doc for weeks, and he checked the records(yes i know its illegal and gosh we were worried that she was lying) but said nothing was on her records at all about testing,treatment or drugs. well we heard nothing at all from any of the family, we have seen her around, she looks well, no hair loss, no illness whatsover,she looks healthy.meanwh ile she had a new boyfriend she is bragging all over FB about how happy she is and all the sex she is getting!!, and how he has helped her past a rough time! Past?? it is only 3 months since she was so ill, she is saying how she is over the bad times?? No one went to the hospital with her and she was just dropped off saying to pick her up as she didnt want to upset anyone, so no witnesses to the Chemo treatment. she is wearing T-shits and no marks on her arms from needles etc i have lost my Dad to lung cancer and the thought of her lying is disgusting! am i missing something and just being nasty? i have no idea what its like to go through something like that but it seems too over with too quick! Also she was going through a bad time as she still lives at home with the parents and i dont think they liked the new boy friend and had awful arguments with them over it, but now its all lovely dovey between  them so it seems the ilness helped(bad thing to say i know) which also makes me suspicious. can some one spreadsome light on this? ie:do doctors have the medical records from the hospital? are you always ill with Chemo? Worried Aunty",

      "Content": "Have an update. She finally got back to me and said she is doing well and she doesn't need the double mastectomy like the doctor thought and that the cancer is shrinking great and her last treatment is on 21 September then she is in remission! So she has beaten breast cancer in less than five months? Seems too quick,and I saw her yesterday she has kept her hair not list any weight and looks same as before. I'm sorry I'm no expert but I know now that she has lied about it. I'm very disgusted in her behaviour and I know I should be lucky she is healthy but I don't think I can forgive her for lying about this.",
