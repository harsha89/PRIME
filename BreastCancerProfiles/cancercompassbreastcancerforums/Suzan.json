      "Content": "I was on Femara for 4 years & have stopped taking it for awhile. I am much more clear headed now that I am off of it. I had a problem staying awake. Although the drug supposedly lasts only a short time in ones system, I question its lingering affects. I had swelling mostly in my left foot & ankle. Went to a vasular specialist & nothing was wrong with the veins etc., he downloaded a 'doctors' report on Femara & decided it was causing the problem. That report had all sorts of reactions on it. If I can find it I'll let you know. It was a little scarry.",

      "Content": "I have been on Femara for 3 years. The longer I stay on it, the more problems occur. I am very tired & can sleep anytime except at night when I need to. Lately I have very swollen feet and some pain with it too.My doctor seems to think there aren't many reactions to the drug, but I see I am not alone. Although I did have chemo it was over 20 years ago, so I can't blame that process.",

      "Content": "Dorothy:It sounds like we are having similar reactions to the drug. Do you sleep easily sitting up? If I sit down to watch TV , I wake up hours later, having slept for hours sitting up. Now I am getting stiff necks. What other problems have you noticed? Do you have any swelling? I am 3 years on this drug & it is building up in my system, leaving me with some odd reactions to it.",
