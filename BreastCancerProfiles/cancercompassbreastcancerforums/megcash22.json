    "Content": "  I am currently working on a paper in one of my college courses about breast cancer.  I am aware that many women diagnosed with this disease not only have jobs, but also families, including children and spouses.  I am hoping anyone affected by the disease can answer the following questions: 1) How do you/did you go on with you daily life while undergoing treatment for breast cancer? 2) How has breast cancer changed you or your life?   I would really appreciate anyone who is willing to answer these---it would be a huge help! Thank you!",
