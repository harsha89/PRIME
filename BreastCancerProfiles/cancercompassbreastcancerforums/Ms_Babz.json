God Bless Hi Ms. Babz, they took your e-mail out of the context.  I would like to e-mail you .I think we've made the right decision.  mine is jjjkkk890  ya. I spoke with a friend of mine last nite whose friend had a mastectomy 11 years ago and refused all drugs and is doing well.  I had stage 1 DCIS but I had a lumpectomy and a re-excision.   I feel a little nervous about it returning but I know I would be more nervous taking the drugs since the announcement on t.v. about tamoxifen has come out witha 440% higher risk of breast cancer returning.  No matter how I try to talk to myself about the benefits of this category of drugs, it just make no sense at all to take it.  Take care and I too, will be praying for you and your ex. as well, as all the others who were kind enough to e-mail me.    ",
