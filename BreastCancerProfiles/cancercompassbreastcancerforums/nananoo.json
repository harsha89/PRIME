      "Content": "I started Femara october 2008  and about 3 wks ago my head started itching and now sometimes burning.  My hair has been falling out for months,  not sure when it started since I thought it was due to cholesterol medicine, statins, but now know it is femara.  I have a call in to my oncologist but no reply yet.  I had surgery in Feb 2007, chemo and radition and then Tamoxifen til Oct 2008 then on Femera.  Just recently through searching the internet found out Femera is a chemo drug.  That is why our hair is falling out.  I did not have any hair loss with Tamoxifen and lost weight easily but gaining wt on Femara.  My cancer is Stage III C and aggressive so I don't think I have a choice.  Will keep searching and trying to get my oncologist to do something. I will let all know when I find out anything else.  A great person who knows supplements and health, suggested using Biotin 5 mg and MSM 2 caps 2 times a day.  Plus, Vit C, a liquid V & M supplement with a lot of other good things.",
