      "Content": "Sorry to hear of your illness. I have not gone through it, but my Grandmother did, and  I did work for OB/GYN physicians for 20 years, so I saw alot more than the average person. My gut feeling is that if they want you to \"consider\" the surgery---GO FOR IT!! Why take the chance?  I always said that is what I would do in that case.  Anything that can be done to assure that there is less of a chance for the cancer to return, I would take. That is only my opinion, and I hope that you are successful, in whatever course of action you take. Beth",
