    "Content": "Just wanted to say that I send my best wishes to everyone on this board. I'm 30 and several weeks ago noticed prominent blue veins on one side of my chest. The internet mentioned this could be one sign of breast cancer. I've always been concerned as my mother required pelvic x-rays while she was pregnant with me and I needed a number of chest x-rays when I was about 12, so this radiation would increase the risk of breast cancer. I examined my breasts for lumps and found a small one at about the 9 o'clock position near the armpit. It felt hard like a pebble. I also noticed the skin looked slightly different in this area. The odd thing about the lump is sometimes I can feel it and other times I cannot. I went to the doctor today and of course, while I was there the lump could not be felt by either my doctor or I (as soon as I left it appeared again). He said my breasts are slighly fibrocystic and nothing to be concerned about. He said if the lump was a concern, I would be able to feel it all the time and the nature of cysts are that they move around. He did send me for an ultrasound that I will have next week. Of course, I am very concerned due to all the misdiagnosis that take place and of course, as soon as I got home, I could easily feel the lump again! It seems easiest felt if I run my finger lightly over it rather than pressing too hard. I guess I can only wait until the ultrasound and see what happens, but was wondering if anyone has had any experiences similar to this one?",
