    "Content": "Energy - what is that? I am almost 8 months out from last chemo and the fatigue is horrible. I try to force myself to be active, but I am simply exhausted. It doens't seem to be getting better for me either. My onc said that there wasn't much he could do. He said it could take 1 year from last chemo to start feeling better. I am so done with this cancer journey. When I have one \"good\" day, then several bad ones follow. But, oh well. At least we are survivors, right? Hang in there. It will get better. Best wishes, Pam    ",
