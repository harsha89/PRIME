    "Content": "Hi, Andi: my name is Joni and I am a 52 year-old caucasian with 2 kids who had triple negative tumor removed last October. it's an odd diagnosis to be sure...i opted not to have chemo; the doc there said that besides african americans, ashkenazi jews get this too- he said a population of polish women get this as well.  i don't have that in my ancestry as far as i know...? anyway, you're not alone and all the docs i have seen so farhave not acted surprised~ any info you can bring to bear would be interesting to me.  keep in touch & all the best, J",
