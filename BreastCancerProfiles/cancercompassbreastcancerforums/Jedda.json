    "Content": "Hello from Sydney Australia!  Thank you everyone for your info.  I thought I was going crazy ... becoming a hypochondriac, constantly complaining of my aches and pains, feeling as bad as my aunts who are in their sunset years and dealing with rheumatioid arthritis!  But no it seems it IS the medication.  Have had a month off Femara and was feeling somewhat better but am now just starting Aromasin and thought I'd research it.  But it doesn't look hopeful does it?!  Still IF it keeps the cancer away.... just grin and bear it.  At least I know it's not all in my head. Although I have been getting a LOT  of headaches.  Is this also a problem on these meds???  Now it seems I will have to insist on having my bone density checked.  I had mentioned it to my GP who brushed it aside.  I am now post menapausal following a full hysterectomy, so this plus the meds is a worry. A word of warning to Tamoxifen users.... I had been on it from 2001 after breast cancer to 2005 when I went into hospital to have what I thought was a large fibroid removed....so asked to have the whole lot out.   Just as well, as it wasn't a fibroid but an aggressive uterine sarcoma.  Did the Tamoxifen contribute to this ????   NO say most doctors..... We can't say one way or the other say some.  So who knows.  Anyway I was lucky I had a good surgeon and hopefully it has all gone but had to have another chemo routine....therefore I need to take these meds as if either cancer comes back I am limited in the chemo available to me.",
