      "Content": "Thank you.  My e-book Curing Cancer with Carrots is based on evidence from studies in scientific research journals.  It explains why carrots can cure cancer.  I doubt any one natural ingredient will cure all cancers, but chemo and radiation and surgery don't cure all either.  Improving our diets to base them in fruits and vegetables could prevent many millions of deaths from cancer.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your openness and support.   I think that natural cures need more attention and investigation from scientists.  They aren't damaging to the body, and they are cheap, and for many people they work.  What nobody knows now is why carrots will work for one person and not for another.  A company called Rational Therapeutics will test cells of an individual tumor against a variety of chemotherapy treatments, to see to which it will respond.  They don't test against natural cancer killers so far (they say this would take too long, but I think it's more likely they haven't had a demand for such tests).",

      "Content": "A woman in New Zealand has written me that her breast cancer five years ago, very recently diagnosed as metastasized to the bones, has not metastasized on to any vital organs since she started drinking fresh carrot juice daily, using 3 kg. of carrots to make the juice.  She says she feels great and is hoping the juice will save her.  I cured Stage 4 colon cancer by drinking carrot juice and have published an e-book about this, Curing Cancer with Carrots.  My best to you.  Ann Cameron",

      "Content": "I am very sorry carrot juice didn't work for you.  The way I advise that people try it is the way I preseume you have--getting a scan at 8 weeks to find out if it's working.  The carrots are good for you and improve quality of life, but if the cancer is still growing after 8 weeks it's time to at the least,combine it with another approach. ",
