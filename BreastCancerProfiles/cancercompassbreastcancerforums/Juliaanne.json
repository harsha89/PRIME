      "Content": "I am also loosing my hair and it is finer. After chemo it came back very thick (always had really thick, pretty hair) but my hairdresser was shocked at how quickly it became thin. It only took about two months to really see a difference. Was on Arimidex for 20 months and the pain was so severe that I switched to Aromasin. The pain is still there but not as bad. I read about this old folk remedy on another site and it has REALLY helped me. Three tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar a day. I take 1 1/2 tbls. in the morning with lots of water and repeat in the evening. (Thanks to whoever posted it!!!) Also started taking an Aleve in AM and one in PM. I can now actually go shopping for a while if I wear tennis shoes or Crocks. The hair loss is really getting to me though. I don't know if I can bear really thin hair. I'm tough and can work through the pain but I guess my vanity hits when I lose my pretty hair.",
