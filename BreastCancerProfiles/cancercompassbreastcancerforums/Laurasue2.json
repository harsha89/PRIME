    "Content": "Hi Kathleen, When I was diagnoised in 98 my doctor did a biopsy and when he told me it was breast cancer he also told me he was going to have to go back in to get a clean margin. He showed me on my path report where just a tiny spec reached his cutting point and said that he couldn't take any chances so I had to have a second surgery just one week later. He told me then if the margins did not come back clean he would do another one...but they did come back clean. It IS good news that the cancer is in the same breast, that close to the original site and that her prior treatment was relatively easy. I had CMF chemo (although it was only stage 1) and radiation. If she did not have chemo she may want to have it this time. I DID NOT lose my hair with the CMF. Take care and my prayers are with you both.",
