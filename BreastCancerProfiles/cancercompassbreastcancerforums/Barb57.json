    "Content": "Hi, I'am on aromasin also. I started on Arimidex Aug. 2006 and the doctor changed me to aromasin in Dec,2006 because I was having so much pain in my hands and feet.  I also wound up having knee surgery last Nov. for a torn meniscus. Shortly after starting the medication my knees sounded like ground glass whenever I walked up step or stooped down. They said the medication had nothing to do with it but I had no problems before that. Since taking aromasin, the pain in my hands improved slightly, but my heels are still painful especially in the morning.  My index fingers also become stiff overnight. Once I start moving things ease up but by evening my feet are killing me. Also if I sit for any amount of time my knees and feet hurt and are stiff.  I too walk like I'am 200 yrs. old until I loosen up.  Good luck to you, it was just a year this Aug. for me.  It scares me to think what kind of shape I will be in four years from now.  I also tried asprin, tylenol, even a pain killer and nothing helped.  Keep your chin up, I guess its better than the alternative.
