    "Content": "12/19/08 I saw your post and would like some help with supplement.  I hope and pray I can cure my cancer with supplement too. I had breast cancer twice in my left breast. After 12 years I got cancer again in my left breast and in June a mastectomy. I had a mammo and they saw calcifications.  I am a single mother of one.  I am told I have stage 1, invasive ductal carcinoma, HER2.  My oncologist are giving me a shot to shut down my ovaries.  I also have HBP and overweight.  Please help me. I am very scare, lonely and depress. My doctor wants me to take chemo but I don't want to go that route. I did had radiation 12 years ago. I am currently taking Vitamin D, 13C, Fish oil, multi-vitamin, Barley grass Essiac, drank green tea.  I am trying to change my diet.  Yes in the past I was a fast food junky and drank a lot of soda. Now I am trying to eat more vegetables, fruit and drank more water. I was losing weight but since the my oncologist is putting me in menopause. I have been gaining weight.   Thank you, Silk I killed my stage IIa breast cancer tumor by using supplements found in the research online. I was a breast cancer patient, pre surgery, and post surgery, the pathology report indicated the tumor \"appeared to have undergone chemotherapy,\" although I took no chemotherapy or radiation. I took high doses of: Vitamin C Lysine Proline Arginine L-Glutamine Reishi Mushroom capsules Shitakii Mushrooms in edible form each day Green tea extract Shark Cartilage Removal of all sugars and refined carbohydrates from my diet, as cancer cells require 5 times more glucose than normal cells.",
