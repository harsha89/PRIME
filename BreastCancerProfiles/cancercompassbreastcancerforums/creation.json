A very small questionable margin remains just under the skin, apparently somewhere between the nipple and armpit, but can not be pinpointed. Also, out of 13 lymph nodes removed, three were malignant. I have not had the mastectomy yet.They \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yet.They \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yet.They did a oncotest which showed the cancer to be slow, non-aggressive, and a 92% cure rate with hormore therapy. The three mentioned are arimidex, aromasin, or femara.   I am a 69 yr old widow and have struggled with Fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease in my back for years. I have strong inclination towards alternative cure options rather than surgery and hormone therapy. I already deal with extreme joint, bone, soft and connective pain and extreme fatigue...my life has been like pushing a freight train uphill for years. I am very concerned that the \"cure\" would be as dibilitating as the \"cancer\".  Would appreciate any comments regarding methods of allopathic vs alternative means to fight this tiger.  Also any comments regarding reconstuction success or problems as I'm not yet prepared to go from a H cup to zero. Quality of life is very important to me as I want to enjoy whatever time I have left....and can anyone tell me statistically what that looks like between the two options.  Thanks for any comments as I am really in quite a dilemma about this. I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. After I had my operation for the removal of my cyst there were 5 more small lumps that grew on the left side of my breast. I was so depressed at that time because I thought that I will die. I did not go under chemo because I knew very well what will happends next. i am a nurse and I i knw the disadvantages of it. I search for an alternative treatment and my friend reommended me to take C 24/7. Have you heard about it? Its a herbal supplement that is very rich in anti-oxidant! It has two usage either supplemental or nutritional.. There is no bad in trying. As long as there is life there is still hope. For me, it really works well since the 5 small lumps on my breast were gone. I thank the Lord for regaining my health back. To God be the Glory!",

I was also told of the probability of it spreading to the brain. I originally had a lympectomy and chemo, and started my herceptin, I had 2 treatments when the herceptin damaged my heart infraction rate to a near fatal low. They had to stop treatment. I still had almost a year of herceptin to go. Was this enough? I asked, no one knows, the human body is so unpredictable. My onclogist did a mammo before I started radiation and found the cancer returned in a more aggessive strain(double negative HER 2 positive). Here came the bilateral masectomy, what a way to get out of radiation. You must live and love life to the fullest, don't fear the things you can't control. I have had many set backs from the chemo, but I am proud to be a 7 year survivor and plan on being here at least that many more. thank you for getting back to me, I have been doing good so far, I thought I had this for the most part beat, and who knows, like you said we dont' have control of it.  All I know, is that I discovered that I had a discharge in my nipple back in 2007, in June of 2008, I had my mammogram, (my husband was getting ready to lose his job, due to the economy, and of course lose his insurance)  I had the mammogram, but at that time the doctor didn't see anything.  My next mammogram wasn't until Nov. 2011, and boom, there was my enemy.  But, the doctor did tell me with the type of cancer I have, I should've been dead a couple of yrs. ago, he was amazed, and I was thankful to the Lord.  Everytime I go in for my check up (every 3 wks.) for Herceptin, my blood work is good, now I am just scared every single day, thinking this is going to drop on me all of a sudden again.  But I pray everyday for me, for other people going thru cancer, and thankful for the work of doctors and sceintist trying to find a cure.

I was curious at the same time in doubt. I asked myself, Is it really possible? She told me to watch some videos on youtube about there testimonies and met the people who uses it. So I did what she did before trying tthere products. I watch some of there videos and met some of the people who were being healed by there products. Due to my curiousity i asked some copies of there diagnosis and went to the doctor to confined if its really true. I have found out that its not only Cancer that were being treated by this but also people who were almost being operated by kidney stone removal,bypass,etc.. tha operation were CANCELED!
