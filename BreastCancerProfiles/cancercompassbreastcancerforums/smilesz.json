      "Content": "Hi im 15 years old female i will be 16 this coming october 2009. I am very concerned and quite panicked actually i was feeling around my breast to do a mini check of my body when i felt a lump on my right breast. When i squeezed it a bit of watery liquid discharged from the dark skin around my nipple. It looks clear but when i wipe it on something white it is a faint yellow colour i am very scared and nervous to go to the doctor the discharge is only coming from my right breast and only when i squeeze it. Is it cancerous what should I do. This has actually happened before but it went away and now im wondering if its serious i am also wonderin if it has anything to do with my period. I already got my period for the month of september and am waiting for october could this be the cause? will i need surgery or a drain or it just a fatty tissue of some sort. Am I going to have to say goodbye to my breast forever? I am really scared to face a doctor and i've already told my mum and she told me to see a doctor but idont know ill be 16 in october does that affect anything. Also it isnt painful so is that a bad sign is this normal in my development ? Someone PLEASE HELP ME!!! ",
