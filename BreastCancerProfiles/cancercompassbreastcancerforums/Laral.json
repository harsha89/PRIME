    "Content": "Happy New Year everyone! In order to help find a cure for breast cancer, I put together a cookbook filled with recipes from breast cancer survivors and from those who had loved ones affected by breast cancer. There are over 260 recipes that feature someone affected by breast cancer. The recipes are from all over the country and include simple meals and appetizers, more elegant meals, and great desserts and cookies. The proceeds of the cookbook all go back to the 3-Day. The book isn't finished printing yet, but it will be available in February. If you'd like to find out more please visit my website www.hopeloveandfaith.com. You can pre-order your copy today, or contact me if you have more questions or concerns. Thanks so much, Have a safe & happy new year! Lara",
