      "Content": "I felt a lump in my right breast a week ago.  I went to the doctor too and she sent me for an ultrasound.  The tech told me right away that she isn't a doctor, but she isn't seeing anything to worry about.  She then went to show the radiologist.  She came back saying what I was feeling was a lymph node and that they were cancelling the Mamogram.  I left feeling relieved, but now as I read online I am not feeling as confident.  Should I be doing more tests to figure out why I am all of a sudden feeling this lymph node.  It's only 1...but does that matter?  Should I request a mammogram just for more feedback?  I am 32 years old, have two little girls and my husband recently died from brain cancer.  I don't have a family history of breast cancer.  I had a really bad cold about 2 weeks ago and I am under a ton of stress as my husband just died on 1/30.  Thanks for your time!",
