      "Content": "Just read your message, hope everything is well with you these days.  I do understand the depression that goes with dealing with this sort of thing that's why they have the support groups.  Please use them if you haven't already.  I hope the Cancer Compass helped you to get some comfort.  My husband went on hiatus at a really inopportune time for me, he just couldn't handle the pressure (imagine how I felt?) So I really understand where you're coming from and can only imagine what I would be feeling if he hadn't snapped out of it.  I'm still leary now because it's hard to trust if he'll be there for future problems if there are any. But I did vent on this site and I felt much better.  If nothing else, you can always use us as a sounding board.",
