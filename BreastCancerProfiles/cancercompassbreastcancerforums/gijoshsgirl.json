      "Content": "2.5 weeks ago I felt a lump in my left breast. It was close to my normal time of the month (though I don't have periods anymore after a uterine ablasion). I waited until last Tues and finally seen my primary. She did breast exam and stated I needed a mammogram. I have a strong family history of cancer and just a few months ago had a spot on my kidney checked out (turned out to be nothing they say). My maternal grandmother fought 2 bouts of breast cancer and died from cancer that metastisized from what they believe was breast cancer again (she was so ate up with it, inoperable, terminal they didn't test to see where it originated).  I had my mammogram today, which turned into an ultrasound, which turned into a second ultrasound by the Dr who did a core biopsy and took 3 samples. He found I have a suspicious grape size mass. I also have a grape size cyst. He showed both to me on the u/s. The cyst looked black, empty, and was/is soft and moves around. The mass is hard, irregular shaped, doesn't move much, doesn't hurt. It was difficult to get the needle in for biopsy. They say it will he a week for results. I'm so worried with my history of family members with cancer and I've had some weird, unexplained illness/symptoms lately. I've ran a chronic low grade fever for a few months now. Fatigue and recently night sweats. I've got an appt next Weds with a Rhuemetologist but curious if its not this lump and what it might be that's causing the fever/fatigue. How did everyone else find their cancer? My lump is not painful either which is worry some as well. Any insight would be appreciated! Ty!",

      "Content": "PASH - Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia. That's one of the diagnosis I have. I also show hyperplasia tubular and columnar cell change, which my Aunt (who is my primary) is concerned with. She says that sometimes PASH can \"mask\" cancer cells and that the excess of cells could mean pre-cancer. She has already scheduled me with a breast specialist/surgeon to talk about removing the mass and further testing. I'm just glad I've got someone medically in my corner that's not dropping the ball so to speak. I'm very blessed to have my Aunt as my primary. I'll keep y'all posted. Glad to hear yours isn't too serious but if you still feel like some things going on, then keep pushing.  My chronic low grade fever has been going on for about 4 months or so. Its definitely not the flu. I've been tracking it on an app on my phone every time I can tell I have one. I had a 99.2 all afternoon yesterday and felt like doing nothing more than crawling up in bed and sleeping. Hard to do when I work full time and have a 5 year old to tend to.  Can't wait to meet the specialist tomorrow and discuss my options. I doubt I sleep much tonight. ",

      "Content": "So my biopsies are NOT back yet (ugh, a whole weekend without answers). BUT, I did request copies of the reports from my ultrasound and mammogram. Of course this did not ease my mind anymore.....perhaps made me worry more. These are the findings of U/S: left breast contains a solid, hypoechoic mass with thin hyperechoic septations. It was measured at 1.3x.08x.08cm. The mass/septation shows blood flow. It is wider than tall. Assessment is Category 4 suspicious. Mammogram results: Breast tissue is heterogeneously dense, this may lower the sensitivity of mammo. The left breast shows a partially obscured mass confirmed to be solid measuring 1.3 x .08 x .08cm. No calcifications are seen, no architectual distortionis identified, no lymphadenopathy is identified. Cyst measuring 1.5 x .05 with thin septation is present at 6:00 (I did not know about the bigger cyst until this). What do you all think?",

      "Content": "I am hoping for results tomorrow. I've got myself worried sick. I've been picking apart my last few medical exams, blood work, and my chronic symptoms. I'm just super worried that signs of cancer have been over looked. Recent CBC showed high monocytes, and I recently tested positive on ANA test. I'm supposed to see a rheumatologist this Weds for unexplained chronic low grade fever and fatigue recently. I'll post my results as soon as I can. ",
