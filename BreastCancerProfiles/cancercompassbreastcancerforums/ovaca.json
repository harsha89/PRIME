      "Content": "This is not an external smell that can be detected by the human olfactory sense but one that is internally perceived.  I was aware of it during my cancer issue which stopped after I was cancer free but the past months I have began having that same internal smell. It's like an olfactory aura.  I'm not worried just curious and hopefully not demented.",

      "Content": "I had ovarian cancer a few years ago and had noticed an internal smell/aura which those around me could not detect. I can not say that its a good or bad smell, it just is and have noticed it again intermittently within the past couple months. I have not been feeling well as of late with a recent 20# weight loss. My PCP is aware of my present symptoms but I have not mentioned this smell/aura to him as there is no factual, medical data to support this. I was glad to find another person that has had a similiar experience even though it was in 2008. Are there others out there who have experienced this or something similiar?",
