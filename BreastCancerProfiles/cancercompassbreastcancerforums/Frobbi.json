      "Content": "Hi Carol,,I decided from the beginning that I was going to be my own advocate. I researched until my eyeballs bled.My recon Dr tells all his students when they are in with us, that I was very kind to him by letting him go all through his talk and then telling him what he should do,,and I was right. I had an expander and an implant.That was in 2003. I had capsular contraction and he removed the old implant this year and put in a new kind. It's silicone jelly so it doesn't leak and feels very real. I'm quite satisfied with the whole thing. I couldn't have had the tram anyway,,not enough good tissue, But I'm not sure I would have gone that route anyway. The less surgery, the less chance of infection. Just my opinion.I am amazed at how many intelligent women just sit back and let their doctors make all the decisions without questioning them.The only thing they wouldn't do was a double. I just didn't want the worry,,but that they wouldn't do. Oh well,,can't win them all. Hang in there everyone. Love and Hope,,Bobbie",

      "Content": "I was in somewhat the same situation. I was told the same thing. Lumpectomy probably followed by radiation /chemo. I researched and decided that a mastectomy was the best road to go. I had immediate reconstruction and never regretted the decision because I didn't need chemo or radiation that way. I was Estrogen positive,all nodes negative but upon further pathology on the breast tissue, minute specs of cancer were found. No one can tell which side is real and I didn't have to pollute my body.It's a matter of the quality of life NOW!",

While visiting family in France she was given Avastin and was amazed at how well she felt. After returning to England she was appalled to learn that she could not have the drug due to the cost!!!

Yes, my hair has thinned considerably but I won't go off the drug for that reason. Too many of my friends had chemo and lost their hair and it seems like a small price to pay for life. They have the most fantastic wigs out now. I just had a double knee replacement due to degeneration of the cartilage. There is a University in Australia doing a study on women on aromatase inhibitors and joint degeneration.I'm sure it is the fact that I am lacking all estrogen. It is the reason for the hair loss, the vaginal dryness and thinning,,and the joint problems. Since estrogen feeds the tumors and no one knows if there is one little bugger still waiting for it's estrogen feeding, I'm sticking with the drug. Certainly it is your decision, but I still have too much living to do to give up. I feel lucky that I didn't need chemo or radiation so I will settle for these problems. It has not stopped me from doing anything I wanted to do. Good Luck!  ",

Of course no one is willing to admit that the degeneration was to to Arimidex, because no one has completed a study. There is now an ongoing study at Monash university in Australia, keeping track of the joints of women who have E+ tumors and are on aromatase inhibitors. My oncologist would like me to complete the 5 years and I will. I would never forgive myself if I gave up now and cancer returned. There is talk of extending the time after 5 years but I will cross that bridge when I come to it. Since the knee replacement, I feel alot better. I'm able to handle the ankle, toes and most of all now, thumb pain! I do take Actonel every week for bone strength, and so far everything is stable. I am waiting for something to give me back my libido!!! Of course being on Effexor doesn't help that situation either!!",
