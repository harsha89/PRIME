      "Content": "Hi, I am working on two years cancer free October 2012 and my six month visit examinations consist of a series of identical questions.  During my second six month visit, I was concerned about the incidence of recurrence and asked my Onc which types of cancer were most likely to recur in my instance.  When she answered, it became very clear to me the series of health questions asked me each visit were looking for symptoms of these three types of cancer.  I am finding that if you do not ask the question, you do not get the answer.   I asked why they do not draw blood at my visits; how will I/we know if there is a recurrence?  I was told there is no blood test to detect these types of cancer;  the symptoms do not develop gradually but all of a sudden and need to be reported immediatelly.  WELL, I had to ask to get this information and I only see my Onc every six months.  If I had developed one of the symptoms, you know how we all self diagnose ourselves, would I have thought or known to contact my Onc?  I feel more information needs to be given to the patient once treatment is over because at that point, who knows what to ask?",

      "Content": "My breast cancer also did not show up on a mamogram.  I was diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) of the right breast in January 2010 after noticing a dimple on the right side of my right breast.  Last mamogram was May 2009 and annually for the previous ten years - all clean.  Cancer did show up on breast MRI taken January 2010 after diagnosis and also detected NO lymph node involvement.  Later in January, lymph node biopsy did come back positive for 2 out of 2 lymph nodes removed at right side of breast.  ILC is traditionally undetectible by mamogram and was told by the radiologist that 95% of the cases are found by the patient.",

      "Content": "When my ILC (with lymphnode involvement) was diagnosed in January 2010 at S3, my course of treatment would be 8 chemo treatments, mastectomy, radiation.  Negative margins were the concern with doing surgery first, which is traditional.  At the time of my mastectomy (double), 24 additional lymphnodes were removed - all clean! - I, too, chose to have the healthy breast removed.  My ILC is undetectible with mamogram (I had annually for the last 10 years) and the thought of annual breast MRIs and the 20% probability the cancer would eventually show up in the other breast confirmed my decision.  My breast surgeon did not want to remove a healthy breast, and never brought up the option, but went along with my decision.  I just couldn't imagine putting myself through the treatment process again as well as the fear of the occurrence in the other breast.",

      "Content": "I, too, was post-menopause, ILC, bilat mast, and radiation.    My Onc prescribed Arimidex post treatment for a period of five years.  My ILC is estrogen positive.  I, too, was told the tamoxifen was given as post treatment preventative for recurrence to pre-menopause women and was told Arimidex would not work if pre-menopausal.  Once the ovaries stop producing estrogen, the adrenal gland continues to produce estrogen as our bodies continue to need this hormone beyond the reproductive years.  Arimidex shuts down the adrenal gland's production of estrogen.  The resulting side affects are a testiment to the body's natural need for estrogen.  I began taking arimidex November 2010.  In April 2012, I decided to stop taking it.  To me, the side affects had outweighed the risk of recurrence.   I am 52 years old and felt like 80+; fatigue, severe joint pain in hips, knees, and hands, weight gain, and overall a loss of quality of life.  Exercise gave no relief; if anything the side affects hindered exercise.  I could not imagine three more years of feeling like this.  Oddly, within a week of being off the arimidex, all side affects are gone!  What did happen, though, is since April, I am having menopause symptoms again! ; hot flashes are bearable but the ADD symptoms (inability to concentrate, make a  decision, focus, a feeling of unravelling) hopefully temporary until my body reacts to the estrogen changes (?)  Neither my Onc nor my PC have an explanation why this onset of menopause symptoms.  My menopause occurred 2005 - 2007 and my diagnosis was 2010!  Onward and upward.......",
