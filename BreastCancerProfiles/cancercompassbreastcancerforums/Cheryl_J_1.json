    "Content": "Hi Andrew, It is a scary thing when a doctor states a time period for your loved one. I'm sure that you have picked up a theme from these messages that frequently doctor is wrong. I had metastatic breast cancer last year; the tumor grew in my lymph nodes instead of in the breast proper. I had chemotherapy with the standard drugs plus I chose to use hypnotherapy to help me visualize the cancer cells being killed. Plus I asked many to pray for me and my family. I also had regular massages as a treat since my body was taking such a beating with the chemo. I also had trouble tolerating the chemo; plus I had 5, instead of 4, chemo treatments on a 21 day cycle. The doctor ended up putting me to sleep for 2 days so that I could sleep through the misery. A home health care nurse would arrive a 7:00 am and put me back to sleep on day 2. On day 3 I could begin to eat. After chemo I had surgery and there was no cancer left, just a bunch of damaged lymph nodes. The doctors were very surprised. I tell you this to let you know that the doctors are not all-knowing; the key is the individual and her support network. Bounce ideas off of your mother-in-law and see what she would like to pursue. The more of the whole person you care for, the better, no matter what the outcome. My thoughts are with you and your mother-in-law. --Cheryl",
