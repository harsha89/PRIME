      "Content": "Use of Probiotics in the Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Diarrhea: A Case Study http://pen.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/0148607109332004 Gastrointestinal disturbances (particularly diarrhea) are often induced in response to cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation. Oral chemotherapeutic agents can induce diarrhea by damaging the intestinal lining. Two common oral drugs used in cancer treatment that are known to have gastrointestinal side effects are capecitabine and lapatinib. In this brief communication, the authors discuss a case study of a stage IV breast cancer patient whose chemotherapy-induced diarrhea was treated successfully with a multispecies combination of probiotics. This is a unique study in which grade 3 chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (characterized by 7\u20139 stools per day and associated with incontinence and abdominal cramping) was treated with only a multispecies combination of probiotics. Probiotics have been used to treat diarrhea in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and Crohn\u2019s disease. More recently, probiotics have been used to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in colon cancer patients. This case study demonstrates that the probiotics can also be used to treat severe cases of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in breast cancer patients. The use of different probiotics in gastrointestinal diseases is an increasingly important area of study, and more research into this area is needed. This study demonstrates that probiotics should be considered for advanced breast cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. First published on May 7, 2009",

      "Content": "One I came across from Canada is called \"chemo-fit\". Yes, Australia is way behind this and the suck it and see approach wastes valuable time as well as being debilitating for those people who have to try a number of different ones before they hit on one that works (if it's not too late to get through them all - as your own experience tells). I would support any initiative to make these tests more readily available to oncologists in Australia and can't understand why they are not. Would also save the PBS for drugs used unnecessarily because a pre-test in a lab would clearly determine which drug would be the best to use for a particular cancer. Good luck with your good cause.",
