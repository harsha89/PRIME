Any advice out there? It is hard to awnser that question.  What stage and grade were you when you were originally diagnosed?  Are you pre or post menapausal? Were you ever tested for the Bracc1 or Bracc2 gene?  I don't mean to be so nosey, but those awnsers would help me to give you advice.  I was misdiagnosed twice in a 6 month period. Back in June of 2007, then again in September of 2007.  If I had not gone to yet another doctor and requested that the lump be drained.....I'd probably be dead right now.  The surgeon they sent me to so that it could be drained, found it to be to dense, so he sugically biopsied it.  Needless to say in December of 2007 I was 40 years of age, premenapausal, diagnosed with a stage 3 and grade 3 left breast cancer.  It had moved into 1 sentinal node and 3 lymph nodes, but was estrogen reseptive.  I reguired 4 five hour long \"A\" \"C\" chemo treatments (thats two seperate chemos that you get at the same time.) then 12 chemo treatments of taxol which took an 3 hours a clip.  After all that I began my 33 radiation treatments (which I am half way through).  After all that i will go on Tomoxafin for what we believe will be the rest of my life.  They may switch me to famora after 5 or 6 years.....we'll see.  The reason i explain this to you is because I tested positive for theBracc 2 gene.   By doing this I was able to determine that my cancer was an estrogen loving cancer and all the other places that it would likely go if it became metastatic.  It also helped me to decide what organs I needed to consider having surgically removed if I wanted to try and prevent secondary cancer.  The most important thing it allowed me to do was to notify all the females on my maternal side of the family, because that proved my cancer was genetic and could be passed on. (usually from mother to daughter) PS....  have a great time at your Pink Party and I wish you all the best. Sandy  ",
