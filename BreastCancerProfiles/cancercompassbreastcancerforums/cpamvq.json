      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of 2010.  Since I am a BRCA carrier I underwent a double mastectomy non-nipple sparring and reconstruction.  I have noticed a lump at the 9 oclock position that is sore and feels like the first time I was diagnosed.  I thought I was eliminating my chances of ever getting breast cancer again?!?!  Without any breast tissue how can there be a lump?  I am reaching out to see if anyone knows or has had a similar experience. ",

      "Content": "Your response definitley puts my mind at ease. The prosthetic implant is under the muscle and the lump/cyst is under the implant. It's sore and feels like something is trying to push the implant out of the way. The implants are not that old, but whatever the outcome I will tackle it with the confidence in knowing that I am a SURVIVOR:)  I have already made an appointment with my oncologist:) Thanks so much!! ",
