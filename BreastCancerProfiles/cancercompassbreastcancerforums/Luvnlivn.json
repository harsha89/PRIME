      "Content": "Hello, Just read your message. Sorry a little late (LoL) I was wondering which type of nioxin did you use, do you remember? There is a bunch of different choices of that brand and loved that it worked so well for you.  I just finishd my rounds of chemo but now have to do radiation (5 days a week for 5 weeks) Blah   can't wait to be done with all this.  Did you have to do radiation? If so did that also keep your hair from growing? I used to have long hair past my rear. I don't think I will ever see that again it took many years to grow it that long. I hope you are doing well and hope to hear back soon.",
