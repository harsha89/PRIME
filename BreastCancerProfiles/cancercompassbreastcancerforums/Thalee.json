      "Content": "Wow! What a relief to hear a reason for my right rib pain! I told a couple of my doctors about my \"sore to the touch\" pain that becomes intense when I bend over or try to do certain yoga positions and they had no answer!! I completed chemo in June 2012 and radiation to my right breast in Sept 2012.. Thank you so much for your post!",

No chemo/radiation/loss of lymph nodes. I am exercising 5 times a week at gym and still experiencing back pain. I have modified back exercises as not to aggrevate the pain. What can I do to relieve some of this pain? Any suggestions please. BrendaC Lidocaine cream seems to help me... hope it can help you...I only use it when the pain gets too bad...my doc gave me a script...I guess massage might help...even a friends massage...at least it may feel good while the massage is in progress!...but the lidocaine does give some relief...hope this helps.    Thalee",

However...statistically it improves my life expectancy by 6 months and reduces the chance of recurrance from 18% to 10%. Side effects of arimidex are significantly higher. I'm into quality of life...not quantity.  And it seems everyone has some side effect. Is there anyone who just takes the pill....without side effects?I have been on anastrozole for 3 years. I have some side effects but I am able to handle them.My doctor highly recommends that I continue... He had a patient that discontinued and wanted a different drug...and her cancer come back strongly . I probably have more side effects than most because I have some other medical problems which clouds the picture...If I were you I'd take it...with the right mindset you can handle almost anything ..... Most side effects can be handled and docs can prescribe some meds if necessary. I have no intention of going off..Life is good! I hope you give it a try...I'll pray for you.",
