      "Content": "Hi car2tenn... I was diagnosed 20 years ago with lobular breast cancer, with a 5cm tumor which did not show on mammogram. Had a masectomy and received chemo and radiation at same time. A year ago in September of 2013 the top of my femur broke.  I was told my breast cancer is back in my bones stage 4...my chemo stopped working after 20 years.  I also felt I did everything I could.   Please know you are in my prayers and take one day at a time. (((hugs)))",

      "Content": "Hi,  18 years ago I was diagnosed with a 5cm infiltrating lobular carcinoma showing in situ lobular carcinoma & chronic inflammation hyperplasia...21 limp nodes were removed...all node negative, estrogen receptive. My oncologist said I was borderline in some areas and above in others.  As part of the Team and by being informed through reading and our local support group, I made the right decision for me. Originally, we talked about radiation, no chemo and a 5 yr. tamoxifen program.  I decided to give it the best shot now and go for chemo, radiation (both at the same time) and tamoxifen with no reconstruction.  I wear a prosthesis which works when I need one.  The main thing for me was to get rid of the cancer and to start treatment.  Many of my friends had reconstruction and it is a beautiful thing.  I cried when my closest friend show me her new breast.  Her analogy was she felt whole again which I know many women will understand.  I know today there are many options but decide what you FEEL is best for you.  My prayers are with you my friend.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply and info. It is greatly appreciated. 20 yrs ago after radiation and chem at same time I was placed on tamoxifen for 5 yrs. No problem with that except for hot flashes and slight pain in the top of my legs.  I then went on evista for 15 yrs. Quality of life is important to me too. With my husband fighting CLL and a few other health issues I need to be his support. April 1 I have another bone scan. ..scared to find out results. For me not knowing is worse than knowing. I feel I can have some control of my life if I can make informative decisions...cancer makes you feel you are out of control of your life. I will look into pallative care. It sounds like the way to go. I am glad your energy is pretty good and you are feeling up to doing the things you love.  My thoughts and prayers are with you",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new to Cancer Compass but not to cancer. I was diagnosed with breast cancer 20 yrs ago, had a modified mastectomy,  radiation and chemo at same time. I was 45...told I probably had it since I was 35. In Sept. of 2013 the top of my right femur broke. Had a total hip replacement. Even though I was node negative, estrogen positive, somehow a cell camped out and when the chemo was out of my system the cell became metastatic breast cancer to bones. I am now taking Femura and receive treatments of Zometa.  I will have another bone scan in May and I am scared.  All I know is that a positive attitude got me through many things in my life; my grandson being diagnosed with leukemia ALL, (he is 10 now and doing well) and my husband the same year with leukemia CLL (he is now in remission). I would love to know what treatments you are taking, how you cope each day, and if you have a motto or thought that helps.  I have always said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Please take care....take one day at a time.",
