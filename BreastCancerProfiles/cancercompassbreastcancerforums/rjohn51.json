      "Content": "I had a mastectomy r breast on December 10.  My drain was supposed to come out in a week.  It's still in and producing at least 60 cc per day.  I have always been on antibiotics.  I've gone back to work and resumed normal activities.  The draining just won't stop.  My surgeon tried injections of tetracycline but still draining.  It has slowed a little since the injections.  Any ideas?????????????????????????????????????????? I'm to the point that I want this drain out even if my breast starts swelling.  I know they can draw the fluid off if that happens.  HELP ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the response and the good ideas.  The first surgery I had was the mastectomy in November.  That drain came out in a week and my breast really swelled.  They did not get clear margins.  On Dec 10 went back in just to take tissue.  There was a large seroma and yes they did alot of cultures on it.  Was told everything was fine.  The surgeon says this fluid is lymph fluid and that one of the nodes is not closing off.  I haven't questioned that idea but maybe I should.  I have an oncological surgeon as well who admits this is a long time but doesn't seem to be that worried.  I probably do need to call another surgeon  I think the scan idea sounds reasonable and will ask for this tomorrow.  Other than this everything seems good.  My incisions healed really fast.  I don't feel sick, don't have a fever, etc.  Hope I can get another surgical consult in less that 6 weeks.  Thanks again.",

      "Content": "I've asked for a scan and the surgeon declines this idea.  We are taking the drain out today.  Previously my breast became very swollen when the first drain was taken out but this was not painful.  I suppose they were able to remove alot of that fluid during the second surgery.  My only real fear at this point is lymphedema.  The nurse reports this is unlikely because the fluid is probably encapsulated but I wonder if it will go to my arm.  Is that likely??  I will probably get the implant within the next month or so.  What a world :)",
