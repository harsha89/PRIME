    "Content": "I am new to Cancer Compass and would love to hear from others suffering from neuropathy. I am 47 and was diagnosed 3/5/07 with Stage III breast cancer.  I had a double mastectomy then started Chemo 4/26/07.  I had 4 Adriamycin/Cytoxin Chemo's then 12 Taxol Chemos.  I finished Chemo 9/21/07.  I am now nearly done with 33 radiation treatments (which are going well). My issue is neuropathy which started about two weeks after Chemo stopped.  My fingers and feet and numb all the time.  I drop things continually. At night my feet just twitch and tingle. My nerves jump around and cause aching all the way up my legs.  My body is very stiff if I sit for more than 10 minutes and then my feet are very sore if I stand for long, so it's quite a balance. My Oncologist prescribed Lyrica which seems to take the edge off but the neuropathy just doesn't seem to be getting better.  I realize the effects from chemo can last a long time but I am hopeful someone can share a story of full recovery from such a nasty treatment regimen. Please know I am greatly thankful to be cancer free but am so very hopeful to get back to as normal a life as I possibly can. Thank you for any suggestions or just shared stories.  If I can be of any assistance to any of you, that would be great as well. God Bless Lori",
