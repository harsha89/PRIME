      "Content": "So you're a survivor? 3 more days of treatment and he can heal, thank God! So I have another question. We're going on vacation, the carribean, hot sun. The doctor was go, go, go enjoy life. Then suddenly, he isn't allowed in the sun, they say his skin will turn black from the chemo. Really? I don't know what will happen, but we're going. Enjoying life in a place where you forget about your problems, its great! I just hope it still is. I like to fo things but he was an avid sun-bather Hearing from those who know, makes a difference. Thanks so much for responding",
