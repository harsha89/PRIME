      "Content": "To Ann and whoever else: I am a two-time cancer survivor; thyroid and breast three years later. I have changed a lot about my life, speaking up for me is one. Foods, teas, supplements, herbs, meditation and prayer have been my allies. I would like more info about the 714X--I'll research when finished here. I have done some hospice work, and as far as I am concerned, I'll take my chances with cancer. The oncologist that I see for blood tests every six months is not happy with me at all, but my quality of life is great. We ride the motorcycle hours on end, we laugh and play. LIVE in other words. Good luck. I'm here for support if anyone needs it. Wendy Cody",
