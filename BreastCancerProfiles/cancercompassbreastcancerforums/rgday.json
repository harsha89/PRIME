    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for 15 months.  A couple of questions for others:  1.  What about memory loss?  I find I am extremely forgetful now.  2.  As far as weight loss, does anyone have any information about the HCG diet?   Homeopathic hcg drops?  Can you take the natural homeopathic hcg drops while on Arimidex? I followed WW for 5 months and lost 5 lbs.  I try to walk and exercise to alleviate joint pain, but I know less weight will be helpful also.  Thanks for any information. ",
