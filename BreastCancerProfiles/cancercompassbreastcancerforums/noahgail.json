I was just diagnosed this week and scheduled for surgery and them chemo after recovery.  Why no radiation?  I did have a PET scan done. I've not had opportunity to talk about these ? with my docs......this is alll happening so fast.  I am 47 years old and have a daughter whom I breastfed for 2 years for what thats worth and no family history.  I've infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 5cm tumor and currently grade IIA. It would only seem logical that systemic therapy started as adjutive without local would indicate other possible tumors in body? thanks for any replys.  ",

In any event, she allowed me to cry, vent and just share how scared I .was.  I needed to talk.  And she said keep talking, talking and sharing.  ESPECIALLY with women survivors of breast cancer. Crying and mourning will come and go but as you mentioned to 'think' good thoughts and to focus on staying in the moment. I was particularly interested in a program she mentioned to me.  \"Shadow\"?  Can anyone elaborate or know about this buddy system and how can I contact them? Many thanks, Sandy",

      "Content": "I am going to buy a wig online.  I would like some pros and cons if you would.  I purchased a wig from a specialty shop and paid $300.  We chose the one I tried on for 'style. My hair is brown ( with golden and auburn highlights).  I've no gray. The 'sample' wig was silky, thick and straight and BLOND. The wig I got was greyish brown, course, and CURLY.   I am so very disappointed. I was sent home and instructed to 'tame' the curl with velcro curlers. Did not work. They had me sign a no return policy and stupid me did so. So , back to square one.  I want to get as much info as I can to insure I get what I want.  At this particular shop, natural hair wigs ran 6-$700. There is a particular \"part\" that I don't remember name of but looked verynatural.  I like that however, I don't know if \"monofilament-part is the same thing?  The wig I am considering is only $100.  Any thoughts?  ",
