    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I've been reading a lot from the message board but have not heard anyone mention getting injections of lupron every 3 months for 2 yrs. along with tamoxafin as a way of avoiding reacurrance of breast cancer. I had the oncotype test that came back inconclusive so chemo. wasn't recommended by my Dr. If anything she said that americans tend to be a little chemo. happy when there are much more alternatives now. I would love to hear what other people's responses to this are! Jennyfur  ",
