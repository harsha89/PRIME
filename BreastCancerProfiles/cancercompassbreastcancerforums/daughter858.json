    "Content": "I don't have breast cancer myself, but my mother was just diagosed with metaplastic triple negative breast cancer, just like you.  I'm not a physician or trained professional but I recommend you get another doctor right away!  Sure, the type of breast cancer you (and my mother) have is more aggressive and treatment is limited since they know so little.  But there is more and more available all the time.  I believe that recovery and survival depends not only on how your body reacts, but also greatly on your state of mind.  If your doctor is giving up on you she in turn is causing you to give up on yourself, which is tragic.  Get out here and read all the stories of those who have survived.  There is a woman out here that has survived 12 years with this same diagnosis.  Please keep positive and don't give up the fight.  Here are some websites you my find helpful.  Stay strong and hopeful!   http://www.cancer.net/patient/Cancer+Types/Breast+Cancer+-+Metaplastic http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?CATID=68&L http://metaplasticbreastcancer.org/ http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/513948  http://www.tnbcfoundation.org/index.html http://www.networkofstrength.org/",
