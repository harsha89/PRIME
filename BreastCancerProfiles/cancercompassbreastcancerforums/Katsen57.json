    "Content": "I just had my port put in on 2/12/08 (a week ago) I find it to be annoying but the pain is sub-siding.  I just can't ge the insurance to OK the Folfox/avestin treatment.  I have Carcinoid cancer.  Its rare and not too many docs have any knowledge about it.  But I am about 120 lbs. and so far I don't have too much discomfort with the port.  Mine is a \"power port\" top of the line new. But my arm feels like I have a pulled muscle or something.  I hope it will get better with time.  Good luck, katsen57",
