      "Content": "I have this same problem!!! Why my mom? She is 53 and has metastatic breast. She was dx last April and we thought the breast ca was the worst thing that could happen, then a month later it moved to the lymph nodes in her neck. And yet again more bad new it moved to her lungs and liver and just last week ended up in her brain. So i am right there with ya, i'm mad and just hurt! It's really hard to watch someone you love go thru something so awful. My mom is my world we have a big family and we all stick together but with this we are all just helpless and angry. I have changed doctors and we have taken the natural approach. i have always been organic and healthy so teaching her a new lifestyle has been hard. i found a web site that really helped her understand and it has been amazing in slowing her cancer down. www.cancer-prevention.net this is worth the time it takes to read! Good luck",

They found 24 tumors in her brain, the largest was about an inch the other 23 were still pretty small. She just finished 4 wks of radiation and alot of steriods to keep the swelling down in her brain. We got the news this past Monday 8-13-07 that the 23 small tumors were gone...and the 24th in drastically shrinking. So tell her to hang in there, the cancer in her lungs has spread since we have been working on her brain but we aren't giving up yet, if she can beat 24 brain tumors than hopefully the lungs won't be so bad. God Bless and keep your chin up!",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about you mom, my mom was dx last April with metastatic breast. It moved from her breast to the lymph nodes in her neck, now it is in her lungs liver and we just found brain mets last week. The lymph nodes in the neck drain into the lungs and abdomin, so its really important that she find resorces to help get it under control. This web site has helped my family understand cancer please at least look at it www.cancer-prevention.net it has given us a new hope, and last April my mom was given less than 6 mths to live. We are now a year and a half out of a terminal diagnosis and still fighting. Don't give up if we can stop the growth of brain mets there is still hope out there for you guys. Good luck!",

She was given a 6mth or less dx last April and we are now a year and a half out and still fighting. this web site helped us understand www.cancer-prevention.net she would be dead by now if we hadn't applied some of these things. She is on Xloda and Tykerb it hasn't done anything for her so she stopped the regiment, we are trying another, but don't give up i have heard good things about the combo. We are using natural and modern medicine and that combo is working she looks and feels great and to look at her you would never know what is going on inside her body.",
