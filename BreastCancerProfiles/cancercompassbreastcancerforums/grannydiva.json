I was in your situation and I chose the lumpectomy instead of masesctomy. My cancer was located in the chest wall. They had to go in with a lead wire to get to it. My doctor said other patients that had their cancer located in the same area, got cancer again, even after the masectomy. I underwent 35 radiation treatments. Where is the lump located? There's also a P.E.T. scan they can run to see if theres any cancer cells movement in the nodes and anywhere else. Dont know if you've had one or not. The P.E.T. scan showed that my surgeon had gotten every floating microscopic cell when he decided how much tissue to take out along with the tumor. I'm tired and fat now, but I'm alive and try to count my blessing every day.   I hope you make the choices that are right for you..... I hope to hear back.   Beverly in Ohio       thank you beverly for responding to my letter, i have made my decision to go with the mastectomy, ifeel this will be my best and safest choice, i have not heard of this scan, its been very hard to decide what to do and i feel good with this decision and i'm praying so hard its the right one and i just felt that goingwith treatment only left me with bad odds,. i will talk to my doctor about this scan and if this is something my insurance will cover maybe i'll give it a shot before anything is done. where can i find info on this?",

I had just returned from my father's funeral, he died from undiagnosed cancer metastactic..... from diag to death in 4 days... I was feeling the same way, I had microcalcifications in two places, no lump... two biopsies, I felt my body had let me down, I eat right, excercise etc etc, so it was a mastectomy, and with 4 nodes positive and her2 I was stage 2b with absoloutely no symptoms other than detection from a mamagram. I came through it well, hardly any pain, recovered fine went to work in 4 days, then started chemo in Feb 07 had mastectomy in Dec06.. Did pretty well om chemo, finished since May 07, have been looking at lots of alternative supplements, and now taking PAW PAW I believe that is the way to go and other whole food supplements. Listen to your Dr, and also your gut feeling, then ask lots of questions, question everything.... I did... good luck and let us know how you are doing. Corinne dear corinne,  thank you, i meet with my doctor and we decide the best was a mastectomy and i now how peace of mind and believe this is best so now i'll be meeting with a plastic surgeon to do reconstructive surgery at the same time, so ill only have to face chemo and hormone treatment i just don't think i would have peace of mind under only treatment i feel good about my decision and can now move forward. i believe in herbal supplements and will follow threw with that after all the big stuff gets out of way. i did herbs for years and then quit, i will go back to it ",

I have not gone through it, but my Grandmother did, and  I did work for OB/GYN physicians for 20 years, so I saw alot more than the average person. My gut feeling is that if they want you to \"consider\" the surgery---GO FOR IT!! Why take the chance?  I always said that is what I would do in that case.  Anything that can be done to assure that there is less of a chance for the cancer to return, I would take. That is only my opinion, and I hope that you are successful, in whatever course of action you take. Beth thank you beth it feels good to know someone else's opinion and with your background helps even more.",
