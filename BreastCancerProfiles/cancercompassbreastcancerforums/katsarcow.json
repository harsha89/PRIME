      "Content": "Thanks for posting.  I too, missed everyone after treatment.  I go back once a month to get my port flushed and when I take my seat in the recliner and lean it back, I feel like I'm home again.  My main nurse is also a brest cancer survivor, so she really had my back.  I thought I must be the only one that felt that way so, of course, I've never admitted it to anyone.  I since then joined Curves and exercise there.  It's being a Godsend.  I've thought about becoming a volunteer, so I could give back some of what was given to me, but so far, I'm leaving it to the staff and getting to know me again.  Joining a good breast cancer support group is also very beneficial.  No you're not nuts.  :-D  We need to let go and let the nurses care for the women that come after us.  There are many, unfortunately.  Take care.  Linda",

      "Content": "Hi, Sorry you are having bad side effects also.  (my side effects were HORRIBLE hot flashes with HORRIBLE tingling in all my joints, couldn't sleep, irritated beyond belief) etc.  I stopped.  I couldn't handle it.  I took all the chemo, all the radiation, surgeries with good results.  But when I tried the meds for 6 mos.  I said no more.  My dr is doing blood work every 3 mos with good results so far.  My next blood work is in about 2 mos.  If it's in the normal range, he said I could have my port removed if I want.  He also said, I gave it my best in trying the drugs.  He also said, \"there is no guarantee the drugs will keep the ca away and he also commented, \"not taking them will mean it comes back.  My lifestyle, age, and other health issues helped me make a the decision to stop.  Does it haunt me sometimes?  Yes, it does but everyday feeling more back normal I forget about it.  It's a heck of a decision none of us should have to go through.  Evidently, there is enough proof that taking the drugs do have better outcomes, but will cancer be my demise?  I don't know.  There's a lot of other things out there taking lives every day.  Hopefully there's anoher pill on the way with less side effects.  If there is good support in the town you live, that might be really helpful.  Take care and hope you can get comfortable with whatever decision you make.  That's where staying in the moment helps.",

      "Content": "I was grateful to search and find this site also.  I am also 64. I was dx with stage 2-3  breast cancer, estrogen positive 93%.  The 93% is why my dr really wanted me to be able to tolerate one of the hormone drugs.  I tried 2 (6 months) and the quality of life for me was not tolerable.  So, since stopping the drug, I have joined a gym changed my eating habits.  I finally feel some sort of normalcy.  I also  know several women personally that can tolerate the meds.  Not clear if your concerns are the know drug sideffects or the effects you are experiencing.  If I could of tolerated them, I would of kept taking them.  I try to live in the moment and enjoy this day.  The exercise (Curves) and eating tons of steamed veggies and fresh fruit are being a pleasant journey for me.  Am I cramming for the finals, maybe, but it's never to late if I can stay in the moment.  That's all we really have.  The best to you.",

      "Content": "I didn't re-read my post but what I meant was:  my doctor said if I stop taking it, does NOT mean it will come back.  Never considered myself brave, but maybe we all are.  Otherwards there are no guarantees either way.  Taking it or not taking it.  That's where I had to consider my Quality of life, not quantity.   The reason I tried 2 drugs was because some people can tolerate tylenol and some can tolerate advil so I gave two a try and I guess #3 isn't out yet.   Bottom line:  I tried two and not worth it to me.  I was too sick taking a drug that has no guarantees.   Hopefully, what ever you and your doctor decides we will still be  posting 20 years from now.   Regarding my port, that's how they administered my chemo 5 days a week for I think at least 6 weeks. I hope the best for you and that you can tolerate any side effects.  They ask that  you take it for 5 years.  I've also read that the results are promising that if you can tolerate it another 5 years even better.   God Bless You and he is the one in charge.  I'm trying to do the footwork the best I can.",
