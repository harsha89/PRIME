    "Content": "I did everything that I was suppose to do and had the blood draws on a regular basis and when they found the cancer was in the liver, bone, intestine and throughout my whole body. The part that really bothers me is that I had been going to the docters for about 8 months prior to the finding of the cancer. Because I was in pain and the ribs kept going out of place and there was a big lump on my leg in the groin area. But no one checked for the return of the cancer. I even went to my onacoligist and when I tryed to show him the location of the lump he backed away and said to see a gonacoligist. I was scheduled to have blatter surgery on Nov. 17th. I was worried about what the lump was. Then it broke open and drained a lot of blood and junk through two holes in the groin area. And healed up enough that my family docter could not find it. So I had the surgery which I am sure caused the cancer to spread to the other side. Why did they not find it sooner?",
