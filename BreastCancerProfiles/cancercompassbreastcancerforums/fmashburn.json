For the past 3 years,every time her yearly would come back abnormal. But the ultrasound would come back ok. So then she would have it again in 3-6 months and they would come back normal till the next yearly. Well, when her breast got red and swollen the red flag finally raised. Now i just found out that she has stage 4 breast cancer ,and that it has spread i'm very angry that after many doctors and tests it didn't get found till now!!! She has not been feeling well for a year, now i know why! Has anyone else had the same experience??     But, this oct. Was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer   I was diagnosed with stage IV cancer in April.  I just turned 49.  I had stage I breast at age 35 (with bilateral mastecotomies), chemo and tamoxifen and have had no trouble until I found a lump in April.  Sad thing is that for the last couple of years I've had pain and swelling in my implants as well as one blood work up that showed abnormalities with my lungs.  Doctor was not worried about blood work because I've never been a smoker. He was treating me for fibromalgia with the pain.  It took me finding lump and going to a surgeon to have it removed.  By then cancer had spread to my liver, lungs and bones.  Now my doctors are telling me that its the same cancer that I had 13 years ago. I live in NC and went to Duke University hospital.  They did not give me much hope for any treatment, except clinical trials.  With encouragement from family I went to CTCA in October.  Things are looking better for me right now with my breast cancer tumor markers being almost normal.  I have a CT scan in late Jan and hopefully it will be positive.  Good luck with your mother I would love to hear what treatment she is having and how it is going. Is her cancer ER/PR positive?  ",
