    "Content": "Dear All,   I am happy to have discovered this web site.   I am 59 years old and I had stage one breast cancer last August. After surgery I had 5 day targeted radiation therapy and started on Femara on August 22. I had been on hormone replacement therapy for years. Intially the side effects were intense vascular flushing (hot flashes), nausea, diaherra, extreme fatigue, and occasional intense joint pain in my wrists and hands. The first 4 symptoms diminished somewhat, but the joint and then muscle pain increased, to the point that it affected my quality of life.....I took to my bed once or twice a week, for probably a half day each time. Sleep is difficult as well.  My Coping Strategies: I have always been an active person, but I have realized that I have to exercise daily, at a more intense level that before...which is difficult when you hurt all over. I work out at the gym 3-4 times a week and try tennis once or twice a week. I have recently started Pilates and that seems to help with the stiffness that makes me feel like I am 90 every morning. I take a lot if vitamins including calcium, of course, glucosamine, multi vitamine..pharmaton, vitamins B12, E, C, and Fish  Oil. I took all of these before I was disgnosed..I am now going to up my intake of Glucosamine, from two tablets to three...ok'd by the doctors.  For pain, I take Aleve and Paracetomal, which is the Englsih version of Tylenol.....I live outside the US and my German OBGYN recommended the Paracetomal after having another patient with a similar case history to mine.Sounds simplistic but seems to do the trick if you take the meds at the start of the pain cycle. For sleepless nights, I sometimes take Zanax, .25 ....not much but at least you can get off to sleep, even if you are up and about through the night.   My Queston:   Given all that I have written above, my doctors and I have decided that I must change to Aromasin as the side effects of Femara were too intense...neck pain started and was intense. Would any of you who have been through a similar path care to advise me as to what I am going to go up against next? E.G.: List of side effects, less or more....do you start from zero again, or are the effects less? I will have been off Femara for one month when I start Aromasin. (and the Femara side effects have lessened, but not by much) How bad is the joint pain compared to Femara? Finally:  To all of you.....we are all still here, scared, but coping as best we can. Together we can find support and hopefully strategies to deal with these drug therapies, I thank you for reading, and hopefully responding.",
