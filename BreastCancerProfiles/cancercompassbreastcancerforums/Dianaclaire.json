    "Content": "You have my sympathy! I have had severe diabetic neuropathy in my feet for the past 15 years.  My only relief has come from a combination of Neurontin ( 2400 mg daily) and Methadone (10 mg 3 times a day). I had tried every remedy suggested to me. I didn't know how I could go on. I finally went to a pain clinic at a large teaching hospital. After trying at least a dozen combinations, the Neurontin and Methadone offered me the most satisfaction. I will be having radiation and chemo soon and I am curious to see how these treatments affect my neuropathy. Don't lose hope, there is something out there that will work for you, too.  Keep on your doctor, he is there to serve you. God bless you.",
