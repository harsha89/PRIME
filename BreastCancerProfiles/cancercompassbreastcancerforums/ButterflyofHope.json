      "Content": "This is my first time on any forum, but I appreciate the content & wanted to share. My story is very similar to yours. A breast cancer survivor as well having had my last Chemo treatment back July 30th2012. When hair regrowth occurred I had peach fuzz all over my body\u2026LOL I\u2019m okay with not having to shave often or plucking the eyebrows, however the disheartening part is the hair on my head .The regrowth was that of male pattern baldness. My hair grew back snow white only the back portion was rather salt n pepper looking. I left my hair natural for the first year in hopes that not coloring my hair would help in its regrowth, tried numerous follicle rejuvenation products too. With little to no success I decided to go full head of platinum hair, at least the scalp didn\u2019t show thru so badly with blonde vrs salt & pepper. I too have tried the powders available to colour match the scalp for a fuller look, also use dry shampoo & thickening hairspray\u2026.but most of the time I put my hair up to hide the thinning hair. Has anyone had any success stories \u2026I message my scalp every nite, even used different oils. No visible results yet.",

      "Content": "On a slightly different note I suffer from very bad neuropathy. Does anyone here also suffer from it? Painful tingling stabbing in feet still occurs especially when tired or when weather changes....even noticed slight trippin when really tired or painfil. Curious if ice packs offered for my hands during chemo could be offered for feet preventing the neuropathy in patients currently going thru treatment.  I\u2019ve been doing a lot of online reading & have found folks have been prescribed with vitamin b12 shots for similar scenarios & claim great results with hair growth, neuropathy, nail strengthening & even energy levels....Curious if anyone on here has tried.  I have my routine follow up with my oncologist & was going to ask his thoughts is it something I should explore? Been suffering for 2 years with no real relief, I did hate giving myself shots during chemo\u2026but I could \"wo\u201dman up if it meant I was going to have real results. Have used oral vitamin supplements such as b12 & biotin wth little tono results so I\u2019d love someones input who has. Thanks",

      "Content": "At his point I am willing to try anything. Recently bought Pantene Sheer Volume\u2026actually impressed with the results just as good as some of the more expensive name brands I have been using. I will keep \"One\" in mind the next time I\u2019m in Sally\u2019s. I\u2019ve always been an 80\u2019s girl with BIG shag hair, now I cheat with my hair up with a false pony to give it the fuller appearance.  I\u2019ve started taking Biotin again as well keeping my fingers crossed\u2026I didn\u2019t see noticeable difference back when I was taking it a year ago but maybe it\u2019s time to try again.",
