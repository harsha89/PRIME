    "Content": "I hope that you have someone that will go with you and be supportive while you are going through all of these procedures and dealing with this diagnosis.  I don't want to add to your anxiety, but my experience wasn't as pleasant as some of the other women who have responded to you.  I have to say that the needle biopsy hurt really bad.  However, on the day of my lumpectomy and LN biopsy, the radiation injection was the worst of all of the treatments and procedures that I went through.  My boyfriend was with me which helped, but that procedure brought me to tears.  I have a high tolerance for pain and that was awful.  4 shots in the areola is tough.  But then that's it.  I can tell you from experience, that is the worst of it. I did have a drain tube for a week.  It didn't hurt, but it was gross.  I've also had 2 different surgeries for a port-a-cath.  I would recommend having this device inserted for anyone that has to have chemo.  It eliminates the need for an IV every time.  My veins gave out fairly quickly with the blood draws before every chemo treatment then with the chemo treatments.  I will say that my general surgeon didn't do a great job and there was an issue with blood return, stuff would go in but nothing would come out.  I suggest having a radiologist do this.  My first one had to be removed and replaced. The radiologist did a GREAT job and I didn't have to go under when he did it.  It made a world of difference.  However, please note that only an RN is certified to access your port.  You don't want just anybody messing with it. You are going to have anxiety until this is all over.  But know that the anticipation is the worst of it.  The pain is gone almost as soon as it starts.  You are a woman, you are naturally strong.   :)  You will be fine.  Keep your chin up and at least have the procedure done before you give up.  You have to know just how advanced your condition is and just what you're dealing with before making any decisions regarding treatment.  Breast cancer doesn't have to be a death sentence.  There are survivors EVERYWHERE!!!  It's amazing how many women you will meet that have beat it and how many men whose wives and mothers have beaten it.  But don't give up.  Not yet.  Chances are very very good that you will beat this thing.  Best of luck to you.  My thoughts and prayers are yours.  God bless you and help you through this.",
