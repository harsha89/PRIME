      "Content": "Thanks to everyone who has replied. The info is very helpful. I am also battling stopping the arimadex completely. I wish I knew of some people who have done this long term but can't seem to find any info. I changed my diet to veggies, fruit, nuts and will do fresh local fish one day per week. I am stopping all processed foods. It is hard to do! Boy do I crave bread! I am going to try and fight the estrogen naturally. I see there is only a 4% better odds using arimadex. I have been on it one month and haven't been able to get out of bed for a week! My neck hurts so bad and I have a migraine headache from it! I want to do yoga but can't stand up. I am 5'9\" and 145 pounds so I don't have much body fat left to create estrogen. I think I need to check that book out :-)",

I didn't follow it strictly though but I did do the probiotics. I am currently one week out on another cleanse. This one claims that your body can have fungus or mold in it and it irritates your liver and it produces estrogen. I was exposed to mold in 2005 after hurricane Wilma so it's not that far fetched for me. I am not eating or drinking anything processed, no eggs, dairy, chicken, peanuts, pork or beef. There isn't that much left after that! It has been 7 days and I am craving a glass of wine and a quesadilla! (This also requires probiotics)",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a hysterectomy and oopherectomy in January. I was on Tamoxifen for almost a year and I think that's what caused a cyst in my uterus, and my right ovary was as big as an orange! So, I cleaned house and got rid of everything. I am now a month and a half in to arimidex. It is post menopausal medication.  I got really bad neck aches and headaches about a month into it and got scared, but went to a chiropracter and it took care of the pains! Now I have to make sure I am taking the right supplements (calcium, magnesium and D3) to combat bone loss. Are they just recommending that you take it now after all of this time? Your body still makes estrogen after the ovaries are gone. it is just a different type. A way to combat estrogen is to make sure you are not over weight. Fat produces estrogen. So, if you can replace any fat with muscle, you will help yourself immensely! I know though. It is hard to work out when in pain. I just eat mostly fruits, nuts and vegetables to keep the weight down.  Make sure you are working with doctors. If you don't like yours, switch. Don't be afraid of second opinions. I am choosing to take the blockers. It's hard, but I have 4 years left........",

      "Content": "Hi, I was wondering if there was anyone who thinks they may know how they got an estrogen receptive breast cancer. I've talked to several women, and they all think they know how they got it. I have a feeling too because I have no family history of it. Between the ages of 20 and 30 I went vegetarian and consumed mainly soy products. I thought I was doing good for myself. I ate veggie burgers, meatless chicken, tofu, edamame, soy sausages....etc. I ate them EVERY day! I know they say soy mimics estrogen so am thinking this may be what triggered my cells to go crazy. Some things I read says plant matter can't do that. I just feel in my gut that this is how I got it. After 30 I ate meat again. But as I try and find the source of the meat, most of it is grain fed.....most of that grain being soy! The chickens are fed grains....soy. The eggs from free range chickens are fed grains....soy! My lotions contain soy! Why does every darned thing I try to eat contain soy! I tried to do better and am left confused by food. Other women ER positive tell me they were on hormone replacement therapy and think that caused it. Another believes it was the hormones in her birth control pills. I am just curious if others have that \"feeling\" that they know what caused them to get this? I was 41 (2012) when I had a 3.5 cm tumor in my left breast. I opted for bi lateral mastectomy. My tumor was close to my chest wall but the surgeon got clean margines. I had 9 lymph nodes removed and 3 had cancer. I was stage 2 but borderline 3. I did 4 rounds of chemo and 36 radiation treatments. I was on tamoxifen for almost a year which made me have a hysterectomy and ovaries removed. I also was having problems with my vision. I couldn't focus my eyes. I switched to arimadex a month ago and hate it already. I have had neck pain and pain between my shoulder blades that has floored me and I can't do anything. My right foot also feels like it is broken. I am just wondering what and how others feel about food........",

Maybe it soaks up toxins and carries them out of the body? I think it is a combination of things, not just one thing picked out. They also eat far more vegetables for more fiber. How often do we eat water chesnuts? I am not understanding why someone said soy. I ate it daily for almost every meal. I drank soy milk on occasion as well. I know I can't change what I DID do, but I can change what I WILL do! No more soy for me! (That I know of anyway. They hide it in everything!) I even had a hard time finding vitamins the other day with no soy. I think it just went over board and to feed animals we eat with it just worsens it (and eggs too). We have wild chickens on this island I live on. I am contemplating building a coop and leaving feed out so they will roost and leave some eggs without soy feed in them!",

      "Content": "I am glad you got through that day. Make sure you go to all of your appointments. Ask the doctor when it's ok to start lifting your arm. I babied mine and didn't realize I was doing it. I think when you get the drains out is when you start. I was lifting my arms, but not like a jumping jack. Also (after your surgeon says it's ok) I would lay on my back on the floor and clasp my fingers together behind my head and hold it as long as I could. I was yelled at by my surgeon that I was babying it and if I didn't show improvement by my next visit, he would put me on physical therapy. Well, when I heard physical therapy, I heard dollar signs. Dollars is not what I had at that time so I took vicodin and walked my hand up the wall crying and swearing the whole time! But, I did it! The next time when my surgeon walked in to the room, I was standing with my arm over my head leaning against the wall and said \"Hi.\" He laughed so much and couldn't believe I did it! When you go to the oncologist, make sure you have a good feeling about them and that they are attentive to your needs. If they are not, shop around. Get second opinions if you need to. I remember I felt very rushed but you do have time, especially because you have to heal before any chemo if you end up needing chemo. When it comes to decisions, it's up to you and you family to make the choices. I chose to be aggressive because I have an almost 3 year old son and it is my goal to see him grow up. Talk to many people to find out what they did and if they've had relapses. I know two ladies who refused chemo and did \"alternative\" methods. One had a mastecomy with no chemo and one had a lumpectomy, radiation and no chemo. Both had relapses years later. I know a few other women in treatment now but they are at the same stage as me for having chemo, so I don't know of any that had relapses after chemo. Maybe you could open another chat on here asking if anyone had chemo and relapse? I am sorry about your loss. I hope you are not thinking you are next. Try and keep the positive flowing and try to stay in this moment. You have to take it minute by minute, not day by day. The hardest part I found was telling family and friends. They get too far ahead in things and it makes it difficult to think or make decisions. Right when I told my sister I was diagnosed, she was already talking about wigs! I didn't even know if I needed chemo yet! So, I had to tell her to slow down and that I was sorry, but I couldn't be there to help her with her emotions about my sickness right now because I needed ALL of my energy to focus on getting well. People are going to want to help, but most don't know how to go about it. They will want you to read EVERY web page on miracle cancer sures and such and such. It is exhausting. No two canters are the same. No two treatments are the same. You may have to have your brother help you in this. I had my husband take and make all of the calls to update people. I told everyone \"Don't worry, I will be back.\"",

I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated!   I was dignosed with stage 4 cancer one month after a clean mammogram.  The physical check  was cause enough for a breast MRI, an ultrasound and a needle biopsy.  If you have any doubts about anything go see your primary...

My dog made me go get a check up too! He began to follow me so closely that I would trip over him and then he kept trying to jump in my lap and jump on the bed with me (both things he has never done before). I remembered a story a co worker had told me that his dog began sleeping on his pillow. He then found out he had a brain tumor. So, that story made me pay attention to my dog and get that lump checked out! I thought it was my baby milk drying up and ignored it! I make sure to tell this story because my co worker telling me his story saved my life! (On a seperate note, my tumor showed up on my mammogram and ultra sound).",

I was glad I did because the cancer had spread to 3 of my lymph nodes. Does it look good? Nope! Do I feel like a man at times? Yup! I was sad to say good bye to my body parts! I am sure any amputee goes through feelings of loss. It's like that feeling you have right after giving birth. The sadness that your baby is no longer in your body. Because of my radiation, I just found out I am not a good candidate for reconstruction. I will be this way forever. If you really think about it, life is not all about looks. I recently was mad about my boobs giving me cancer. Then I thought real hard about it and decided I should be thanful for them! They took the brunt of my cancer and gave up their lives for me! It is the BEST possible place to get cancer if you are going to get it! They can cut it out! They can't cut it our of your lungs or bones or blood! So look to the sky and say \"Thank you\". Thank the unniverse that you have it in a place where it can be dealt with. You could have been hit by a bus and not had today. But you were given today. So be thankful for all of these extra days you've been given. Stop thinking about what you DON'T have and be thanful for what you DO have. While you are in the middle of all of this, you will think this is how you will feel forever. It is painful but it does go away. And lift your arms when they tell you to! Lift them like you are doing a jumping jack! I pounded the vicodin and broke through scar tissue to get my arm up! Don't do that! Do it before the scar tissue creeps in! Keep your chin up.

Yes, many people have problems in life and go through financial difficulties. This is simply if you want to help. Even with health insurance, a cancer patient is not able to work full time or in some cases at all. With missed income, daily necessities are difficult. Times that by increased gasoline costs, having to get food on the road while being treated, co pays, deductibles and so on, it is a difficult journey to just get by.

I went through a bi lateral mastectomy in Dec of 2012. January 2013 started 4 rounds of chemo. Then went right in to radiation (36 rounds) which my 1 year anniversary is on the 10th! My son was 14 mos old when all of this started! Now I have hair, but Tamoxifen made me get a benign polyp in my uterus as well as thickening of the uteran wall and my right ovary was the size of an orange and my left one was the size of a golf ball! Just when I thought treatment was over, I had a complete hysterectomy and ovaries removed in Jan 2014! I feel like I have been recovering ever since! Now because I am officially post menopausal, I switched to Arimadex. Within one month of taking it, I am having severe neck and back pain to the point of not being able to function! I looked at a forum on here and saw that it did a lot of damage to a lot of people and am considering stopping the post cancer meds. I would love to talk to my oncologist about it, but the cancer center did not renew his contract and now there is no oncologist where I live! Anyway, I would love to hear where you are at in all of this. Keep on keeping on!",

      "Content": "Hi. I had radiation a little over a year ago to my left breast (where my breast used to be). I had 36 rounds. Did they mention aquapur and silvadine. Not sure if I spelled them right? Immediately after you get radiation, you should put after sun aloe on it like you buy for sun burns. Do right at the office where you change your shirt. The aquapur can be bought at cvs. I think Eucerin makes it. It's about 18.00 for the large jar. I bought some men's plain white t shirts because they were cheap. I slathered the aquapur on at night and put the loose fitting mens shirt on to sleep in. Do not put anything on it before you go to radiation. Wash the area that gets radiated with plain water as gently and as best you can and pat dry. You do not want anything oily on your skin before radiation as this will intensify the burn. Silvadine has to be prescribed. It gets worse before it gets better. Right when the treatments stop, it starts to heal really fast. Try not to wear bras or anything that will rub on it. Try not to use soap on the area either as that will dry it out. You can also ask for a low dose anti depressant. It helped me to have the \"I don't care\" effect :-)",

I also said it would be nice if she appreciated what I try to do for her/us once in a while.  Just a simple Thank You.  Now she says she doesn't know what to do, I said she was fine and to just focus on herself.  I know I was wrong to bring it up, I became frustrated and spoke w/o thinking.  Now it's crying every day, yelling at me, I have prayed to God for an answer and will continue to do so.  Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I never meant to hurt her feelings or to suggest any negativity.  I have failed my wife and see no avenue to change it. Thank You, Doug Bring her flowers. On another day, bring her a card that says nice things. Tell her you don't care what happens and that you just want your wife. With chemo are steroids. She could be roid raging. I did that and had no idea what was going on. I wanted to rip other drivers out of their car for cutting me off! It was horrible and I had no clue. It all felt real to me when it was happening. Your wife is dealing with the fact that she probably is not going to live as long as she thought she was going to. She looks in the mirror and someone else is looking back at her and she can't find herself. Her whole life just changed and was thrown upside down. Sure, your life changed too. But she knows once she passes, you will be able to live on and move on (This is what we think in our heads mind you). Part of her may be pushing you (and family) away so you get used to her not being around. People do nice things just to do nice things and not have to get attention for doing so. Saying you want a thank you once in a while means that you feel like you are going above and beyond what you WANT to be doing so it makes her feel like you don't WANT to be there for her and that her existence is a nuicense to you. Do not make her feel that way because she will not get better. Make her want to fight to be here. Don't make her feel like you are bothered by here presence and that you want her gone so you can move on. Flowers for no reason once in a while helps. Cards too. Ask her what you can do for her. I guarantee she has extreme fatigue and pain. Don't make her feel worse about it like it's her fault she got sick. Did you say for better or for worse when you got married? I have had every female part of me amputated, I can hardly walk or work anymore because of post cancer meds, and my husband makes me feel like a beautiful princess. He makes me feel like I am his world and he wants me here. I fight twice as hard because of it. It may help for you as well to find others in groups who are dealing with cancer spouses and talk with someone. Cancer is stressful for the entire family. My family has no idea what I am dealing with. Personally, I hope they never will know. Best of luck to you and I hope you can wait the emotions out. Don't take them personally. Try not to make suggestions to her either because that will trigger it worse. Just ask \"What can I do to help you? I don't know what to do.\"",

It ended up that my uterus lining was thickening and that I had a polyp (luckily benign) and one of my ovaries was the size of a large orange and the other the size of a golf ball. Is your cancer estrogen positive? It can help fight your cancer by removing ovaries but just be warned there are side effects. After I had my operation they then put me on arimidex. After 10 months of that, I decided to take myself off both drugs due to the side effects. I of course am nervous about this and it wasn't an easy decision and I am not happy about the lack of choices I have in the matter. I am also doing a complete lifestyle change about educating myself about outside estrogen sources and eliminating them which is also not easy but i feel like it is my only defense. I stopped eating meat and dairy which was first and foremost and also removed all canned foods, processed foods, soy, flax, and plastics out of my life. I also switched any body soaps or lotions to paraben free as those also mimic estrogen. You need a strong liver and a strong intestines to help your body heal. So learn how to take care of them and that will help you. I have been studying this almost daily for 3 years so it is a process.....Nothing about cancer is easy.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am so sorry for your diagnosis. I like your question and am also interested to see if anyone has been \"cured\" through alternative means. I am stage 2 ER and PR positive. I went the chemo route. I had a bi lateral mastectomy Dec 3rd of 2012, 4 rounds of chemo starting in January ending in March and then had radiation 36 rounds until June 2013. I then was taking Tamoxifen until January of 2014 when it messed up my uterus and ovaries (so I had them all removed) and switched to Arimidex (estrogen blockers for my estrogen positive cancer). I don't regret my treatments. I believe they saved my life. I had involvement in 3 of my lymph nodes so know that cancer cells may have gotten loose in my body. At first I didn't look at food. I just wanted to get better and knew I had to eat food to get better. I ate everything. Chemo makes you want nothing, so I at high fat and high calorie foods just to get me through. Since the road to recovery, I searched high and low trying to figure out why I got cancer to begin with. I have no family history. Between the ages of 20 and 30, I was a self declared vegetarian. I thought soy would give me all of the protein I need. (For some reason people are obsessed with protein) (me included). I ate soy products for breakfast lunch and dinner. Now I know soy mimics estrogen. Sigh. I had too much estrogen and got a 3.5 cm tumor very close to my chest wall.  I can't say that is how I got cancer, but the more I researched food, the more soy I see. I am 43 now. I was diagnosed at 41.  I always tried to be healthy when it comes to food. I always eat salad and raw vegetables. Even my dentist says \"I don't know what you are doing, but keep on doing it. Your teeth have no build up.\" But after 30, I began to eat meat again. I also conitnued to eat soy. Tofu. Edamame. Veggie burgers. etc. The things I didn't know is that soy was in the meats I was eating. Anything grain fed is fed mostly soy beans. Chickens. Free range chickens are grain fed....mostly soy beans. The eggs which are organic were laid by hens that were fed a vegetarian diet.....mostly soy beans. I decided to read labels on everything. Everything from soup to canned tuna fish contains soy! The facial products, soy! Protein powders, soy! Everything has soy! I was eating all of this thinking I was being healthy! So now I am VERY careful about what I eat! No more processed foods! No more meat and no more dairy! I think your decision should be based on 2 things. One, go with your gut. Your gut is never wrong! Two, it all depends on how far along your cancer is. I think once it gets to tumor stage, you may need doctor involvement and western medicine to get you back to \"normal\" and then implement natural remedies to keep the cancer away. You will hear MANY stories how this thing or that \"cured\" cancer. What you don't normally hear with such  stories is what type of cancer cell the person had. What the person's name and age are. If they've had any western medicine at the same time as trying natural medicine or not. That it is the exact same cancer as you had (no two cancers are the same). If the person had a tumor or not. What stage cancer they had. Etc.  Please keep those questions in mind. I have heard everything under the sun cures cancer such as tumeric to pot oil (THC), to dandelion root tea, to a certain bark of a tree etc., etc.  Research everything. Ask questions. If you don't like what the doctors are telling you, go to another doctor. YOU are your best advocate. Take charge! Think things through. You are the only one who can make these decisions. Keep in mind that a doctor can only give you options. They cannot tell you that you SHOULD do this or that. My surgeon offered many suggestions. He then told me the number one breast cancer patient is a returning one. He couldn't tell me which option to take, but his face lit up when I said I should do bi lateral mastectomy. He said it was a very wise decision, but he wasn't allowed to tell me to choose that route. A doctor has seen many cancers and has also seen how they react to treatment. I had no experience with tumors and cancer. Who am I going to trust? Someone with experience, or someone with none? I did also go with my gut. Treatment sucked. I will not lie. But I am here. I am a mom to a 3 year old and I am thankful I can still be his mom! I am still here! Things still suck sometimes but I get better all the time. I work, am a mom and a wife. No matter which way you go, it's going to be difficult. Sometimes it kicks in that it's CANCER. But do not have a pity party! There are hundreds of thousands of us cancer people out there! You are not alone :-)",

      "Content": "Hi. I was also looking for someone who was longer out who has done just natural treatments but can't find any. I can tall you the stories of me and a few of my cancer buddies.  I have estrogen positive cancer and was stage 2b. 3 of my lymph nodes had cancer in them. At the time of diagnosis, my son had just turned a year old and I wanted to be around for him. I was aggressive, because I do not want to do this again. I had a bi lateral mastectomy. I then had chemo and then had radiation. I will admit being bald with no breasts is no cake walk. But now I am 2 years out and have all of my hair back. I am also alive. I have been studying natural stuff and keeping estrogen out of my life. What I have learned is that you need 2 things in order for your body to fight for you. Your liver and your intestines. These 2 things are your biggest illness fighters. So, you need to make them healthy. Probiotics help your intestines. There are so many anti biotics in meat and dairy that it is killing our good bacteria. Don't think this can be done with yogurt. That only has one little probiotic and then you are cancelling it out because you are eating dairy which caused this. Get a good probiotic from the refrigerator section of your local health food store. Stop eating meat and dairy. Even organic meat and dairy are fed 85% soy. Soy mimics estrogen in the body. It will feed estrogen positive cancer. Cut out soy if she's eating that. I was a vegetarian and ate soy products for breakfast lunch and dinner from 20-30 and diagnosed with cancer at 40. I am convinced it was soy. Soy is in almost every product on our shelves and 85% of soy is GMO. It also mimics estogen in the body. Soy is in everything from ice cream to canned tuna fish, to cookies and crackers. I am sure one serving of soy is fine but when it is in every food, it is impossible to control.  Canned foods and plastic drink bottles have BPA in them and it mimics estrogen in the body. Cut those out. Parabens in shampoo, make up, lotions and soap mimic estrogen in the body. Buy those in paraben free. The supplements I take are copper, glutathione, D3, calcium, tumeric, magnesium, probiotic and sea kelp. No one has the answer but her. She has to make her own decision. It is a difficult one to make for each of us who have to make it. I feel better that I had chemo and radiation. I feel like I did all I can to make it not come back. One of my friends just did lumpectomy and radiation and had a recurrence 8 years later and she regretted not having chemo. She then opted to do bi lateral mastectomy and chemo. 3 weeks after chemo I ran a 5k race. I was slow but I never stopped. The post cancer dugs tamoxifen and arimidex are a little difficult but the alternative is worse. I do not like these drugs one bit but am trying to get past the 5 year mark with them. I have 2 years down. There are no guarantees in any choice. That's why the choice is so difficult. I have been trying to find a time schedule of how long it takes for these cells to die but was looking at it wrong. The cells are triggering wrong and you are trying to change the trigger (if that makes any sense). The diet takes time to get used to and doesn't happen over night. Research everything even if you hear about it on sites like these. I wish you all luck!",

      "Content": "Hi. I think using the word alternative \"cure\" isn't the right wording. Maybe alternative keeping cancer at bay? I am interested in which type of breast cancer your wife has? I have been studying our food in the US. I know they do not allow a lot of what we use in Europe. Is your wife's cancer estrogen positive? We have chemicals which mimic estrogen in the body in our plastics used to sell us food in. We also have gone crazy for the soy bean and it is added to everything we consume from cookies to canned tuna fish, to english muffins to ice cream. Soy also mimics estrogen and they tell us soy is safe \"in moderation\" but how can we moderate it if it is in everything we consume? All of our meat animals eat 85% soy beans. So do the cows that make dairy products. Then they also inject them with more estrogen to produce more milk. We go crazy over dairy products over here because protein has been pounded in to our brains as the most important thing our body needs. Advertising keeps giving us bling words like \"natural\", 100% juice\" and using names such as \"Healthy Choice\" which is a frozen dinner. Tell me how a manufactured frozen dinner is healthy? 100% juice does not mean organic and is full of pesticides. They slap the label natural and there are about ten ingredients you can't pronounce on it. It's all marketing. Just because it TASTES good doesn't mean it is good for you. Anyway, since your wife is almost done with treatment, you may want to have her get a 50 billion count probiotic because she pretty much just killed all of her good bacteria in her intestines. You need two things to help fight cancer. One is your liver, and the other is your intestines. So, if you take care of those, you will do much better. Going meat and dairy free and getting rid of processed foods is the best way to go.....",

If you eat meat, the meat is fed grains which are mostly soy. Chickens eat mostly soy. Even your organic free range hens eat soy and the eggs they lay are soy. Soy mimics estrogen. I also cannot believe how many processed foods also have soy in them. Read the labels. Soy lechithen etc.  I went meatless, dairy free and minimally processed foods a little over a month ago. I finally feel in my heart I am on the right path. Ya, I know. What about protein? That's what EVERYONE asks. There is plenty of protein in plants and nuts and beans. I just have to be creative.

No meat, dairy or peanuts! They didn't mention the peanuts in the documentary but they are covered in a very toxic mold or fungus and should be avoided when your body's defenses are down.

If you start the day with butter on toast, there is one serving of dairy. Then, you put creamer in your coffee (or milk in your tea) and that is 2 servings you've already had and breakfast isn't even over yet. Then, you put milk in cereal and that meakes 3 servings already. Then move on to lunch and have a sandwich with cheese in it. That makes 4 servings. Then at dinner, you have pizza. no one eats just one slice so there is about 2 to 3 more servings of dairy. When I tell people they need to cut out dairy, they say \"I don't drink milk anyway.\" But they eat cheese, yogurt, butter, coffee creamer etc. and then consider themselves to be dairy free. Thank you marketing..... The probiotics can be found in a refrigerated section at a health food store. They are capsules and they have different counts of how many live cultures are in them. When I mention probiotics, people usually reply that they get them in yogurt. Yogurt has acidophilis and that is it. Your body has billions of different ones. So, thank you again marketing firm for making people think they are being healthy by eating dairy....sigh. They do have up to a 90 billion count. The higher the count, the higher the price. Here a 30 day supply of 50 billion count is about 35 dollars. So check out your local health food store and see what they offer for intestine and liver support. You are so lucky to have access to a farm! I live on an island so I grow my food in planter boxes. I have deer and iguanas that compete for my food. If you can get hormone free food that wasn't raised on grain, you are ahead of the pack! Also wild caught (NO TO FARM RAISED FISH!) fish is good too. I am glad you are getting research for your wife. It shows how much you want to keep her around :-)",

We discovered that it was because I had scar tissue and did not get my range of motion before I did radiation, so the act of clasping my hands behind my head for the length of time of the radiation treatments were the cause of my pain. You can try clasping your fingers behind your head while laying on the floor at home and hold it for as long as you can as many times as you can throughout a day. How many more rounds of rads do you have left? I had 36. I also had to be put on a low dose of Lorazepam anti depressant to get me through the rest of the treatments. All of this treatment is mentally disturbing. Panic doesn't help. (I had one moment where I jumped off the radiation table and screamed at them telling them they were trying to kill me). This too shall pass. It always feels like \"forever\" when going through this crap. Yesterday was my one year anniversary of the end of my radiation treatments. It is a sigh of relief. Do I still have pain? A little. Nothing like when I was going through radiation! All of these treatments are counterintuitive. Your body and mind will want to fight them. My tumor was close to the chest wall as well and I had 3 positive nodes. Stick out the last of your treatments because they are the booster ones which will treat your chest wall. You can do this! I know you don't want to do this, but you can do this!",

I also chose what seems to be working and not just an article that never has names or faces on them that it has actually worked (and also will sell you a miracle product at a healthy cost). Cancer is no joke. Definitely do research and take your time with your decision. Maybe even look in to alternative treatments from doctors that have proof they work. I was always a healthy eater, excercised and did all of the things right and still got cancer. It's a tricky little bugger! I hate it. I hate the treatments.

If you haven't, go the a health food store and get the refrigerated ones with like a 50 billion count. They are around 35.00. Also, while you reseed your gut, it is best to cut out irritants while you do so. Irritants are processed foods (pasta, chips etc) and cut out all meat, eggs and peanuts except for fish (stay away from farmed fish or fish imported from Taiwan or china). Oh, and avoid dairy too. They usually require one month but sometimes that's hard to do. When you do this, your body will be dumping toxins out so you may get cold or flu like symptoms. No medical professional told me this. I had to look it up. I am one year out of chemo. Also, are you on tamoxifen? If so, go see your gynecologist. The pains may also be your uterus or ovaries. They can do an ultrsound and rule that out.",

This will help you if you are estrogen positive as well because most animals are fed 85% soybeans (which mimic estrogen in the body). So if you are eating meat and dairy, you are also taxing your liver. \"Food\" can do just as much damage as drinking when it comes to the liver. Look up all you can on line. Livers can regenterate. It's not easy. I have been meat and dairy free for about 6 months now. I only eat occasional locally caught fish, occasionally eggs and most of my diet is from raw veggies, nuts, fruits and veggie (soy and whey free) protein powder. I actually went through detox when I started! You can cut back gradually do you don't have withdrawel. Eat as many organic things as you can afford.  Remember all of the things that are dairy. Butter, sour cream, coffee creamer, milk, cheese, yogurt....They all cause inflammation in the body. Get your body to protect you not fight against what you are eating. The doctors won't tell you this because they are not dieticians. You need to do research and help yourself. I signed up at the library and learned a whole lot of new things!",

I faced it head on and told the cancer it is not allowed in my life! I had a bi lateral mastectomy with no reconstruction. I then had 4 rounds of chemo and then 36 rounds of radiation. It is not easy to choose and it's not easy to go through. But on that note, it is doable with lots of fight and a good mindset. 3 weeks after my chemo, I ran a 5k race. I never stopped! 3 weeks after my radiation, I ran another 5k race! Almost a year later I had to have a hysterectomy and my ovaries removed (thank you Tamoxifen....not). 10 weeks after that surgery I ran a 7 mile bridge run. Cancer treatment is the biggest mind game you will ever play. It is a choice to be strong and happy, or to be depressed and say \"why me\" all the time.  It's a choice. I chose to be strong. It doesn't mean I didn't hurt or wasn't sick because I was. It just means that I decide I am going to make jokes and laugh and not worry so much about the future that it stops me from living today. I woke up today. I got to have today. So many others didn't get to have today. I did. I am going to love it! I was stage 2. I spoke with a triple negative survivor just 2 days ago. I asked her how she was feeling. She had chemo and radiation ELEVEN years ago and looks fantastic! She was 49. Her advice was to see a breast cancer specialist. If you don't like what your doctor is saying or you are uncomfortable, go to another doctor or center. Go with your gut. You will see on here a lot of fear of chemo and people calling it poison. I on the other hand feel like it saved my life. Yes, my immune system was compromised during treatment. I knew this going in to it. I went in public as little as possible so I didn't get sick. I ate foods which wouldn't cause a bacterial infection such as deli meats, raw fruits and vegetables and under cooked meats. You need to take care of yourself while getting treatment. Your doctors must know any supplements you are taking. Ask as many questions as possible. Go with your gut but also be informed :-)",

Several people have asked for my own view on whether soy is safe or not. Here's my response as a scientist: There is a fundamental difference between the training of physicians and scientists. Physicians are trained to be decisive, even in the face of incomplete information. Scientists are trained to be skeptical, even in the face of (apparently) overwhelming data. To drive home this point, let me use as an example the effect of soy consumption on breast cancer. In the early 2000s, Dr. William Helferich, a nutrition scientist at the University of Illinois, published a series of papers on the effect of genistein, a phytoestrogen found in soy, on promoting the growth of human breast cancer cells in mice (whose ovaries where removed to get rid of endogenous estrogen). His research was sensationalized by the media, and to this day, has been used by anti-soy proponents as an example of the \"dangers of soy\" and by physicians to recommend to their patients NOT to consume soy. Dr. Helferich, being a scientist, knows that the relationship between soy and breast cancer is much more complex than what his initial research has suggested. He did more research and in 2010 published with other scientists a review article on this subject: Is soy consumption good or bad to the breast? (you can read the whole article in link). Portion of their abstract states, \"Results suggest that women consuming moderate amounts of soy throughout their life have lower breast cancer risk than women who do not consume soy .... Findings obtained in 2 recent human studies show that a moderate consumption of diet containing this isoflavone (genistein), does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence in Western women, and Asian breast cancer survivors exhibit better prognosis\". And in direct correlation with my work on lunasin, they further conclude, \"We propose that the reduction in (breast cancer) risk involves epigenetic changes that result in alterations in the expression of genes that regulate mammary epithelial cell fate, i.e. cell proliferation and differentiation\". http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long A little bit of soy may be ok, but these days soy is in EVERYTHING. Almost all live stock consumes about 85% soy beans. That means when you eat meat, you are eating soy. Even organic meat. Almost all soy (except organic) is genetically modified. When you eat eggs you are eating soy because the hens are fed soy. Did you know soy is in canned tuna fish? Chips? Cookies? Lotions? Makeup? Milk? Cheese? Yogurt? Butter? I was a vegetarian from the age of 20 to 30. I ate soy daily at almost every meal. I was never on birth control to add any hormones. I have 2 sisters. I am the only one in my family who got estrogen positive breast cancer and I had it at age 40. I am 100% convinced it was my own consumption of soy. I have gone meat and dairy free and only eat local wild caught sea food occasionally. You have to know what you are eating and putting in to your body. I know what you are all going to day. \"What about protein?\" Everyone says that to me. What about magnesium? Most people are magnesium deficient but no one is ever worried about it. They are worried about protein because it is what is advertised as important. A woman my age only need 43 grams of protein per day. It goes down as I get older.

Epigenetics!  Turn the bad genes off and turn the good genes on!   Most of the soy studies are basing their findings on comparing American women to Japanese women stating that Japanese women consume large amounts of soy and are 24% less likely to become diagnosed with estrogen receptive breast cancer before menopause. I do not believe this is a fair comparison due to the fact that American women have a completely different way of eating. Japanese women consume large amounts of raw fish as well so why are raw fish tablets not being sold as a cancer cure due to the 24% less cancer rule? They are not basing this study on the amount of soy Americans consume unwittingly. There is soy in almost everything we eat because everything packaged needs the least expensive \"filler\" they can find which happens to be soy beans. \"The benefits: Women who consumed fish oil supplements had a 32 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer after six years compared to non-users, according to a study from the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention. Fatty fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which may decrease inflammation in the body. Researchers believe chronic inflammation may encourage breast cancer development. Reap the rewards: Although women in the above study took supplements, researchers recommend getting omega-3s directly from fish. Chomp at least two 3.5-ounce servings of fatty fish like salmon, tuna and mackerel each week. \" Just avoid any canned fish as canned fish also has soy in it.........",

Several people have asked for my own view on whether soy is safe or not. Here's my response as a scientist: There is a fundamental difference between the training of physicians and scientists. Physicians are trained to be decisive, even in the face of incomplete information. Scientists are trained to be skeptical, even in the face of (apparently) overwhelming data. To drive home this point, let me use as an example the effect of soy consumption on breast cancer. In the early 2000s, Dr. William Helferich, a nutrition scientist at the University of Illinois, published a series of papers on the effect of genistein, a phytoestrogen found in soy, on promoting the growth of human breast cancer cells in mice (whose ovaries where removed to get rid of endogenous estrogen). His research was sensationalized by the media, and to this day, has been used by anti-soy proponents as an example of the \"dangers of soy\" and by physicians to recommend to their patients NOT to consume soy. Dr. Helferich, being a scientist, knows that the relationship between soy and breast cancer is much more complex than what his initial research has suggested. He did more research and in 2010 published with other scientists a review article on this subject: Is soy consumption good or bad to the breast? (you can read the whole article in link). Portion of their abstract states, \"Results suggest that women consuming moderate amounts of soy throughout their life have lower breast cancer risk than women who do not consume soy .... Findings obtained in 2 recent human studies show that a moderate consumption of diet containing this isoflavone (genistein), does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence in Western women, and Asian breast cancer survivors exhibit better prognosis\". And in direct correlation with my work on lunasin, they further conclude, \"We propose that the reduction in (breast cancer) risk involves epigenetic changes that result in alterations in the expression of genes that regulate mammary epithelial cell fate, i.e. cell proliferation and differentiation\". http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jn.nutrition.org/content/140/12/2326S.long This is the first thing that Lunasin says about it..... Lunasin is a soy peptide that exhibits health promoting characteristics. Scientific evidence indicates that Lunasin is a key component in soy protein responsible for its cholesterol-lowering properties. Lunasin is a unique, 43 chain amino acid peptide found within soybeans. Recent research and development surrounding this soy peptide focuses on promotion of healthy cholesterol levels. In addition to lunasin exhibiting cholesterol lowering properties, research shows it also has cancer preventive properties. How is there no soy in soy peptide?",

Also, stop using scare tactics in saying we will all die within 7 years! That is not true and it is NOT rare that we will live longer! I know about 20 women personally, all whom I talk to that are REAL people who are alive and have been for 20 plus years after diagnosis and treatment! Even stage 4! Do not tell me I personally know all of the rare cases and there are no others! You are insulting and you need to leave this page! Take your snake oil elsewhere! None of us have any money anymore to pay for your snake oil anyways!",

      "Content": "I am wondering also if there is someone out there who decided not to take it and what the long term effects are. I had stage 2 with 3 positive lymph nodes with an estrogen receptive cancer. I was 41 at diagnosis. I had bi lateral mastectomies, chemo and radiation. I was then placed on tamoxifen because I was pre menopausal. I did that for almost a year and in January had to have my ovaries and uterus removed. Since it put me in to menopause and I hated the side effects (destroying my ovaries, uterus and I wasn't able to focus my eyes and always having a pain in my groin area) I decided to try arimadex. I have taken it for one month and my neck and head hurt so bad that I've been in bed for a week! On chemo I would go get chemo and go back to work so I am not whimpy! This is aweful! Unfortunately, I don't have an oncologist right now because I live on an island and our only oncologist didn't get his contract renewed (causing me more worry). After reading the discussions, I am taking myself off from it for 3 weeks to make sure it is side effects and not something else. I am also going to go to a new oncologist on the mainland to talk to an oncologist and see if there is any thing else I can do. I feel like I am too young to feel so bad. I also have a toddler to care for. So, I've been reading lots and lots over the past few days. I have read interesting things about mold and fungus being in the body and that can trigger cancer cells. Back in 2005 I went through hurricane Wilma and had to live in a mold infested place for one month. 3 feet of salt water raged through my appartment and mold was everywhere. So, it is possible I have mold in me. One way to kill it is by diet. I started yesterday. No processed foods and no meat and dairy or peanuts. I figure this will have two benefits. One, if I do have mold, it will kill it. Two, getting any body fat I have lowered will lower estrogen levels. Also, they say when the mold or fungus is present, it affects the liver and the liver produces more estrogen (my cancer is estrogen receptive). I don't have any long term advice on it as this is only my second day off arimadex. I am on vicodin trying to get this pain out of my neck. I am able to sit up and do a few things today. But, going off a med is scary. You may want to check out the statistics of how much it really helps you. Find out how agressive your particular cancer cells are. Also, if you are on arimadex, talk to your oncologist about getting a prescription calcium and make sure you are getting enough magnesium and vitamin D every day. They say if you have worse symptoms, it means it is less likely to be a recurrence. You may want to try the sample and see how the side effects are for you. I knew in one month. I am not sure if I am going to stay off it or go back on. I am torn. It stinks either way. There is nothing easy about having cancer.",

I am not 100% if I remember this correctly (chemo brain) so make sure you ask a professional before you do anything. I think my friend had this and it was a reaction to the pre meds they gave her (steroids). Don't be afraid to ask. You are paying them.",
