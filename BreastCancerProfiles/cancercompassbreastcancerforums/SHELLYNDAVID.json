    "Content": "Well i wouldn't think he would do that type of surgery. I had to get a different surgeon to talk to about removing mine but i don't know if i'll ever get it removed now because i'm fighting another round of cancer and they still need the port for the chemo. I also had a filter installed because of an aneurism in my right lung. I was told it was temporary and had to be removed before a year went by well that time is getting close and now the surgeon is talking like it should stay in just in case. But i really wanted it removed but he won't remove it now because i'm battling another round of cancer and he says it would be safer to leave it now. It's titanium but i know what happens with them over years of growth around them. I studied all about them and they will grow closed over time and have to be removed if they don't cause you to have a stroke first. Â ",
