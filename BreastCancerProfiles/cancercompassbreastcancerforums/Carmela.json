      "Content": "My name is Millie, I have breast cancer, but with no surgury because it was from Harmone therphy. So the Dr. put me on the pill Fermara for 1 1/2 yrs. But I got bad hot sweats, bone 7 joint pain & very tired. So now I am starting to day on Aromasin 25mg. hoping this pill will do better. Also I was on Zometa injection once a month 3mg. for 1 1/2 yrs. Now the Dr. took me off Zometa and only trying Aromasin. So those pains are not from old age it is the medication giving all the disconfort. Because before having this cancer I was fine. I am 72. So tell me out there friends how is Aromasin working for you all? Thank you",
