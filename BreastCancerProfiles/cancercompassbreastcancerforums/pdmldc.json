My Doctor gave me a local and it numbed the area really well..I did have a little soreness afterwards but nothing that stopped me rom doing my every day needs. I was a little bruised and that took about a week to subside. As it turned out it was cancer and I am now recouperating from the surgery. I wish you all the best and know there is support out there if you need to vent.",
