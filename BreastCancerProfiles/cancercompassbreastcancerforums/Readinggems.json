I had a left mastectomy with lymph node removable all clear. I am 42 and on to 4th chemo out of 8 and then I will have 5 weeks of radiotheraphy. My sister-in-law who lives in Irvine California recently told me about a herb called Graviola which comes from the paw-paw plant she said that a friend of a friend took it and is now cancer free. I spoke to my doctor who had not heard about it, but she did make a comparison of the yew tree plant that they synthesized the breast cancer drug taxol from. If there is anybody out there with any information on graviolas benefits please let me know. Thanking you J. Here are some informational websites that give benefits of graviola. http://www.ecgnaturals.com/hsi_graviola_alert.htm http://www.geocities.com/graviolaforcancer/ http://homodiet.netfirms.com/otherssay/letters/prostate_brea It is my opinion that all ailments are a direct consequence of a break down in our immune system caused by poor diet, chemical toxins, and air toxins.  Take natural products that build the immune system and the body will cure itself.  Graviola is 1 of those natural products shown to kill 12 different types of cancer.   Reishi, Shiitake and Maitake mushrooms,  Ellagic acid (from Raspberries), Turmeric (yellow color in mustard), Beta glucan, colosstrum extracts (from  milk) are all natural products that build the immune system and help the body produce \"killer cells\" that track down and destroy non-normal cells like cancer. The following website offers a powerful formula that builds the immune system and has helped me. http://www.globalnutritions.com/ The following comments from my own experience can help improve the immune system: If you have ever had a problem with acid reflux and indigestion the cure for that is very simple.  It cost me $1.79 to do it.  Get some 100% potassium chloride (diet salt) at a health food store.  Mix 1 teaspoon with 1/2 teaspoon regular salt in a glass of water and drink once a day.  This formula balances the bodys \"buffering system\" with the \"acid system\". (We do not have enough sodium bicarbonate in our system to keep the buffer system working because we eat too many processed foods.) This puts the body tissues into a non-acid state and then the immune system becomes more active.  ",
