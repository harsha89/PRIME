    "Content": "My Mom was recently diganosed with Stage III IDC. SHe underwent a mastectomy and is now doing chemo before starting radiation. Her biggest complaint is extreme diarrhea and extreme leg weakness. So much so that there have been times she can't make it to the bathroom quick enough. And walking from one end of the house to the other is difficult because her legs get so wobbly. ANY suggestions from anyone who has experienced this would be so wonderful. It makes me so sad that she is going through this but then to have these side effects that are so debilitating makes me even more sad :( Please help us!",
