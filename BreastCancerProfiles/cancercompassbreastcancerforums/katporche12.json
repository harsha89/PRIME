Yes,yes, yes.  I hae the same problem.  I had radiation for my breast cancer over ten years ago, and I now have scarred lungs and very bad liver scarring.  I try to tell my physician, my lung doctor, my oncologist and my gastromologist that I know it has to be from the radiation treatments for my breast cancer, but none will admit it.  I am not a drinker or smoker, but they keep telling me I am lying.  It is extremely frustrating. If they cuould just admit it, it would make me feel better even though I know it will not fix my problems.  So glad to kow there is someone else out ther with concern.  I at least know I am not crazy.   :(",
