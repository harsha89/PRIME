    "Content": "Hi Anna, Your post is the latest one I saw on here so I don't know if you even come to the board any more.  I was diagnosed in August 2005 with breast cancer right breast, there were 8 lymph nodes involved.  I did 8 chemo treatments and 33 radiation treatments. They got all the cancer and 3 months later it spread to my bone to the left hip. At this time I went from a stage 3 to a stage 4. I only did two weeks of radiation for the hip and was cancer free for almost two years. Then it was down hill the chemo destroyed my heart surgery did not inprove it.  I now have a pace maker/defibulator. My heart only pumps blood at 12%. From there the cancer was in my left femer and ate a 10 inch section of bone. A rod was put in the leg. More radiation. Then it went to my liver nine months later. I have been on chemo for 2 years and will be on it for the rest of my life.  I had scans just over a week ago and haven't got a call from the doctor's office. I have been fighting long enough to 6 years in August) to know this is not good.  They have always called me when the results are good. When they are bad I have to wait to see the doctor.  I have pain in my right side but it feels more like a rib then it does the liver causing the problem.  So until Thursday it's a wait and see game.  Hope you are still in there fighting.  Kathy   ",
