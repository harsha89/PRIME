I just wanted to say Thank you for your letter that makes me feel as if I have NOT lost my mind and that the pain and swelling that I am experiencing is not in my head and is not just due to my age (65). I also have been a very active person and had some arthritis in my knees but could always exercise and walk forever.  Now however I feel so crippled (even tho I force myself to keep moving) and I too feel like an old woman. I took Tomaxafen for 2 years and had a small amount of pain but I have been on Aromasin for 6 months and I am ready to stop the medication. I will keep checking to see if we find out any new information. Thank you again ! Jeannie It's nice to hear from you !  Thank you for your response.  Lately I've been going against the \"rules\" and have been icing my hands.  The tendons, specially the one that starts at the wrist and goes up the thumb, has been so knotted up that the inside half of my hands feel like thick, non-pliable rubber, and I have to ice in the morning and take a pain pill just to get my hands moving.  I then ice 2 more times per day and this is the only thing that has given any type of relief.  I'm afraid to NOT take Aromasin, but I find I'm taking it on again, off again because I just can't live with the side effects.  I too, feel like a crippled up old lady and sometimes I let myself cry a few tears, just for some release of frustration. It's hard for others to understand that even doing normal routine things that we used to take for granted can cause so much pain, swelling and discouragement, but I try to live my life as close to normal as possible and can't wait until 3 more years have gone by and I can quit the Aromasin.  Hope you can find some reliable ways to ease this discomfort and enjoy moving your body again without pain.        ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the prayers !  I also have the tingling, burning in my hands, specially my fingers and my feet are kinna numb, but this has been Dx'd as peripheral neuropathy.  I'm on pain meds for that and it's tolerable now.  I've tried the glucosamine and have tried a product called Neuropathy RX and it was like a miracle, but alas, it made me very nauseated.  I really don't like to complain about all of this, but my oncologist is still in denial that these could all be side effects of chemo or Aromasin.  He wanted to blame it on my age, but I never felt like this before I had cancer treatments and I'm relieved to find out that I'm not the only one.  If it weren't for the internet, I wouldn't have known where to go to see if what I'm experiencing is common.  I can tolerate the pain and neuropathy, but it's the depression and fatigue.  I know it's not really how I feel and I just have to keep telling myself it's only temporary.  May the Lord bless you and keep you and may He make His face to shine upon you !!  We'll keep fighting the good fight, won't we ?  ",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply !   I try going back on Aromasin, but after 1 day back on it, the depression starts to set in again. I hate having that lump in my throat all the time, wondering why I'm so depressed.  When I'm off the Aromasin that depressed feeling vanishes !  I'm sure I don't want to go into Stage IV cancer, but it's so difficult to think of spending the next 3 years with that horrible dark cloud hanging over my head all of the time.  Being post-menopausal I'm not sure if Tamoxafin is the drug for me, but I'll call my oncologist and talk this over with him.     ",
