I always seemed to have trouble standing for longer periods of time--seemed to always want to sit down instead but always thought that was something else. Last summer (August) I had trouble walking for any amount of time over 20 minutes. After MRI and X-rays, they said it was bursitis. A shot into that area with cortisone helped although it still acts up. In February of this year I had major back trouble with sciatica. It was very, very bad and they say I have degenerative disc problems. There is no history of anyone in my family having back problems even my 83 year old mother. I still didn't think much about it but my Radiation Oncologist mentioned that maybe it was a side effect off the Arimidex. Now I am wondering if I should stop taking it. I am tired and lack energy but always thought that was just the result of work and commuting. Reading your response is making me wonder even more. I also wake up 4 to 5 times every night.   I have been on Arimidex for 3 1/2 years. At first, it was just the hot flashes, which I still have all day, and night.  The muscle and joint pain moves around my body.  I've had numerous x-rays done just in case it was something else.  This summer I spent 3 months in pain thinking it was just the side affects of arimidex, only to find it was sciatia.  My doctor has no comments about the cause.  There is arthritis in my family, but no back problems. I have had 2 spinal injections for the pain. I wake up 5-6 times a night. I can handle the hot flashes, and the joint pain, but the weight gain has really upset me. I have put on 30 pound in 3 years!  I have tried exercise up to 2 hours a day for 3 months, and I still didnt lose a pound. I can't wait to stop the drug, but I'm willing to take on more as long as the cancer is gone! ",
