I encountered numerous problems with stiffness of joints, agressive arthritis, and tons of muscular pain. Recently(thru a change of doctors) I was placed on Aromasin.  I am beginning to have more joint stiffness but am still trying this med.  There is a very noticable difference in my hair.  It is really thinning out.  Anyone with any suggestions?  Or has this impacted any one else???  I sure don't want to feel like LoneRanger. I also had thinning hair from the meds....so.......I was watching Home Shopping Network one day and there was a product called TOPIK.... its a fiber based powder that you sprinkle very lightly on the thinning areas....it comes in many colors....and the \"bald\" spots are gone!!!!  Try it!!!!!",
