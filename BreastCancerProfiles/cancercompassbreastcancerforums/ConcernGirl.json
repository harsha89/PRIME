    "Content": "I'm turning 16 this coming January and I'm concerned for my mother. A year or so ago she told me that she feels this lump on her breast. She said that it was always there for the last 4 years, and for the last few months the lump is getting bigger and bigger. Of course I'm worried, and I'm stressed cause I don't know what to do to help her. She's keeping this a secret, letting only me and my boyfriend know about this. She doesn't want to consult the doctor because her cousins wife passed away 2 years after receiving her treatment. I don't have the guts to ask her if the lump is cancerous or not. For now all I want to know is how can I help her, because for the last few months she's always getting sick (ex. fever, headache and stomach ache) I'm looking forward for some replies and answers, thank you.",
