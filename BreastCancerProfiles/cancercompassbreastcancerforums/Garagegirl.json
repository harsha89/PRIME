    "Content": "Hi: I have discovered an unusual lump in one of my breasts. I check myself regularly because of family history and the fact that I have dense breasts and my doctor has told me to be on top of this. I have had several \"scares\" over the years but it always turns out to be nothing. The lump I have is not round. It's more long - about one inch - and possibly 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide. I have never had anything like this before. Has anyone else had this type of lump. And, I know this sounds weird, but it is more noticeable at night than first thing in the morning. Thanks in advance for any info/advice. Â ",
