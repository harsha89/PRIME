    "Content": "Who knows all the tests for detecting reoccurring Breast Cancer and the sites it is likely to strike first ?? Anyone in here have pain at the site of surgery ?? I have had a partial radical masc. on rt. side with lymph node removal, too. Lately, I have had pain and burning pain, too all in the area where I had surgery in my chest wall....my Onc. said that it is NORMAL--well, I do not think so, who knows on this site ??? I live in a small town, where there is only 1 Onc for all cancers--and he doesn't speak English well either. I just finished all my chemos and adjuvant for HER-2 +++, now on tamoxifen for ER+, as my bone density was not good for the aromatose inhibitors.... tests I have heard of: CTC =circulating tumor test tumor markers=alot like the 125 CAT = more for bone stucture, right? let me know PET = for organs MRI = head Bone Scan Bone density test I think I need another bone scan and maybe the PET, since I am having PAIN and have met my out of pocket deductible. WHAT DOES ANY HERE THINK??? RSVP asap kat",
