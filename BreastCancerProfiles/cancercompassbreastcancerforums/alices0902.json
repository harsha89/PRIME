    "Content": "I was diagnosised with invasive ductual carcinoma stage 1 Breast Cancer in October 2015. It was a non agressive BC. The lumb they removed from my left breast was .6mm. It was very tiny.  No signs of cancer in the five lymph nodes they removed. After surgery I received 15 days of radiation. That was the mandatory recommendation from my HMO. No chemotheraphy treatment was needed. Then in February I started on tamoxifen. I am slightly overweight, but physically active. Meaning I go to the gym and work out 2-3 times a week.  In the last four weeks, I have been to my general MD because I have been having lower back pain. Sometimes it is the entire lower back, other times it is my lower left side of the back.  I know that 10% of the woman who take Tamoxifen experience lower back pain as a side effect. Is it too soon to be having this side effect? Is the lower back pain continuously does it occurr here and there? I do sit at my job for long periods of time on and off, but I do get up and walk around. I've never had any back problems or injuries.  I am wondering if this side effect is happening too soon. If I see my oncologists to see if I could switch medications what other options would there be for me. I am 54 and did not start menopause until after my surgery. Would like to know the thoughts of others.",
