      "Content": "Had double mascetomy with diep flad recontruction almost 2 years ago.  I had a pretty easy recovery but have always felt more abdominal tightness than I expected.  I have also been experiencing a constant feeling of pressure on my bladder and pelvic area which leads to a sense of urgency.  I have been told that I am having pelvic floor muscle issues which could certainly be brought about by different posture following the surgery.  Has anyone else had bladder or pelvic problems after diep or even tram flap surgery?",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to say that things have worsened considerably. I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis with Hunner Lesions. Basically, what started as pain urinating , bladder pressure and conitually increasing frequency is now a severely diseased bladder lining. Seems unlikely that it was caused by DIEP flap but perhaps some of the related pain was connected as my posture changed in response to surgery and discomfort.",
