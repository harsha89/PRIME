    "Content": "Hi Marsha, I just had the expanders exchanged for the implants last Friday(June 8th).  My Dr. said drains were not necessary.  I don't think you would want to go back to work the next day, but unless you are doing manual labor, you should be able to go back to work after a few days.  Also, it has not been painful because the muscles were already stretched out from the expander placement and the actual expanding.  You will have to wear a sports bra for a few weeks and not do any heavy lifting, but other than that it was a breeze.  Good Luck.
