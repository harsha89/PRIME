They gave my father a yr to live in Feb. of this year and my Mother 6 months just recently. Unfortunately, my Mom's cancer has spread to her lungs and there is not a whole lot they can do for her. As we all know with bone cancer there's not much hope either. What I can't seem to understand is why is my family having to go through this at the same time. It's not like one yr my father and a few years later my Mother....No it's all at once. On top of things, they have been divorced since I was thirteen and I'm spread very thin between the two trying to take care of them. I don't feel I can really give time to either of them like I should be able to. I'm very mad right now and upset with God. If my parents are going to go through this then why couldn't it be at different times so we can at least spend \"quality time\" together. ?? I just don't get it. Both my parents are very young. My father is 57 and my Mother is 54. This really makes me wonder what kind of health future that my Brother and I will have and our kids? Has anyone been through this with both parents at the same time? My father was diagnosed in 2005 with throat cancer. It was one of 12 cases in the world of his specific kind. The doctors didnt know how to treat it because it was so uncommon. He was given an 8% survival rate. For months I watched as the chemo slowly killed him inside. He transformed from the tan, muscular man that was my dad into a shrill, pale, hopeless figure. He was confined to his bed for over seven months. Everyday he would write me notes telling me that he loved me and that everything would turn out okay in the end, but I could never force myself to believe him. As the months went on his body seemed like it couldnt take much more. My brother and I said our final goodbyes to him. However, they were not needed. My father kept his faith with God the entire time he was battling the demon that we call cancer. And his prayers paid off. Now, in 2009, I am the daughter of the same man that was my dad before the cancer tore him up inside. He still says that his faith in God kept him alive. However, 2 weeks after my dad was given the \"all-clear\" by the doctors, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I couldnt imagine why God would put me through this. Two parents with cancer is a hard thing to live through. But it happens. My mom also is now a cancer survivor. I found this website as I was searching Google for maybe some people who are going through the same thing I did: two parents with cancer. When both of my parents had cancer, I had the exact same mindset as you. I couldnt quit asking \"Why God?? Why are you doing this to me?? Why now??\". But then I realized that the main people who needed my prayers were the ones who had always been there for me: my parents. I had been so selfish asking God about ME that I was too busy to look at the people who were actually going through the chemo. I didnt have cancer, they did. God has a plan for us. Everything that happened to you he did it because he knew that in the end you would benifit from it. God doesnt do anything to you that he knows that you cant get through. To close this up, I'm going to tell you one thing: I'm 14 years old. I went through the exact thing you did and I know how tough it can and will be. But keep your faith in God, please. He knows the pain you're going through and he is the only one that can make it better. You and your parents will be in my prayers. God bless.  .",
