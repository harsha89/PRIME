Yeah, unfortunately, people with darker skin absorb lower amounts of UV rays, and their Vit D levels are lower, sometimes much lower, on average I've been going by the current Vit D experts, such as Dr's Reinhold Vieth, John Cannell, and Cedric Garland, who recommend a minimum level of 40ng/ml.

You can also read about a study they're doing with it in Africa, on very sick people, (AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, cachexia).

But the 'walks for the cure' and ribbons are getting old, IMO. I also question the 'non-profit' status of most of these organizations. Do they truly have the best interest of women at heart, or is it all about early detection and mammograms. What about prevention?  One glaring example, with the largest of these organizations, SGK. They hardly mention Vit D and all the current research that's been done as it relates to BC, especially inflammatory BC. Experts estimate more than half of all cases of BC could be completely avoided, if women simply had adequate levels of Vit D, which is actually a hormone, year round. What say SGK ?  mums the word   KnowBreastCancer.net is one organization that seems to 'get it', and has the best interest of America's women at heart  ",

      "Content": "As taken from http://cancertutor.com/Cancer/Laetrile.html \"Laetrile (i.e. amygdalin or Vitamin B17) therapy is one of the most popular and best known alternative cancer treatments. It is very simple to use and is very effective if used in high enough doses and if the product is of high quality and if it is combined with an effective cancer diet and key supplements. Most people take laetrile in the form of apricot kernels. In the middle of a peach or apricot is a hard shell. If you break open the hard shell with a \"nut cracker,\" pliers or hammer, you will find a small seed/kernel in the middle that looks like an almond. However, it is much softer than an almond and certainly does not taste like an almond. It is this seed that is rich in natural laetrile.\" Apricots are the best source, but Amygdalin/laetrile is also found in the seeds of peaches, apples, red/black rasberries, strawberries. Basically, the seeds of any fruit, except citrus fruits, have laetrile. \"The FDA claims that laetrile is toxic. This is an absolute lie.\" (See Sloan Kettering study below) \"Most experts will recommend a daily dose of apricot kernels from between 24 kernels a day up to 40 kernels a day, spread throughout the day. For a person in remission, 16 apricot kernals a day should be used as a minimum.\"   Very interesting article about Laetrile/Amygdalin and studies done with it at Sloan Kettering The Ralph Moss Story (in his own words) excerpted from www.cancerdecisions.com \u201cIn 1974, I began working at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the world\u2019s leading cancer treatment hospital. I was an idealistic and eager young science writer, sincerely proud to be part of Sloan Kettering and Nixon\u2019s \u201cWar On Cancer.\u201d Ever since I was a kid, my main heroes were scientists (with the Brooklyn Dodgers running a close second!) The job at Sloan-Kettering seemed like a dream come true for me. I wanted to be part of the winning team that finally beat cancer. Within three years, I had risen to the position of Assistant Director of Public Affairs at the Hospital. At the time, I was 34 years old, married to my high-school sweetheart, and we had a daughter and son, then 9 and 7 years old. We had dreams of buying a house and saving for the kids\u2019 education, so you can imagine how thrilled we were when I was promoted, with a huge raise, glowing feedback from my bosses, and was told that perks of the job would eventually include reduced tuition for the kids at New York University. Needless to say, we all were really counting on my \u201cbright future\u201d at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. But something soon happened that changed the course of my life forever. A big part of my job as Assistant Director of Public Affairs was to write press releases for the media about cancer news and to write the inhospital newsletter. I also handled calls from the press and public about cancer issues. So I was just doing a normal day\u2019s work (or so I thought) when I began interviewing an esteemed scientist at the Hospital for a newsletter article I was working on. It turned out that the scientist, Dr. Kanematsu Sugiura, had repeatedly gotten positive results shrinking tumors in mice studies with a natural substance called amygdalin (You may have heard of it as \u201claetrile\u201d.) Excitedly (and naively!) I told my \u201cdiscovery\u201d of Sugiura\u2019s work to the Public Affairs Director and other superiors, and laid out my plans for an article about it. Then I got the shock of my life. They insisted that I stop working on this story immediately and never pick it up again. Why? They said that Dr. Sugiura\u2019s work was invalid and totally meaningless. But I had seen the results with my own eyes! And I knew Dr. Sugiura was a true scientist and an ethical person. Then my bosses gave me the order that I\u2019ll never forget: They told me to lie. Instead of the story I had been planning to write, they ordered me to write an article and press releases for all the major news stations emphatically stating that all amygdalin studies were negative and that the substance was worthless for cancer treatment. I protested and tried to reason with them, but it fell on deaf ears. I will never forget how I felt on the subway ride home that day. My head was spinning with a mixture of strong feelings- confusion, shock, disappointment, fear for my own livelihood and my family\u2019s future,  and behind it all, an intense need to know why this cover-up was happening. After long talks with my wife and parents (who were stunned, as you can imagine) I decided to put off writing any amygdalin press releases as long as I could while I discreetly looked into the whole thing some more on my own time. Everyone at the office seemed happy just to drop the whole thing, and we got busy with other less controversial projects. So in the next few months, I was able to do my own investigating to answer the big question I couldn\u2019t let go of: Who were these people I worked for and why would they want to suppress positive results in cancer research? My files grew thick as I uncovered more and more fascinating - and disturbing - facts. I had never given any thought to the politics of cancer before. Now I was putting together the pieces as I learned that: The people on Sloan-Kettering\u2019s Board of Directors were a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of investors in petrochemical and other polluting industries. In other words, the hospital was beingrun by people who made their wealth by investing in the worst cancer-causing things on the planet.  CEOs of top pharmaceutical companies that produced cancer drugs also dominated the Board. They had an obvious vested interest in promoting chemotherapy and undermining natural therapies. The Chairman and the President of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world\u2019s leading producer of chemotherapy, held high positions on MSKCC\u2019s Board.  Of the nine members of the Hospital\u2019s powerful Institutional Policy Committee, seven had ties to the pharmaceutical industry  The Hospital itself invested in the stock of these same drug companies.  Directors of the biggest tobacco companies in the U.S., Phillip Morris and RJR Nabisco held places of honor on the Board.  Six Board Directors also served on the Boards of The New York Times, CBS, Warner Communications, Readers Digest, and other media giants. Not surprisingly, profits from chemotherapy drugs were skyrocketing and the media glowingly promoted every new drug as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in cancer. I kept all my notes in my filing cabinet at work. I had no idea what I would ever do with them. I just knew that I  had to get to the bottom of it, for myself. Meanwhile, the public\u2019s interest in laetrile refused to go away. A lot of people were going across the border to Mexican clinics to get the stuff and my secretary\u2019s phone was ringing off the hook with people wanting to know what Sloan-Kettering thought of its value. I was once again told to give out the news that the studies had all been negative. At home, I called my family together for a meeting. with their support, I decided I couldn\u2019t lie on behalf of the Hospital. In November of 1977, I stood up at a press conference and blew the whistle on Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\u2019s suppression of positive results with amygdalin. It felt like jumping off the highest diving board, but I had no doubt I was doing the right thing. I was fired the next day for \u201cfailing to carry out his most basic responsibilities\u201d as the Hospital described it to the New York Times. In other words, failing to lie to the American people. When I tried to pick up my things in my office, I found my files had been padlocked and two armed Hospital guards escorted me from the premises. Luckily for all of us, I have a very smart wife who all along had been making copies of my research notes and had put a complete extra set of files in a safe place. Those notes turned into my first book, The Cancer Industry, which is still in print (in an updated version) and available in bookstores. That dramatic day, when I stood up in front of the packed press conference and told the truth, was the beginning of a journey I never could have predicted. I was launched on a mission that I\u2019m still on today \u2013 helping cancer patients find the truth about the best cancer treatments.",

      "Content": "  You might have read that it is more difficult for darker skinned people to synthesize Vitamin D from the sun. Resulting in significantly lower levels of Vitamin D throughout the year, compared to whites. They've found that African American women diagnosed with Breast C  have higher mortality rates and higher incidence of the more aggressive cancers, in large part, due to lower Vitamin D levels.  Taken from VitaminDcouncil.org - \"Studies show women with low levels of vitamin D have a 222% increased risk for developing breast cancer. Ecologic studies have shown an inverse correlation between breast cancer mortality and sun exposure and dietary vitamin D intake. Blood levels of vitamin D at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer accurately predict a woman's survival. The cancer is much more aggressive in those with low serum vitamin D levels: they are 94% more likely to have the cancer metastasize and 73% more likely to die within 10 years of diagnosis.\" PubMed articles- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029996 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18614733",

      "Content": "This forum is mostly about treatment. But thought this information about Prevention was too important not to post on here. A lot has been found about Vitamin D in the last few years. For one, it isn't a vitamin at all. It's a steroid hormone very important for immune and cell health, and the expression of genes. And that about 90% of Americans are very deficient in Vit D.  The findings about D and preventing cancer are remarkable. The Moore's Cancer center at the University California San Diego completed a 30 year study finding that Breast and Colon cancer could be almost completely prevented, if we just had proper blood levels of Vit D throughout the year. This costs pennies a day with supplementation The next step is getting the Cancer agencies to acknowledge these findings. But with huge sums of $ at stake in treating cancer, it could be a long time. Sad but true, in what is supposed to be the greatest country in the world Dr Garland from Moore's talking about their findings: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPCbsnOQIIE    ",
