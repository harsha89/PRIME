      "Content": "Thank you for your reply.  I guess I should have said that I was diagnosed with HER2Neu Overexpressive Breast CA.  I was feeling confident with my Herceptin tx, until the new labs.  I get another set of labs tomorrow, which has been a long three week wait, if it doubles again my onc will do some testing at that point.  I just wanted to know if anyone else had an experience with their markers. Lol, just like most people the waiting is horrible and it makes you crazy with thoughts... I'm sorry to hear that the Herceptin didn't have a good outcome for your husband.  Hopefully his new regimen will work for him.  I'll keep both of you in my prayers... Kat",

      "Content": "Hi I was wondering if anyone else had their CA27-29 tumor marker double while on herceptin.  I had my 6 rounds of taxotere and carboplatin. I am half way through my 1 year of Herceptin infusions and my last labs showed the increase in my tumor marker.  From the day I was diagnosed until this double increase my markers were only going up in very small increments.  Kat",
