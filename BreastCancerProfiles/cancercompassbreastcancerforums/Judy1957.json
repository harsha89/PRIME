      "Content": "Hi Jan,  Like you, I have no regrets for the surgery choice I made.  They did find that the tumor was quite a bit larger than they originally thought, it was not in the lymph nodes but had eaten through a blood vessel prior to surgery.  I feel really good, have not had any depression or regrets and went back to work today.  I still have two drain tubes in, it seems like I may never get rid of those, they are so inconvientent  to work around.  I go next week for my chemo workup and then will probably start it around the 15th of March.  It sounds like about 12 weeks of that but it isn't set in stone yet.  How did chemo affect you?  I have alot of reservations about it but know that it is the best choice, I just don't know enough about it to even ask intelligent questions.  The one nurse I talked to at the chemo center said she didn't think it would make me sick as much as it would just make me extremely tired. Hope she's right.  I appreciate any advice and input that you might have.  Judy",

Thanks for sharing your experiences.  ",
