    "Content": "HI. I am so sorry you are going through this. I am only a year younger than you. I was diagnosed 2 years ago at 33 and just turned 35 and celebrated my first year of remission last week. The first thing I did was educate myself as much as possible. I asked aÂ  million questions. You can fight this and beat this. You are stronger than you think. Please feel free to ask me any questions or if you want to vent about anything.",
