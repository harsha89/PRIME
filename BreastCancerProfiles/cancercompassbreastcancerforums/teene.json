      "Content": "Hi  I had a lumpectomy 2 weeks ago and was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer.  My doctor would like me to participate in a trial study which will involve oncotype dx testing to determine my treatment plan.  I will not be having radiation until this test is completed which will be done on Monday. The doctor said it takes at least 14 days to get the results and I am anxious and very nervous about receiving chemo. I hope I don't have to get it but she says that depends on how the results come out.  I guess I'm wondering why your doctor didn't test you first since it is to my understanding that chemo comes first before radiation.  I don't know what difference it would make. I'm just curious. The doctor said even though I'm early stage breast cancer, I still may need chemo.  This test will determine that.  The great thing about this test is that it will tell me how aggressive this cancer is and whether it is likely to return.  She did mention that by receiving chemo, it cuts the chances if cancer returning in half.  I'm still afraid of chemo and know how hard it is on the body.  Please keep me posted on how you are doing and if you will be receiving chemo. I need to know how you are doing physically and for that matter if anyone reading this that has had chemo could please email and let me know how they did on chemo and radiation. I have never been through this before and I'm very nervous about it all.  Teene",

I still have 2 treatments left to do following by 5 weeks for radiation every day.  I was stage 1 with a 1.5 cc tumor no lymph node involvement but still needed chemo.  I was really hoping to get out of it. It will reduce my chances of the cancer returning by 10%.  My score on the oncotype test for reaccurance was 20%...that's just too high and I didn't want to take the risk of not having chemo.  I  do not want this cancer to return so I am doing everything in my power to prevent that.  I hope everything is going well with you. Please keep in touch and let me know how you are doing. I'm sure by now you have learned about chemo, hair loss and everything else the doctor may have explained to you. Keep in touch.   Tina",
