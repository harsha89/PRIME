    "Content": "Has anyone else tried an allergy elimination diet for coping with the muscular effects of letrozole (aka femara)? I did not assocate my arthritis, stiffness, aches etc with the drug but thought it was my age and my immune system. So I tried the allergy elimination diet - lamb, rice, carrots, butter and pears.  (All organic except the lamb which is freerange)  Nothing else at all for about a week. No tea, no coffee, nothing.  My symptoms improved.  I then started adding items back, one a day. If my aches came back I  stopped that food. I now find if I leave out all gluten, lactose and sugar (including much fruit and all honey) and have few nightshade veg - and worst of all - very little ordinary tea,  I can cope. I'm grateful to the friend who sugggested this. ",
