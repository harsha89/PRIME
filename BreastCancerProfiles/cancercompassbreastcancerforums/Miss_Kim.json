    "Content": "Hi Dianna, I was diagnosed with colon cancer in Nov. 2005. Had surgery to remove the tumor 12-14-2005. Biospys show it had spread to 2 lympnodes. Chemo was a no brainer according to the surgeon, but not to me. After 3months of reasearch I started chemo 3 weeks ago. Not my decision but my family and friends couldn't beleive I was not wanting to do this. During my first visit with the oncologist he did a breast exam and found a small nodule. I am 62 years old and I have never had a mammogram. He insisted one was needed. I am not sure of this either. As you can see I have very little faith in our Medical Field. I see to many people running to the doctors all the time and ending up sicker than they were when they went. I have never had any health issues until now. This colon cancers was discovered because I went to the doctor thinking I was having a heart attack. She did a stool check and found blood in my stool. I was having no problems there at all not ever. Now I am faced with this mammogram and I'm not really sure what to do. I know I don't want to know if I have breast cancer right now. I just want to cancel the appt. Any thoughts. Thanks Kim",
