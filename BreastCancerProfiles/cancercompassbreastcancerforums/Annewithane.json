    "Content": "I have been suffering from this ever since radiotherapy finished.  went to see consultant about it who was pretty dismissive and told me probably won't go away.  was eventually referred to lymphoedema nurse in hospital - it only took them 8 months to see me!  ha ha!  Now have been fitted for new bra which is very supportive and receiving massage therapy once a week for next 6 weeks and been shown how to  do this myself.  Have also been told that swimming is very helpful for this condition.  have also been told though that may neve return completely to normal size.   would be interested to hear from anyone else who has this.   I was not warned this might happen after op. only about lympho in the arm!!  ",
