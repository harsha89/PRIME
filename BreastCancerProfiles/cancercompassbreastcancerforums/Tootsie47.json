    "Content": "This should be an interesting dialog. My husband with SCC Head and Neck got his permit and tried using mj with a vaporizer. Even this small amount of vapor was too hot for his radiated throat. He tried it twice and couldn't take the heat (literally). We didn't want to experiment with trying it through his feeding tube. We understand it has benefits with nausea and pain however it wasn't something that he felt like experimenting with during his treatment. I hope others find relief what ever way they can.",
