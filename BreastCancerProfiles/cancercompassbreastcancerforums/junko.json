    "Content": "Aloha Tre, I read with interest about rebounding. Do you think it would be beneficial for someone 4 years out of surgery? The tissue seems to get tougher and tougher as time goes on. Thanks for your input.

You can get a 36\" mini-trampoline for around $30 - 40 at discount stores like Target and Walmart, and online. Don't spend a lot of money on it - the inexpensive ones are just as good. Just make sure if you are a heavy woman that it is rated for your weight.  (Mine can handle up to 250# - is a good incentive for me to keep exercising, as I am just below that.) Lymph fluids and intercellular fluid travels by gravity - which means it all wants to go downward, and sometimes tissues don't get the drainage and lubrication they need, causing fluid retention or scarring/adhesions.  Bouncing on a rebounder induces weightlessness which will promote better circulation of fluids between cells and better circulatory removal of wastes. This can have a MAJOR impact on scar tissue.  Seems too silly to work, but it really does. And it's fun.  Gentle bouncing for 3 minutes at least twice a day is a good start - can increase as tolerated. http://www.healingdaily.com/exercise/rebounding-for-detoxifi cation-and-health.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.healingdaily.com/exercise/rebounding-for-detoxifi \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.healingdaily.com/exercise/rebounding-for-detoxifi http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Sincerely, Tre",
