    "Content": "Hello, Where is the angiosarcoma located at in the body that your inquiring more information about? My daughter was diagnosed with an angiosarcoma in her maxillary sinus in January of this year. She has had 5 rounds of aggresive chemo, 7 weeks of radiation, and 6 surgeries. Her oncoligists have told us that her type of tumor is vey aggresive, fast growing, and has a high local reoccurence rate. She is doing well at this point. I pray every day that her tumor doesn't reoccur! Lisa",
