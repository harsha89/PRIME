      "Content": "Hi there. I'm just wondering if you received an response on this. My mom was diagnosed last November with breast cancer and after a seemingly easy go around with the treatment and surgeries she was told by two of her surgeons that she was going to be fine. Now, 6 months later she's discovered a lump and after seeing one of her surgeons yesterday they are almost positive it's cancer. The lump is in the same breast and just above the scar from the original surgery. Anyone have any info or ideas on this or why it happens?",

My mom is going in next week on an out-patient basis to have the lump removed and sent off for a biopsy. Now, there is always still a chance...but for now we are very hopeful. Thanks to everyone for your kind words and support. Kathleen",
