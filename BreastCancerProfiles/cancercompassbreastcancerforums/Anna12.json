Barbara Barbara, My mastectomy was done in August 2004 and I had a drain in for 5 weeks.  I had it surgically removed when I had my medi-port placed in my shoulder.  I had a lot of drainage and my surgeon seemed to think it was normal even though everything was dry when she closed my incision.  I don't remember the amount of drainage; but it was sufficient to cause me to worry.  I have had no problems whatsoever since.  I believe you are normal.  Perhaps your drain should have been left in for a longer time.
