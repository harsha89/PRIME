THAT LED ME TO MY GENERAL PRACTIONER.  the pain in my back and feet were chalked up to standing on my feet all day at work,  The bone doctor blew me off even though my scans showed hot spots and uptake deposits.  My point is that you have a doctor that can stay on top of things with you.  I am stage 4 but doing very well.  Yesterday i climbed a ladder and renailed some flashing that was loose on my mothers home.  I live alone and 100% take care of myself.  I was rxd over a year ago. thannks for the advice. im also alone a d work and take ncare of myself. you are an inspiration. ",
