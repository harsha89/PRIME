      "Content": "Thanks for repling, I had a double mastectomy a year ago in Feburary, I was dianosed with Meta plastic carcinoma breast cancer which is rare, After my mastectomy I had a pep scan and was cancer free, they ( Syracuse NY) wanted to do Radiation and Chemo, I couldn\u2019t see why if I was cancer free so I went to the cancer center in NYC, didn\u2019t like it, they too said Chemo and Radiation, so off to Chicago to The Cancer Treatment centers of America, they did a VERY through exam and also doid blood markers as well as a mammoprint ( which I had never heard of) blood markers were perfect and the mammo print came back that it was 29% likely the cancer would come back some place else, but even with chemo and radiation they could only get it down to 15% so I would get the treatment for only a 19% per chance, for what the treatment does to your system I felt it wasn\u2019t worth it. I know my immune system is the MOST important thing right now to try to keep the cancer in check.",

Yes, I would agree with you, QUALITY of life is what is important..... but I believe it has to be a decision that comes from within....... The will to live is a VERY powerful thing so treatments seem to be the only way when you talk to the medical professionals , I personally don't believe that. I believe there are alterative ways.... Good luck.... and take good care!!",
