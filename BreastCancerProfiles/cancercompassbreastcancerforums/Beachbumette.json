You just need to stay positive, listen to all the directions of your Doctors and Nurses. Each individual has different side effects. I had Chemo on Thrusdays, Every Friday I ate out with a girlfriend. Sat/Sun I remained mostly in my room. I called them my \"Dark Days\". By Monday I was up and running the household with 4 children and a husband who traveled on my off weeks. Hydrate, take the anti nausuea meds!!! Always easier to keep sickness away, than be nausueous and work to get better. I also had my internst tell me \" One day you will need the prescription I am writing\". He was true to his word like always. He recommended taking a Xanax when leaving for the hospital for Chemo. It settle me down and allowed some much needed sleep at times. I found I was more nervous/anxious prior to any NEW treatments. I heartly wish you mush success in your treatments. We all at times have fear of the unkown...when in doubt, Look it up at a reputable site. God's Belssings, Nancy  3 Yr BC Her2+/ Stage 3B - 12+ nodes, Full Reconstruction One Year After surgery.",
