    "Content": "HI all. This is also my first post. My breast tissue was also tested through the Oncotype DX lab. It showed an intermediate chance, a 21 if I remember correctly which is at the low end of intermediatte, of recurrance WITH five years of and chemotherapy. The number that is indicated is with the assumption of the patient taking tamoxifen and chemotherapy. So, yes, the chemo will reduce the risk of recurrance. It may be helpful to talk with the oncotype folks or your oncologist about the test and how to interpret it. My doc actually thought twice about chemo after seeing the low number in the intermediate range, but because the tumor was 2.5 cm and there was another area in the same breast with microscopic cancer cells that did not show on any of the tests, we decided chemo was in order. I sooo thought that I had done everything to avoid chemo, too!!! I was also node negative. I had a full mastectomy (right breast) with reconstruction. You can see my profile for more details of my journey! I have to tell you that 9 days after starting the AC chemo, my hair started to fall out and I immediately had my hairdresser shave my head down to a buzz cut. This was much less traumatic than seeing hair all over the place for weeks. The AC chemo for breast cancer causes hair loss, unfortunately. I haven't heard of anyone yet who has not lost their hair. I was pretty vain and obsessive about my hair, but I made it through with many do-rags (hated the wigs). It was not so bad! Hair finally growing back, curly of course, but I have hair!!!!",
