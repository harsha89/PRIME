A smell she will never forget.  When my mother's friend got cancer, Mom said the smell was unbearable!  When I got breast cancer, I don't remember any change in my scent, although, after chemo, I didn't get any underarm odour for 2 and a half years!  Small blessings!  I am very curious to know what it smells like.  Can you describe?  The thought of recurrence is always in the back of my mind, this just might be a weapon against this horrible disease. My Mother is now staying with me because she has Stage 4 Colon Cancer with mets to the Liver. She has been on chemo for approx. 3 months, and she too has a strong odor. I can smell it when I get near her, and I smell it in her room and on her sheets when I was them. I was wondering what this smell is. Is it the cancer? or the Treatment? I don't want to say anything to her as to not hurt her feelings. Any suggestions on how to tolerate this? Thanks.",
