    "Content": "I am soon to have my breaast reconstructed and at the same time, as I have lost a lot of weight, I am having my \"love handles\" removed. I would love to chat to someone about this op or rather talk to someone about what happens and how one feels after the op. Can one sit? for how long? can one drive? etc lots of little things like that. We are going to Portugal for my recovery and plan to drive, which takes about 4 days, stopping overnight in differnt hostels and Hotels. Any help would be much appreciated. Â Thank you",
