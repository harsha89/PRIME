Yes, it is 2015 & I'm alive & well.  Just today, I had an appt w/my oncologist.  So far, the breast cancer has not returned, but still I'm plagued, on a daily basis, with the Arimidex side effects.  Initially, my GP told me this would last 6 months..., but here we are.  As I am a very active nearly 65 yr old (09/07/50),  I have not allowed the lingering effects to lay claim to the qulaity of my life.  We have a gym here in the house & I workout at least 3 eves/wk....1 1/2 hrs each...hand wts, bench press, elliptical, Bowflex and treadmill.  Most days, I'm OK until between 11a-1p, when I take my pain med, Nucynta.  It's a wonderful, non-constipating opioid. Then, I take the second one about about 5 or 6p.  However, there are other days when I awaken with this burning/throbbing/tingling annoyance, about a 3 or 4, on a pain scale with 10 being the worst. Those mornings, I take Nucynta when my feet hit the floor, about 7:20 & it's out the door to walk the dog.  The second pill is about noon & a third about 6p.  This really sounds nuts, but the heating pad on my bottom is helpful getting me thru the nites, when the days start like that.  A few times, I have awakened in the night with discomfort.  It is focused on the soles of my feet, in my hands & at my butt. Never had anything like this before Arimidex. Am resigned to the fact, I'll have this forever & the only way to keep disabilities from becoming a way of life is to exercise. As long as I'm moving, I feel good, but when I stop, I feel it.  Even the EverReady Bunny has to rest sometime!  I also do 4 hrs of yard work every Saturday & volunteer 4 hrs weekly in an ER.  To stop/decrease activity allows for stiffening to set in, which then begins to limit range of motion & the less active I am the more pain I have. So, that's me in 2015. So, how are you doing?   ",

      "Content": "Good Morning All.  Regarding the half life of Arimidex.  I took it for 87 days & quit due to bone pain and limitations to range of motion to some joints, esp my right hip.  So, here I am, 5 yrs later & still have daily burning sensation at both butt cheeks, worse when I sit.  Sporadically, I get pain in the fingers, my feet will feel like they've been runover and my tailbone will feel like someone is driving a spike up thru it.  Altho the intensity has decreased over the yrs, it is still there everyday, for which I take pain medication.  After having stopped Arimidex 12/23/11, I saw a Rheumatologist, in Feb 2012, who said it was not arthritis, but Arimidex.  I now have cancer in the other breast.  Not metastasis or recurrence, they tell me.  I'm taking Aromasin this time & no new bone pain at day #14.  Wish me luck & I wish you luck.  If your side effects don't stop, I'm living proof it can happen.  My Dr kept telling me it would go away......haha. My step-daughter's breast cancer was diagnosed 1 month before my first one, in 2011.  She had raidation, IV chemo, Herceptin & tamoxiphen for 5 yrs.  We're awaiting her biopsy results.  I am fearful it's likely cancer of the uterus- - -another fine side effect of these lovely drugs they give us.      ",

I am also sorry that you have breast cancer, again.  I sincerely hope that you can tolerate Aromasin better but so many of these drugs have such bad side effects that doctors don't tell us about.  I've come to believe that these oncologists are told by drug reps. (or whomever) to just \"stick with it...\" but they are not the ones taking these drugs or experiencing the side effects.  Perhaps they, the drug reps., manufacturers, and researchers should take these drugs for 5 years, then perhaps they would do something about the side effects and come up with better drugs.  In re-reading my post I sound bitter and I guess I am.  I'm not bitter because I have cancer but bitter over the drugs and the doctors who push them. The manufacturers and physicians just don't get it.  They think if they can give us a few more months or yrs, they've accomplished something.  But when that \"extra\" time brings the burden of uncomfortable side effects, it is hard to be grateful.  I have refused IV chemo for that very reason. It's OK to be bitter.  It is what it is.  Better to get it out, than let it eat you up. Here on the messageboard is a place where thsoe feelings are understood & accepted.  A very good place for it, rather than in your personal relationships. ",

Vit. C; 3 500mg. of B-17; 500 mg. of Iodoral; 8oz. of Ensure or Boost; Minerals such as Boron, Zinc, Strontium, Calcium, Manganese, Magnerium, Potassium, Vit. D3, Vit.

My only complaint is I am having cognitive dysfunction. My breast cancer is estrogen receptor related kind.   I started with a large mass on my right breast and now it has shrunk to almost half the size.  What helps me with the shrinkage is I apply daily DMSO on the tumor itself. Google search everything I take and see if you think you this will work for you.  BTW, I still take Arimidex. cognitive dysfunction is well known & also called chemo fog.",

So, that's me in 2015. So, how are you doing?   Thanks for responding! I am 79 years old and have been on Anastrozole (generic for Arimidex) for 4 years. For about the past year, I have been so sore that I could hardly turn over in bed. Mentioned this to my oncologist, but received no help there. It finally dawned on me that medication might be causing this soreness. I got online and found your post. I stopped taking Anastrozole about 6 weeks ago. Today I feel like my old self again....not having the depressive feeling either! I have not consulted my oncologist, as I have an appointment with him in early October. I had gotten to the point that I thought I could not walk, and developed sciatica. Since not taking the Anastrozole, the sciatica is under control. You can only take so much Ibuprofen!!! I'm hoping this good feeling continues! Glad you're feeling so much better & that it was as simple as stopping Arimidex!  Yes, taking that stuff is a scary experience.  From what I read from others posting on this site, some ended up in wheelchairs & others even lost teeth.  3 times since 2011 I have experienced toothaches.  Different sites & never limited to just one, usually 3 or 4.  The aching would stop as suddenly & unexplainedly as it started.  Nothing over the counter worked for me, neither did Tramadol.  My GP had referred me to a Rheumatologist, since all the aching soun ded like arthritis.  After numerous x-rays, the Rheu said this is not arthritis, it's your Arimidex. That really helped me make the decision to quit. Now that your are feeling better, you might consider routinely exercising, to gain back the muscle strength you've lost while your activity was so limited. Take care.      ",

Joint and muscle pain are common side effects of aromatase inhibitors (AI), occurring in the hands and wrists, feet and ankles, knees, back or other parts of the body.  Altho this pain isn't supposed to be permanent, my bone pain is ongoing for 4 yrs now.  In rare cases, AIs can cause carpal tunnel syndrome.  Anti-inflammatories, special exercises or acupuncture may ease the pain. The family of AI includes Arimidex (anastrozole), Aromasin (exemestane) & Femara (letrozole), which are newer drugs than the old standby, Tamoxifen, which has a different chemical structure than AIs.  It is important, when researching, to look for the adverse effects, not just side effects.  You'll then find that unlike Tamoxifen, AIs do not increase the risk of uterine cancer, blood clots, or stroke, but they can promote bone loss (osteoporosis) and are associated with an increased risk of bone fractures and cardiovascular events.  In rare cases, a serious jawbone disorder called osteonecrosis may occur. Nothing I've found relates to your upper abdominal pain. Have you had a PET scan? ",

As all the oral chemo for breast cancer are in the same family of drugs (similar chemical structure) , they all tend to have the same side effects, some, however, worse than others.  Tamoxifen is known to cause uterine cancer in some individuals.  Just what we need!! In general, this family of drugs causes bone pain & osteoporosis, which makes us more likely to fracture.   We're here for you! I have been on frames for 2 years and considering changing over to Arimidex. But after reading y'alls post, I think that would be going from the front pan to the fire. My bones ache is horrible. I teach and some days it takes all I have to make it through a day. It seems the longer I am on it the worst it becomes. I have cone to the conclusion that all of these estrogen sucking drugs cause the same pain. Good luck ladies, just bring strong and trying not to give in to the drug!  We should not have to spend our days in pain & toughing it out with bone pain.  Isn't anyone on any pain medication??",

      "Content": "I am also new to this site....looking for an answer:  how long do the Arimidex side effects last after stopping the drug?  Unlike your accts of experience with Arimidex, I've only been on it since 10/1/11, not quite 3 months & have given up (12/27/11).  Quality of life is far more important to me than quantity, after what I have been experiencing.  The hot flashes from Hell, sometimes occur nearly hourly during the afternoon & wake me at nite, despite loads of sleep meds.  I have Raynaud's & am used to being cold.  Sometimes, despite my FL location my digits will get numb from being cold. Meanwhile, sweat pours down my face & drips off my hair from the lovely heat flashes! I feel like a Sweat Hog & am embarrassed to go out in public.  Every move I make hurts.  I feel very stiff.  Even my butt hurts & then, there's also the migratory joint aches.  The Rheumatolgist said there was nothing he could do.  Arthritis medications won't help bec it's not arthritis, it's Arimidex.  All he offered was a Rx for pain medication.  All that did was contribute to the constipation caused by all the Calcium to protect my bones from Arimidex.  This is just plain absurd.  I quit.  I'd rather die in peace, than live suffering in pain & constipated.    ",

      "Content": "Hello Marjwat1942.  Reading your post sounds like you wrote about me. I have prior posts about my nearly 3 month long Arimidex experience & its after math & now, my second breast cancer.  See Page 5, 12/28/11, pg 24, 11/19/15 & pg 26, 9/8/16.  I seem to be getting along better with Aromasin now, than I did with Arimidex back in 2011.  Regarding bone loss, that is nothing new.  Read back to some of the pages, early on, on this site.  In 2011, I read how some women lost their teeth due to the bone loss in their jaws.  I was horrified.  Guess what? I discovered I have 4 loose front teeth about 6 months ago.  I still have daily pain...in my feet, hands & butt.  Bec of the Opioid epidemic in this country, the pendulum is now swinging far back in the opposite direction.  Physicians are very afraid & hesitant to prescribe pain meds.  I have been on an opioid since Feb 2012.  My onc recently decided I should see a Rheumatologist, I guess bec she didn't believe I had pain that warranted an opioid.  After a slew of lab tests & xrays, all the Rheu said was \"your xrays are very impressive\".  He then said, if I wanted to pursue treatment I should see a hand specialist, foot specialist & ortho spine physician.  Seems to me, had this been mere arthritis, he would have said so & continued to treat me himself.  After thinking about this for 2 months, I have just recently requested my records so I can read for myself what I'm dealing with.",

I followed WW for 5 months and lost 5 lbs.  I try to walk and exercise to alleviate joint pain, but I know less weight will be helpful also.  Thanks for any information.  Yes, we get what is known as chemo fog.  Look it up on the internet.  Of course, memory loss is also part of the normal aging process.  So, we get a double whammy. Regarding weight:  my success is attributed to decresed carbohydrates.  Check out the Glycemic index.  Lower your intake of high glycemic foods.  Increase protein.  Above all, get your body moving.  Walking is great for its aerobic benefit for your heart & lungs.  However, building muscle mass will increase your metabolic rate,(rate at which your body burns calories) aerobics won't.  Look up some strength training exercises on the internet & get started...5 days/wk. Diet alone will not make a difference.  Don't go out & by weights.  Many exercises can be done starting off seated in a chair or start off with 1# cans of fruits or vegs in your pantry.  I'm 5'5\" & weigh 125.  You can do it too, but you need to alter your diet & increase your movement.  I've also found the more I move, the less pain I have.  It takes a committment to lifestyle changes. Gimmick diets work for awhile, but when you return to your eating habits, that got you where you are, there you are again!   ",
