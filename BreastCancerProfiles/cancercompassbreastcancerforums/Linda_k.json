Was warned there would likely be same problems- but just as with arimidex, there was somewhat of a delay in onset of symptoms, so have not yet reported to oncologist. will next month. how are you doing????   On 9/15/2005 Cjgeorge wrote: Please advise if anyone but me is experiencing pain in hands, legs, feet from taking aromasin. I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!!  ",

      "Content": "I just discovered this message board while googling aromasin side effects. I also take glucosamine, Vit E, something called epican forte by Dr. Rath,  flax seed oil, multivitamin, B complex, pH balancer, ginger root and turmeric..  Also calcium. My bone density went way way down my first year on arimidex, since switched to aromasin, BD won't be checked again till Sept.  I joined a breast cancer survivor dragon boat race team out of long beach CA for exercise and moral support- this is the best of all.  Thanks for posting everyone.",
