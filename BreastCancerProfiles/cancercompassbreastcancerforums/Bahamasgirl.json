      "Content": "I certainly hope that your call back to have another mammogram turns out to be nothing. Not to scare you, but, two weeks ago, after 15+ years of clear mammograms, they called me back, saying \"not to worry, this happens to a lot of women.\" Except it had never happened to me. And the next day, when I went back, they were just \"too nice\" to me. Sure enough, they found a tumor, so I had an ultrasound that day and a biopsy the next day. The following day I got my diagnosis: high-grade ductal carcinoma. I have surgery this coming Friday. I'm optimistic and very grateful for those annual mammograms, whether or not they show anything. Good luck, and let us know what you find out.",

I'm not supposed to have anything to eat or drink after midnight. I don't know how I'll sleep tonight. And the doc already has warned me that inserting the dye for the biopsy, done an hour or so prior to surgery, will sting. Those who've been through this, advice please! Today's going to be a long day. How can I stay calm and get rest before tomorrow?",

      "Content": "Thank you both for your replies, different as night and day in terms of approaches, but both valuable and appreciated. I guess it reinforces that everyone has to make their own choices and do what feels best for them. Gayle, you hit on something that's one of my biggest concerns right now: telling my daughter, my only child. She's grown and has two little boys, but I'm her only parent, since her dad died when she was 16. She's very protective of me. She will collapse when she hears this. She will immediately assume that I'm going to die. Any advice there?",

I don't have all the details from my biopsy yet, but, thanks to your tip, I will ask to see it and to read it for myself. They're trying to find a breast surgeon for me now, since I'm new to the area and don't have friends here who've been through this. My GYN has hooked me up with the cancer center associated with the local medical school, and their office called me and the \"nurse navigator\" did say that some results from the biopsy report would take a few days. She's trying to get me an appointment with the surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist -- my \"team,\" I guess -- for next week. So I'll know more then about the biopsy results and what treatment options are.  More questions: How do I know if this is the right doctor for me? I want to get this THING taken out right away. When do you feel you need a second opinion? It's not like I'm searching for vacation spots, or seeking a contractor to build me a house. I want to deal with this NOW, before it spreads. How much difference does a week or two weeks make, in case I wanted to talk to another doctor? With these folks, you can't just get in the next day... In your opinion, what makes the biggest difference in long-term outcomes (other than the kind, type of cancer, etc.)-- the doctor? the treatment? Anyway, I'll let y'all know when I know more. I'm so grateful for any support and help online, since I feel pretty alone here and pretty scared. (Yeah, Halloween is two weeks away. Trick or treat? I think I'm getting my trick, big time.)",

      "Content": "A little more than a week ago, I wrote to this forum, saying that within that hour, I had been diagnosed with high-grade ductal carcinoma. I was afraid and very upset. Nine days later, I have a lot more information and, most important, a treatment plan. My tumor is 1.3 centimeters, has escaped the ductal wall but the MRI shows no involvement in the other breast and nothing else suspicious in the affected breast. The cancer is both estrogen- and progesterone- positive, but the HER2 test came back \"inconclusive,\" so they're going to do further tests on that. My surgeon thinks I'm a good candidate for the \"breast conservation surgery,\" or lumpectomy. I'm going to have that in five days, to be followed by radiation. I'm going to try the accelerated, partial-breast irradiation, where the radiation oncologist focuses the radiation on only the spot where the tumor was, through a catheter inserted into the breast during surgery. I'll have radiation twice a day for one week, instead of once a day for six weeks. I'm feeling much more confident. And I did wait to tell my daughter until I had more information, so she was less upset because I was less upset. Anyone who's been through exactly this process, I'd love to hear from you about what to expect in terms of pain, recovery, etc. Thanks for your encouragement and support!",
