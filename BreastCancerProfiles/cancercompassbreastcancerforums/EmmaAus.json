    "Content": "Hi, my grandmother (now 84) was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago and had a radical mastectomy on her left side.About 2 months ago she started complaining of pain whilst urinating and after a month of her doctor saying don't worry about it it's all in your head (i should mention at this point she also has dimentia) my mum finally took her to another doctor and after a few tests they discovered she had kidney cancer. She has been to oncologists and they recommended Chemo and Radio therapy. Now, they have discovered 2 lumps in her breasts and another cancer in her colon. I have had mixed messages from people some saying that she should still continue and start the treatments next week and other who say, it's too aggressive and with the age and dimentia as well we should just let nature take it's course. I am really after some words of wisdom from anyone who may have had to make this choice before and anyone who may know life expectancy rates in this situation. I would rather have a month or 2 of her here, with pain medication and her happy than however long it may be going through the pain of chemo (which i witnessed my mother go through when she had breast cancer 10 years ago). I am just so confused. Can anyone help?",
