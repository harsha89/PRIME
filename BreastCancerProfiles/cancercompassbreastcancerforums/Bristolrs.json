The first 3 months I had no side effects then started having bone pain, getting stiff after sitting too long, trouble getting out of the car, etc. Also fatigue. Just the past few nites, I wake up sweating with my hair soaking wet and my bedding and pajamas damp. I see my oncologist on Monday and will relay all this to him. I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this while taking arimidex. Thanks, Sandy  I am having the exact side effect you are, have been on letrazole (same family as arimidex). Bone pain in my feet was so bad I couldn't even have them touching my mattress, had to prop them up to hang free. Now my knees ache, ankles, heels. I have to change my PJ's some nights, sheets are soaked. I got about 60-70% relief, however, seeing a bona fide acupuncturist for the foot pain. I mention \"bona fide\" because he has his MD from Stanford, studied acupuncture in China. If you try this for relief, make sure you have the real deal, there are some quacks out there who call themselves acupuncturists. I see my oncologist for a 6-month check-up next week (3/13), will also get him caught up on these developments. My oncologist also told me to take 2,000 mg of vitamin D to help the bone pain, maybe it is contributing to the small improvement in addition to the acupuncture. I also gained weight after starting the drug, but this is probably also due to the terrible foot pain that kept me from wanting to even walk anywhere. Keep in mind though, this drug is keeping us safe from recurrence as the trials were fantastic. This is what I tell myself so I don't get too bummed about feeling fairly miserable at times. Hang in there:-) Helen",

I am had a total hysterectomy last summer, started on Arimidex, have developed terrible bone pain in my feet in particular, 24/7 pain, can't sleep, hurts to walk, etc. When it first started, I got acupuncture and I actually felt the pain go away during the first treatment! I was a miracle. I went back a few times, but was basically pain free (in my feet, that is) until I stopped going to acupuncture for a few months, then the pain returned with a vengeance. I've been back for one treatment, but plan to go until the pain is resolved. It seems miraculous that the acupuncture works so well-couldn't recommend it high enough. Caveat though: MAKE SURE you go to a legitimate trained acupuncturist, preferable an MD who is trained, not a quack, as there are many out there. A quack won't help you at all, an excellent acupuncturist who has studied in China or in a rigorous Chinese training is your best bet. Good luck!

I am almost 51 and I am very concerned about these bad side effects vs the real risk of really increasing my risk of long term survial. From what I am ready it is most likely going to make me, feel like 70 with the joint pain and bring back all the menoplause stuff, that has been long gone. Any body feeling like me?  ",
