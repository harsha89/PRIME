    "Content": "Hi. My husband has had blood clots recently due to a blood disorder called Lupus Anti-Coagulant. He had two very extensive clots from his knee to his naval. Warfarin and Heperin did not work with him. The clots kept reforming within days of removing them. He is now on shots twice a day that have so far been working. The shots are called Lovenox. They have to be given in the stomach. My husband also had a filter placed for safety. I hope things improve for mine and yours.",
