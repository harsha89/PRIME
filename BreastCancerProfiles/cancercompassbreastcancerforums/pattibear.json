      "Content": "I totally understand your dilemma! Two years after my treatments I have tried everything to get my hair back to normal, to no avail! It is depressing and I really miss my hair! So after accepting that this was it, I bought extensions, top hair pieces and whatever I could to have my old look back? It works pretty good. There are great wigs out there also? And I use those also. It's not a solution but it can help you feel better? Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi, it has been frustrating for me to wait for my hair to look \"normal \" again and I realize now that after 3 years it is going to stay thin, wispy and fuzzy. I tried everything and I mean everything. So this is where I am now with it. I bought tape in extensions which are much cheaper then the sew in kind and they last longer. My hair now looks like it used to and even though my hair is very thin on top my hairdresser has worked it so I feel back to normal , as much as possible. I hope this helps with the women who are having hair problems. Btw you can wash, blow dry and straighten with an iron if you want. I actually forget it's not my hair. Good luck!",
