    "Content": "So sorry to hear about the lost of your sons and then You are dealing with cancer.Sometimes it seems like life throws a bunch of lemons at us. Sept30,06 I lost my brother to Lung Cancer.He was just 56. I thought that was young. Well This Friday I found out My baby sister who is 47 has inflammatory breast cancer and she is stage 4. Which I can't believe this is happening. Your husband is reacting to your needs just like most men to they want to bury their heads and not deal with the problem. Sorry I didn't fine this earlier. I imagine you have decided one way or the other right now on the new drug, I say go for it. Most people that have been cured where in a study. I truely wish you the best.",
