      "Content": "I know what you are going through. My Dad is 88 and 3 tumors were found on his lungs. I had breast cancer a year ago, so I called my oncologist to ask her what she thought we should do about my Dad. She said, \"At 88 you should stay away from doctors!\" Well the family had a discussion about what my Dad should do. He decided that he would go and get the biopsy to see if it was cancer or not and if so what kind and what his treatment options would be. They were supposed to just biopsy one tumor. That went so well that they decided to biopsy a tumor in the other lung. That did not go as well and he developed a pneumothorax. He had to stay in the hospital overnight on a chest tube and on oxygen. They sent him home the next afternoon. Before he went into the hosptial he was mowing his grass, going to get the mail, and felt pretty good. When he got home he was short of breath and was taking naps 3 times a day and felt bad. This was 3 weeks ago. Since then he has been to see lots more doctors. He got put on oxygen at home and some new meds for his lungs. He is gradually recovering from the biopsy ordeal. He has decided to not get chemo since he thinks that would make him too sick. He also does not want surgery because he thinks that would kill him. He is going to try radiation and see if he can tolerate it.  One of the oncologist that he went to see told him that his cancer is very slow growing. She also said that cancer usually grows more slowly in elderly people. If I were 96 years old. I would probably not have surgery. I would stay home and enjoy the time I have left. Just getting the biopsy was very hard on an 88 year old. Everyone has to do what feels right to them. Is your grandmother with it enough mentally to make her own decision? If so, talk to her and discuss the pros and cons. Good Luck! Deborah",

I am a nurse and I work at a hospital in the nursery. Because of security issues with newborns there are a lot of heavy doors that I have to go throught getting in and out of the nursery many times a day. Opening these doors causes pain. It is like going to the gym and working out on a machine. I can be doing fine and then after working a 12 hour shift I can barely move. Then I rest on my days off and I am better. I go and pull weeds in the garden and I am sore again.   My husband may have torn his rotator cuff so I am trying to take care of him. I drove him to a doctor appointment and then did some errands in town and now I am hurting.  My cancer was on the right side and I am right handed and that side hurts the most. Thanks for your caring words and I wish you the best. I still have hope that one day I will be back to normal. ",

Deborah Hi, I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders put in during the same operation and ended up in the most excruciating pain I could ever imagine. The surgeons told me for 6 months that they had never heard of pain like that after the operation, and they prescribed all kinds of narcotic pain meds. I had the expanders removed, on both sides, and the pain continued. Finally, I went to a pain management center and found out that my pain was from nerve damage (which the surgeons certainly did not want to tell me about!). After a few years on Neurontin, my pain doctor switched me to Lyrica, I also take Effexor because it helps with pain. They had me on a Fentanyl patch, too, but I started acupuncture last year and it helped so much that I gradually stopped the patch. Since then, the pain doctors told me that they've learned that Fentanyl does not help nerve damage. I am wondering if the pain you still have is from nerve damage. If it is, you should waste no more time getting treated. The longer you wait, the harder it is to stop. Ask your doctor if Lyrica could help. I have no side effects from it, and it enabled me to get my life back.   Dear Ebreporter, Thanks for your reply. Do you have to take Lyrica all the time or just for a while? I have not felt like my doctor is very knowledgeable about issues conserning pain and rehabilitation. He is good at reconstruction and everyone tells me how good I look. I want to feel good too and be able to do the things I used to do.  I decided to get saline implants because I didn't want to have to get MRIs to find out if the implants were leaking or not. He says that silicone implants are more comfortable and he really wanted me to get silicone. I don't know if it would have made any difference or not. Thanks for your response. I will ask the doctor about the Lyrica. Deborah",
