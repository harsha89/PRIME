    "Content": "I found out today I have a spindle cell tumor in one of my breasts. I was told that the pathology report of the core biopsy showed it was benign (after much delay from the pathologist), but I will have to have it removed ASAP. After getting the diagnosis and attempting to do research, I am left with very little relief. Basically I feel like it is so rare and there is so little info that I do not feel confident about the diagnosis. Will they biopsy the tumor again once it's removed? Is it possible it can come back malignant after the initial test said benign?",
