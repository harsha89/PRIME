    "Content": "Took femara for a year but was on antidepressant Cymbalta which also reduces pain. When I went off the Cymbalta because I couldn't get to sleep when I was taking it, the pain jumped on me. I was on a road trip and I had to buy a cane so that I could get around. I have been changed to Aromasin and I still have joint pain - hands, knees and ankles. I have alos noticed that my blood pressure is acting up. Very high in the mornings. Has anyone had this happen? Aroasin is a steroid and if I understood the research, steroids can elevate blood pressure. Thanks for reading.",
