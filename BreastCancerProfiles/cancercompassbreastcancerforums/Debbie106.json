      "Content": "I would like to hear from any of you that opted to get bilateral masectomy, and start the reconstructionprocess, but did not have reconstruction finished until a year after radiation.  Did you find that you radiated skin got much softer by the time you were done with the year before having your implants put in? I had 7 weeks of radiation and it really effected my skin badly. I got so badly burned I had to discontinue it for 2 weeks before finishing my last 3 sessions. It's been 5 months since I last had radiation and my skin is really still very touch. I just would like to know how others handled this type of reconstruction that had radiation also.   ",

In a few more months I will need that port removed. Can my plastic surgeon that I'm having my reconstruction done with also do that?  Anyone here had it done by their plastic surgeon?",

      "Content": "My cancer did not show up in the mammogram. They actually did have me get an altrasound on right breast because their was some question about it, but after that it was found out they were just cysts. My breast had always been dense so self checks didn't really seem to work cause I had lumps and bumps all in my breast when I felt them. 8 months after my mammagram, I happen to be in the shower washing and noticed a big hard lump on my left breast. It seem to be the size of a golf ball. Anyways went to have everything check out after that. It was a 6 cm cancer tumor in the left breast. That was not the breast they did they altrasound on back when I had mammogram. Found out it was stage 3B cancer. Went ahead and had both breast removed. I have finished treatments and doing well now. ",

      "Content": "I'm trying ti decide which dr. I want to do my follow up care. My surgeon has been doing it for the most part, she is very nice but when she explans thinks she gets way to long winded and tells stories of all her other patients.  I find it hard to remember all she says, and sometimes almost forget what question I've asked her.  I want to have my oncologist do it for she explains things in English, simple and quick. Yet she doesn't seem to feel a need to have me checked in any way until after 6 months.  I guess my question is doesn't it make sense to have some tests like ct scan and bone density to see if the treatments have worked?  How do they know for sure that the cancer is gone?  Anyone that has gone through some follow up care I would love to hear your experiences.  Thanks!  Debbie    ",

      "Content": "I was wondering who normally does the follow up after treatment for breast cancer.  My surgeon has been having me come to her, even though I tell her I have my oncologist that can to care of it.  I would think the oncologist would know more about it than the surgeon.  My surgeon is very nice, but way too long winded, I get confused and forget what my question was sometimes because she goes on so long. I have already told her in a Christmas card that I appreciated her services but now have two other drs. I see for follow up so I will not be coming back to her. Her nurse called today to tell me that I really need to stay with her and wanted to make me an appt.  I hate being rude, but what do I do.  I would have never thought that the surgeon would deal with anything other than the surgery process anyways. Anyone else out there go to their surgeon for follow up care?  ",

      "Content": "For those of you who started reconstruction by having expanders placed in chest immediately after mastectomy done, then had to have radiation on your chest area, and had to wait a year to put the implants in, I was wondering if you were happy with the end results. I'm suppose to be able to get mine finished at the end of this year. My radiated left side, the skin is very tight though. Anyways, wondering if anyone else had that, and have finished with their reconstruction and are pretty happy with it.  ",
