Although they got the cancer, they felt I needed chemo and radiation as a preventive measure to keep the cancer from coming back or showing up somewhere else. I was given 5 treatments of 5 FU the first week of October. By the 5th treatment, my mouth had blisters. The oncologist looked at my mouth and said, \"Mucocitis...antibiotics won't help..rinse mouth with baking soda and water\". A few days later my mouth had gotten progressively worse. I was unable to eat or drink. I went back to my doctor who gave me a shot of Neulasta and told me it would take about 10 days before I would begin to get better. The next day I was admitted to the hospital due to dehydration. Over the next 14 days, I was treated for leukopenia, thrombocytopemia, stomasitis, and mucocitis. I was diagnosed with having a toxic reaction to chemo. I am back on my feet, but now my doctor feels that I still need a month of radiation treatments. What I'm wondering is whether it is \"safe\" to have radiation treatments after what happened with the chemo treatments. My husband has the same diagnosis and is being treated with 5FU and Leukovoran. After his first cycle he had the same side effects you mentioned and was hospitalized for 5 days. He had a second cylcle but the dose was decreased and had not as severe side effects. He is about to begin a 5 week radiation and chemo regimen. I am interested on knowing if you proceeded with the radiation and how it went. Did you have more side effects? Were you tested for DPD enzyme deficiency? How are you now? Thank You  ",
