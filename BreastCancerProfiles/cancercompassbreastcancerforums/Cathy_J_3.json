      "Content": "Thanks for the info.  I guess each doctor and ins. plan is different so I'll just have to hope for the best and if they won't take payments when I have some money, I'll just have to start from scratch and search for different doctors. Good idea re the credit counseling . . . some of my creditors said they'd set up a \"payment plan\" for me, but if I have no money to make payments, that does me no good.  My husband just makes enough to pay what we need, nothing more. Thanks again for the info.  Cathy",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed three weeks ago with invasive breast cancer of the milk ducts.  I had surgery Friday and the path report came back clear.  Because both my estrogen and progesterin receptors were negative, I was told I need chemo, followed by 6 weeks of radiation. Luckily, I got on my husband's insurance after losing my job in November.  I've been paying $20 co-pays to doctors and a co-pay to have two surgeries. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield through the Dept. of Labor.  Can someone tell me whether or not (most) doctors will charge a co-pay for each time you go for radiation?  If so, do they work with you?  Six weeks of radiation at $20 a pop is $600.00, which might as well be $6,000. Also, does the same go for cancer treatments?  $20 each time you go in?  I won't know till I see the oncologist on Monday what my chemo regimen/schedule is. I realize I am very fortunate that not only did they catch the cancer early, but that I have insurance, but I have creditors calling me 25 times a day, 7 days a week (for 4-1/2 months), ready to sue me because I have not been able to pay my bills since I lost my job, and am very stressed out about the finances.  Thanks for any help any of you can give me.  Cathy",
