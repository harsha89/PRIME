      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. It is so scarey when first told as I remember well. Reading all about my cancer in a book called \"What your doctor won't tell you about breast cancer\" made feel real better.  I was diagnosed with Stage 11 invasive ductal cancer in my right breast in 2009. It was a 3.50 mil. tumor and cancer grade high. No mets. in nodes.  I had the right breast removed and had four rounds of chemotheraphy and am considered cancer free today. I am 59 now and doing well.  Another great site to go to for great information on any cancer diagnosis is cancer.org cancer.org /cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-staging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cancer.org /cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/brea Hope this is helpful.",
