      "Content": "Dear Caroline: I also had the estrogen receptor positive kind of cancer. I was told to take omega 3 supplements and I found it in Flax seed but did not know it could trigger estrogen production. Unfortunatelly I've taken it for about 3 or 4 months now. What do doctors recommend for omega 3? Would it be fish oil capsules? Do you know? I finished my chemo last July and have been on Arimidex since August 2005. My last blood check for cancer cells came out ok last week. I also have stiffness and a little bit of dizzines. Thanks for answering.",

      "Content": "Dear Caroline: My family doctor, who is a lady who had colon cancer a few years back, told me to take Ester-C vitamin and omega-3. She recommended fish oil capsules, but I had a large jar of flex seed and it says it has large amounts of omega-3 as well as supposedly prevents cancer among other diseases, and it really helped me for regularity, so I thought it was great. She also told me about soy products and she believes sweets feed cancer cells, including fruits. I asked my Oncologist about the last one, and he said he did not believe it to be true, and that I needed fuits. I have been thinking about getting some sound nutrition help because I need all the help I can get. I pray I'll never get this back! Stiffness, I only feel it in my hips and knees. I've been taking Arimidex since last August. My dizziness is not bad at all. If I eat more frequently small meals, I feel a lot better, so maybe is just that I take long breaks between meals. Thank you so much for your answer. Litzia",
