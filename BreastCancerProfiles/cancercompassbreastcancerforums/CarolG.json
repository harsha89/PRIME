I had microcalcifications in a cluster four years ago, subsequent stereotactic biopsy determined they were indicative of DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, a pre-cancerous condition that is treated like cancer and sometimes referred to as Stage 0 breast cancer.)  I had a simple mastectomy, which was not particularly difficult, and subsequent reconstruction and am pleased with the results.  Three years later I was diagnosed w/ fallopian tube cancer that unfortunately was Stage IIIC, I had two rounds of chemo and am now either in remission or cancer free.  I was genetically tested, found to be carrying the BRCA2 mutation, and will have the other breast off this summer.  In my opinion the calcifications are a blessing--they can indicate very early breast cancer at a time where there is no \"lump\" to feel and enable you to go after it.  Since you are an ovarian cancer survivor, have you considered getting genetic testing?  Hang in there, I will be praying for you.  CarolI",
