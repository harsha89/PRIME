    "Content": "Hi, have you found anyone yet to make the pillows?  The reason I ask is that my  mom (a breast cancer survivor, and age 81 now) and a group of ladies at her church in Anderson, SC, have made a lot of them through the years to pass on through Reach to Recovery to breast cancer surgery patients in Anderson.  She has a huge stockpile of these pillows (some 200) and would love to place them with women who need them or someone who can pass them on to breast surgery patients.   She is moving and can no longer store them at home; besides, they could be doing others some good.  If you or anyone else who reads this is interested in receiving them, please let me know!  Thanks, and bless you for caring.
