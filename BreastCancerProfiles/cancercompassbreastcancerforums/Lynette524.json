      "Content": "Hi, I am sorry you are having problems.  I am on this board to look for answers to my husband's colon cancer.  He has chosen not to do chemotherapy unless it is insulin potentiated. Please try to find a dr who is familiar with bisphosphonate class drugs, and take supplements for healthy bones:  calcium, boron, silica, magnesium, and vitamin D.  This is all available in www.lef.org/protocols . The Dr. we speak with has several women on IV vitamin C who are doing well.  You may want to look into this natural treatment. Hope this helps.  I wish you the best and you will be in my prays tonight.  ",

      "Content": "Dear Amyjo, My husband is taking cesium, but we opted for alternatives first before chemo, and if he takes chemo, it will be insulin potentiated.  Cesium may work, but it is not the only Stage IV alternative method.  I would not throw all of my eggs into one basket.  I would call for a consult with one of the alternative hospitals, such as Oasis of Hope which tends to be less expensive, or the Gerson clinic, see what they have to offer.  My husband had one met to his liver, now the last scan, the doctors aren't sure if it is cancer.  They are recommending another scan in a few weeks.  We are keeping our fingers crossed.  I would also look into IV vit C.  I was talking to the naturopath about my husband and she has one patient with bone mets maintaining well with this.  I would also look into laetrile injections, coffee enemas,  modified fruit pectin, hydrazine sulfate, LDN, high does of melatonin and enzyme therapy.  Look up World without cancer.  They have a protocol.  There is also a need for a good immune modulator. We believe it is just not the cesium that is working, but the protocol as a whole which includes a strict diet.  Cancer has an underlying cause which is nutrition issues and toxin build-up.  The tumors are a result of these and are a symptom.  I wish you and your mom the best of luck, and she will be in my prayers.  Lynette",
