      "Content": "Hello, I was diagnosed @ 31Yrs old Invasive Lobular Breasr Cancer ER/PR+ HER2- I am 44 now and haven't given up. I would take the prior advise and get another oppinion.  I would not accept that getting it young means anything positive because it has been my experience it is not a positive thing. Usually tougher to beat. Get the best medical firm from the begining you can get! I have had 3 relapses and now been metistatic stage 4 since 2003. I was told 1-2 years with treatments for a life expectancy. Well that was 3 years ago I should have passed. Well, I'm still here and it has not been easy. I have been on every drug or chemo FDA approved for breast cancer and now running out of options and wondering what to do when that time comes. I had originally in 1995 a 1 cm tumor then it went to the other breast in 98 as multifocal spots not seen in any scans. I had the 2nd breast removed to prevent a bilateral accurance. It was too late. I also had 2 nodes involved, microscopically. Had treatments again. Then in 2003 it went stage 4 and spread to outside of uterus. We have been beating it down with treatments ever since.  It keeps advancing a little further slowly. I now have it in the liver and then just recently a lung also. I could write a book here to fill in all the steps and stages I've been through. so I have not put in all the details.  The best thing I can say at this point to help the emotional part for me was knowllege.  I just dug into anything I could learn. For some reason it helps.  Also \"time heals all wounds\" is not a myth. Give your self some time to adjust. And DO NOT THROW IN THE TOWEL! I just picked up the pieces and kept going. Live as you would have before. You now just have a part time job to do also to stay on top of this! My husband passed a couple of years ago to head and neck cancer. I feel I've seen it all ARGH.... If you want to talk I would be glad to help you out if I can. Just respond to this message and I will get an email. God Bless You! Annie",

      "Content": "Hello, I myself have not taken Xeloda. I have a friend who is taking it and has been for about a year and has breast cancer mets to the bone and lung. Other chemos beat her up to much before this and she is doing very well on it. As far as I know she had some issues getting the dose adjusted properly and had some rashes on her hands and feet like burns. Once dose was adjusted right she is doing great. Her cancer is slowly regressing. Her lung is clear and bone sites are stable. She is happy on it. My husband has advanced head and neck cancer and was put on it as a last ditch effort due to not tollerating other chemos. He only lasted one cycle and his platelet counts got way to low. He has had a lot of chemo and his system is to beat up to tollerate anything at this time. We don't feel the Xeloda caused it as much as he is just to weak. I myself am a Stage 4 breast cancer patient who still has an option to use Xeloda in the close future and happy to know it is there. zooma",

      "Content": "Hello, My husband and I went through a similar situation. We both were treated for cancer. We fortunatly had good insurance. There were drugs that were not FDA approved and insurance would not pay for. We both had drugs given to us by some drug companies because they wanted them approved and used the data from your case to support their drugs. Our oncologists contacted the drug makers and set up the whole thing. The drugs for us were Avastin and Gemzar. Your oncologist will know who makes them. All we had to do was sign some finacial income papers and make less than 75,000 dollars a year. Maybe you can find a company that would help you out to. I think you should qualify. Good luck and I wish you both the best for help and a recovery!",
