      "Content": "Hi,   My name is Maggie and my 7yr old daughter has being diagnosed recently with a tumour called a diffuse ponteine glioma. An inoperable brain tumour. We have being told 1in5 are alive after 2yrs. Radiation is the only treatment. In my quest to find answers I came accross a device called a photon surgical system. Which is a different way of giving radiation and you can have the treatment multiple times. It is radiation but a massive dose delivered by this precise instrument. There is no spliage of radiation to other tissues. I know there are big trials with this system its worth a look.   Good Luck   Maggie&Richard Perth W.A",
