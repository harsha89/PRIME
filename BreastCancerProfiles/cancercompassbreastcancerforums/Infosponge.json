    "Content": "Scared, My sister in law in seattle was in the same boat/ mds told her she had 6 months to live.  She told them she would not accept that. That was 15 years ago.  I just posted a bunch of messages to Sweetpea 839 on this site about alternative medical stratagies I've found online. She was inquiring about intravenous vitamin c.  I'm fairly new to this site and am having trouble negogiating my way around in here.  I found Sweetpea and cancercompass  while searching thru sites under the general heading \"intravenous vitamin c\" on google. On my computer she was back on page 4 or about the 30th entry. See if you can find her messages and go thru them.  There was helpfull advice from a number of people. There is also an alternative treatments discussion board in this site. Good luck.  infosponge       ",
