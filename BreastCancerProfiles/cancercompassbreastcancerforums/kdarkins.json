      "Content": "Please get an MRI.  I'm 45 and I get regular mammograms.  I felt a lump under my arm in Nov 12.  I saw my gyn and she told me to get an ultrasound with my regularly scheduled mammo in December.  It showed an enlarged lymph node, but they thought it was because I had been fighting bronchitis.  They told me to watch it for 3 months.  In March, I saw my breast surgeon who said it was not cancer, but that it \"looked weird\" and she would do a biopsy.  When I woke up from the surgery, so told me I had stage III cancer.  Further testing showed a 12 cm tumor in my breast, and a 5 cm tumor in my lymph nodes with 3 of the nodes being positive.  Upon further review of the 2 previous years of mammo's by a different radiologist, I was told that my cancer showed up on those mammograms, but it was missed by my doctors.  You know your body better than anyone else.  Insist you get the MRI. I am happy to report that I had 8 treatments of chemo, surgery, and radiation, and my CTCA doctors tell me my blood tests look great.  I am going to watch my daughter graduate this year and give the valedictorian address.  Life is good.",

      "Content": "I lost my hair when we were on a college visit at Vanderbilt for my daughter.  It just started to fall out in clumps right on the floor of our Opryland Hotel floor.  I had a pretty good attitude about it.  I cleaned up the mess and went about my business.  I was glad I had cut my hair a bit shorter right after my first treatment.  One day I was standing outside a restaurant with my husband, and the wind was strong, and it was blowing the hair off my head.  My husband has a motorcycle and he joked that he could just take me out on the highway and get it over with really quickly.  We laughed & laughed - and then I cried.  I had someone I knew who had breast cancer several years before who shared a big bag of hats & scarves with me.  She was upbeat and taught me how to tie the scarves.  I ended up wearing a wig to work, but when I came home, I whipped it off.  My family got used to seeing me bald.  When I went outside, I wore hats & scarves. My hair started to come in toward the end of my chemo treatments.  I kind of liked it when it was really short, but now it is curly and at that awkward stage.  My husband wants me to grow it out again, so I have to deal with this mop for a bit longer.    I won't lie, it stinks being bald.  But it does send a message to others that you are going through some crap - let people spoil you.   In 3 weeks, I will be alive to see my daughter give the valedictorian speech at her high school graduation.  I have witnessed the love of my friends and family in ways I couldn't imagine in the past year.  I wish you the very best.",
