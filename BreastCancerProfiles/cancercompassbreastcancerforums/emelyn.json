      "Content": "Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma 1.5 cm 1 node positive. 99% E&P positive. ONC prescribed me cytoxan taxotere 6x every three weeks followed by radiation 30x and the tamoxifen for 5 years. I am 43 turning 44 in April. My question is if anyone else is doing radiation after cytoxan too. I have been reading the risk of secondary chemo related cancer is increased with radiation added to cytoxan. Why give me cytoxan instead of something else??? Anyone else on same regimen??? Any input would help!",
