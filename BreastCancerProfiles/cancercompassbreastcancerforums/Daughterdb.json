    "Content": "Hi. I am a daughter of a mom with metastatic breast cancer to her liver. She is only 53. Its been a few years now since she was diagsnosed with stage 1 lobular cancer. she was put on tamoxifin and had a double mastectomy...awhile later she returned to show 3 spots on her liver. the doctors read them out as hemangiomas. three months later she came back, she had full blown mets in her liver. just telling that makes me so angry...anyways, back to it. she did the minimal chemo, she believes in organic foods, good nutrition, supplements, alterative treatments. to say the least chemo made her feel horrible and she felt horrible putting that into her body. so she began alternative options and  started to lose support from the conventional docotrs which is a whole other story, that also frustrates me...well she did her own treatments, and felt great, looked great, sounded great...but 5 weeks ago she had a CT and it is progressing, so she agreed to go on femara. now she feels horrible, the pain is intense, her belly is bloated, and i feel so helpless....not to mention scared. i feel sometimes like the anger is overwhelming these days. why my mom, why any of us? why is it so hard to find a good doctor? why is life so unfair?   Any advice out there would be much apprecitate",
