      "Content": "Itching was no fun; I only got rash, itching on face and chin. It would stop, go away if stopped Arimidex. Felt run down, joint pain. I can walk it out, after a few steps it goes away. Had MRI on leg joints, it showed nothing. Most frustrating is weight gain. I tried talking to oncologist, did not get far on issues of Arimidex. I stopped after a year, watching my diet closely, avoiding foods higher in the estrogen. I eat lots more whole gain, walnuts, greens and fruits. I avoid grapefruit, most meats, workout every evening 1.5 to 2 hrs, also walking at my lunch 3 to 4 days a wk. This has to be better than the side effect of that medication   God Bless",
