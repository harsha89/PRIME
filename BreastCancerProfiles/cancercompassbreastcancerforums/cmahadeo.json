    "Content": "Hi,  I was been diagnosed for IBC stage 3 in December 2006. The IBC was recognised late because I was feeding my baby then and gynaecologist misdignosed it as milk duct swelling to start with hence I missed some important months.  After diagnosis, I was given 4 rounds of chemo (TAC therapy) at regular intervals of 21 days. Tumour size only reduced from 10*10 cm to 7*7 cm. I was operated for mastectomy. Then again there were 2 rounds of TAC. THere after there was internal and external radiation (22 times). Medication seemed to have end and I was happy again.  But immediately in one month there was a small tumour see on chest. PET scan told us that even lung might be infected. I am shocked. Doctors have adviced GEMCITE/CARBOPLATIN chemos again, but are very pessimitic of outcome. But i want to positive and fight out the cancer. I want to survive me and my 1 year daughter. Please advise on this on treatment, options available, medicines, hospital etc. Any help will be appreciated. Regards",
