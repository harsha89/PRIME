    "Content": "hello susan, can u share with me how she's coped up with the pain aside from the brace. my mom is in exactly the same situation. she even developed pulmonary infection that makes her really weak. the doctors have to extract the fluid in her lungs that makes it diffucult for her to breath and sweat a lot...the pain seemed to increase each day. it breaks my heart every time i hear her scream in pain. she's in oxycontine and morphine, but i don't think it's helping her. the whole experience is becoming emotionally and financially draining for our family.",
