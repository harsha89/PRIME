      "Content": "I hope someone responds to this, I signed up for this page today.  I have been on Aromasin for 4 years.  I am 55 but feel like I am in my 80's.  Everything is painful, joints, muscles.  I read on line today that you should only be on these drugs for 2 1/2-3 years?  I really tried to do the 5 years, but am thinking of stopping it.  My biggest concern:  memory problems, mental fog.  I forget what I am saying, struggle to find words as I am speaking, forget to pay bills, forget where I am going in the car.  I am raising a young son alone (am widowed) and I am all he has.  I am wondering if anyone else has this problem?  I also did not have a cancer in the breast, I had a pre-cancer and was put on this to prevent it from turning into cancer.  It did work.  I am very depressed also, and my quality of life is extremely poor.  I always feel 'sickly' and 'down'.  My house is a mess, I am unable to clean it due to no energy and pain in my body.  Please - if anyone wants to share their experience message me back!  Mary",
