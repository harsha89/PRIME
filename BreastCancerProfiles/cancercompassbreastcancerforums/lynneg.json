    "Content": "Hi, I have just been diagnosed with DCIS and am getting ready to have a lumpectomy on my left breast for a small area that they have found.  They then said that the follow up treatment would be pointed radiation only on the spot that they found the cancer in.  Did you have your whole breast radiated?  I am a bit scared now as I was hoping to have the lumpectomy and radiation and not have to have the mastectomy but now I am rethinking that decision after reading your post.  If you are willing to, can you provide some further info on how big the area was and if you had your whole breast radiated?  That may really help me rethink my choice.",
