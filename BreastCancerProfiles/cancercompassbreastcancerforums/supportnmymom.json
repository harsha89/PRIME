      "Content": "Hi. My name is Quinshondra, and let me first say that I am sorry to hear about your sister. My mother, who is 39 has Stage IV BC with mets to the liver. She is sometimes in pain, but not as much as before when we first found out about the cancer. That alone gives us hope that treatment is working. I really wanted to tell you the same thing that I told my mother and maybe you can share it with your sister. This battle is more than physical-- which mean she has to fight more than just the physical stuff. 80% of this battle has nothing to do with the cancer itself... but how we approach the fight. Please do not let what those doctors say scare you, Not sure if you believe in a higher power, but if you do trust in that and know that GOD can still say YES when everyone else says NO! No doctor on earth can tell you how long you have left here. A cousin of ours was given a 2% chance of making it through the night-- that was eight years ago and she's sitting next to me now!!! Look what GOD can do! Be encoouraged and stay strong!",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm a new member here and let me first say that i'm sorry to hear about your diagnosis. My mother is 39 ans was just diagnosed at the end of august w/ liver mets. She was just told today that the chemo they were using to treat it is not strong enough and she will have to start a different one that will make her sick and take out her hair. She just went through this last june, andÂ i have a baby on the way-- due in jan.-- which makes it really scary for her. all i can say to you is the same thing i said to her. we are not very religious people but we are spiritual and do believe in GOD! I had to remind her that we serve a GOD that says yes when everyone else says no. When your doctor starts talking like that, it's time to either have a serious convo with him about not giving up on you, or starting the search for a new doc! I think we are about to seek another opinion about treatment. Don't let him scare you. Remember you have the power to fight this as long as you beleive you can!! Please be encouraged and keep me informed!",

      "Content": "Well I wish you the best of luck with everything. I was just telling my mother about you and it really comforts her to know that someone else, whos young as well is going through the same thing. Most of the people we talk to about it are older and I just came across this site today and it is such an outlet for me. i hope it can be for her too, because i feel like it will be such a vital part of her survival. I'v been reading about people who've been living with this for 13,14,15 years-- and that gives me hope. I am really looking into getting her into CTCA too. Havve you considered that?",
