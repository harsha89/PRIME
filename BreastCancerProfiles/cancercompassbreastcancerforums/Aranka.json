      "Content": "I have a cyst as well.  The ultrasound revealed the cyst as being liquid (just a black spot on the screen).  If your breasts are prone to cysts, the one filled with liquid is far less harmful than a solid mass (shows as white or gray on the screen).  Don't panic but do follow up.  You need to be pro-active when it comes to you health issues.  If you don't like the Q and A session with your doctor, seek another one (God knows there are loads of doctors in this world).  You have to be persistant, assertive and inquisitive. This can directly affect you and and your well being. Doctors often think of their patients as naive, lacking medical knowledge etc and therefor hate when asked a poignant questions - prove them wrong.",

There are many articles and studies written on the subject of dense breast tissue.  Good luck,   Aranka",

Just recently she has been diagnozed with metastatic breast cancer. It appears that she has developed a secondary spot on her spine.  Her lymph notes are not involved.  She has undergone both radiation and chemo and to my great sadness her condition has not improved all that much.  She has been and I believe still is treated for severe bone pain, but her pain is not subsiding.  She has to sleep in a special bed and is currently taking cortisone to help her with the \"overall bone ache throughout her body\" (at least that is how she describes the pain).  I am very concerned for her.  This illness is making her suffer and it is so unfair. She is a great person and despite everything she is going through, she maintains her optimism and hope.  My question is:  what can we, her friends and family, expect in the future and how hopeful can we be about her life expectancy.  I am hoping against hope that her condition will improve, that this is just a temporary set-back.  Her sister is beyond herself with worry and I am just trying to find enough information about her condition.  I know that each case has to be treated separately, but an overall information would be so helful.   Many thanks,   Aranka",

She is slated to go to a spcial rehab center (which of course is a private establisment and quite expensive and being in Geneve/Switzerland, you can only imagine how expensive it must be.  It is sad, actually repugnant how money has taken control over our lives. Living with a little bit of dignity is not much to ask for. Again, many thanks Teresa and the best to your sister.  If it is not much of an inconvenience, would you kindly advise me of any new treatment, news, anything that has to do with this bloody metastatic breast cancer.   God Bless,   Aranka",

I tried going on another forum and asking this question but no one answered me....so I found this website and I'm hoping someone will have some insight!   Anways...My mom is 53 years old and she recently had her yearly mammogram and they called her back for more pictures because there was a small area that was suspicious. So she got her other pictures done and the radiologist ended up talking to her and basically just saying \"I'm 95% sure this is benign but the other 5%...I'm not sure about. So I want you to get a biopsy.\" She then talked to the doctor performing the biopsy and she said she felt strongly that this was benign, which is good and then what they were seeing on the mammogram is calcifications. She ended up getting her biopsy last week and she forgot to stop taking advil (you're not supposed to take it 5 days before a procedure like that because it can make you bleed) and ended up bleeding a lot because of not stopping the advil and the doctor doing the procedure knicked an artery or something like that. She ended up having to go to the hospital to stop the bleeding but knock on wood everything's been fine after that. Kind of one of those weird rare things. I'm a constant worrier. Two of her friends actually had the same thing happen to them and their doctors both told them they were 80% sure that it was benign and both ended up being fine. I'm just nervous because everyones different. I worry about everything. And this is no exception. I'm really nervous my mom has breast cancer and something horrible is gonna happen. Basically what I'm trying to get at here is...should I be this worried about it? I understand it's normal to be a little worried...but I'm really a wreck here. I also see that she's a little nervous and that makes me nervous but the only reason she's super nervous is that she has a ton going on (she's getting a divorce). She gets her results tomorrow but the waiting is killing both of us...but once again...am I worrying too much? Hi, has you mom received results of the biopsy. If the results are negative, I wouldn't worry about it.  I too have dense breast tissue and I too like your mom have one spot that is 99.99999% a case of calcification.  I don't worry about it as I am sure that if the spot was that suspicious they would have recommened a biopsy.  I didn't have biopsy done, was told that is not necessary. Again, good luck to you and your mom, please do not worry  - sometimes streess caused by worries can make us ill.  God bless you both. Regards  ",
