      "Content": "Dear \"Helpforhiswife\", I had a double mastectomy in February. Looking back it seems much longer. Currently, I'm mid-reconstruction, with tissue expanders-expanded and scheduled for my 'final' reconstruction(implant placement). When I was anticipating the decision about double/single mastectomy I asked the social worker at my cancer clinic to speak with other woman whom had a similar experience. The social worker had many woman reach out to me. I was so grateful for each and everyone of them. Each lady had their own journey, no two were even similar. I learned from each and every one of them, I was so touched by their willingness to share with me, a stranger. I hope to give you even a small amount of the comfort they gave me. So here's my 'advice': 1. Take the pain medicine as prescribed and don't feel like you need to \"brave\" if for anyone!!! I was in a lot of pain and actually had an extra hospital overnight because of the pain.  2. Ask for help!! I asked my girlfriends to make meals for my family for when I got home. This turned out to be an amazing help! Even though my hubby is wonderful, it made things easier on him and gave my lovely ladies a chance to help.  Learning to ask for and receive help. 3. Take a stool softener. I know, this is kind of yucky. Let me tell you, pain meds will bind you up...so get some at the pharmacy before you're home from surgery. It won't take much, but will help. 4. Get some loose comfy button front shirts and pull up pants.  Your arms will be sore, especially if you do immediate(partial)reconstruction where they cut the pectoral muscles for tissue expanders.  5. REST REST REST!!!! Once you're home from the hospital, don't push yourself and make sure you take it easy for several weeks!!!  I wish you the best going forward. My OB/GYN went through this 2 years ahead of me and something she said to me, post surgery, made me feel more at ease with the tough decision I'd made: \"When your breasts try to kill you, you get rid of them\".  Save your life! Try and focus on the things you can be grateful for instead. Get a great team of medical professionals to care for you. God Bless You!",

      "Content": "I'd recommend calling any local cancer treatment centers in your area and ask to speak with a social/care worker. Also look for support groups, which is where a lot of the women who reached out to me beforehand were from. It was very helpful! I'd be willing to speak on the phone if with you if it would be helpful.  It's a terrifying thing to face. Now that I'm on the other side, I'm relieved to have it past me. It was rough during the recovery period, get and accept ALL the help you can!! My husband and I watched funny movies too, although it did hurt a little to laugh...but was worth it.  Be gentle with yourself! Stand up for what you need!  Are you scheduled for surgery? I would like to hold you in my prayers...if you'd wish.... God Bless You!",

      "Content": "Greetings Brave Souls, I had a double mastectomy in Feb. 2014 with immediate reconstruction. I'm due to have my tissue expanders removed and implants installed as my 'final' reconstruction soon. I was hoping to learn about the recovery from this procedure. Such as how soon you drove afterwards, any pain, range of motion, etc.  Thank you for your time and consideration with this post.",

I just hope the replacement surgery doesn't interfere with the progress I've made thus far.  I'm glad to hear your wife is happy now. I also didn't have to do chemo or radiation...and on the \"morning pill\".  Thank you for sharing and blessings to you and your wife!!",
