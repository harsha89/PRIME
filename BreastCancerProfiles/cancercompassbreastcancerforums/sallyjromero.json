      "Content": "I had radiation for sarcomas in neck & a large one in my armpit, that  started growing after a centinel node biopsy for melenoma surgery. , It has a hole in the middle of it, that is large & has a foul thick cheesy  covering over it. I am going to start chemo therapy soon,  I asked the  oncology nurse if she knew what it was, the doc was not in so I didn't see her, the nurse had no clue, she said maybe the wound clinic would be good to see.  have any of you heard of this?
