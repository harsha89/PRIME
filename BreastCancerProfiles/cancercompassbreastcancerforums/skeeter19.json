    "Content": "I have Inflammatory Ductile Carsonoma in the right breast.  I found out 3 months ago at my routine doctor visit. I have changed my diet to organic.  I am drinking Essiac Tea twice daily.  I have recently added Baking soda and organic molassis to the protocol.  After 2 weeks all the inflamation and most of the pain was gone.  However the golf ball size mass under my right arm has grown to a tennis ball size.  This has scared me into S.O.C. protocol.  My blood work-up is perfect, and I started Chemotherapy today.  It's 3 am and I am very sick and cannot sleep.  I told my Doctor about Essiac Tea and he said it is working, continue to take it along with the Chemo.  According to the PET scan there is no sign of Cancer anywhere else in my body.  I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing here.  Can some one comment please.",
