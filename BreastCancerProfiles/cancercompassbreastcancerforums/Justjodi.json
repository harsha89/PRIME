      "Content": "Tricia, Thank you, fellow warrioress in this war on cancer!! I have never even heard of HER2, but will call my oncologist tomorrow and ask. I just had bloodwork and she said my tumor markers have increased slightly, so we're doing the old PET scan next week to see if anything has traveled. It's a scary time, that's for sure. God Bless you for having gone through this three times and are still here to inform people like me! Strong will and stronger faith are my two best tools! I just don't know how long a body can carry this stuff around. I'm going back to the natural diet, no refined sugars to the best of my ability, plenty of water and leafy green stuff!Do you happen to take any extra vitamins or minerals? Again, thanks for the encouragment and information!! Jodi",

      "Content": "As the header states, my breast cancer that the doctors thought they got all of in a mastectomy and radiation, at stage one....went directly to my lungs and set up house. 13 spots altogether were found at my yearly follow up CT scan. I was 37 at the time, 39 now. Was put immediately into menopause and take Femara. It has slowed the growth well, no changes on my last 3 CT scans. Spots still there, but not growing. I refuse to let my doctors give me a \"time line\" because all of their studies and numbers have never included my will to live and my faith in God. What I want to know is....has anyone else out there been successful in carrying breast cancer mets to the lung for a respectable amount of time? I know sugar feeds cancer, and I try like crazy to stay away from it, is there something else out there I may not know about? I have an 11 year old daughter who has been forced to grow up quickly because of this disease. My cancer is slightly hormone receptive, should I demand that my ovaries be removed? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your help.",

      "Content": "My dear friend, All of us that are now warriors in the war on cancer have asked ourselves this very question. I did it myself yesterday when at the age of 39, found out the cancer that is in my lungs (originally in my breast) has decided to start growing again. You haven't \"done\" any more than I have, you just have it. I agree that you must, you absolutely MUST focus on the positives now, check into changing your eating habits, GET OFF ALL SUGAR IMMEDIATELY!!! Sugar feeds your cancer, so starve it instead!! So your body went haywire and created some cancer cells, it can also destroy them. Pump your immune system, and please, if you do nothing else, say to yourself every day \" I will survive this disease\" or \"my body will heal itself\". The unconscience mind is wickedly powerful and it believes what you tell it....but it doesn't understand a negative thought! If you say \"I cannot die from cancer\", your unconscience mond will remove the negative, which then turns into \"I can die from cancer\". Be STRONG and change your mindset! There is a great book called \"Beating Cancer with Nutrition\", I bought it at Barnes and Noble. Have you contacted CTCA yet? Call them, in a lot of cases they will fly you in for free for a second opinion. If you are a Christian, ask Jesus to give you strength and courage, and if you are not, now might be a good time to consider geting to know Him. My prayers are with you. Jodi",
