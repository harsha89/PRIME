He is being treated at Sloan Kettering in New York and i=has had three treatments of Carboplatin and Etoposide. So far so good, the only neurologic deficit he has is he is a little (a I mean a little) confused, but that could also be put down to the fact that he is taking steroids, has had whole brain radiation and is currently on chemo...who knows. When Dad was diagnosed we had gone to Sloan fully expecting him to have a surgery to remove his primary tumor. At that time the neuro-surgeon looked at the most current MRI and diagnosed Dad with leptomeningeal disease. He was so blase about it we thought it was a good thing until we came home and read the internet! We have learned to take one day at a time. Dad has been doing well and then all of a sudden he gets a clot and a pulmonary embollism and ends up in the hospital for two weeks, but so far so good. I have done a lot of research on this disease and it does not look good at all but we can hope. I would love to be in touch with you...you can email me at suzthebrit@comcast.net. Suzy   thanks Suzy.  My sister is at Emory in Georgia. She has very blurred vision and started having seizures from her last methotrexate treatment.  We are in need of another alternative treatment to treat the cancer.  While the doctors are considering alternatives, we will have her seen by a neuro opthamologist, neurologists and others while she is here.  I will follow up with you offline to hear more about your dad's experience at MSKK.  thanks for replying.  ",
