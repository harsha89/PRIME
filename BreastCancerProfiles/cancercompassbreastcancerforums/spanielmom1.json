    "Content": "I am a 7 year breast cancer survivor. I've taken Femara and had terrible joint pain. I was then placed on Aromasin and had the same joint pain. I started experimenting with taking the medicine every other day and it works for me. My doctor ran some tests that showed him my hormone levels were staying where he wanted them while taking it this way, so he agreed to allow me to continue taking it every other day. That was 6 years ago. I've had some neuropathy in my thumbs which seems the worst when it is extremely cold or hot outside. I've had the depression - fixed by taking Nature Made's Super B Complex vitamins. I also take 4000 IU's of Vitamin D per day. My only big complaint is the vaginal dryness that prevents me from having sex with my husband. This is very stressful on our marriage.",
