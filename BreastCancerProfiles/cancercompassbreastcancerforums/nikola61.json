      "Content": "Can you describe the smell? My husband had prostate cancer found during a physical. It was the primary cancer and doctor said we would not know if there was a secondary until something else showed up.  The last couple years he had had constant back pain sometimes radiating into the legs, blood in stool, loss of muscle mass and serious depression as he does not want to know what is up. He will not see a doctor and has stopped talking to me about it. I think he knows there is trouble but says if he is dying he does not want to know. His symptoms could apply to a number of things but what cannot be explained is the smell which I can only describe as sick sweet, kind of fruity or I should say fruit rotting. Does this sound like what you had? This smell is worst some days and other days, not so noticable. When the smell is there it really can send you reeling. Hope you are doing well and look forward to hearing from you.",

      "Content": "Can you describe the smell please? I posted some time back about my husband and the odour and suspecting bone cancer, he already had prostate cancer 7 years ago. He will not see a doctor. He does not want  to know. Last weekend the smell was so strong from Friday until Monday, it was awful. A nurse friend suggested diabetes. But as his wife of 30 years I just have the feeling it is bone cancer, he has so much pain as well as the odour. But the smell has been so powerful lately that I am completely freaked out. I have not mentioned the smell because I think he would be so very much offended that he has a bad odour that he cannot control. I know I would be mortified.",
