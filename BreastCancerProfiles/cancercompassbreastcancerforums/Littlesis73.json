    "Content": "My sister started her 16th round of chemo two weeks ago. Her breast cancer was diagnosed in July '05 and within this past year she has gone from having stage II breast cancer to stage IV mestastic disease with tumors in her lungs, on her ovaries, adrenal glands and on her heart. I know she is not long for this world - and am truly inspired and amazed by how she has and is continuing to show so much courage. Now, I believe she is becoming more aware of the severity of her situation, but she still holds-on to the smallest glimmer of hope and she still maintains as positive of an outlook that she can. She is very weak now, very thin, tired an in tremendous pain. My heart truly aches when I have to leave her. We all cope the best we can, but this is beyond hard--this is just impossible.",
