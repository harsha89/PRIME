      "Content": "Just let me say first that I am so sorry for all of you who are suffering from hair loss. I underwent chemo and radation back in 2009 for breast cancer. I went into treatment with a thick and curly , beautiful head of hair.I knew that I would lose it and that was ok because I knew that I had to take the chemo. I hoped that my hair would come back as it was pre chemo but it didn't. It took me from the onset of chemo until about 2014 for my hair to regain any normalcy. It did not come back as it had pre chemo and it lost it's curl and thickness. I am a Hairstylist and had often sold Rogaine and such products to my clients. I know that they only have results as long as you use them and are expensive. I am certain that one day there will be a rescue for all of us who suffer from hair loss due to being born with alopecia as my little nephew was or for those of us who have lost it through premature baldness or chemo. Until then we have to tease our hair and spray it and if you have enough hair you can have hair extensions of diffirent lengths sewn in. It will help with the volume. Also use thickning shampoos and conditoners.I wish I could offer up more hope but we have what we have and we will learn to deal with it as much as possible to our best ability.  As for Doctors telling women who  lose there hair after chemo that it was because of male pattern baldness well I have this to say! It is true that women just like men can lose their hair to male pattern baldness but to tell a woman after chemo that that is what happened is simply slapping a band aid over the situation. The treatments we recieve are what caused our hair to fall out and sadly for some , not to come back or to not at least to return to it's former glory. I feel for you all and am sending hope to you and praying that down the road not too far that there will be an affordable answer to regrowing our hair. Best wishes to you all and remember ,you are not alone we are all in this together. It makes us like family members who we just haven't met.                      Best of all,                             Livinlife  ",

I just bought some fringe hair that clips onto your hair (have to have enough to clip).  I wear my hair short, but it will give me bangs, coverage on top of my head, and blend into my hair. (I will be getting it cut). I have accepted the fact my hair is not coming back. I am grateful for life, having hair is minor. Thank you Lord.  Hi Nurse, I agree with you. I thank God that I am alive and well. I also purchased the clip in bangs at a hair show back when my hair was first growing back and it really helped my hair look much fuller around the face. There are so many pretty wigs and cute hats and scarves that you can get. I love your outlook! Be very blessed in your future,                           Livinlife",

Anyway, It's been 8 years cancer free for me (Thank You God) and my hair is still the same. Thin on top.  A friend has about 15 years out and her hair eventually came back to normal. That is my hope for my hair. If not, I'll just continue to work with what I've got.  I cut off my dread locks because as they got longer and heavier more of my scalp showed through. Now it's about a year and a half later and I'm wearing it loose and natural. This gives me a little more coverage up top. If you look hard or if the light is behind me you can see my scalp. Thankfully no one looks that hard. Six and a half years out for me and I am so happy to report that though my hair is not as thick as it was pre chemo it is much thicker than it was and best of all......Last week I did my regular shampoo and decieded to let my hair dry naturally and finally!! My curley hair is back. When I did my next shampoo My curl was still there.  I know that I sure asked God often enough to please let my hair just come back the way it was before chemo and though it took a little while it is so much better than it was. I am a Cosmetologist and used to shave women's hair who were losing it due to chemo never thinking it would ever happen to me and I always realised just how much most women valued their hair. I truly hope for all of you that even if it looks bad right now that one morning you will wake up and you will see the change. Hand in there ladies and don't give up the hope just yet! God bless you all.",

Just find your best hair thickining shampoos and condt. and hair styling products as well as tools and brushes. Work with them and make then your best friend and you will be surprised how much better it can look. Off to do mine now. Good luck to you all!",

I think it is perhaps all they know how to say but in any event we are here and for some of us our beautiful has not come back in the former glory that it was before Chemo. I knew that my hair would come out and I was ok with it and may as well have been because it was part of the treatment. I do wish however that the Doctors had told me about the possibility that it would come back so changed.  I am six and a half years out and though my hair is not as thick as it was it is much better now and my curl has come back more.  I am wondering if when enough years have gone by that it somehow gets out of our system enough to allow our hair to return to something like it used to be?",

I think wigs will be my best friends now, because nothing else seems to be working.  If anyone finds an answer out there let us know.  Take care All. Hi everybody! I read everyones post about your hair not growing back or at best sparsely. I went through radiation and chemo back in 2009. I lost all of my body hair.I had a head full of long dark curly hair like (Fran Drescher) on the Nanny! I loved my hair and as a hairstylist it was so important to me.I didn't mourn when I lost it.I knew it would grow back when I was finished with all of my treatments.My hair did come back but it was completely gray and had lost most of my natural curl and the hair was no longer near as thick as it had been.When we go through chemo it disrupts our hormones as it throws us into  menopause.I am sure our thyroid as well is affected.Those two things control much to do with our hair.I so hate to say that sometime the changes to our hair are permenant! I had breast cancer that was non-estrogen responsive and can not take hormones to help with my hair loss.The best thing probably is if you can take them,to talk with your Physician and see if HRT is and option for you.When doing that also use Rogaine or Monoxidile....you first have to have hair for those two products to work. Then wait and see if that happens.Get your thyroid tested too just to make sure that is ok. Best of luck to all of us!",

I finished chemo after Christmas of 2009. I began to develop hardness in my breast and it itched.Not as much as what you say yours does. The mass became much larger and now encompasses 2/3's of my breast. I am not able any longer to have mammos. as the mass has become as hard as a rock.It has gotten even bigger now and there is a seroma in it which is a pocket of fluid.I was told there is nothing that can be done.It is scar tissue caused from the radiation I recieved! My Radiologist who does my mammos. does not agree.I am going back to see my surgeon this month so we can deciede if surgery can be done.I was without pain for a few months and now it is sore again and itches. I guess I take it in my stride because it seems a small price to pay for being alive. Not sure how this will go but I am hopefull that cosmetic surgery can remove it and replace it with fat from my tummy or and implant as 2/3's of my breast will collapse once the mass is removed.I do hope you get some good help for your situation.Wil be hopeing for the best for you as well.Don 't give up!

You will be beautiful no matter what and your hair will be back before you know it. I am sending you lots of positive thoughts.God bless you.",

If you haven't, go the a health food store and get the refrigerated ones with like a 50 billion count. They are around 35.00. Also, while you reseed your gut, it is best to cut out irritants while you do so. Irritants are processed foods (pasta, chips etc) and cut out all meat, eggs and peanuts except for fish (stay away from farmed fish or fish imported from Taiwan or china). Oh, and avoid dairy too. They usually require one month but sometimes that's hard to do. When you do this, your body will be dumping toxins out so you may get cold or flu like symptoms. No medical professional told me this. I had to look it up. I am one year out of chemo. Also, are you on tamoxifen? If so, go see your gynecologist. The pains may also be your uterus or ovaries. They can do an ultrsound and rule that out. Hi, Thanks for responding. I have tried probiotics.I have not taken the stronger ones you mentioned but will try it.It was in Dec. of 2009 that I finished treatment and I began to get sick about three years ago. I had a Historectomy many years ago so no problem there. No tamoxifen needed either. I have cut so many foods from my diet already and just heard about the Paleo diet this morning which is very strict but great for the body and for inflamation which is in the gut with all of the tummy problems.I am thinking that this may be a great diet for my tummy.I have done fast before and it does help to clean the toxins out. I also like you research things on my own and have even shared some things with my Physicians and they hadn't a clue about many things that work for us when we have been through chemo. I rarely eat any meats or eggs and dairy is rare. Thank you for getting back to me and I will go to the health food store for the probiotics you mentioned. I am glad you made it through chemo and I do hope that you have noting in your future but good health.",
