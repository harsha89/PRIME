    "Content": "I've been on Aromasin for approximately 14 months after trying Arimidex for 3 weeks.  At first, it seemed like a breeze but after a couple of months, I developed pain in my heels.  It got so bad that I went to a podiatrist.  He couldn't find anything wrong so he gave me cortisone shots which helped for about 6 weeks.  After 6 mos., I have a bone scan which indicated I had osteoporosis - I'm still trying to determine best method of treatment.  I'm taking Vitamin D3 and calcium and trying to work out almost on a daily basis.  About a month ago, I deveoped pain in my left hand, thumb and middle finger and more in my feet.  It can be excruciating at times.  Sometimes, I'll give in and take some ibuprofen.  I would love to stop taking it but I'm PETRIFIED of the possible consequences.  I'm trying to keep up with my exercise program but it's getting more uncomfortable.  I wish there was an easy solution.
