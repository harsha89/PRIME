    "Content": "Hello,  I am a 55 year old female just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma.  I recently learned that my hormone receptors are all negative, which makes my cancer more difficult to treat.  As I inderstand it, hormone therapy follows chemotherapy and helps prevent new cancer cell development.  Since my hormone receptors are negative, my body will not respond to hormone therapy.  On the advise of my doctors, I am beginning chemotherapy treatment prior to surgery in order to shrink the tumer which is 2-5 centimeters.  Additionally, there is one affected lemph node in the interior mammory glands.  This cancer is stage II.  Is there anyone out there in this same situation?",
