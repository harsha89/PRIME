    "Content": "Hi I stumbled upon your post becasue I myself am going through a very possible breast cancer scare. Your post caught my eye because it was about your mother. I just wanted to know how she was doing...I lost my mom 12 years ago to lung cancer. She went in the hospital with what they thought was a bad chest cold and she passed away less then three weeks later. My mom meant everything in the world to me and not a day goes by where I dont cry about her.. So I guess I am just sending my support and Im sure your mom will be just fine. Breast Cancer is the most resposive and treatable cancers...kee her spirits up, it makes al the difference in the world on her outlook... Take care of her and I wish you both the best.... Jackie",
