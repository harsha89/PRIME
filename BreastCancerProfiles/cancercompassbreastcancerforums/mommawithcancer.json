    "Content": "My mom had breast cancer about 8 years ago, she went through cemo and radiation and was cured.  About 3 years ago she was having pain in her hip and after several tests,  she was told that a form a very slow growing form of breast cancer had formed in her bones.  She has been on several types of cemo treatments, pills, injections, you name, she's had it.  The doctor is going to start her on a 5FU pack this week.  What can we expect from this?  She says she will have a fanny pack but is it more like an insalin pack?",
