      "Content": "Hi Jody, I'm sorry for your pain and what you're going through.  My deepest sympathy...  I have done the same thing, crying tears on my pillow every day, head pounding, sleepless nights, and imagining the worst.  My mom kept it a secret too for awhile which made me madder and more frustrated that she was bearing it all by herself and was alone with her fear. All the feelings you have, anger, guilt, despair, helplessness ...it's horrible.  And it shows how much you love her. I know what you mean about not feeling prepared and feeling lost. There's so much time to make up for.  I try to be closer to her and talk more often. Keep trying to mend the relationship because she needs you, whether she will admit or not. And whether she thanks you or not, you will be glad for that time together. Even though I know everyone dies, and my mom will die someday, it would shatter my world, and I don't think I will ever be ready for that. I'm sorry.  I wish I could offer you words of comfort.  Feel free to message me.",

      "Content": "I'm sorry for the very difficult position you are in.  It sounds like you are trapped.  If it were me though, I probably would force her to get the surgery, even if it took long and was hard.... This is why: My mom was in denial too and she said some of the same things about doctors just wanting money, but I think it was the resentment and fear talking.  Because if she accepted the truth, it would mean having to accept the fear, and making those hard decisions.  Finally, she chose surgery, but it was sheer torture every day for us until she did.  And after the surgery?  She said she felt like a weight had been lifted, and she wished she had done it sooner.  It was agonizing and hurtful when she lashed out at us but we kept pushing her.  I was in tears when I finally broke down and told her how it was affecting us to see her do nothing and about our fear that the cancer would grow and get worse. There was a man I met in the hospital who was a husband of a woman with cancer.  He said at the time that his wife's cancer was detected early and it was small, smaller than my mom's tumor.  She was prescribed medication but wouldn't take it because she hated how she felt on them and she was so stubborn, he said.  He had to force her to her appointments and they argued each time.  Now the cancer has spread to her bones, and it's in her hip, and she was doing radiation, but it was a different outlook.  I will never forget this man in his 60's and how he wept as he told me their story.  He was afraid of losing her.  And I think he wishes she had just listened or he had pushed her a little harder. I don't know what's right in your case, but I hope you don't have regrets or guilt.  I wish you the best, and no judgement either way.  There's no right answer.",
