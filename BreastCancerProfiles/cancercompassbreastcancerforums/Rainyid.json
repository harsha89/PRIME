      "Content": "  On 7/16/2008 Pat52 wrote: I was diagnosed with DCIS, stage 1 breast cancer in April of 2006. I had 2 lumpectomies in May and 30 radiation treatments that summer.  From 9/06-6/06, I took arimidex, as recommended by my oncologist.  Weight gain, fatigue, and especially nausea with vomiting were my symptoms during that whole period.  I took myself off of it, but my oncologist convinced me to try aromasin beginning in Dec. of 07.  I have been taking it for 7 months now, and I've never felt so bad daily for so long before.  My first trigger finger developed while on the aromosin.  I have had 2 cortisone shots to help temporarily and only slightly relieve that one.  I have same digit, middle finger, on right hand now, with very limited movement and lots of pain. The pain and stiffness in both hands and feet, is probably the most debilatating symptom for me.  I have trouble walking and using my hands normally.  I too, am so stiff after sitting for even a few minutes or when getting up in the morning, I feel like someone might feel at 100 years old.  My arms and legs hurt, as do my rib area and hips at times.  I go back to my oncologist for a regular check-up in a week, but I am quitting the aromasin TODAY!  My mammogram recently came back clear.  I don't know about the bloodwork yet, until my appt.  My fingers are so swollen.  I am CONSTANTLY tired, regardless of how much sleep I get, which has been about 8-9 hours a night this summer, since I am a teacher.  I rarely have any energy to do anything, but force my self too.  But I also find myself on the couch much of the time, if I really don't HAVE to do anything.  I hate being and feeling like this.  I will post another message in a few weeks to reflect on what I notice about being off the meds.  I'm 52, going on 92! I too took arimidex and had very bad side effects....  I had to quit taking it and start taking tomoxifin.... Had I continued taking the arimidex I would be in a wheelchair by now.... When I took the arimidex I had to have help to get out of bed in the mornings... I hurt so bad... My hands still hurt but nothing like when I took it.... I had to have surgery on my left hand to repair what the arimidex did to them....  I have not talked to anyone that has had good things to say about the arimidex.... I decided to quit it before it killed me instead of the cancer....  I am feeling so much better since I quit it and I cannot believe that it is still out there for people to take.... I hope that things go better for you... Let me know how you are doing.... Lorraine",

They drained the cyst and sent it in for cytology and other testing.... He put me on a strong antobioc... I knew that I had the cyst and we had decided to just leave it alone.... I had it drained one other time but it never acted the way that my breast is doing now.... With the IBC do the symptoms come and go???  My redness is almost gone and the fever is not as warm....  With all of that fluid removed my back is not hurting....  This really has me concerned and I appreciate all of the info that you can offer....  Thank You So Much ~~~~ Rainy22",

I still cannot lose the weight, but I can at least function as a normal human being, something that I could not do while taking the Arimidex....  I am sure that one reason the doctors are prescribing the Arimidex is because of the price.   It is over $300.00 and the Tamoxifin is like maybe $30.00 a month.... You do know that for every prescription that a doctor prescribes he gets a kickback....  So of course they will prescribe the more expensive ones.... I hope that things are going better for you and your treatments....  Lorraine",
