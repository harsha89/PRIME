      "Content": "Hi Pat Z, I too am very sensitive to drugs and my first chemo treatment was the worst.  I could not function at all, my eyes were scrambled, I could not write, I was a mess.  It felt like I was hit by a semi (whatever that feel like).  I had a very hard time with the steroids.  I did accupuncture with my chemo treatmens and that was a God send.  My oncologist told me he wished more of his patients would consider accupuncture.  It helpled with the nausea, I was never sick once.  My doctor and I decided that I could cut back on the steroids, I think because the accupuncture was working so well with me.  Steroids are to help with the nausea and I was having accupuncture to help with that.  I have to tell you that my first chemo was the worst and after that it got better.  I had 4 cycles of cytoxin and adrimycin, 4 cycles of taxotere, a mastectomy and then 4 cycles of gemsar and cysplatnum.  I would visualize the chemo eating up the cancer cells and just go with the flow,  your body sets up a cycle of good days and bad days and is pretty consistant. I knew what days would be my bad days after chemo and just gave in to it,  I lived in bed on those days and with my good days I coped as best I could.  I know that 7 more cycles seems like an eternity but believe me, you will get through, it is a tough fight but you are strong and can do it.  The cycles do get a bit better as your body gets used to the drugs.  Adrimycin and cytoxin were the worst, taxotere was better and I could actually function with the gemsar and cysplatnum,  I could actually drive myslef to chemo with the last 2 drugs.  One suggestion I wish my dr. pushed, was if you have taxotere and your tear ducts plug, go have the tubes put in, it will save you much misery in the long run.  I did not have the tubes put in and am paying for it now, that is my strongest advise. I wish you the best and will be praying for you during your journey to good health. Teresa",

I know some of these side effects could happen but what I find weird is that everything began after my chemo, hair did not begin to grow until end February, numbness in fingers and toes in January, and nails in February also... any response would be greatly appreciated.  Regards    Mal Hi Mal, I completed all my chemo and radiation 2 years ago, I still have numbness in my fingertips and toes.  I have talked to a neurologist since and he told me that if I had not regained any feeling at this point there is a strong chance it will never come back.  I have gotten used to it and can now go bare foot again.  I lost all my finger nails and they have grown back nicely.  I didn't believe that they would becuase they looked so ugly and jagged.  Your finger nails will grow back.  I still have problems with my toe nails though.  I just keep them painted because they are ugly.  As for my hair, I was lucky enough to not grow back my underarm hair, I am still waiting for my eye brows (they are not growing back) and my hair is very thin now but it is back.  I think everyone has different experiences with this and that there is no hard and fast answer.  Just be glad to be alive everyday and that you can function.  So many of our sisters have it worse off than us and I remind myself of that everyday when I start to complain about my eyebrows or thin hair.  The reason some of your side effects happened after chemo is because even though you have finished your treatments, the chemo is still in your system working and it takes a while for it to dissipate, just be patient and know that the drugs are still working to kill the cancer.  Talk to your oncologist about your concerns and I sure he/she will have an answer.  Best of luck to you and just keep a great sense of humor, it makes going through this darn disease easier.

I hope everything goes smoothly for you and let me know how you are doing.  Good luck to and God bless you, Teresa ",

Like the previous response above, do your research and ask a lot of questions.  Ask to speak to patients who have had the proceedure, I did this, it not only will put your wife at ease but it will help her feel more confident when it comes time for the surgery.  Best of luck to both you and your wife.

Good luck to you and hope you enjoy your new breast(s). Teresa ",

It is not just for cancer but all disease.  I just learned this technique 5 months ago and am treating my sister who has metastisized breast cancer.  This treatment is accupressure and kinesiology.  It can clear the side affects of chemo and may clear the cancer all together.   I am having good results.  Search the internet about NAET and read the testimonials.  The practitionaer who helped me ( I had many health problems like celiac and RA symptoms and migraines) has had good results with cancer patients and has cleared tumors of cancer.  You don't have to suffer the affects of cancer or anything else when there is a treatment that can help.  Do the research and find a good practitioner. My heart goes out to you and your family,   Amy I would just like to respond to your suggestion of using NAET to \"cure\" cancer.  I used NAET throughout my chemo and radiaton.  What cured my cancer was my chemo treatments and radiation.  I highly do not recommend using NAET alone to \"cure\" cancer.  What was good about the NAET is that it did ease the chemo side effects.  I was stage III with an aggressive cancer and I am still a high risk candidate for reoccurring cancer, I am 2-1/2 years out and doing great.  I was using NAET for allergies before I was diagnosed with cancer and upon my diagnosis, my accupucturist suggested I see a person who could \"cure\" my cancer.  I went to see this person just out of curiosity.  This person used a diving rod and the medical diagrams to tell me all my ailments.  I did not say anything and then this person asked me why I was there and I told him I was just diagnosed with BC and he waved his magic wand again and said Yes I see that you have cancer.  DUH, I just told you had cancer.  Anyway, my accupucturist suggested that I strictly use NAET to cure my cancer.  I did not.  I feel that the combination of eastern and western medicine in unison is great.  The western \"cures\" the cancner while the eastern releaves the side effects.  Thank you for listening to my view on the use of strictly using NAET to \"cure\" cancer and best of luck to you and your beautiful family.  Going through cancer is a beautiful lesson in life.  You learn that each day is a gift.  Teresa  ",

My surgery was 10 hours (I only had one done) and I was in the hospital for 5 days.  The second phase, if I remember right, is out patient and you get the damn drains again but it is much easier than the first surgery. No one can tell I has surgery and the scars fade in about a year.  I wish I had a double so both sides have the same consistancy.  Anyway I am just so happy to be hear and look normal that the rest does not matter.  Best of luck to you and enjoy the new you.

I was diagnosed with Stage III lobular BC in '05.  My tumor was over 6cm.  I had chemo first to shrink the tumor, a mastectomy, more chemo (they found more cancer) and 36 rounds of radiation.  I had 2 positive nodes before I started chemo and 2 more positive nodes removed at my mastectomy.  My Drs. tell me they do not know how many nodes I lost altogether because the chemo discintegrated a lot of them (this is good).  My oncologist and radiation oncologist both give me a high survival rate (only 20% chance of reocurrance).  I take my Aromisin every day and am very optimistic about my survial rate.  I will always have that little nagging reminder in the back of my mind, I acknowledge it and move on.  I am very positive and live a very happy life.  Being optimistic and having a great outlook on life really make a huge difference.  Your mom's best allies are her Drs.  Please tell her not to be afraid to ask questions, I'm sure they will alleviate her anxiety by voicing her concerns. I wish your mom a long and happy life. Teresa",

I hope my experience helped and best of luck to you on your decision. Teresa",
