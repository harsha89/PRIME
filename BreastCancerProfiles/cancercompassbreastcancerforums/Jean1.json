      "Content": "yes that helps alot .She has not been following her results and everything .I have done alot of research but some things are hard to understand.She asked me if her cancer could or has spread to other parts her body bacause it it a fast growing type of cancer (being that it was not in her lypph nodes.I asked about pet or ct scan for her body .she has had alot of coughing and the dr said her chest xray showed fine is there any blood or scan testing that can give her/us any more comfort that nothing has spread.So would radiation be beneficial.I am thinking they will put her on herception.but we are still waiting to find out also can you recommend any good support groups?she has been very depressed thank you so much and god bless",

As far as being in remission and how you can tell. The onco usually does circulating tumer cells test as well as a tumor marker test. For the tumer cell one anything over 5 is not a good sign, and the tumer marker usually is 0 to 35 and anything over 35 results that the cancer is still present in the body.also the tests that are by blood test like thwe CA-125 etc. Tell your Mom to get out and do somethings even if it is for a little while, Tara you can also get people to call her and to have people write cards and letters of encouragement to her to help her not be so isolated. Also you can put cards out every day for her that people have sent to help her be encouraged.I hope this helps....Take care and GBUthank you so much..she is taking paxil but she just is very tired ! Are all these blood tests ?",
