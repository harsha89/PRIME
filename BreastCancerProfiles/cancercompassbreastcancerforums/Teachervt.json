      "Content": "Thank you so much for responding! That is exactly what happened to me. I had an accident the year before I was diagnosed with breast cancer that required knee surgery. The RSD is now effecting my right leg and arm. I'm scared because the burning pain is starting in my left hand as well. I have not been able to work at all since September. Has your RSD traveled to other limbs? Can you work? Any information that you feel comforatble sharing would be a big help to me.",

      "Content": "After bilateral mastectomies I developed Post Mastecomy Sydrome which actually got worse over the last four years. Two painful lumps formed under my arm that turned out to be surgical clips used in the surgery. I completely lost the use of my right arm. Surgery was performed to remove the metal that there was some immediate improvement but I am still in pain. The burning pain in now in my left hand and right foot. Apparently this is a condition called RSD that can travel to other limbs. Anyone else develop this?",

      "Content": "My sister's name is Colleen. I am so happy to find someone out there with such a similar story. I have been doing research about post breast cancer treatment issues and find that very little follow up is done. All we know about are the rates of reoccurance. The quality of life and other health issues are unknown. I was diagnosed at first with Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. It was not until I brought up the problems in my left foot that RSD was mentioned. I think that there may be many people like us out there Thank you so much for taking the time and energy to write.

I haven't met a doctor yet that knows anything about it. It is very bad-I'm afraid that I will not get back to my job and I don't know anything about disability.",
