      "Content": "That is how it should be. The US could take note from Australia! I have miserable rib pain. Some days you can actually see it moving. Like when I was pregnant. A baby foot or a baby elbow would protude out.  I had 3 of the most  lethal forms of Chemo. Red Devil, Cytoxan & Taxol. 35 Days of Radiation including 5 days of Boost. My rib looks dished yet swollen.  I have brutal neuropathy in my hands & feet. My muscles, bones and joints hurt so bad.  I exisit in head to toe, nonstop pain. Triple Negative Breast Cancer took away my Quality of life, job, income, means & savings in 2010. My husband has been jobless since '09. I don't see any Dr. unless a Dire emergency.  I had my First/Last Breast MRI with Contrast on 10/30/20124. The Contrast nearly Killed me!! It was Brutal. My BP was 70/40.  I found out late oin 2014 I'm BRCA1+ Positive. So I have Ticking time bomb body parts. I had a salpingo-ooperectomy in December 2014.   It has been a hard struggle. I do my best to hold on with Hopes of Healing and quality of life back. I may not get comfort or relief. But I hope you can and will. Someone out there can and will help you. I wish I could.  Best wishes to your healing. ",
