So much for the clowning idea?  It will have to be put on another burner for now. Jodie areyou her2 pos 3+ ? herceptin responds to the 3+ much better. If you had your test using IMC staining ask for FISH test. this will give you a better result.make sure you are 3+, if not ask your dr for other treatment ops. I pray you have better luck with this.I can give you case study info to support this hi i need help .mu mom is her2 3+.she has had tykerb,capeta and now herceptin.6 months back the scans were absolutely normal.now again there is great progression in the diseaese.i dont know what to do. i dont want to lose this battle.please help  ",

Had a rash during treatment and asked if it could be cancer and was told no. After 6 months of different creams (it was only the size of a pea) went and had it tested and now stage 4 and incurable but treatable. Have tried xeloda, avastin, herceptin, navelbine and now gemzar. Herceptin was also along with some of the other meds and it is not working. Will be two years next month. If we find something that is working I will let you know.  The only way to get through the day is to enjoy it and laugh. I find it harder to get another day under my belt if I focus on why me. Hope something kicks in. God Bless Sue hii do you believe these alternate traetments work in case of advanced cancer?  ",
