      "Content": "I noticed a little over a week ago that at times I will have a sort of milky discharge coming from one pore from only one of my breasts. It only occurs when it is stimulated, usually pressed or squeezed (I discovered it by stretching when I only had a t-shirt on with no bra, and the way I stretched my arms forwards squeezed my breasts), but I've been searching around the internet since I discovered it and have seen that discharge from on pore can mean breast cancer. The breast in question is a larger than the other one, if that means anything, but it always has been, and at times it will have a dull aching.Â  I'm really freaking out, but I don't want to tell my mom yet because it's an embarrassing, though potentially very serious problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",
