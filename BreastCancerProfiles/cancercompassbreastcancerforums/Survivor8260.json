Just wondering if any one knew, i don't know the name yet, picking it up tomprrow. just thought i would share, big difference in price, i will get back when i find out or if anyone know's that would be great too. Katrina Hello, I have taken both the name brand Arimidex and generic name (Anastrozole) for almost 2.5 years via Canada Drugs.com . I have not found any local pharmacy in the United States that can compare in the price savings.  The down side is that it does not count against you insurance deductible, however, I still save more since I usually do not meet my high deductible anyway.  My Celebrex is also cheaper!",

      "Content": "I was born in Maryland but now live in Lanesville, Indiana (14 miles west of Louisville, KY). Hoping to pay a visit with my Dad soon. I just passed my 4th year in remission; they say I will never be Cancer Free, but I just deal with the cards dealt to me. Your Doctor is probably thinking about Armidex or Aromasin; I have a couple of BC friends that their Cancer came back since they did not choose the radical way that I had to choose.  One friend also had the spots on the liver this time and the Arimidex is doing the trick in keeping it in check.  Another friend is now taking the Herceptin as a treatment for her BC returning and seems to be doing very well. Both were Stage I & II.  I have always had the \"fighter attitude\" and that helps me since I was BC Stage IIIA.  As for your depression, you may want to take to your DR. about some medicine.  I even finally had to reconsider the medicine (Savella) when the chronic pain and side effects finally caught up with me and it has made a real difference for me considering that I have also lost 4 family members and a beloved dog in the past 6 years while dealing with my 2 Cancers. You can e-mail anytime and try a locate a BC group in your area (maybe local hospital-they are always very supportive). My name is Susan and I am 51 years young.",
