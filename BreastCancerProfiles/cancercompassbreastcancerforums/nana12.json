    "Content": "Good luck with your chemo.  I had chemo every 3 weeks for 4 treatments.  I had retuxian, vincrestine, cysoxian, and adriamycin.  They also gave me an anti nauseau med prior to the treatments which took most of the day.  I had heard horror stories about getting so sick with chemo that I too was pretty nervous.  I did not get sick once nor did I lose my appetite,  I had trouble sleeping but doc gave me sleeping pills, I was very tired, and had headaches.  I think the most that bothered me was when I was told I would lose my hair.  After that, I was fine.  I stayed positive and thanked God I was alive.  I had non-hodgkins lymphomia.  It has been almost a year since I received my last chemo treatment and had 21 radiation treatments in Feb.  So far pet scans are good.  Just stay positive and rely on the love and support of friends and family.  Good luck and hang in there.",
