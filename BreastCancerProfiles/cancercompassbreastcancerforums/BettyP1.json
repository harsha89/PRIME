      "Content": "I recently switched from Arimidex to Aromasin, and took Aromasin for three weeks.  My major complaint with Aromasin was the additional pain---as well as the swelling and rash/itchiness  over my whole body!   I tried taking otc benedryl but it did not work.  On Monday my doctor called me and told me to stop the Aromasin and called in an rx for Atarax.  Within hours I felt much relieved.   I have Herceptin treatment on Monday (every 3 weeks for past 1-1/2 years) and then appt. with doctor to discuss my other options.  I am sure that Aromasin is now out of the picture for me.",

      "Content": "Hi Louise!  Prayers for your Mom!  Please do not listen to anyone who would suggest that Stage 4 patients only have 18 months to live!  That is ludicrous!  There is however much research which proves that those who receive traditional chemo DO NOT have a better chance at longevity---it is amazing what the doctors do not tell you when it is right there in black and white!  And external beam radiation is also nothing you want to just accept.  It does cause problems for many down the road. I was diagnosed with Stage IV IBC with mets to liver in November, 2008.  At the time it was suggested I undergo barbaric radiation and chemo and surgery, which I refused.   I opted instead for targeted therapy, Herceptin (given intravenously) and at three week intervals.  Additionally, after I determined the side effects from Herceptin, which although somewhat milder than traditional chemo were pretty frustrating, I started taking Arimidex every day up until one month ago.   I tried Aromasin for three weeks, but had too many side effects and stopped for this week. Last year I also starting taking daily B17 and cesium chloride, along with emulsified vitamin A & E.  I continue with my Herceptin treatment on Monday as scheduled and will discuss further options to replace Aromasin.   Hopefully I will be able to make the decision soon to have the breast cancer removed and implants put in. Meanwhile, I have periodically had bone scans, ct scans, heart scans, blood workup, and the bottom line is that my therapy is indeed working, as my tumors are shrunk to about 1/3 their size.   My liver has been functioning perfectly, even with the tumors, to the surprise of my doctors.    Do not hesitate to do your own research and NEVER hesitate to ask any and all questions....take a note pad with you if it helps.  I wish your Mom the best.
