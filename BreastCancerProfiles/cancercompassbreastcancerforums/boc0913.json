      "Content": "It definitely helps. Wow, I'm so sorry to hear the side effects are so harsh on you. It does make me think again, whether I want to take.  I've had a total mastectomy, so my taking would be strickly because there was a very, very low chance of microinvasion.  I have a very weak estrogen receptor, so its not for that reason.  My doctor is being very cautious and saying it might be a good idea just for the slight chance there was microinvasion.  I certainly hope that they can find something that works better for you.  I really hope they will minimize your side effects.  Of course, there's nothing more important than survivial and I guess all of us have to look at that first.  Good luck with the new drug and thank you for sharing your experience. ",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your reaction.  Wondering if you could give me some advice.  Found out they want me to take it as well.  Have a very low, low risk, and I'm not sure it is worth the side effects.  I've just recently developed severe allegies to antibiotibics, so reading this really helped.  Wondering what other side effects you've had over 5 months.  I'm just not convinced I should be on it.....so anything you can contribute would be helpful in my decision making.  Any chance for you they would try a different med....something similar?  What happens if you react again?  Hope you feel better soon.  We all have enough to deal with, without reactions like that!",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your reaction too.  With so many responding, its seem the drug manufacture would have more info on this.  What an either or situation this is?  So many challenges and then making the decision on whether to take something with so many side effects for such a long time. Thank you all for your input.  It really helps, as I do have a decision to make.  I truly hope they can find a resolution. I've suddenly had severe allergic reaction to antibiotics.  It started when I had an extreme case of cellulitis in my breast in Oct, which ultimately led to my diagnosis.  After mastectomy and reconstruction, they tried a different med, and about a week later another reaction.  So, I can sympathize with the skin rashes and itches.  I hope they can find a compromise for you.  Maybe a different, similar drug. ",

      "Content": "Good advice.  Thank you.  I know there were changing cells in one lymph node, but they never said it was cancer cells.  I understand that sometimes during biopsy(?) cells can get \"pushed\" into the node.  That's what they told me when I met with med onc. However, someone else mentioned that I should ask the doctor what type of cells were found in the lymph node.  So, more questions and adnswers needed.  Good luck with your new medication.  Hope side effects are zero to little for you!",

      "Content": "So sorry to hear this news.  If G is staging, then I would think 1-2 is early and I'm praying that's better news for you. They caught mine early and I'm doing very well.  Has your doctor laid out your options for surgery/treatment yet?  If not, I suggest you try to set up appoitnment immediately with your doctor and get as much info so you can make an informed decision right away.  My radiologist and breast surgeon share an office.  All tests are done on premises and at diagnosis my doctor was there to discuss options immediately.  If you need any help or other info, don't hesitate to ask. I'm still in recovery mode.  I've tried to push my recovery and realize it is not working.  So, I'm not rushing back to work.  Time is precious and we need to gain all of our strenght to make the best decision for us.  And then to go through it and recover.  wishing you the best....",

      "Content": "Definitely get into MD Anderson if you can. I believe the best outcomes are related to where you and the doctors who treat you are....You don't want to wait too long, but MD A is definitiely worth the wait. I've been through this before.  My husband is battling cancer as well.  We both ended up at NYU in NY.  So we had a couple of excellent choices and felt NYU was the best.  And it is one of the best in NY. I think MDA is one of the best in the country if not THE best.  So you will be in excellent hands and that makes all the difference. One hospital told my husband (he had prostate cancer in his 40's) that he was too young and his numbers were too high and they wouldn't do sugery on him because of that.  He felt it was a death sentence.  Well that was almost 8 years ago.  He is not cancer free, but he has done incredibly well. His surgeon came out of John Hopkins and has been at NYU for several years and was part of the team that developed the surgery at Hopkins.  He walked into see my husband and told him, it was a very serious situation, however, he ws going for a cure.  Did the surgery, did radiation and here he is, still working, still participating in life 8 year later.  My best wishes and prayers.  You will be in wonderful hands!",

      "Content": "I can personally tell you, both having had benign tumors removed and malignant, you should try to relax and stay calm.  What I could feel was benign and freaked me out more than what was actually cancer, which I could not feel.  I can also tell you, your doctor and radiologist sound very laid back about your return.  This is what I experienced when everything was benign....the need to recheck, but not rushed.  When it was cancer, it was quite quick, and very immediate. I'm two weeks post mastectomy, doing very well and please just try to relax and take it all in stride.  My prayers are that you will get good news.  Based on the way your doctors are handling the siutation, it sounds like it will all be fine!  ",

Most of us on this site know exactly how you are feeling and what you are going through.  Let all those feelings help you know that whatever the outcome, we as a group and individuals are here for you! Comforting to know the biopsy went well and let's hope it continues to go just as well and you get the results you want.  Whatever, the outcome.....you have my support.  Reach out whenever you need it.  Hang in there. Nothing about this is easy, but support is here.  I'm hoping you won't need it!  ",
