    "Content": "I just erased my message. Don't you hate to do that? I have had low grade ovarian cancer for 14 years. Chemo does not help me. Chemo works on fast growing cancers and mine is slow growing. My doc has been controlling it with Tamoxife, which gives out in 2 years, then he used Arimidex. It did beautifully lowering my CA125 to around 20, but he said it was damaging to my insides making me look as though I had radiatiion. Now, he is only giving me Tamoxifen which no longer works. I fill up with fluid every few months. Is Femara the same as Tamoxifen or does it work in a different way? Thanks",
