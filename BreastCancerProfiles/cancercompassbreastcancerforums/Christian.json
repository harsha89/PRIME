    "Content": "If she has been diagnosed at the third stage, why wouldnt she have a mastectomy? Then she could reconstruct and get all new breasts with a implant. Then forget radiation and go natural or hormone therapy. I am not a fan of any of it. Everyone has a different opinion. The cancer society is a huge business. I cant believe that they are in the barbaric times of the treatments that they offer. Then a natural doctor comes in with a cure and they try to inprison them. Everybody lies, and wants the dollar and the newly diagnosed just pray that we are making the right choices with a bombardment of options. God bless your wife and I hope she is not as scared as I am. Lots of Love and hope, Thank- God she has a great husband who is doing all he can for her. My prayers are with you and your famly",
