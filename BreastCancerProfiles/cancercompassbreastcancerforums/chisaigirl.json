    "Content": "I have never taken aromosin or experienced breast cancer, but I have battled some serious yeast infections/ vaginitis/ and thrush.  In addition to Dr's help I've gotten results from taking 2 acidophilus pills (found in the refridgerated section at health food stores) with each meal and using 1T vinegar to 1C water solution in a squirt bottle to cleanse the external area.  Hope it helps you!",
