    "Content": "Hi Lisa.  I am 41 and was diagnosed with breast cancer just over 1 year ago.  My husband almost left me a few months after the diagnosis.  He was very supportive the first month (very agitated but supportive).  After I decided to do chemotherapy first versus starting with the mastectomy, he basically washed his hands of me.  He worked full time on the other side of the U.S, while I went through the chemotherapy treatments alone with my sister and mother to assist me when needed.  I begged and pleaded for him to come home and it fell on deaf ears.  After three months of chemotherapy treatment, our marriage was heading towards a divorce.  I thank his mother, for convincing him to come home and support me during my last three months of chemo, surgery and most of my radiation.  He did so reluctantly.    Ironically, we had been together for 11 years and were very happy.   After 4 months in to the diagnosis, my husband could no longer remember any happy times and was ready for a divorce.   To this day, I don't know if he wasn't there for me due to him being scared of losing me or that he just couldn't cope with the diagnosis.   We are back together now.  His memory has changed too.  He remembers the good times now that we have had over the years.   Now, he doesn't remember not being there for me and instead remembers being there for me all the time during my treatments.         Unfortunately, I am no longer confident in the stability of our relationship as I was before.   I knew we were there for each other no matter what.  He could count on me and I could count on him.   Now, I take each day as a blessing, not knowing for sure if he will feel the same way tomorrow or the day after.    I am sorry to hear that you are going through a divorce due to your cancer.  You are in my prayers..Marital counseling helped in my case a little bit.  Most of the help came from his mother, who he would still listen too......",
