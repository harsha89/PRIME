    "Content": "Hi my name is Jeanette I live in liverpool, England. I was diagnosed with BC in Oct 2004 had a 5cm non invasive ductal carcinoma. I had a left mastectomy with lymph node removable all clear. I am 42 and on to 4th chemo out of 8 and then I will have 5 weeks of radiotheraphy. My sister-in-law who lives in Irvine California recently told me about a herb called Graviola which comes from the paw-paw plant she said that a friend of a friend took it and is now cancer free. I spoke to my doctor who had not heard about it, but she did make a comparison of the yew tree plant that they synthesized the breast cancer drug taxol from. If there is anybody out there with any information on graviolas benefits please let me know. Thanking you J.",
