    "Content": "My wife (37 yr old) was diagnosed with breast cancer in 3/2004, (2cm, node negative, er+, pr+). Had lumpectomy, radiation, chemo (CAF) and has started 5 years of tamoxifen. Our last visit to the oncologist she had elevated liver enzymes so the Dr ordered a bone scan, which revealed she has something on her spine. They have set her up for a CT scan but are taking their own sweet time about it. My question is: she was node negative (sentinel lymph node) is it still possible that the cancer Mets to the bone without showing up in her lymph nodes? Thank You.",
