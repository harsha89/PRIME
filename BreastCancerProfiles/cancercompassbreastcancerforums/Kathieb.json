    "Content": "Megan,  Just go get it checked. I know it's really scary, but GOd forbid it is something bad, earlier is better than later. Nothing you feel is too small to get checked. I've been in several times with small (about the same as you describe) lumps, and each time the doctors have thought it warranted more tests (mammogram, ultrasounds). Each time, luckily, they have found them to be non-cancerous (even one needle biopsy). Finding out for sure is better than the not knowing and worrying. I wish you luck and strength to get the lump checked.   Best wishes,   Kathie B ",
