    "Content": "This year I decided to schedule my Mamo and bone density tests on my Birthday.  Thought it would be a good way to remember the date and take care of myself.  Well the test was in the morning and the next day at work I recieved the phone call that I needed another test.  With the Hospital Client Portal I was able to see that they found asymmetry seen in the CC view located 9.5 centimeters from the nibble.  I am scheduled Monday for a HC US EVAL Breast Mass Unilateral.  Is this a long test?  Results quickly?",
