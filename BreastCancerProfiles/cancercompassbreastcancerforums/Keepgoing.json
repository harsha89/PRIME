    "Content": "Hi,  I am very sorry to hear about your mom getting BC again.  I have had it twice also.  Is she going through chemo right now?  Loss of appetite is really commom during chemo. Nothing tastes good and  I didn't want to eat anything, potatoes were the only thing that tasted ok.  Will she take any liquids?  If so try some kind of protein drink (natural food stores have good ones) and see if she can tolerate that.  Also talk to the doctor and tell him your concerns.  If you don't feel he is listening then try another doctor.  And getting a second opinion for your mothers treatment/case is a really good idea. Two places I would recommend to call and try is Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York.  Also Cancer center of America in Chicago is another good place to call.  They were great with me as far as answering questions and really seemed to care.   During radiation I used Thi-go juice which is sold by Natures Sunshine products.  You can probably find them on the internet and you could check to see if there is a distributer in your area.  This anti-oxident juice really helped me when I was going through radiation treatments.  I would take about a 1/2 cup after my treatment and sometimes in the morning.  I never suffered any energy loss, tiredness during my radiation treatments.  It also helped me when I would start to get sores in my mouth from the chemo.  I would swish it in my mouth for about a minute and my mouth sores would be gone in about 2 to 3 hours.  Tell your mom to hang in there and I wish you both good luck.    ",
