Maxine Dear Maxine, I too was on Femara after being on Tamoxafin for 5 years. I experienced debilitating pain in my hands at first and then in my legs. I was just about crawling when I had to negotiate the stairs. I could not kneel down and then stand up again. I eventually realized this started about a month after taking Femara. I decided to stop taking it after getting information on chat rooms like this one, and have experienced the pain leaving and my muscles slowly returning to normal. I am not recommending you stop taking it, as my cancer was resolved with a lumpectomy. My doctor said to weigh the pos and cons, as most medications do have side effects. Do keep talking with your doctors, and tell them about others experiencing your symptoms. Best wishes to you....",
