      "Content": "I have stage iv breast cancer with two small bone mets to pelvis and spine. Feel great and an taking tamoxifen ... Only side effect is night sweats and hot flushes. Oncologist wants to put me on monthly zometa infusions. Having had a look at the side effects am not happy about bisphosforates in general. Have found out by googling that natural strontium citrate plus calcium and vit d can do the bone building just as well without side effects ( not strontium range late). Am fairly sure onc will try to put me off this route as its not a 'pharmaceutical' and I am now of the opinion that pharma companies do not create cures they create customers! Not once since my diagnosis has diet and nutrition been mentioned except to say eat what you like ! Is there anyone on cancer compass who can advise me. Do not want to sign up for monthly infusions if there's a more natural way.... Look forward to your comments",

      "Content": "Hi Bahamabob ..... really interesting you mention the cost.... so extortionate.... reinforces the idea that doctors have no clue other than prescribe.... that is what they have been taught to do but things were not always so.   google 'natural alternatives to Zometa' and its quite interesting what comes up....   Bisphosphorates as a class of drugs were introduced to the world as having NO side effects....  now apparently there are some lawsuits pending in US because they have actually caused fractures.  Luckily I have no pain.  In fact other than puckering in my breast I had no symptoms of cancer and my only sick days were after the op.  (was stupidly on HRT for five years for early menopause but my GP still doesnt see a link to lobular breast cancer... doh) My nutritionist has advised me that it really is better for me at this stage to get my bone building help from food and supplements.... have discovered Strontium Citrate on google and am gonna ask her about that next week.  Apparently you take it a few hours before Calcium Citrate and supplement with magnesium and vits D and K.   The Zometa wouldnt cost me a penny but I dont think I want it in my body.    You will need even more drugs to combat side effects and so the pharmaceutical rip off continues!   Bones affected by cancer can be compromised in the rebuilding process.... bisphosphorates is an extreme solution.  Get yer digestive system working at full strength by Food Combining (like hay diet) take the supplements and you have a natural solution methinks.  I took the oral alternative last month.... Fosavance.. a once a week bisphosphorate oral drug... and had a horrible reaction... pain in my bones and my joints where I never had it before.  Refused to ever take it again so doc suggested zometa infusion.  They were just about to give it to me when I mentioned the jaw necrosis thing and the fact nobody had advised me to visit a dentist and hadnt been to see one in over a year.  got a reprieve on the Zometa till next month and thats why am researching alternatives.... once a month in the chemo unit is not something I want to do.  We have to live with this bone met thing and its better to find a lifestyle solution.  I am also taking Salvestrols which supposedly produce an enzyme that targets cancer cells.  wont know if its doing the job till I get scan in September but feel absolutely great.... despite having radiotherapy on breast for last five weeks!  Exercise also good for bone regeneration.  ",

      "Content": "thanks for that info and pleased you have a positive outcome.   gonna find out about Xgeva.  Am taking tamoxofen as my cancer is hormone driven and this in itself could shrink tumours.  hence my reluctance to hit the problem with a sledgehammer at this point.  think docs are too happy to prescribe and from what Bahamabob says Zometa is about three grand a month... thats 36,000 a year for as long as ye live plus all the other meds.   never thought it before but cancer eally is an industry and I now totally believe that if something non-patentable were to prove to be the cure.... it would be hidden from us.  keep walking Jim  Px ",
