      "Content": "hey Christy your welcome, I am a breast cancer survivor too. I was first diagnosed at age 31 after having two children. I had a lumpectomy and radiation. I was clean for nineteen yrs and had followup during this time. At age 50 i was diagnosed with a second breast cancer. Five years later and it is now in my bones but i am doing well. I dont have pain and am undergoing treatment ( chemo pills) and a zometa infusion once a month. If it were not for my faith i dont know where i would be. Most people do not live with cancer as long as i have. I know its the power of a mighty God and the prayers of his people who have sustained me. I can only imagine the fear that is attacking your mind. Remember God is in control and he is able. Keep in touch via the boards here. I wish i could share my email address but they dont allow that. Remember God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind. 2 timothy 1:7 God bless, Nancy",

      "Content": "Hi Ella, thanks for your message of encouragement. I just started on the oral Xeloda a week ago. So far i seem to be tolerating them well. Could you tell me as you get farther into the cycles if the side effects start up? I am wanting to go visit my daughter in a month or so. That means flying accross country. I would hate to get out there and not feel well, but i really want to.......... need to go. I have stage 4 Breast cancer with mets to the bones but still have good quality of life. I was on femara for a year and then my oncologist switched me to Aromasin. My blood work shows my tumor markers are up and i am anemic so hes trying the Xeloda. Sounds like you have been on it for a year, so thought i would see how you feel on it. thanks for any help ........ Nancy",
