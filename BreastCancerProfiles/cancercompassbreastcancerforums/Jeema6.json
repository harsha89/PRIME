My question I guess was more why is the dose so high for breast cancer treatment? Was just saying that with the worst for of brain cancer there is my dad has never been on 16mg/day. The highest was 8 mg and that didn't last long. But I guess since it is used for such a short period of time the effects of decadron are not as damaging thankfully!! :) I took this with my second round of chemo and it helped.  I was sooo nauseous with the first round I was apprehensive and was given decadron...2 pills the night before chemo, 2 pills the morning of chemo and 2 pills that same day....good lookin out for your peeps!",
