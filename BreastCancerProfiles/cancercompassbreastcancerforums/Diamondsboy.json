      "Content": "Hi all, My name is Mike Watson from Massachusetts. My mom Dorothy lost her fight with breast and brain cancer in December of 05. I have posted with her story on CancerCompass in the past. On August 5th and 6th I will be riding 192 miles in the Pan Massachusetts Challenge to raise money for cancer research. 99 cents of each dollar I raise will go directly to Dana Farba Cancer Institute and the Jimmy Fund. I am looking for help to fight this desease that has effected so many of us. If you can help in any way please go to PMC.org and enter my name Mike Watson in the profiles section on the left of the page. Here you can read my moms story and learn more about the history of the PMC and Dana Farber. My hope is that one day soon none of us will have to visits sites like this one and our kids will only hear the word cancer when they read about who cured it! Thank you in advance for your support.",

One bit of advice, you need to be your own advocate when it come to your or a loved ones care because the doctors and health care system will not be. Mike",

      "Content": "Tony, My mom passed last night from carcinomatous meningitis. She was told three weeks ago that she was \"going to hit a home run\" and to consider her success in her fight against brest and brain cancer an early Christmas present. On Christmas eve morning she began to have trouble seeing and standing. I rushed her to the E.R. and from there she went down hill. She lost the ability to walk, speak, see and understand over seven days and died on the Thursday after Christmas. None of the Doctors had any idea what was happening to her until one figured it out on I think Tuesday. She had early signs like you described, leg pain, weekness and facial numbness. Seven days and she was gone. You are right, This is an evil desease and it needs to be cured. I am sorry about your wife, you are not alone and now I know that niether am I.",

      "Content": "Melissa, Your moms story sounds very close to what I went through. I lost my mother on December 29,2005. She had weak legs and the right side of her face was numb for several months. She reported this and vision problems during her treatments for breast and brain cancer but they missed it. We were not told what took her (Carcinomatous Meningitis) until after she had gone and were never warned about it being a risk. When I did bring her to the E.R. on December 24th after speaking to the \"covering oncologist\" as hers was on vacation she could not walk and was having double vision. They could not contact anyone on her team because they were all on vacation and it was a holiday as we were told. No one could help us or had any idea what was happening to her for about five days. In this time she went from poor vision to total loss of almost all functions. I can be reached at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
