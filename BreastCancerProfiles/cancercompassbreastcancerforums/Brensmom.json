    "Content": "Hello, I have HPV and had precancer of the vulva and had surgery in June 2007 and been doing ok so far. However I have found a small lump where my breast joins my arm and it is very sore and wakes me up at night with some pain. I don't want to sound paranoid but now I am very scared. I am going to call and see if I can see a breast surgeon. I am just afraid because it takes forever to make an appt. Can any of you tell me of some of the symptoms? Did your lump hurt? Â  Regards, Esra",
