    "Content": "I have stage 0 DCIS  estrogen + 99%  and Progestone + 50 % and grade 3. I had a lumpectomy and 35 sessions of radiation. I did 3 months of Arimidex and felt awful with joint and bone pain, fatigue, and dizziness. I tried to stick it out, but then two fingers in my right hand froze up and I couldn't extend them, except manually. (Trigger fingers, I was told.) Now I'm off the med for 4 days and already feeling better. It is scary though. I need to decide if its is worth trying another anastrozole or go with good nutrition, exercise, and hopefully luck. Any input is greatly appreciated!",
