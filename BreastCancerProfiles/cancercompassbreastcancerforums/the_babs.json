I am not quite sure if it is the side effects of Letrozole or Zometa. Both these drugs have similar effects.  Is anyone going through the same treatment and having similar effects? Or is there any alternative medication I can take to alleviate these effects? I am 47 years old,but it feels as though I am 90. With love Ryalma   Dear Ryalma, First, I am so sorry to read of your suffering.  I am 69 though and can't imagine going through your scenario at such a young age.  Although your youth may help you in fighting this dreadful disease.  I have all of the above from mets in my femurs, pelvis, fractures in my hips and a break in my pubic ramus, to my ribs, spine, shoulders, neck and skull w four lesions in my liver and nodules in my lungs...........I know how tough this is...........BUT where are your pain medications????  I can't believe that they are letting you suffer like this w/o pain meds.  I am on the Fentanyl Patch 150 mcg's and for break through pain either percocet when necessary and/or neurontin with iboprofin.  If you don't like percocet because it can weird you out, the neurontin (gabapentin generic very cheap and just as good) with an anti-inflammatory over the counter is also excellent. You must be on pain meds!  It will help you fight and also help you live a more normal live and help with daily activities.  I still love my gardening and vacuum, dust and do daily activities.  To tell you the truth, my biggest problem can be fatigue more than pain as the pain is taken care of.   Zometa is excellent!  You should have been on this sooner.  I am not familiar with all your other drugs and do not know if you are HER 2 Positive..........if you are, you should be on Herceptin.  I will be starting a new trial continuing Hercepting, but adding another drug that you mentioned with Pamidronate.  I can't believe tho' that they haven't given you pain medication.  Do not be afraid of it because it will really help you cope with the stress of the pain you are dealing with.  I just really cannot believe that you are not on pain meds...........REALLY!  Also I take a very low dose of the generic for Prozac (fluoxetine).  .....10 mg and sometimes 5 mg to round it out to 7.5.  A very low dosage of Prozac will help with the stress you are dealing with and also help you fight the disease.  With a very low dosage you will probably not have side effects.  If you do, either stop or try another drug.  Some doctors have samples.  Only an extremely low dosage.  It will help with the stress and not swing you up and down like xanax or other tranquilizers. Something else.........do not be afraid to get second opinions and change physicians.  Also check out the web for clinics in the country that are traditional, but specialize like MD Anderson in Houston, or Sloan Kettering.  Many have cheap to no cost housing.  There is even one west of Vail in Edwards, CO.  The name is something like The Shaw Cancer - - - -.........research Google.  I'd check everything out on the web........BUT YOU MUST HAVE PAIN MEDS to help you cope.  No kidding Ryalma, you've got a helluva fight ahead and if you don't have pain meds you'll be screaming crazy.  Don't be afraid of becoming an addict..........focus on feeling well enough so that you can fight! Really hope I've helped a little.  I felt so bad reading your story and the pain you are in which I am so familiar with.  Get pain meds, get rest, eat as well as you can, listen to music, and when you feel up to it take walks with a friend. Love and blessings..............Barbara in Denver, CO p.s. I'd be happy to talk to you if I could figure out how the whole internet planet wouldn't have my phone number.  Be aggressive in talking with different doctors and second or third opinions.  Also, if your finances are being affected, check with social security to find out what help is available to you in the way of disability/medicare.",

Also, if anyone has had treatments at Oasis of Hope in Mexico and how effective the treatment has been.  Many thanks It's really hard to get a direct answer from physicians.  I don't think they know.  I was diagnosed last June with Stage IV to liver, bones & skull.  I don't look any different than before, but let me share with you what I've learned from a few patients I met so far.  One lady in particular who was about 65 (I am 68) was on her second round of chemo.......BUT, her first round was 7 years ago!  She told me that her mother had the same thing and lived until 98!  Now I realize this is a very unusual case, but I think it depends on so many different factors even the doctors simply don't know. I have good days and bad days.  My biggest problem is fatigue.  I've heard some remarks about it being 50/50.  A lot of people will probably have something to say about that one too!  Even if I knew the answer........what good would it do.  I just think that I'll probably live as long as I want to unless an Act of God takes me out, like a car crash or something like that. Enjoy and bless every moment and live your life to the fullest of your ability.  What good does it do to wonder how long you're going to live?  Have your life in order, let those close to you know you love them, and enjoy your time on the planet and you may be surprised!!
