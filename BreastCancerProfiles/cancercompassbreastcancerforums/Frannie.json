      "Content": "Alina, I took Tamoxifen for about two years after I was initially diagnosed in 2002. I did gain a few pounds but that was from the anti-nausea medicine doctors gave me during chemo. Unfortunately, the cancer came back in 2004 and doctors took me off Tamoxifen. I've had my annual Pap smear and other tests and I'm okay so far so I say to you don't worry, just make sure you get your tests done...Stay healthy and on top of your health. The Bible says be anxious for nothing because we achieve nothing by doing so. When you are anxious, your immune system won't function as well so smile often and laugh much. Be blessed and know that God loves you and other survivors are praying for you. Fran",

      "Content": "Dear Linda, I just read your message today and I pray that your friend is still with you. I am 36 and a 2-time breast cancer survivor. In August, 2004, my oncologist said that the cancer metastasized to my lungs and bones. I go weekly for chemotherapy without any side effects to the chemo. I am treated with decadron (a steroid), benadryl and zantac to prevent side effects to Taxol (the chemo). What I suggest for your friend is what I also use: I take 1000mg of Vitamin C and Niferex (prescription Iron). At 1000 milligrams, the Vitamin C not only works as an antioxidant against the cancer, but at that level, it helps the body absorb the Iron, which keeps the energy levels up. Advise her to check with her doctor about using this with any medication she may currently be using. I got clearance from the pharmacist at the Cancer Institute of NJ where I get treatment. I also recommend four other very important items that I also use: One is laughter. Get your friend videos, DVS, or take her to live performances of comedians that make her laugh. The Bible tells us that laughter is the music of the soul. When we laugh, it does an internal detox of our body and actually makes us healthier. I personally laugh at something no less than five times a day. Items 2, 3, and 4 are books that have changed my life in ways I cannot fully describe: How to Live and Not Die, I forgot the author's name. In The Grip of His Mercy by Bishop Donald Hilliard, Jr., and Your Best Life Now by Joel Osteen. You can get all of these books at Barnes and Noble or Borders Books and Music. These books are filled with biblical scriptures on healing and serve to help change the way you think about and look at this diagnosis. They also encourage you to change your vocabulary. Instead of saying, \"I have cancer\", say \"I've been diagnosed with cancer\". By doing something that simple you change the way feel about the situation and your internal system reacts differently about it. It may sound cheesy but in the two and a half years that I've been dealing with this in my life, I've NEVER said that I had cancer. And when the first breast surgeon I met diagnosed me with breast cancer, I immediately said that can't be because I don't get sick! And while I've had a masectomy, chemo, radiation, and 2-years later back to chemo, I have not had one day of sickness from chemo therapy. In essence, what I'm saying and what these books will encourage your friend to do is say what the Bible says about her healing. The New Testament says that God would have us prosper and be in good health even as our soul prospers. Psalm 117:18 tells us that we shall not die but live and proclaim the good works of the Lord. If your friend quotes just that scripture several times a day, it will help her tremendously. I know several women in my support group that have done it and they have been cancer-free for over 10 years each. Isaiah 53:5 says that Jesus was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of peace was upon the Lord and by His stripes we are healed. Jesus already paid the price for your friend's healing from any disease. With faith if your friend quotes this scripture, it will put her at ease. For you and her other friends and family that are concerned for her, I give you this scripture: 2 Timothy 1:7 says For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but a spirit of love, of power and of sound mind. Get those books and read them to her, particularly if she feels tired. Let those anointed messages saturate, permeate, and marinate in the air around both you and her. They will cause angels to fight on your friend's behalf and enable both of you to experience th joy of victory when her doctor tells her that she is cancer free. Be blessed now and always. Fran",

      "Content": "My name is Fran, I'm 36 years old and a 2-year, 2-time breast cancer survivor. In August 2004, I was diagnosed with metatstatic breast cancer in my lungs and bones. My oncologist currently has me on weekly treatments of Decadron, Benadryl, Zantac. The chemo of choice is Taxol. Since my form of cancer feeds on estrogen, I get monthly doses of Zoladex to suppress my ovaries producing estrogen and Zometa to strengthen my bones which are weakened by the Decadron. I am currently experiencing hip pain and I've been walking with a limp since May 2004. Most days the pain is enough to be a nuisance without requiring pain medicine. The degree to which I limp sometimes varies. Some days - like today - my limp isn't bad, I almost walk like normal. Other days - like yesterday - I looked really bad and those close to me were suggesting I start planning for hip replacement surgery. But the pain and limp continues to be inconsistent. My concern is quality of life. My current oncologist is only concerned with treating the cancer, she seems totally unconcerned that one or possibly more of the drugs are impacting my ability to walk. I saw two orthopedic specialists who both say my condition could be caused by the Decadron. I receive Decadron to avoid having an allergic reaction to the Taxol. I maintain a positive attitude and I know I've been blessed to be able to work 45 hours a week while going for chemotherapy every week. I just can't accept the idea of having to go through another surgery. I have had more surgery and hospital stays in the last two years than in my whole life. I have more doctors, more scars and keloids, more medical vocabulary and more reminders of what I've already lived through than I can shake a stick at. I've read comments from so many others that have asked their oncologist about nutrition or having some participation in their treatment or recovery process and the doctors have no answers about nutrition or any other questions. Has anyone had a similar experience and gone to a specialist who deals in alternative treatments and (1) stopped chemotherapy and (2) is living cancer-free? I'm convinced that there is an alternative treatment out there that is better for me than chemotherapy. I would just feel better knowing that someone else out there had a positive experience with alternative treatments before I embark on this journey of exploration.",

You've obviously eliminated some things from your diet...can you name a few. How did you go about detoxing? Was this something your doctor played a role in or was this strictly from your research? Did you have any complications from the dental work or were you finished with traditional treatments when you made this transition? Please tell me a bit about Protocel? What are you using it for? Did your doctor prescribe it or was this from more of your research? I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks. Fran",

      "Content": "I am SOOOOOO glad that you decided to trust your instinct and listen to the others that encourage to get the biopsy. I am part of a support group for African-American women in NJ and one of the founding members was mis-diagnosed for 3 years and given similar information to what you were given. She died before I was even diagnosed in 2002. I lost another friend in November who was also part of my support group. She was mis-diagnosed for 1-2 years despite telling them that she knew something was wrong with her breast. They did mammograms and ultra-sounds - I don't know if they ever did a biopsy but they kept saying they couldn't find anything. She changed doctors several times until she found one who went a step further and did tests that found the breast cancer, unfortunately she was diagnosed in stage IV and had a difficult time with several different chemotherapy treatments. I say all of that to say GET THE BIOPSY and change doctors if you have to. Your life is the most precious gift God gave you. But He also gave you wisdom in the form of common sense and instincts, use them carefully and enjoy life abundantly. God bless you. Make sure you write back and let us know how you are doing. Fran",

Call the Cancer Treatment Center of America and have them make arrangements to get you out there for QUALITY TREATMENT. They will want the films from the pathology report and medical records from all doctors that have treated you concerning cancer. HOWEVER, they are extremely organized, kind, professional, experienced and every wonderful thing you can think of. They will: review your medical history with you; run their own tests and compare the results with your existing medical records; customize a treatment regiment specifically for you; and they will have you and your care-giver meet with someone from every department there: nutritionist, naturopathologist, spiritual advisor, case worker, oncologist, physical therapist, and pain management. I was just there 2 weeks ago after several unfortunate incidents with my oncologist over the past three years. I've decided to travel back to the Zion, Illinois facility monthly for treatment until they open the Philadelphia facility in October. If you believe in God and divine miracles, you will DEFINITELY want to go there. They will handle the flight and lodging arrangements, just tell them when you're ready to go. Be blessed and keep us posted. Fran",

      "Content": "I am 36 and a 2-time breast cancer survivor. I was first diagnosed two years ago in stage 3 and I now take weekly treatments of Taxol for metastatic breast cancer in the lungs and bones. As I drove myself home after being diagnosed with Breast Cancer, I stopped at a red light and asked God this question: I have friends that smoke 2-3 packs of cigarettes a day, I have other friends that have had sex with entire townships, I have other friends that drink liquor like it's kool-aid. I've never judged or shunned any of them about the things they've done. And while I don't wish this or any disease on any of them, none of them are sick. So what am I supposed to learn from this? In the midst of me crying, God said: It's not about you. I don't know why, but upon hearing that, I stopped crying. God never elaborated beyond that statement but in the two years since then I've learned that this really was NOT about me. God has used me to be an example to others that have unfortunately been diagnosed after me. So many of the women in my support group have taken chemotherapy and not had the strength to work. I not only go for chemotherapy every week since my recurrence (in August, 2004) but I also work about 45 hours a week. Since my diagnosis, I have continued to change my eating habits. I don't eat fast food, I've eliminated most of the junk food...I may treat myself to french fries, cheesecake or ice cream once a month. Once I got a second opinion that confirmed the diagnosis, God told me to let go of past hurts and anger. He said forgive and let it go. That for me was a bit of a challenge. There were many days prior to diagnosis where I would be happy and doing whatever and out of nowhere a memory of something someone did to me that made me really angry would pop into my head and I would re-live the entire experience and I could feel my chest get tight and I would have to take several deep breaths to loosen up. It did take time, but it has also gotten easier to do. Another major task was separating myself from negative people. The Bible tells us to guard our eyes and ears against evil because the pride of life can tempt us to sin. It is really easy to get swept up in listening to people talk negatively about other people. For some reason, we've been conditioned to find that interesting which is why there are so many celebrity gossip programs, magazines, websites, etc. From the second week after the initial diagnosis until now, I get a sick feeling inside when people start talking negatively about anything around me. I'm not saying that I live a sheltered life where I only talk about sunshine and blue skies; I will discuss the good, the bad and the ugly for the sake of sharing information and learning from it but I don't have time - and neither does any other cancer survivor - to waste on trivial matters, we must be about the business of getting and helping others get healed. The most important lesson I have learned from this experience is this: Life, Time and Choice are the most precious gifts God has given us. How we use that time, that life shows our gratitude to God because it shows how we make choices. We can choose to be angry, bitter or scared that we have received this diagnosis and in some cases, blame God. Or we can choose to live life to the fullest and encourage another survivor to do the same knowing that God will enable us. The Bible tells us that with man all things are impossible, but nothing is impossible for God. It is one of the scriptures that comforts me most on this journey. So what would I say is the meaning of my illness: Jesus told his disciples that when He left to return to the right hand of the father, the disciples would be able to do even greater works than Jesus did as He walked with them and taught them. I believe that those of us that are dealing with these diseases - cancer, lupus, sickle-cell, etc. - are here so that others who don't believe Jesus because they cannot physically see Him will come to believe because they will not only physically see us healed, but because we in turn will lay hands on them and by the authority given to us by Jesus, others will be healed. Isaiah 54:17 says \"No weapon forged against you will prevail and you will refute every tongue that accuses you.\" That means that when the naysayers come around looking at you like your at the end of your days, you can look at them with confidence and tell them Jesus was wounded for my transgressions and bruised for my iniquities. The chastisement of my peace was upon the Lord and by His stripes I AM HEALED!!",
