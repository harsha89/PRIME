    "Content": "Be careful with Tamoxifen.  I was on this medication for 11 months and developed a blood clot in my leg as a result.  They are planning to switch me to Aromasin as I cannot continue with Tamoxifen.  Tamoxifen does not have side effects of joint pain, but has its own issues.  Side effects include blood clots, spotting, and uterine cancer.  The blood clot resulted in me being hospitalized for 4 days and put on IV drip of Hepfrin, followed by 5 days of injections in my stomach twice a day of Lovenox.  I am currently on Warfarin (coumidian) which is a blood thinner.  This involves having to go to the doctor to have levels checked, which can be inconvenient if you are working.  My advice is to proceed cautiously with Tamoxifen.  ",
