Every little bit helps Thanks Susanne    I'm presently going through chemo and am on my 4th treatment.   In doing research myself, I've found that it is extremely important to take nutritional supplements to boast and enable your immune system to function properly.   Chemo is extremely hard on the bodies defense systems. Supplement products such as: ReLiv and Xango, may be something you should consider.  I have just begun taking Reliv today and will continue through out my remaining chemo treatments.   I've listened to many people who have been on ReLiv and the positive impact on their lives is amazing!   Has helped many people with cancer.   You might try this or at least look at the product on the web.   Good luck to your MOM!
