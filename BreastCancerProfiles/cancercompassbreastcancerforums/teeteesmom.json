    "Content": "Hi, I am new here and I sure hope I am doing this right.  My daughter is 36.  Sept 2006  she found a lump.  Lumpectomy, back in again to get cleaner margins, a round of chemo (AC) and then radiation.  Then she found a lump in the other breast.  She had a double mastectomy, chemo (Taxol) and while on chemo found another lump on that breast (there was no breast, but some tissue always remains.)  They realized chemo doesn't work so well so they did radiation for 30 days.  She did have to take a break because the skin was so raw they could not make markers.  We were hopeful she was done and on her CT scan she had 2 weeks ago they found 2 spots on one lung and 1 spot on the other.  She had Ixempra (Ixabepilone) intravaneous on March 24 and on March 25 began taking the Xeloda (capecitabine) daily.  She is taking 2 pills 2 times a day.  I am scared beyond belief.  She has metaplastic breast cancer.  She went back to work on Thursday the 27th.  She and I actually love working.  I told her as long as she was working for herself and not for money, they company or any other reason - she should work.  So far she is queasy in the tummy and tired.  Her neuropathy is frustrating, but manageable.  She does however require meds to help her sleep or the neuropathy will keep her up all night.  She also gets achy muscles after a huge bout with the neuropathy.  It is like her muscles try very hard to control the nerves and they ache as if she has just done a muscle builder's workout.  I will keep you posted as much as I can.  It helps me to talk about it.  If only I could take this on instead of her.   Annette  ",
