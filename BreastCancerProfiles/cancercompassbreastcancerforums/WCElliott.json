    "Content": "A) I'm selling nothing.  I used to be Director of R&D for three biomedical companies, and I understand all too well how the Corporate Management spends it's R&D money - *Treatments* are profitable, *Cures* are less profitable, *Cures* that *can't* be patented are considered without financial merit - they don't get a dime to research their worth, regardless of their potential. B) Does Malignant Melanoma count?  I'm currently treating it with Curcumin + whatever I can think of to enhance its absorption into the bloodstream. C) \"Apoptosis\" IS the MAGIC BULLET for cancer cures.  It tells the cancerous cells to commit suicide, which they're supposed to do automatically, but usually some difficiency (e.g., Vitamin D3) prevents that from working.  Please note: Apoptosis isn't the same as killing a cancerous cell by poison, there's a pre-programmed cell-suicide mechanism in the cancerous cell that's supposed to kick-in whenever the cell acts abnormally.  That mechanism is called \"Apoptosis\".  Tumors, by their very nature, are generally lacking in sufficient oxygen and nutrients due to their rapid growth, which causes their mitochondria to shut-down.  It's the mitochondria that checks to see how many times the cell has divided (by counting the telomeres on the cell's DNA - one less for each division) and when the telomeres run out, the mitochondria signal \"apoptosis\" and the cell dies.  An hypoxic cell (like a tumor cell with insufficient blood supply due to its run-away division) has a mitochondrial malfunction preventing it from initiating \"apoptosis\", as it runs on Oxygen.  Cancer cells rely on an ancient metabolism based on our hypoxic ancestors, yeasts & molds, so they thrive once the dormant genes kick-in.  Grape Seed Extract, for reasons unclear at this point, re-start the mitochondria in Cancer Cells and they immediately trigger the \"Cell-Suicide\" mechanism we call \"apoptosis\".  Normal cells are unaffected, so you have *No Chemo side-effects*.    D) I have no vested interest in any product or company that makes or sells anything remotely related to either Grape Seed Extract or Curcumin (which is what I'm taking for my Melanoma - Google \"+melanoma +Curcumin\" and see how many scientific papers pop-up).  My motivations? I'm a Christian. Any further questions?  Feel free to contact me directly, or read my Facebook/Profile/Notes at: http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000925682048&s",
