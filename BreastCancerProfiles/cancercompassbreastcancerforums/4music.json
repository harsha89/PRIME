    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer (early stages) in 2004. I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years and have been on Aromasin for about 2 months. I thought I was doing pretty well physically until this summer (it has been terribly hot, especially without the estrogen!). I've noticed that my hair is getting finer and less in the last 2 months. If that is a result of the Aromasin, does anyone have the experience of it happening that quickly? Also I notice the tightness of my feet and legs as the day wears on. Does physical exercise help this(such as yoga or Pilates? My visual disturbances of migraines (minus the headaches) have returned that I once had when I was younger. Does a healthy dose of B vitamins help with the hair (Biotin) and the weight gain? I have asked many questions, but I would like to have some knowledge of your experiences before I approach my oncologist about my symptoms. Thanks! From a caring member of this community.",
