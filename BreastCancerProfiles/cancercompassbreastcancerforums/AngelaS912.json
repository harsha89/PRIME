    "Content": "Liz....I know it has been awhile since you posted this (2006) and you did a great job explaining the wound vac, but I have gone through something similar: lumpectomy, radiation, seroma (similar to abcess but not infected), open wound, wound vac and hyperbaric treatments for 6 months, another lumpectomy basically to remove the tissue damaged from radiation, then that incision opend and I am back on the wound vac.  I am overweight, but generally healthy other than the breast cancer and have not been able to find an explanation as to why I didn't heal after 6 months on the wound vac and why my incision after the last surgery didn't stay closed. I had them check for diabetes and tried going to a naturopath and take supplements that were supposed to help. I think my dr is out of ideas. I would be interested in the name of the specialist you saw when you were going through treatment.  I am wanting to obtain a 2nd opinion to be sure this is the right course of action.",
