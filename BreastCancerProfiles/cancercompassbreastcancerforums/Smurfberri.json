It started after 2 yrs on Anastrozole and quite itchy at times. It's affecting my groin area, inner thighs, my rectal area, under my breasts and incredibly my inner jaw area. The doctors are denying a possible side effect to the med. I've had a biopsy and was assured it was not cancerous but no one seems to know what to do with it. Hoping to get a resolution soon .",
