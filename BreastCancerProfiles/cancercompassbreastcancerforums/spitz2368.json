      "Content": "I'm very confused about what to do for my mom. The question is, do I try to tell my mom, to convince her that she does have cancer and that she needs to take care of it? This is such a long story but I will keep it to the point- or at least try. My mom has breast cancer. She also has borderline personality disorder, which in short, means that she can't see anyone's view but her own. She can become very bitter and mean and condescending towards others who do not see things her way. Its complicated for those who do not know what it is. Kind of like bi-polar disorder. My brother and I have dealt with this our whole lives. It can be very alarming as she become belligerent and speaks about crazy things. The big problem, besides the obvious cancer situation is that she is in complete denial about the cancer. And, its not like she is just afraid, its the disorder that is causing her to have delusional reasons for not treating her cancer. For instance: Doctors don't know what they are doing and that they all lie to get your money. Its a big conspiracy. We have seen 6 doctors who all agree she has cancer. She has a huge open wound that she wants treated, obviously, but can't because it's from the cancer that she doesn't believe she has. The last doctor was a surgeon who felt she could probably get the tumor out but that my mom would need after surgery treatment, like chemo or radiation. Well, my mom agrees to the tumor removal, but not to the treatment (cause she doesn't have cancer). So the doctor has explained that she needs time to speak to my mom's other doctors and to think about it because she has an ethical decision to make. BTW, my mom is very proud of the fact that she has warded off the cancer with her alternative treatments and feels that she needs to find a doctor that will practice more holistic treatments- which I don't have a problem with except at this point she is so advanced in the cancer that it may be too late. She hasn't warded off the cancer. This doctor took me aside and suggested that my brother and I try to take over her medical decision legally. She is the first doctor out of the six to suggest this. We have seen a social worker and I have shared my story with a physician's assistant who both think it would be an act of congress to do so. This doctor said a judge would take one look at the wound and commit my mom. And yes, she did use the word commit. So, do I respect her wishes? Or do I get aggressive? I've lived with her mental illness my whole life. She is mean. My relationship with her is distant and limited. I have only put in time with her because as a human being I can't stand the thought of her being alone through this, on some level, I do love her, she is my mom, but at the same time, I can't take her tantrums and its really difficult to stand by and watch her make one bad decision after another. I would love to hear from someone about what to do. ethically, what should I do? BTW: I do not have a prognosis from any doctor about the time she has left. She is very weak and can't breath well at all. She sleeps a lot and has a poor appetite. It has been suggested that most like a she will go into cardiac arrest at this point due to the lack of oxygen. But no doctor is telling us a time frame. Thanks for reading this.",
