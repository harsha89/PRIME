      "Content": "Hi Ann, I have taken essiac for my early breast cancer, and believe it was significantly helpful during chemo at helping me recover quickly between doses. I had A/C too - but no Taxol. I don't know if essiac had any impact on the cancer of course, but it was good to know I was trying other things besides what the conventional doctors recommended. That in itself was good for me. Acupuncture was also extremely helpful in restoring my immune system and energy levels after chemo. It is also good for relieving the side effects of hormone therapy. (Arimdex or Tamoxifen). I would very very careful of taking anything that might impact on your hormone-related treatment, ask before you take anything at all just in case. Meditation, tai chi and even things like massage have also been very helpful to me. Being kind to myself and taking time for me has probably been more helpful in my recovery than most of the supplements, etc I have tried. Hope this is of help to you. Wishing you all the very best with your treatment. You are being proactive and looking at the bigger picture and that is always good in my opinion. Wishing you a happy Christmas with your loved ones and some time away from thinking about your health if you can manage it (I was diagnosed at Christmas last year and know it can be an alienating experience). Love, Holly xxxx",

      "Content": "HI Brian, Thanks very much for your response. It is reassuring to know that others have experienced emotional side effects to chemo. I also have a very good prognosis and have coped extremely well right through all my previous treatments. That's why I have been so confused and frustrated by my sudden onset of depression and anxiety since starting chemo. But I am doing everything I can to rise above these problems and have seen significant improvements. Thank you to all who have replied, wishing you all the very best for your continued recovery, health and happiness. Love, Holly",

      "Content": "Hello all, I'm having A/C chemo for breast cancer at the moment and I am feeling really depressed and anxious all the time - a lot more so than when I had surgery or radiation therapy. Up until now I have been extremely positive and able to enjoy life almost as usual. Has anyone else experienced emotional reactions during chemo? I'm trying to work out whether the idea of cancer has finally hit me or if it is the drugs messing with my head. Love to hear from others on this topic. :) Holly",
