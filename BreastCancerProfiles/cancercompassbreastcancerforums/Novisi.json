      "Content": "Hi Velvet, Thanks very musch for your reply. I will take what you said on board. Yes everything is down to my sister's choice but it seems she's really going down each day. I don't think the Doctors have any hope for her at this point of time. She is bedridden and I am with her all the time. All I can do is to make this moment as special as it can be for both of us. Thanks so much. God Bless. Novisi.",

      "Content": "Hi Madge, Keep up the high spirit. My sister is at the moment in a very bad way and the doctors don't think she is going to make it but we are fighting and will not give up hope. Your story inspired me and I wish the same for my sister to get better.My sister is 59. She has Mets b. cancer. At the moment she cannot walk but all this happened only in December. she is in the hospital still receiving treatment and I pray and hope she gets through it no matter how long she have after. Its not easy to be told your sister has only a month. But our spirits are high. Is it ok for my sister to be on vitamins while on treatment? and can you suggest any that will help.? Thanks very much and keep going. Novisi.",
