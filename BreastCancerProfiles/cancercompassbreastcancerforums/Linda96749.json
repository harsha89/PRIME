      "Content": "I switched from arimidex to femera.  the arimidex made me too fatigued and was cutting off half my life.  I work full time, would come home and not be able to do anything--no cooking, nothing. had to go and lie down.  although I have joint pain with femera, I do not have the intense fatigue I had, at least, now I have a life at home.  I do get tired occasionally, but not as severly. talk to your doctor--there are other medicines out there that do the \"same\" thing--aromasin, femera....",

      "Content": "my cancer was stage 1; had lumpectomy done but the cancer was invasive so had to have masectomy done.  on the morning of my surgey, told my surgeon that I wanted to have the other side removed also--did not even want to think of having to go thru this again.....and did not want to be lop-sided. my surgeon had to battle it out with my insurance provider. but, I had a bi-lateral.  I knew I made the right decision when the pathology report said that I had pre-cancer in the other \"unaffected\" breast.  I just cleared my 3-year check up....so I go back to the oncologist in 6 months instead of every quarter.  I really, really like the fact that I do not have to wear a bra.  in fact, that is the only thing holding me back from reconstructive surgery. I just have to watch the style of clothes that I buy--and everything is designed to show cleavage....!!!! never had it with boobs, definitely don't have it now...after a while, no one even notices or cares. so I am bra free and I won't be a sagging!!! yeah. I just wear a padded bra if I have to go out on an occasion and want to wear a certain dress or blouse. I went thru chemo and am on femera. life if good--I am still here to harass my son, hug my grandchildren, and love my husband.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, in my experience, the worst is over.  the needle biopsy was the worst. the nurses I had were very understanding. and comforting; they gave me an ice pack and all to strap on.  the reason the dr said mine was so hard or painful is because my breast tissue was dense--like a 20 year old's--I am in my 50's--that did not make me feel any better. the other hard part was when they used the needle localization--again, it was because my breast tissue was so \"young\" after that, they knock you out for the surgery, so it was no problem for me.  there was not that much pain after that.  I also had a sentinal node biopsy, and was I surprised when I peed a beautiful blue. my cancer, though stage 1 had spread to the breast tissue but not the lymph nodes so I had a masectomy the following week.  the day of the surgery, I asked my surgeon to take off the other side too--I did not want to be lop sided, or want to have to face going thru a similar procedure again.  they had to scramble to get approval from the insurance company.  but, they did. I am glad I had the other side removed cause in the biopsy, they found pre-cancer already.  I am flat, and I go braless (yeah) that is the best part, and I can sleep on my stomach without being uncomfortable.  my husband just wants me to to be with him.  does not interfere with sex life at all ( I was small to begin with). after taking chemo A/C, my dr started me on Arimidex, but the fatigue was too much as I need to work full time.  So after two years, he switched me to Aromasin, which is not so fatiguing, but is not covered very well by my drug plan.  so now, he has me trying Femara cause he said it would be cheaper, and if the side effects are tolerable as Aromasin, cheaper is better. I know it is supposed to be for 5 years, but, if cancer can recurr, would this be a life time thing?  I am so glad that I can read the effects of these drugs, cause \"normal\" people cannot really understand the pain in the bones, and stuff.  I try to be \"normal\" and active, but I get tired--I look ok, and I can sure \"talk\" ok, but at least you, my sisters understand.  take care, all of you, let's just make the best of every day that we have--if we can complain, there is still life!   ",

      "Content": "thank you gay for responding so quickly. I too am holding down a full time job and trying to raise, or guide (or nag, as he puts it) my soon to be 15 year old son. Had him when I was 43...so I am kinda older and more tired. I am experimenting on the time that I take my aromasin. cause it makes me so edgy and snappy.--and that is hard when you are at work. I don't even like feeling like that when I am by myself. I will try it for a week at least, and if I feel that that the edginess is really one of the problems, then I will call my Onc and tell him that I am going back to arimidex. the fatigue only bothers me. and the bone aches only bothers me. I don't have to slash out at anyone. freddy kruger looks like he has a manicure the way I feel. I actually have to take anti-anxiety meds just to keep me on a even keel. 5 years, is it that long?",

      "Content": "glad I found you fighters! it has been two years since my double masectomy -- actual stage one cancer in right breast, but had the other one remove to have \"balance\". glad I did, they found precancer in the left side. Did four treatments with AC. and went on Arimidex. was on meds for about a year; complained to dr about fatigue, he suggested I stop for one month and see how I felt (felt sooo much better) could actually come home from work and cook dinner and wash dishes. Just visited Dr. and he gave me samples of Aromasin. So I entered \"arimidex vs aromasin\" in google search bar and found you. your postings and experinces have been very informative and helpful. at least I know I was not imagining my fatigue, and aches and pains. my question--took my first aromasin tablet yesterday, got a blinding headache centered at the base of the skull...has this happened to any of you? plan to take my pill again and see results. If headache is one of the side effects that I am going to get, I certainly cannot use this stuff as I have to work. Please share your side effects and solutions. I really want to increase my chances on not getting a recurrence. thank you linda",

I am more aware now, but will just have to see how it goes, after all, only 5 years.. so I think I have 4 years more to go. it is just so nice to know that I am not alone or was imagining all this. yahooooo",
