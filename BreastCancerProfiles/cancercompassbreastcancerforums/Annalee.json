    "Content": "I had AC treatment 4 yrs. ago for breast cancer. Last year, I was put on Femara for bone mets. A couple of weeks ago, I found out that I have liver mets. My oncologist recommended 3 chemo combos: Taxotere & Xeloda, Taxol & Gemzar or Taxotere & Navelbine. My oncologist says that any of these could produce a good response and to just pick a treatment. I was wondering what experiences others have had with these chemos either singly or as combos. Are there certain orders in which you have taken these chemos and achieved good responses? How does one truly know that both drugs have failed in a combo? Doesn't the doseage factor in? Thanks for your help! We are so confused and tired (and scared).",
