      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear about that.  My least favorite part of the journey was the periods of unknown.  My wife got a mamogrm at the age of 30 (in 2013) as recommended before we started to try to have kids.  (cancer runs in the family, but no brca gene).  They found calcification clusters in her right breast, proceded with biopsy, and fortunatly discovered she had stage 1 invasive ductal breast cancer, caught at very early stage of stage 1.  We went the most aggressive route, and proceeded with double mastectomy and breast reconstruction, and they did not find any in her lymph nodes.   Hang in there, easier said than done we know, but keep your head up.  We are all here (fighters, survivors, caregivers etc)! ",

      "Content": "My wife was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer at 30 in 2013, after she got a routine precautionary mamogram, the day before we were going to start trying to have kids.  Well, we've ridden quite the roller coaster since then, and we have a strong faith in God and Jesus Christ as our lord and savior.  That being said, we had a difficult time at first understanding why He would allow such a thing, but kept praying, knowing He has a bigger plan for us that we know.  Since her double mastectomy, breast reconstruction, and our emergency invitro fertizliation, we know one of many things God planned for her and I to be are supportors, advocates, caregivers, faithful prayers, for others out there in the middle of the scary unknown storm of cancer and recovery.  It was easy for me, as the caregiver, to tell my wife God has a plan, clearly we were blessed for reasons x, y, and z.... but it needed to originate from her, the cancer fighter, and survivor.  I just continued to support her, pray WITH her, out loud, every day, and tried my best not to tell her how she feel, and encourage her to be honest with me or anyeone with her feelings.  Several months later, she admitted that now many more positive things have come from this experience than negative, and God clearly has a plan for her at a young 31 year old breast cancer survivor.  God bless you and your mother.  Be there for her, clearly you are, and let her be scared, let her go through some denial, just don't leave her side... her mind and emotions are likely on a rollercoaster and sounds like playing some tricks on her self, fed by Daisy.  ",
