I'll look at my diet and clean it up, improve on taking my supplements and remember the words of my Naturopath, \"it may take 6 mos. to 2 yrs. to rebuild the cell's energy factories\".  I am currently using an easy detoxing supplement and a super-mushroom product to lighten my liver's body burden and boost my immune system...especially those Natural Killer cells!  I had Cytoxan and have learned that it leaves a chemical residue in my body.  It's a process.. but I would rather it be DONE!  Be gentle, listen to your body and look for ways that fit you to support and heal it.  If we had had a glass layer to observe what the chemo/radiation/surgeries did to our system we/I might be a little easier on myself.

Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! Hey there, I am 3 yrs. out from diagnosis for breast cancer.  My mammogram showed only microcalcifications; very tiny!  Biopsy showed malignancy.  The kicker is that I also had a 2cm. tumor that was \"accidentally\" removed w/ the lumpectomy for the  tiny microcals.  I never had an U/S before surgery and it was hard to detect the 2cm. mass via palpation due to dense breast tissue.  I might recommend an MRI, esp. if you are \"dense breast tissue\" too!  My follow-up now is a mammogram alternated w/ an MRI on my remaining breast every 3-6 mos.   Best to you, NurseKaren",
