    "Content": "hi caregiver, i am a lung cancer patient and my dad died of cancer as well. i have been fighting for the last 6 years with this, but i had some good shots for periods of time. My dad fought as well at age 58 but when there was no options left where it would help, he did not push himself. you do not want to be so sick from taking medicines that are told will not help whenyou have plans to make and conversations to deal with. Best route is to find out if any drug such  as avastin would help in any of the areas to sustain her , where she could get quality of life. i found from personal experinece that people hear the word cancer and they back off. The patient feels very isolated. You need to understand the options, so that your mom can talk to you about them.Make her feel that she is still part of the family and can discuss all. Anything you can find out for her is great as the patient is  so emtionally drained it seems you dont have the strength to do much of anything. i wish you and your mom courage and prayers",
