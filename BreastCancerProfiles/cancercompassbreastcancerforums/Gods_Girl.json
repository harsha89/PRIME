    "Content": "First of all PRAY!  God will give you the guidance you need.  You are not alone.  My mom has been dealing with breast cancer since 02.  She had radiation, that didnt help because she got it again and then it went to her sinus.  She did radiation again.  She is now going to Ni's Acupunture center who specializes in cancer.  They dont approve of radiation/chemo  but that is between you and God.  It wouldnt hurt to consult with Dr. Hai Shaw.  Blessings.",
