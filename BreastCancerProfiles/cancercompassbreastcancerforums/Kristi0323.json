    "Content": "I am 40 years old and on my 2nd mammogram in my life they found something and said I needed to come back for another mammogram. The lady taking the pics would not say what she thought it may be. A week later received a phone call that the mammogram had shown that I need to go see a surgeon for a second option. When I went to see the surgeon is when I found out I have a small cluster of very small microcalcifications . He said they are almost always begnign, but a small percentage it was the early stages of breast cancer and he recommended me having a biopsy immmediatley. So he never leaned one way or another on if he thought it was cancerous or not. Had the biopsy yesterday and now have to wait til next Thursday to find out the results.. anyone have any ideas if I should be worried?",
