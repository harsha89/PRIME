    "Content": "I can relate to the previous response.  My hair grew back very harsh and wiry, I also have 4 cowlicks, I never had one before. My hair is now very strong and grows quite fast. It is now 9 months since chemo and I have a haircut every 6 weeks.  I do like to keep it short however.  I have a few pics of my hair on my livespace. http://www.sheppey2007.spaces.live.com The problem I have is that the hair on my legs and armpits is incredibly strong and fast growing.  I also suffer very badly with ingrown hairs, so bad that I have had to have antibiotics to try and heal them.  They are mostly on my head and my arms. anyway the good thing is we are here for our hair to be a problem to us. cheers Jayne    ",
