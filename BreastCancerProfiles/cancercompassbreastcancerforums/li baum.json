    "Content": "It's about my mother, she has been diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2012. The cancer was in the initial stage, the node was removed and she got \"only\" radiotherapy. Now she had in February a painful \"bump\" between the index finger and metacarpal bones. No doctor could tell us anything about it, until a CT was done. Now, it was found that she had cysts in the bone. My mother has a photodynamic laser therapy at the Center \"erweiterte medizin\" in Frankfurt decided. Two months she was there in therapy. Now the cyst is not to be found in her hand now. We are very surprised and happy that photodynamic therapy worked so well.",
