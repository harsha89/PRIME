    "Content": "I have had stage 4 pancreatic cancer for 3 years. I am feeling pretty good, I have been tolerating chemo and the pain is controlled by oxycodone. I am getting triple chemo drugs, gemcitibine, Taxcotera, and xeloda. The last treatment caused alot of nausea so I got a prescription for zofran and the insurance would not cover it. The walgreen pharmacy said the cost of zofran is 1200. for a month (60)supply. The cost of these drugs have wiped me out financially.   ",
