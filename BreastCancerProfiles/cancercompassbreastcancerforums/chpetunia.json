    "Content": "I like an essential oil info site, \"Camp Wander.\" The site has remedies, beauty, and clean home green ideas and recipes.  There is an article for a radiation burn relief healing salve. http://campwander.com/2014/09/radiation-burn-relief-healing- If making your own is not your choice, go to the Camp Wander Shop.  I have used several salves and the lip balm and am very pleased.  Look at All Purpose Healing Salve, Dirty Salve, and Anti-age with Rose.  The first two would give you all that the radiation burn relief article calls for. Excellent quality at a fair price in my opinion.  A little salve spreads a long way. I'm using these salves and have good results.  I hope you will, too. Best Wishes, Christine",
