I had scans done in May and something showed up on the liver but, was told it was nothing. Now here I am stage IV and scared to death. I see doctor tomorrow to find out I guess what can be done if anything. Any one else with breast cancer that has metastasis to the liver? Would love to have someone to talk to about this. I hope this email finds you well. My mother has the same thing. I'm hoping that you can give me some insight on treatments that may have worked and those that did not.       Hi, I have the same situation with my mother as she has been on Avastin and Taxotere.  She does not know how much longer she can take it.  Is there any other treatment for this? Thanks, Ed",
