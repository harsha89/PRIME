I would love to exercise if I could... before the femara, and arimidex I biked, walked 20 miles a week, hiked.... I was very active.  Now its hard to work, I stand on my feet all day as a hairdresser.  I am comfortable with going off the medicine, everyone has to decide for themselves.  I have always been in tune with my body and now its telling me that its better to feel good and live life, than suffer with pain every day. I'm a 10 year survivor in Oct this year......I took Tamoxifin for 5 years and I'm taking Exemestane 25 mg.  I used to have the bone pain, but I found that exercise helped. I garden and don't watch TV.  You might try it.  I don't have bone pain anymore and I'm on my last bottle of Exemestane in my current clinical trial.  I don't know what my treatment will be once I finish this Phase III trial in August.   I did have bone pain for a couple of months but I have never allowed cancer to get me down.  I did Chemo/Radiation/Tamoxifin continued to work  and go to school.  The only problem I have encountered was with my need for life......my choices have led me to divorce a wonderful man and find another.  Hope I can stay happy and healthy......  ",
