      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear about your aunt. I also have breast cancer that has gone to my spine, ribs, pelvis, leg, but not brain. She must have had for a long time without knowing it to be that bad. Breast cancer tends to spread somewhere else in the body, especially bones. They should have checked for that in the begining. Unfortunately there is no cure for bone cancer at this time. But, keep the faith. They cannot tell you how long you have to live. I know because my son had a glioblastoma brain tumor, they gave him 9 months to live. He is 3 yrs out & cancer free. I have had radiation & will start zometa this month. Also take arimedex. My prognosis is 5 to 10 yrs. They come out with new stuff everyday. I will keep her in my prayers, try to be positive for her. Good luck.",

      "Content": "i also have breast cancer that has gone to my bones. My spine, pelvis, ribs, shoulder & leg. The radiation did help the back pain, reduced some compression on my spinal cord. have to take arimedex for 5 years & will start zometa next month, once a month for at least a year. My diagnosis is not good, however they come out with new treatments every day. So keep the faith. Dont know what the side effects are for zometa yet, the radiation caused nausea & fatigue. I notice a small amount of hair loss, but not significant right now. My son had a glioblastoma brain tumor 3 years ago, the dr. said he had 9 monthe to live, but we never gave up & he is 2 & a half years cancer free. Never let them tell you how long you have. they dont really know. Good luck.",
