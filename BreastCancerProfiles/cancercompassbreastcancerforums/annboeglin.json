      "Content": "I am 66yrs old and am recovering from triple heart bypass surgery. In Feb 2011, I started taking an arimidex. A year later I found out I had chronic luekemia. Two years ago I had pneumonia. My family does not have a history of heart disease and my profile does not match a patient for heart disease. I have never smoked. I have an ideal weight and live a very active and healthy lifestyle until now. I will fight to come back from this but I would be hard to convince that the mild heart attack and blockage in 3 arteries ( 98,97,83%) did not come from this drug. Maybe the reason I survived is to share this information with others. I would like to know if other women had these side effects.",

Had a left mastectomy in April 2015 with reconstruction on right Breast I was told I could not have radiation due to my autoimmune disease, Lupus, which I have had for over 25 yrs. so I get inflammation of joints, aches and pains, had to have knees replaced in 2012 Cuz I was bone on bone. Had a work injury in 2009 with my back. 2 compression fractures and 2 herniated discs with degenerative joint disease. With all of my health issues already, they want me to take arimidex. And by what I have read, it sounds like I don't want to take it.. I don't want my already health issues to get even worse by this medicine or anything else for that matter. What do I do? Any suggestions? I am Ann and 66yrs of age. I am recovering from triple heart bypass surgery with complications. I have been taking an Arimidex med since Feb 2011. I had a mastectomy of my left breast and reconstruction, no radiation or chemo. Genetically there is no heart disease in my family. I do not smoke, never did. Healthy life style, ideal weight, very active does not fit the profile for my heart problem. I t would be almost impossible to convince me that this arimidex drug did not cause the trauma I have been through. I am blessed that the mild heart attack did not take my life.",
