    "Content": "Hello, I am a graduate student conducting research on treatment breaks from cancer therapy. If you have had a break (missed a dose or an appointment, taken time off of treatment for personal reasons or because of difficulty tolerating side effects) from adjuvant therapy please participate in our anonymous survey that is available on-line.Â  To find out more about the study or to participate, visit the website below where you can select and read the consent form. In the consent form you will find the link to the survey. Thank you for your interest and help in improving care provided to cancer patients! Your participation is valuable and will aid in informing health care providers how to best tailor treatment to meet the needs of cancer patients and increase quality of life during therapy. http://directory.vancouver.wsu.edu/people/jill-gjerde/cancer",
