      "Content": "Hi Lesley, I am 60 and was diagnosed end of March. They can tell from the Ultra sound the approx size of the tumor. Mine was .8 cm. I opted for Limpectomy and sentinal node removal, which was done. My margins and nodes where clear so they staged me at 1A. They automatically send you to Radiologist. Depending on the stage of the tumor and at our age, little may be gained from radiation and a lot may be lost. Wait to get all reports. Ask for the OnxoDX testing, not that it means all that much, but it gives you a rate of recurrance. I have decided not to do any toxic treatments and am doing healthy modalities. Try to get your hands on Ty Bollingers \"Quest for the Cure\". It can be watched on You Tube and look into the Gerson Therapy. I have never felt better since I started to follow it, right after the surgery.",
