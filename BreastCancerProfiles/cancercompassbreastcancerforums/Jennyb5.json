    "Content": "Dear Fran, I am so sorry for all you are having to endure, not only with just the primary problem but the side effects as well. I am an RN who self studies cancer alternative treatments. I have read quite a bit about macrobiotics and healing of cancers. Also, there is a book out Recovery From Cancer by Elaine Nussbaum. She did not have breast cancer but endometrial cancer with mets. She was treated macrobiotically and is cancer free at this time. She went on to study nutrition and macrobiotics so she could help others. Last I read she is located in Orange or West Orange NJ. Also there is a MD in Syracuse NY. Her name is Sherry Rogers, she believes in healing through nutrition. I don't know if any of this will help you, I hope so. There is a center for macrobiotics located somewhere in Massachusetts - Brookline? I'm not sure, outside of Boston, I think. Best of luck to you. You are in my prayers.",
