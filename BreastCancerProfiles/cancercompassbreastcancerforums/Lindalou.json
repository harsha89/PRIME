      "Content": "Thank you , Thank you for your reply! My ultrasound tech, also called in the radiologist to feel the lump. They both could feel it easily but it didn't show up. I've spoken to my gyn and have an appt in a few weeks for another breast exam. If the lump is still there we will do a needle biopsy. You are exactly right to follow your instincts and I'm going to follow mine. Best of luck to you!!! Linda",

      "Content": "Thank you Bonnie! That is exactly what I have decided to do. I have an appt with my GYN in a few weeks and if the lump is still there he is going to send me to a surgeon for biopsy. Why would I wait for the lump to get bigger? Doesn't make any sense. THank you again for your message and I hope everything goes well for you. I will post an update once I find out for sure. Linda",

The more I think about that, the more insane it sounds! If they think it has the potential to get bigger then it has the potential to be cancer. Thank you all so much for your help. Linda",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm visiting from the Thyroid Cancer message board and have a question. Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated!",
