      "Content": "Kathy. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July. I had a bugling disc and a herniated disc prior to the diagnose. The still have lower back pain. I lift weights which seems to help and strengthen my core. It still flairs up. I go to a chiropractor for adjustments that also helps alot. I think when we have had cancer I mind immediately goes to it spreading. Be positive. Maybe it's just a bad mattresses causing it. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I'm with you. I was diagnosed June with stage 2 lobular breast cancer. I had the mascetomy on my left breast. I refused chemo, radiation and hormone therapy. I believe I am healed. I change my diet to no meat, dairy, or sugar. Cancer loves sugar. I do vitamin c IV's 3 times a week and take lots of supplements. God made our bodies so we can heal ourself but we have to take charge of changing our lives spiritual, emotionally and physically. I'm 59 years old. Three days after my surgery I was back in the treadmill, Im back to lifting weights and working out and feel increible. I know some people say go for the conventional medicine but that never resonated with me. I believe like you God is in control. God bless you and a lifetime of great health.",

She refused more chemo and She opt to go the VIT C IV route. She change her diet and takes supplements. She recently had a scan and the rumors are shrinking.

      "Content": "June I was diagnosed with stage 2 grade 3a breast cancer. I took my time and decided on a mascetomy on my left breast only. I refused chemo, radiation and hormone theraphy. In my opinion chemo was not an option. I chose to take control of my own health. I do VITAMIN C IV's 100 units 3 times a week. I eat only plant based diet. No meat, dairy, sugar. I take supplements, and do coffee enemas every day to keep my liver detox. I went to two different oncologist. They both wanted me to do chemo, radiation and hormone theraphy. When I refused they couldn't believe I wouldn't follow their advice. But I am blessed I have an alternative MD that told me not to do any of the things they suggested. I look and feel incredible. Please research. The Gerson Theraphy, the Budwig diet, the Hippocrates institute. Cancer is an immune disease. Heal your immune system, your emotional self and your physical self. You can heal yourself. Please don't let these Dr's force you into something that's bad for you. 87% of Drs polled said they would not do chemo but they want us to. Something is wrong. You have time make healthy decisions for your life.",

Approx 4 cm. doing the mascetomy it was lobular 10 cm x 6 cm. 2 years prior had a small lump and a biopsy they said it was benign. Lobular is hard to detect with The MRI did not Detect the large tumor either. They said my lymph looked fine but out of 12 removed 5 showed sign of cancer. Keep insisting they find the issue.",
