      "Content": "I am a 45 year old female and I had a 2cm size tumor only on the right side of the left breast with a 1cm tumor in the sentinel node. The doctors felt my chances of complete remission were excellant since it was an early detection situation. The surrounding tissue was negative for cancer cells after the lumpectomy. I had 4 cycles on AC despite my heart condition, some nausea and complete hair loss were the extent of my dicomfort. I then had 4 cycles of taxotere. I experienced some numbness in my hands and feet, but continued to work 40 hours a week. At the end all looked great. CA Markers were normal and my CT Scan and mamogram after 33 radiation treatments came back normal. That was in January 04. I completed my chemo and RT on day before Thanksgiving 03. In April 04, my CA Markers started to climb again. I had a PetScan. The results showed 2 new tumors in the lymph nodes located between my heart and lung inside the rib cage behind my left breast. These were not there before. The cancer is back. I have now had 11 weeks of Xeloda and Navelbeine to no avail and have just completed 1 cylce of Taxol and Carbo12. I know we are all different. I have been lucky not to have bad side effects or allergic reactions. I am not diabetic. I have been able to continue to work 40 hours a week. BUT my cancer has been chemo resistant to every treatment I've had and I moved up from a stage 2B to stage 4. I am considered incurable. Please don't give up. I haven't. Keep working with your doctor to find an answer. Don't risk the odds, because your friend is different and you are different. Hang in there. I will pray for you. A nurse friend who has cancer told Attitude is 90%, medicine is 10%. Together you get 100%. Find something to occupy your mind and keep thinking positive thoughts. Good Luck. teejay",

      "Content": "I am so glad to hear you toughed it out and finished your chemo treatments. No one can know how difficult it is unless they are in your shoes. I will pray that all was successful and your test results come back negative for any more cancer. I am still fighting the fight. My cancer has now gone chemo resistant for the fourth time and my cancer markers doubled. I had a CT scan the day before Thanksgiving in hopes that it is a false increase and that the two new tumors are shrinking. The last time this happened the tumors had doubled in size. The location prevents any additional radiation treatments or surgery to remove them. They are locate in the lymph nodes between my heart and left lung inside the chest cavity. As for the radiation, I continued to work fulltime as I am doing now. You have some specific rights under the American with Disabilities Act regarding your employment. They refer to reasonable accomodation for your treatment while working. Check into this. The radiation made me a little fatigued, like having been out in the sun all day. Just make sure you get plenty of quality rest and sleep at night. Also, drink lots of fluids, use aloe vera gel (available at WalMart)on the radiated areas and eat lots of protein and vegetables. I will continue to pray for you, but I think you will find this easier than your chemo treatments. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and it is NOT a train. Good Luck. Tracee",

      "Content": "I empathize with you sincerely. I too have stage IV breast cancer. Mine is slipping through the lymphnodes. Two additional tumors were found. I have been bouncing between chemotherapy treatments and radiation for two years now. NON STOP. Nutrition keeps me going along with my family and employer support. I work 40 hours a week in an Alzheimers facility. It helps my attitude about my cancer. They have no idea what is happening to them and watching the families struggle makes me appreciate life more each day. You see my problem is my cancer is chemotherapy resistant and progresses rapdily if left unchecked for a month. I have tried AC, Taxotere, Xeloda, Navelbeine, Taxol and Carbo12. I have been in a new protocol through Seattle Cancer Care injunction with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington Medical Center. I refuse to lose. I will keep on trying. Find something to keep your mind off the disease. Focus on living each precious day. It's how long we live, but how we live. Most of all Attitude is 90%. So get some attitude girl and get living. It is worth it. Remember you are not alone. Teejay",
