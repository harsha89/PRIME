      "Content": "I had been trying to find aromasin side effects and I came across several discussions here which confirmed what I had been experiencing.  I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer 3 years ago, had mastectomy and diep flap reconstruction on my right breast 3 months after diagnosis and 2 months after second opinion, and started taking tamoxifen right after I got my onco-type dx result (8% recurrence), without any chemo or radiation. Tamoxifen caused my liver functions to go up and after 2 years, my oncologist switched my medication to aromasin. As most of the discussions I read here, aromasin caused my limbs to ache terribly, combined with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome on both my hands, my life was almost unbearable until I had surgeries on both my hands for the CTS.  I still have pain in my feet, legs arms and hands because of aromasin and I am thinking everyday of the time when I have to stop taking the medication, will all this pain be gone?",

      "Content": "Hi, thanks for your message. I hope that your new lab results will be good. My oncologist asked me about whether I can live with the pains, she doesn't want to change aromasin yet if possible. Since I chose to have only hormone as my adjuvant therapy, I guess that I have to try to increase my tolerance. I will be 54 years old with 3 adult kids but 1 of them is autistic. I want to try to be well for them including my husband who has been walking this road with me from the beginning. Knowing that I am not alone in this, that others are also experiencing the same pain, has given me a little comfort. I wish you all the best, too.",
