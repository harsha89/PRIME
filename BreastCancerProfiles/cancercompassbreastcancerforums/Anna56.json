      "Content": "I was diagnosed in late April with stage 1 ACC of the breast.  Had surgery in early July, the margins were not clear so they did a second surgery in late July and found nothing else.  Lymph nodes were clear.  No radiation or chemo.  Makes me nervous... but that is what they recommended.  Anyone see a surgeon or oncologist with experience in ACC of the breast?  I saw there are couple of folks at MD Anderson and Dana Farber who are knowlegeable.  ",
