I have just finished Taxol & Herceptin, however will continue with strong doses of Herceptin until 09/07. They want to place me on Arimidex,and I have high quality of life values. I am almost 51 and I am very concerned about these bad side effects vs the real risk of really increasing my risk of long term survial. From what I am ready it is most likely going to make me, feel like 70 with the joint pain and bring back all the menoplause stuff, that has been long gone. Any body feeling like me?        I have been on Arimidex for 2 months now. I have pain in My upper leg hip area & down to My feet. It is so hard if I stoop down& try to get up, it's painful! I also have alot of pain in My upper arms. Taking off My shirts over My head is painful. I have Stomach pain. Of course the Arimidex put Me into Menopause, so........!!! Not sure if this the Arimidex or Menopause or maybe both, but, with this pain the Hot Flashes that I could read by & Weakness & Fatigue I wonder about taking it longterm.  But what other choices are there? They are all about the same right?",
