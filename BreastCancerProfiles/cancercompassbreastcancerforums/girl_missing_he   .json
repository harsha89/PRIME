    "Content": "Hello!  I am a 32 year old soldier in the army.  I just lost my mom on Wednesday October 3rd to Breast Cancer.  She was diagnosed back in 2004.  Unfortunately, it was missed prior to that.  When it was found, she had already advanced pretty far.  She had a masectomy and chemotherapy in 2005.  It quickly came back very agressively and she had more surgery to remove some of the cancer that had spread to her stomach.  The doctor's weren't confident in the success of that surgery.  She was on hormone therapy and could not try chemotherapy again because she was always so sick and weak.  She had so many problems as a result of the cancer and it's treatments that I cannot even begin to list them.  She had just turned 49 on Aug 23rd.  I miss my mom very much.  I have two children (girl,9 and boy, 5).  They were very close because my mother lived with us off and on for the past nine years and consistently for the past year and a half.  This is the third funeral for an immediate relative in the past 13 months for us.  My children are really trying to make sense of all of this.  My daughter does not want to go to the funeral.  I will be in another state (my mom's home).  I cannot force her to go nor leave her behind.  I cannot really grieve because I need to be strong for the children and make funeral arrangements.  I am in a battle rhythm right now and must stay focused.  I am afraid of the day when I finally breakdown. ",
