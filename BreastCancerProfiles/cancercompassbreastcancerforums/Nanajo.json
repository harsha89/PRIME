    "Content": "Hi hon, Its hard when you are going through treatment and you often feel far to ill to eat.  I have been down that road far to many times.  I know it is hard on your mom but try to get her to eat some chicken soup or other home made soups.  Try to get her to eat pudding and even baby food!  I often eat baby food when it becomes to bad.  If her throat is sore give her popsicles made from chicken broth or pudding. I will keep my fingers crossed.",
