I then had two acupuncture treatments. The pain in my jaw is gone now and my wrist/thumb are much improved. I would definitely recommend acupuncture. (Naturopath said eat no tomatoes, potatos or green pepper because they contribute to the pain.) I think I was developing ONJ and there are dozens of lawsuits around that! My oncologist wants me to try Aromasin now. That's how I found this board. I'm not sure if I'll take it... it sounds a lot like Femara.",

      "Content": "Hello again - I asked my RN/social worker if she knew of anyone and she recommended Dr. R. Not all naturopaths offer acupuncture but I asked Dr. R about massage and where I might get it and it sort of led naturally into discussion of acupuncture. Is there a social worker attached to your cancer clinic or hospital that might steer you to one? Maybe a nurse you trust? Not all allopaths are averse to other forms of treatment! LOL. You could even use the excuse of wanting nutrition counseling -- which is what I iniitially went to Dr. R for. I juice daily now and good nutrition has also helped me. I'm in the Twin Cities. Where are you? Good luck. to you. Keep me posted. MaryLynn",
