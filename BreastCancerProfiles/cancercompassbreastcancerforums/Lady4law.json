I discovered a lump about a month ago and had my mammo & ultra last week. The lump is (was) 3x4 cm. I will be seeing a sergeon this week for a biopsy. My breast feels far worse than last week, hurts, and the lump feels much larger. Today I noticed a pink, sort of marble-like color, to the underside of my breast. I am very frightened.",

HE wanted to perform the procedure this Friday but his nurse told me I would have to wait 3 weeks. My son, \u201chopefully in remission himself, was very upset with this nurse who continue to state, as long as you haven\u2019t had the biopsy or the results, there\u2019s no issue. She continues to stick her head in the sand as my son tried over and over again to say, \u201cwhat if this is IBC, and it could spread well your waiting and ignoring\u201d. He wants me to call another Dr in the morning and see if I can have by biopsy in a day or 2. The Dr explained needle and core biopsy but removal of the entire tumor, his preference. AM I wrong not to want to wait that 2-3 weeks?",

He recommended the complete removal as sometimes the needle biopsy will come back negative, giving a false hope of no cancer. He said the normal procedure is removal of the entire growth, then follow immediately with chemo. He wants to remove this ASAP, but his nurse will not book me for 3 weeks! The growth was the size of a golf ball on June 1, (day of mammo) and yesterday had MORE than doubled. The issue now is, he wants to do it this Friday, but his nurse was trying to make me wait 3 weeks. My husband called to speak to him this morning and the nurse will not allow them to talk. SHe just called a few minutes ago and said they coudl move it up to 2 weeks but cannot reach my PCP for a preop pysicial. Of all times for my doctor to be moving hewr office. Neither of her phone numbers old off or new, are working.",

I felt the area I was experiencing the pain and discovered a LARGE lump. The weekend seemed extremely long, waiting for my Doctors office to open Monday morning. My PCP said the lump is thumb size and ordered a mamo and ultrasound. The Mamo shows a large growth, but the ultrasound...nothing. I am now waiting to see the surgeon. It seems like a long wait as I cannot get in to see him until June 11th, and that appointment is only a consultation. I have no idea how long it will be before I have the biopsy. I am very scared as both my mother and grandmother died from breast cancer.",
