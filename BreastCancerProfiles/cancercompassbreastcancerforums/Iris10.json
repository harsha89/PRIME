      "Content": "I have been taking Arimidex since June 2004. Stiffness, some swelling,hot flashes (now come at regular intervals) and a battle against weight have been the worst side effects until the last 2-3 months. Itching has been added to the list. Because I also have hypothyroidism its hard to tell which is causing the itching. Oh, I was diagnosed with papillary breast cancer, no lymph node involvement; however treatment included partial mastectomy and 6 and 1/2 weeks radiaion therapy and adjunctive treatment with Arimidex (5 years). Keep the faith, Wish you well!! Iris10",
