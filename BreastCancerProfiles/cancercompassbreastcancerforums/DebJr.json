    "Content": "Hi there, Never on this board but saw your post. Am a regular on the Multiple Myeloma board (my dad has MM) but want to tell you, yes, of course there is hope for you. Don't throw in the towel. With MM, there if often 'bone involvement', especially in the later stages, very painful, etc. That particular cancer can make holes in your bones, so similar to mestastises and what you're referring to... One thing your oncologist will probably bring up (and if they don't, you should mention) - is the treatment of Aredia. It's not a chemo for the cancer, but a bone strengthener, pariticularly for situations like yours. It takes time, but it DOES work. My dad was in so much pain (b/c of the bone involvement) and over a course of time, he is now almost pain free... except for some occasionally stiffness/arthritis, etc. And he was 77 with Stage III MM & major bone involvment when diagnosed over two years ago, now he's almost 80 and still active, shops, drives, etc. They may also suggest Zometa (which is similar to Aredia). You usually get either about once a month, thru an IV infusion. It will help your bones. Don't give up... you will be fine. Deb  ",
