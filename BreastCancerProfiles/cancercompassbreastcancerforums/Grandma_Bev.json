      "Content": "I too am a survivor. I have 5 years of tamoxiffin in me, almost 1 year of Femara and now they've moved me on to Aromasin. I am 47 and have been diagnosed with arthiritis and now Osteo. I dont have any doubt that this has been caused by the meds. I literally cried all the time while on Femara. I could hardly move my neck the entire time I was taking it. The docs tried to get me to keep taking it, but enough is enough. It is hard to talk to someone about the pain if they aren't dealing with it too. I was so upset I went straight to the makers of Femera with my complaints. I told them they could at least be honest with patients who are asked to take the stuff. I dont call that quality of life. After 4 months of quitting the medicine and afraid to tell the doc I stopped, I finally mustered up the ocurage. I am now in my 2nd month of Aromasin and seem to be taking it much better. I have gained 35 ppounds and feel 20 years older. Maybe there's no meds out there that are pain free, but we are the only ones that can say if the pain can be tolerated. Good luck with finding the right meds and I hope you live a long painfree life. Your friend in Dayton, Ohio",

      "Content": "Hello Feeling Alone, My heart goes out to you. I'm an 11 year survivor and doing well. I was in your situation and I chose the lumpectomy instead of masesctomy. My cancer was located in the chest wall. They had to go in with a lead wire to get to it. My doctor said other patients that had their cancer located in the same area, got cancer again, even after the masectomy. I underwent 35 radiation treatments. Where is the lump located? There's also a P.E.T. scan they can run to see if theres any cancer cells movement in the nodes and anywhere else. Dont know if you've had one or not. The P.E.T. scan showed that my surgeon had gotten every floating microscopic cell when he decided how much tissue to take out along with the tumor. I'm tired and fat now, but I'm alive and try to count my blessing every day.   I hope you make the choices that are right for you..... I hope to hear back.   Beverly in Ohio      ",
