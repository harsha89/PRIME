      "Content": "If you had a biopsy done and the tissue was tested for estrogen and progesterone \"receptors\" and the result was negative, that means that you currently do not have estrogen or progestrone receptor-positive breast cancer cells. (Your doctor should really be answering your questions.) Estrogen and progesterone positive receptors means that your cancer therapy and adjuvant therapies will be targeted specifically at reducing those female hormones and estrogen receptors in your body so the estrogen receptor positive cancer cells will be starved. If you are \"negative\", that means that conventional chemo, not hormone-type treatments, would be recommended. Consider yourself lucky. Treatments that prevent cells from absorbing estrogen are very defeminizing, to say the least. Your tissue should also have been tested for HER2NEU, which also requires a targeted therapy. If that was not tested for, you should speak to your doctor and ask if the tissue is still available for further testing. This is a genetic thing, so if you have it your children may get cancer, and males are known to pass this gene on. Anyway, go search the internet for these specific topics and make sure you ask your doctor these questions. She should be your best resource; however, doctors aren't always totally \"available\" for patients' many questions and concerns.",

Incompetence!  Run, don't walk, to another institution and provider on Monday.  I still can't get over it.  There's always hope!  Are you kidding?  There are so many drugs available now as opposed to even 5 years ago.  Are your doctors  old?  Often, these\"old school\" oncologists aren't totally familiar with things happening today and they're trained to deal with breast cancer sufferers as if death is imminent.  It is't.  Please, I beg that you take my advice and either confront your doctors directly with a best friend or partner with you and tell them that you are not satisfied with their conclusion!  There's no spread, so you're not even metastatic, and the only thing is two armpit nodes.  I'm just sitting here and  shaking my head and knowing this attitude is why women keep dying from breast cancer. I've had metastatic disease with widespread metas since 1996.  I'm not alone.  We're still living. The worse thing you could do is just accept what they say. I think you said you had surgery.  Surgery, radiation and chemo is a very unusual approach to stage 2B.  I would be careful of over-treatment as many oncologists are winging it, take it from one who was over-treated and suffers the lasting effects.  Again, GETE ANOTHER OPINION for treatment.    ",

Is Arimidex the only drug you're taking? Did you tell your doctor that you have this problem? You might ask your doctor if you can suspend treatment for a week or two to see what happen s. A week or two off of a treatment never really hurt anybody. Do you really need estrogen suppression?

      "Content": "My message to you was cut off.  Your doctors won't tell you that you will become a man with Arimidex or any other estrogen-suppression cancer therapy because THEY aren't enduring trans-sexualizing cancer therapy.  Do you know that European female body builders use Arimidex to develop bigger muscles and to become less feminine?  No you don't.  When one gets Arimedex, one agrees to have their femaleness destroyed.  That's all I can say, as a former user of  it.   After three and a half years on Arimedex, I myself decided to stop the therapy, without my oncologists's input or consent.  And when I told him that I thought it was too damaging to me as a woman, he suggested yet another estrogen suppressing drug.  At that point, I said to myself, my life is my hands and I have to stop the pharmaceutical abuse. What would he know, anyway.  They go by what the pharmeceutical companies tell them, make no mistake. Estrogen suppression therapy is only appropriate for men with prostate disease.  Good luck to ladies who can't say, wait a minute, I want to get some  more information, I want a week or two to do research, I want two more opinions,  I only wish I knew in 1996 what I know  now. .  . ",

Information for both is available online.  Just type in the individual words and do a search.  I have it.  I use it.  Have cancer since 1996.  Additionally, it is a genetic marker which means you've inherited it through your mother or father.  It can be passed by males.  Does someone on either side have/had cancer?  Many targeted therapies are available for ER+ too, so don't be so down!  This stuff is highly treatable.  But since it is a genetic marker, your sisters or daughters should be screend as early as possible, and though it may not be covered by insurance, $150 for a mammo is well worth it.  National Cancer Institute also has lots of info; National Institutes of Health, etc.  Tykerb is made by GlaxoSmithKline; go there. ER+, Arimidex, made by AstraZeneca.  Herceptin is made by Genentech Bio-oncology.  Visit them too.  Ask the onco for a PET scan to rule out metastases.  Chest x-ray too.  BE WELL-INFORMED AND PROACTIVE ON YOUR OWN BEHALF!  All the best to you.",
