      "Content": "Dear Justjodi, Are you by any chance her2positive? If so there is a wonderful website where people exchange ideas and encouragement for this version of breast cancer mets, which is treated remarkedly by a monoclonal antibody called \"herceptin\", truly a miracle drug. If you are interested I can give you the site or just type in \"her2+\" to get on it. I also have BC mets to my lungs, stage IV. It was discovered a year ago when I had a heart attack and they did a CT scan in prep for heart surgery. It is my third \"go-round\" with cancer: BC first in 1985 with double mastectomy, nothing more, then met to my spine in 1990, treated only with tamoxifen. Now here it is again in my lungs, 3 small nodules, after all these years. I also have a very strong, positive outlook, with a lot of faith in God. I have also used positive mental imagry, and have changed to a Ph-balanced, vegitarian diet. I seem to be licking it again. The nodules have not grown in a year. I was on navelbine, herceptin and femara for 6 months, now only herceptin and femara. The only reactions I have had to chemo is a total loss of taste for sweets and my fingernails are in terrible shape. You sound like a fighter! Hang in there! Best wishes, Tricia--",

      "Content": "Thirdtimers, don't give up! I have almost completed 6 months of weekly chemo therapy using Herceptin and Navelbine, along with Femara. Since this is my third time with breast cancer and 2nd with stage IV, I didn't have a lot of hope, just a lot of faith. My x-ray last week showed the cancer mass in my left lung appears to be gone! I think the oncologist was as elated as I and my family! I first had cancer in 1985, had a double mastectomy, nothing else. It next showed up in two vertebra in my spine in 1990; I went on Tamoxifen for 5 years, still no chemo or radiation. Fourteen years passed. On June 30 of 2004 I had a heart attack, and in preparation for surgery, a CT scan showed the cancer had reoccurred in my left lung. It was too large for surgery and was her@positive. The heart surgery was postponed and I went on the chemo combo listed above. I also practice positive thinking, prayer, visualization and self-hypnosis. Another thing we did was to move from our home at 6000 feet in the Arizona mountains down to 1000 feet in Mesa, Arizona. I had to be on oxygen 24/7 after the heart attack at the high altitude. The Dr. was so surprised by the x-ray he doublechecked to make sure it was mine. He wants me to finish the chemo (one tomorrow and one next week) and then do a CT scan in another week. He suggested we may want to contine the herceptin every 3 weeks for awhile, but since it does affect the heart, I will check with the heart specialist on that. I will probably stay on the Femara. I just wanted to tell my survival story to give others hope and determination to stay the course. I need to add that I am 75 years young and definitely an optomist!",
