    "Content": "My hair was thick & had natural waves.  It still seems to have the waves but it has thinned out a lot, especially on top & growth is slow.  It's only been 6 monthis since I finished chemo, 1 month since I finished radiation & I am still taking 20 mg. of tamoxifen everyday for the next 5 years.  Everyday I wash my hair & find the short little 1\" pieces in the sink or tub.  The hair on top is not right at all.  It's hard to explain but it is like I have 1 small thicker spot on my bangs & the rest is thin.  I keep it combed to the side with the sides behind my ears.  I also find that I get cold all of the time now where I didn't use to.",
