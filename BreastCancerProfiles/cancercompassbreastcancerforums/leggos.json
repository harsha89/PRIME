      "Content": "BonnieeHi,              I have been on Zometa for about eight months, Having breast and mestastised cancer everywhere. I have not had the slightest trouble with it, or it's sister Arimidex. BUT I find out now it has damaged my Kidneys, One side of a drug cures a little, while the other side kills! What is the Answer I wish i knew! I hate drugs, My Doctor prescribed a blood pressure drug, but when i checked it on the Internet, It could have killed me, as it caused Angina and all sorts of terrible things. Luckily I didn't touch it. as I already have the disease,  We have to make our own decisions these days, best of luck Leggos",

      "Content": "Hi I am so ,Sorry your Twelve year old has to go through this, with you.    I have the same as you, I was diagnosed nearly a year ago now, I was on Arimadex then Aromasin, and Zometa which only damaged my Kidneys. I refused Chemo, couldn,t face the side affects must be a whimp. I had my first night of pain last night. up all night, toothache right through my body. couldn,t lie down, couldn,t stand up,I haven't eaten for over two Months, lost heaps, had blood transfusion. I am not good at handling any pain. feel like hitting something,When are they going to come up with a cure? how many thousands have to get this awful disease. they can go to the planets, make a terrible Bomb. Don't tell me they can't find a cure for this, I'ts all about the money How many business's revolve around us, who are suffering so much? makes me feel irritable and cranky, not the real me. sorry for the whinging but I am in pain. Hope your luck gets better soon love to you and yours Leggos",

Do not believe it I am doing fine I have never had any pain get on with living, don,t even think about the disease at all. The arimadex and aromasin have stopped working and the Oncologist stopped my Zometa injections. I refused Chemo, have read about all the suffering others go through with it. the only problem i have is I cannot eat I hate food and am losing weight, but my daughter Lol has bought out the health shop for me, I can,t take any of it as the taste is very distorted. I am now on no treatment and apart from not eating feel great. Hope this helps Leggos",

      "Content": " Hi Ipah123,                 I have the same diagnosis, as you Breast Cancer spread through to my hips neck,  skull, spine,ankles,shoulders femur pelvis,  , You name it i have it also the Zometa has damaged my kidneys, I take Arimidex, and get Zometa injections to strengthen my bones, once a month. Now I have been told i have kidney trouble caused by the Zometa,what else can we do? one thing helps another kills. I am afraid it is our fate and we cannot change it. I suffer no pain as yet, but i am holding my breathe in terror about what is inevitable to come. You get little understanding at this stage believe me all I hear is and i quote: You are on Qol what can we do for you .qol is quality of life to help you with pain and suffering . towards the end,leaves me feeling very isolated and lonely. As we are not dead yet. I am sorry to be so blunt, but that is the horrible truth of this disgusting and Evil disease. I do wish you well, I was a total optimist, but i still have the rotten disease, I do keep busy while i still can, but I was given a paralyzed face as well as if the Cancer isn,t enough to contend with. I hope you can come up with something to beat it, let me know if you do love too you Leggos ",
