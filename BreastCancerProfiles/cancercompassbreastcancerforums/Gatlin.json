      "Content": "I had the spacers put in when  I had the mastectomy and I would recommend that. Also, if you  will be taking chemo , I would have  the chemo port put in. I fussed about the port but it was a life saver. You will get very tired of being stuck. Let me know what your treatments will be. I might can help you know what to expect.      I am now  cancer free and very happy. I have been painting my daughter's apartment for college, but it was a year of personal, mental, and physical struggle.  I am not sure if  my insurance will pay. DO not worry about that. You will learn to live for now. We are not guranteed tomorrow . Get those new boobs. We  must look good and normal in our clothes. Buy a sexy low cut dress and hang it in your closet. They will not feel like your boobs will but they will be a part of you. Nothing is as good as GOd's creation, but plastic surgeons are really good at what they do. You will be amazed. I looked at the things they give you to put in your bra and they were heavy and uncomfortable. You are beautiful on the inside and the people that love you will still love you. The ones that do not --need to be somewhere else!           ",

      "Content": " Hi! Last May28, 2006 , I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was attached to my nipple so saving the breast was not an option.  I had both breat removed and reconstruction. I could not have the nipple reconstruction because of thin skin.  I do not regret either decision.  IF you have only one breast removed, you will have to deal with the worry of it coming back in the other side and your breast will not both look the same. The silcone gel implants are the way to go. DO not choose saline.  Yes, it is painful. Take a pain pill before you go for fill-ups. It will hurt for about 36 hours and then it will feel better. It is worth it. You can wear normal clothes and feel more like you. Read as much as you can! I am so sorry for your pain. It is something you will not forget, but you will move on and survive. It will make you a very strong woman. My grandmother and great-grandmother both died of breast cancer. It took me a long time to realize that having cancer is not always a death sentence. I am sorry for the loss of your father. My uncle is terminally ill now with throat cancer .  I cried a lot and I prayed a lot.             On 7/29/2007 Juanaboo wrote: I was just told I have BC and I am reeling because I just lost my dad if February to Esophageal Cancer which was his third type of cance. (colon and Hodgkins disease previousley all seperate times). My dad was 56. I am 36 and still morning him and just reallly can't believe that I, (1) have breast cancer. (2) they want to take my breast and (3) want me to consider having my ovaries removed. I have researched so much online that I am overflowing with info so now I need some survivors to tell me its not so bad losing your breast. That the reconstruction immediatly is going to help. So how bad is the pain of the R.S. and how bad is Chemo.  ",

Be careful about who you pick to do it. The skin graft sounded really painful and my doctor felt that it would be too risky becasue of my thin skin.  ",

I am pleased with my reconstruction. The stretching was painful for the first 24 hours, but it was worth it. Good luck!      ",

My family insisted.  I had heard so many horror stories. It is hard but it will improve your odds.My heart aches for you. I wish that no one would ever have to go through chemo!  My treatment was one time every three weeks. I felt really bad for a week then the next two weeks were not that bad. Get lots of rest! I worked and it was tough.  The hardest part for me was being bald, but my friends bought me beautiful scarves and hats. All of the wigs looked bad on me and it made me feel \"fake\". I have fake boobs now, but I could not handle the fake hair!  Whatever decisison you make, I wish you the best. Now, my hair is curly! My hair would not even hold a curl before chemo.       ",
