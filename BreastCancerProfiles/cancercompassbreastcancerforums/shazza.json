      "Content": "Hi Tracie Have just read your message regarding your mum.  My sister was diagnosed with secondary bone cancer last in the last 10 days.  Her primary cancer was breast for which she was treated with chemo and radiation.  She noticed a pain in her breastbone right on the spot where she had the radiation.  She felt like there was something moving inside the bone.  When she had chemo she had a line put into her sternum and she wondered if part of that had been left inside as that was the sort of feeling she was getting.  Unfortunately that was not the case and we are now waiting to see the oncologist and to see what treatment she will have to have.  It is very scary as my dad had secondary bone cancer and we watched him suffer before he passed away.  I hope you can get some answers from the bone scan.  My thoughts and prayers are with you. Kind regards shazza   ",

      "Content": "Hi Karen Thank you for taking the time to write to me.  It is very kind of you and much appreciated especially as you are fighting your own battle with this horrible disease.  We will know exactly what we are up against when she sees her oncologist on the 8th of August.  Sandra wants to wait as I think she wants to delay the verdict.  Her GP told her that the result of the bone scan was secondary bone cancer so presume it is not back in the breast.  It is right on the sternum where she had the origianal radiation treatment for the primary breast cancer.  She also underwent chemo.  For me I will do anything that I can to help her. My thoughts are with you, and I hope you will be cured of your disease. warmest regards   cheryl",

      "Content": "Hi I am writing from NZ.  My sister has been diagnosed with secondary bone cancer. Her primary site was in her breast 7 years ago,.  This was treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but now it has returned. She is unable to see her oncologist for another three weeks but has been told that it is unlikely that she can have radiation treatment again as you cannot have radiation to the same place twice.  Can anyone give me any information on this.  Is there anyone that has had radiation in the same place twice.  I eagerly await any replies. Thank you.   ",
