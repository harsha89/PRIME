I was forced to take a government insurance that has limitations. Our insurances won't pay for hyperbaric treatment. I'm on my third hospital for oncologists and have done a lot of research to find a doctor. We have to pay out of pocket for natural treatments here. I don't have the time, money, or energy left to chase around all these natural treatments and I can't afford to go to another country for help. Keep trying with the Doctors, also look in to clinical trials (immune based)",

And I'm not even going to depress myself by looking into more therapies I can't afford. I'm already considering a second job and what good is working around the clock and losing sleep trying to afford more stuff that's not helping? Have you asked the oncologists about the drug, if they haven't given them then you could ask for them ''off label'' or see if your family GP will give them to you. If that gets nowhere then you might wish to change your oncologists/GP. Also clinical trials might be helpful too. You should see a registered dietitian or nutritionists with experience in a calorie restricted ketogenic diet (its high in sat fat and low in protien & carbs) and look in to Hyperbaric Oxygen treatment. Also a web search might be able to find a hospital that will perform one of those treatments (like PDT) or ask your oncologists for a referral. This might be of some help but i live in the UK and don't know how the system is set up in the US",

      "Content": "You should look in to a vegan calorie restricted ketogenic diet with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose and possibly Hydroxycitric acid. A water fast is done for a week and then you start eating a high fat diet with low to medium protein, no sugar and low carbs (you need to watch what fruit & veg you eat as well). It takes 3-5 weeks before your healthy cells switch to using fat for energy, the cancerous ones can't and this puts them under stress, it should slow down or even stop the cells growing and is also anti-angiogenic. 2-Deoxy glucose is given as the cancerous cells take this up but can't metabolize (use) it for energy and this will help slowly kill them. Also this is used with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (3 times a week) which causes free radicals which in turn kills the cells as they can't deal with them. Also you should look in to cryoablation, hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy and irreversible electroporation. Also certain kinds of interleukin, delta inhibitors and/or interferon can help too. You should also look in to certain immune theapies like Dendritic Cells & GcMAF. GcMAF should help, but you should be careful if the tumor is blocking/near any major veins/arteries and/or the cancer has spread to the brain/liver. The reason for this is because it might cause initial swelling, if this is the case then you should start at a reduced dose. Also you would need to take up to 10,000IU of Vit D3 daily (possibly even more depending on your blood level, ask for a 25(OH)D test). The other side effects might include flu like symptoms (fatigue, fever and/or headache etc). Also a nagalase blood tests monitors how effective this and other treatments are and should be used along side other tests the oncologist recommends (its claimed the test is more sensitive than others and only when it goes below 0.65 can you be sure your cancer free). Its ideally taken twice a week and injected intravenously and intramuscularly (both should be done by a health care professional).",
