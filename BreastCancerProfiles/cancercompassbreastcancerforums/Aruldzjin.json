      "Content": "I have to say I agree. I was diagnosed in Mar 04 with multiple metastatic melanoma. I was give a prognosis of 0-2% chance of surviving 5 years with treatements. However, I decided to go ahead and take Chemo. I'm only 36, and didn't feel ready to give up just yet (not that you are giving up). My first 3 months were a very tough combination of Cisplatin and several other drugs. My blood counts were low, I suffered every side effect of each one of the medicines given. At the end of 3 months there was no change in my condition aside from the fact that I finally just wanted to die and get it overwith. Then my oncologist recommended changing the style of chemotherapy I was undergoing. We went to a high dose Interleukin-2 program. Since then (and I'm going to my third round next week) the inoperable growths in my lymph nodes have shown respectively a 30-50% decrease in size. It is actually working this time. Best part is the only side effects I've shown so far is flu-like symptoms during the week I'm in the hospital. Not much help on your question about refusing chemotherapy and working with nutrition to give you a better quality of life. That is a choice you have to make, and no one can stop you from doing what you feel is best for you. Just when I was about to give up and refuse treatment, we found another course to take it and it has been working wonders. So I guess my answer would be yes, quality is infinitely better than quantity. But if a different form of treatment would give you both, why refuse it?",

      "Content": "I know by now you've read more than your share of information on different types of cancers, treatements and therapies and nutrition etc. One of the BIGGEST factors in my decision to undergo treatment was two books that I discovered early on after I was diagnosed. I wish I could remember the authors names, the titles alone should be able to be located by any book store. I was fortunate enough to find both of them at the local public library. The main thing I gained from reading both of them is that NO ONE can tell you what to do. If your chemotherapy is making it that much worse, it's your right to say NO. Of course under my old treatment, no one would let me say no, but I'm glad they didn't. I go back in for my next round of the Interlukin-2 on Monday. I have about 15 people with different prayer lasts that you've been added to. I'm spiritual if not religous. But you do whats right for you. There's No Place Like HOPE From This Moment On Both books were highly inspirational, ever easy to read since they are only one or two paragraphs at a time. daily meditations and such. Rather expensive books so I recommend the library first.",

      "Content": "Dear Paulette: I have read your message, and can sympathize with your situation all too well. I myself was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2000. After undergoing the Whipple procedure followed by a long hospital stay and chemo and radiation treatments, and getting fairly ill, I decided to stop. In 2002, there was a new treatment of chemo called gemcitabine. (Gemzar). I had no ill affects because of this chemo. I do not advise the radiation that all doctors seem to want to give. I had to stop taking the gemzar treatments in Sept. of 2004 because my bone marrow was saturated with the chemo. My tumor marker was well over 1000 in 2002 before I started and at the time that I had to stop, my tumor marker was near normal (33). Don't get me wrong, I have said my share of prayers continuously, but I feel that before you give up on the treatments, you should look into this type of chemo. I have grandchildren myself that I couldn't be around when my blood counts were low. If you are going to the right doctors, there is something out there to help raise your white blood count, and there is Aranesp(?) for your red blood count to prevent the anemia. I never lost my hair with this treatment, and even though for the first day or two I was tired, I was still able to have a quality of life. My pancreatic cancer (primary cancer) unfortunately has spread to 3 secondary cancers: lung, liver and bone. I am glad to state that I among the few who have survived this long with pancreatic cancer, however, now there is not much that can be done. My only advice would be not to give up hope. You have 3 grandchildren that you need to live for. I myself am 55 and can understand the \"hopelessness\" you are feeling. Please remember that God is with you, continue your prayers, watch your diet and please ask your doctor about the possibility of having the gemzar treatments. My doctor states that because I was on the gemzar for so long, that these new cancer cells have found a way to bypass the chemo. I am heading to Fox Chase for another opinion. I will add you to my prayers, and God willing, you will get the right treatment and get well. By the way, just as a side note, my cancer has come back in the areas that were treated with radiation! Good luck and may God bless and hold you close! Yours in prayers, Marsha.",
