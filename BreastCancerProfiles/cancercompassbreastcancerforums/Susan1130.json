    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this site but taking a leap of faith.My mom died of breast cancer 27 years ago.  I have the genetic mutation.  I had DCIS in my right breast 10 years ago - followed by a lumpectomy and 7 weeks of radiation.  10 years later I have what they thought was DCIS but is early invasive breast cancer.  i had a double mastectomy 3 weeks ago with immediate reconstruction - but i feel like i am totally out of touch with the \"real world\" whatever that is..I simply dont care.  I'm seeing a therapist but.......  My husband is loving and so supportive and I know i am not giving him what he is giving me.  Has anyone gone through anything like this?  I had a colon resection last year so I can't have chemo and I feel now like this disease will always hang over me. ",
