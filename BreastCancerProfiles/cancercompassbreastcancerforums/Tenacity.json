      "Content": "Ladies, please forgive the daughter of a pancreatic cancer sufferer hijacking your thread, but your determination to research the hell out of ALL treatment options and weather the protocol paralysis and convential treatment stazi really inspired me. I'm that advocate I feel grief that other cancer sufferers don't have and I've led Mum to nanoknife as an addition to her conventional treatment.  It's usually only done palliatively, but given aggressive chemo hasn't helped (no spread, but minor local progression) and chemo/rad combination booked to follow is going to roast her innards for only 20-30% chance of help I persuaded her to look elsewhere.  The reaction from existing oncologist and surgeon, both of whom we trusted thoroughly has been quite aggressively anti.  My mum is 68 and one of only 10-20% PC sufferers with a chance of surgery - a very slim chance.  As someone else said.  She doesn't want to wait until this has spread during administration of \"best available\" chemo/rad or after massive abdo surgery, THEN be offered something that can help without doing lasting harm.  YES it's not been in large trials, YES it's not approved for NHS treatment, YES very few PC suffers in the UK have had it, but if no-one tries, no-one will! She's also embraced a holistic approach to her general health with a lovely old local doctor keeping an eye on top to toe wellbeing while onco types tunnel vision on her tumour. She is amazing and still up for trying this first, but it's shameful that she is having medical support withheld as a result. Rant over and I it is great to hear of the positive outcomes you strong woment have obtained.  I'll just leave you with something I finally managed to put into words about this.  I suspect it may strike a cord:   When rules, policies, protocols and procedures are for the good of the majority they should be upheld UNLESS there is no tolerance for individual exceptions. Exceptions are the seeds of evolution. Exceptions are how individuals carve a better future for the majority. Standing alone is hard and people will try to force you back to the pre-approved path, but stand strong, balance your risks and as long as you do no harm to others, fight for yourself. Your risk may benefit many others who follow. Your apathy will harm no-one but you. Hugs and positive cancer fighting vibes to all.   Sarah",

      "Content": "Thank you for that reply, The choice to fore go standard treatment is tough with pancreatic cancer as it is so aggressive and local spread can quickly cause acute pain and extreme digestive problems not to mention mets in the liver, lung, peritoneal cavity and elsewhere. She now has a situation where the very best surgeons say they won't operate without chemorad.  A tough one, but trying to find an enlightented surgeon somewhere who will reserve judgement until post nanoknife scans are in. I am delighted to hear your story and applaud your brave choices.  Your example will hopefully lead to better research into immunological and systemic treatments that support our own defenses rather than attack them!

      "Content": "Just touching base to say final course of combination chemo FOLFIRINOX started for my Mum. Travel sorted for the Nanoknife (Irriversable Electroporation or IRE) treatment on the 18th december.  The distinction between this treatment and Laser or targetted radiotherapy (cyberknife) is that it doesn't cause heat damage.  Very short high intensity electrical pulses are delivered via probes placed around the perimeter of primary tumours or mets.  Microscopic holes are made in cells and that causes apoptosis (cell death by disrupting ability of cell to maintain mollecular structure so the body culls them).  This is particularly helpful for cancers like prostate or pancreatic where tumours are frequently close to other major systems, organs or blood vessels.  That's why it's a blessing to have found it for my mum as her tumour is partially encasing some major veins and minor arteries, but creeping closer to the big daddy SMA artery that supplies most blood to the upper abdomen.  SMA involvment = no chance of an op. Procedure can be done laporascopically or during open surgery.  Mum's is the former.  For more on this as an evolving treatment see info from Louisville hospital . Dr Martin there in the US is one of the foremost experts on this and for more on what it is and how it works have a trip over to the pancreatic cancer message board.  The thread on nanoknife/IRE is one of the most active there. We decided nailing most of the cancer to give her body a fighting chance before trying CRT was the better way round to do this.  As far as I know this has never before been tried on someone with a chance of PC surgery for fear of derailling proven (protocol) treatments. Perhaps her example will help others down the line.  Regardless ofthe outcome it adds to the store of knowledge for those who will follow. For something that feels like a no-brainer for us, it hasn't half set lots of cats amoungst lots of pigeons this side of the pond! Sarah  ",
