I'm in Indianapolis Indiana and am going to the St Francis Breast Center. They have a very large Cancer Center. I don't have any friends to go with me and my family won't come. So I'm going into this alone and it's making it scary too. I did find out from my doctor that both my breasts feel very 'nodular' is what she called it. She did reassure me that being so small chested they have special plates to help the machine really see things well. So she said the mammogram was definitely 100% needed. If I do have cancer I will be traveling and finding a large cancer center with very good doctors. I'm just so nervous and worried and trying to make plans just in case. Plan for the worst and hope for the best Do you have a family doctor that you can confide in and ask for his advice, or is this your family doctor that you are referring to in your note. I have an excellent OBGY at the cancer center where I am an outpatient. You might also be able to find some assistance from the actual breast center, before you go in,you could ask if there is someone who can help explain what you can expect, and go over the possible tests, maybe ultrasound might be easier on you since they can see more than on the Mammogram, and you are small breasted and this is your first one. I have dense breasts but this determined after I had my first mammogram. Good luck you are being very strong. My prayers are with you. My Family Doctor is who haas referred me. She was really sweet and told me that the cancer center is really good. I think they said I would have an ultrasound after the mammogram. They said any other tests they want/need to do will be done that way and pretty much I will leave Friday knowing if it's cancer or not. I will call the breast center tomorrow and see if anyone could talk to me about this more. I think that's a good idea! thank you so so much for all your help!",

Hopefully they'll get me in next week for the MRI and find out what's in my boob once and for all! Anyone had a breast MRI?When I was around your age, my mammogram showed something in my breast. My GP said he felt certain it was only calcium crystals but they cut me open to be sure. He was right. I have a friend who just turned 68. Her mammagram showed a large mass. (6 weeks ago). They did further testing and she does not have cancer. Hopefully, that is what yours will be. Be happy they are testing. Not knowing I had anything, I went in for a regular physical. My Doc. Of the time listened to my heart and took my blood pressure. So, I said \"aren't you going to do a breast exam?\". He was shocked that I wanted one. He did a very cursory exam. I go for regular mammograms. My doctor should have caught what my mammogram missed. By the time I found it, my surgeon said the lump was there for somewhere between 3 - 5 years!! If you do not have confidence in your facility then definitely go elsewhere. There must be someone on here who lives near you that is very happy with their treatments and their Oncologist. I cannot help you. I live in Canada. I'll be thinking of you and praying for you. God Bless. Thank you for sharing this with me about the crystals and yourself and your friend. I'm definitely glad they are testing. I just hate that I have to wait until the MRI. If this is something I want to know and start getting it treated. After my MRI I will make sure to get a 2nd opinion with my films even if they think it's nothing just to make sure.",

Hello..proud of you that you went to have the examinations. I have had several ultrasounds on my remaining left breast, also at the 3:00 location, (dense tissue) the radiologist indicated the first time that sometimes because the breast tissue is very dense it sometimes overlays on itself, they didn't find anything. This last August they took another ultrasound, this time they found what the radiologist said was a very itty bitty cyst, it is not cancer, but they will follow up in six months, because I have had cancer twice. In reading what you have posted,  what I understand is that they have NOT found a mass, solid or cystic lesion, no adenopathy, and no abnormal liquid collection. You obviously have dense breast tissue like so many of us, and I have never had an MRI so I have no opinion, but because they are seeing something they don't understand they have recommended the MRI, if you are not happy with this recommendation, get all of your films and take it to another oncologist, that is what i would do..God bless you big Hug being sent to you~Stay strong and focused. You can also google all the terms to see the explanation of what they all mean. Thank you! I will get the MRI and depending on what they say then I'll get my films and have it checked out by another oncologist just to be sure it's really nothing (if that's what they say after this one) I just want to be SURE and not go back in a year and discover something has spread.",
