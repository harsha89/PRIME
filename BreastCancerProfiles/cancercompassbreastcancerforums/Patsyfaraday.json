      "Content": "I've stopped taking aromatase inhibitors. They were killing me. I was exhausted. No amount of sleep helped. My body felt like it was stuffed with cotton. I questioned my ability to go on. I lived on the sofa. Depressed? Oh man! And I haven't even started talking about the pain. All of my joints were inflammed. I used to be a runner. These drug have trashed my right knee. These drugs are evil on some level that is yet to be quantified. My body was telling me to stop. I really thought I was dying. And cognitively they really impacted me as well. I'm an internal medicine nurse practitioner. I need my brain. I've been off of AIs now for two weeks and I feel alive again. I love life again. Sincerely, Patsy",

      "Content": "Nothing in my life Was not negatively impacted by aromatase inhibitors. I finally just quit. I feel so much better. I have my life back. I don't know if it will be shorter but I do know that it will be better. These drugs are new. Who knows what the long term effects are. Getting well and feeling that beat up were mutually exclusive. My entire body was inflammed. I would not be able to continue work, support myself and take those drugs. My bargain will be to get back to my ideal body weight and run everyday instead of taking aromatase inhibitors. These drugs have huge quality of life consequences. I can't do it anymore! Good luck to all of my sisters that are a part of this struggle!--quote------ On 3/12/2009 sarahruth66 wrote: Thank you so much for your response.  It is somewhat comforting to know someone else can relate to the problems I am having.  I stopped because my oncologist said I had to take actonol with the femara for calcium and mineral loss.   I took one a week for 3 weeks and thought I was going to die.  It felt lke I had ground glass between all my joints and nothng wouold help.  Couldn't walk and just laid in bed.  Only then did I start reaearching the side effects of both drugs.  I had thought that at 65 I had arthritis,etc.  I am considerably better now that I am off femara.  I would like to be able to walk normally again without pain.  I can not stand up straight.  I am very hunched over but MRI doesn't indicate stenosis.  I have been off femara now for 10 months.I have tried physical therapy, acupucture, water aerobics, chiropractors, massage therapy along with various meds.  Advil (800 mg twice a day) is the only thing so far that helps a little.I had a lumpectomy in 12/99 for invasive lobular breast cancer.  The tumor was very small and all nodes and tissue were negative.  I had radiation, but not chemotherapy.   My oncologist told me 2 years ago that I could stop femara, but I continued it because my insurance paid for it and I thought it would give me more protection.  How I wil I had listened to my oncologist.  She never mentioned side effects.  But then they seldom do. The pain I have in hips and knees is bilateral.  I have wondered if there is natural remedy or herb that would help.  I am at a loss to know what to do next.  I have wondered if there is any safe  estrogen replacement.  I also had a hysterectomy15 months ago.  That was elective.Again, thank you for your reply, and I hope your pain lessens too.  I would be interested to know what your oncologist recommends.    Sarahruth   -----end quote------",
