    "Content": "Differentiating breast cancer, esp. ER+ breast cancer from other types of cancers, is it is related to hormonal levels or activities.  Perhaps we should ask why, since 1995, there is only a 30-month quality of life human trial, not an actual treatment enhancement trial combining Avemar with Tamoxifen in human. When the study didn't record those patients survival rate or cancer return rate during the trial.  After such quality of life trial, why the researchers went back from human to cells and animal models and publcished those data as new as 2007.   If you dig into the function of Avemar, it in fact has the behavior of Estragen.  In an Avemar article using one type of breast cancer cell, it has claimed the increased activity of estragen in breast cancer cells when using Avemar alone, but decresed activity when using tamoxifen alone. Thus, Avemar and tamoxifen has opposit effect on breast cancer cells.  However,  the aritcle further claimed that the activity of the breast cancer cell was further decreased when combined Avemar and tamoxifen. This is rather unusual findings to me, and I wish the article gave a better scientific explanation on mechanism of action.  Furthermore, one possible reason for Avemar to improve quality of life in breast cancer patients is the increase in estragen level, which is the opposite of what tamoxifen is trying to to do, i.e. to block the estragen receptors and decrease estragen activities.  Any side effect, such as joint pain, insomnia ect.when taking tomoxifen, is due to the blockage of such receptor by tomoxifen.  It is actually a sign that tomoxifen is doing its job and protecting one from having the formation of new tumors. If anyone out there with ER+ breast cancer and have been taking Avemar for years with tamoxifen, it may be nice to post your overall health and whether encounter reoccurance of the cancer here. This will help us to collect more data.",
