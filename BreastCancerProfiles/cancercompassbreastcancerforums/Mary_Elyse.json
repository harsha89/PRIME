      "Content": "I was on Arimidex for 4years and just recently had a reoccurence-one lymph node - clear margins - but enough to make you worry. I now have to come off of that and am on the monthyl Faslodex shots. Does anyone out there have any advise on the side effects? I had an anxiety attack and have now been put on a low dose of Xanax which seems to have helped but where are the other Faslodex users???",
