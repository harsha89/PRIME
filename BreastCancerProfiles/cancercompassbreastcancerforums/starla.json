      "Content": "Confused and waiting I went through a differant kind of breast cancer but I have a couple of suggestions for you. Make sure you have someone with you at every appt. its important because of all of the running emotions. Also take notes lots of notes the times, dates, names and anything else you can think of. Also write down questions to ask have your family and friends write down their questions so you can ask them also. Remember the only dumb question is the one that is not asked. Also no matter how comfortable you are with the doctors that you have a second oppion is a must I wish someone would have told me that but don't tell the new doctor what the other doctor said you want to know what his oppion is. Also ask your doctor about Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome that is what I suffer from now I don't want to scare you because I would not do anything differant but if my doctors would have known about this Syndrome they would have been able to make a diagnoises and I would have been able to get the proper treatment so it would not have ended up being untreatable I'll check back if you have any questions for me I'll help if I can you need as many supporters as you can find may God be with you in your journey I will keep you in my prayers. GOOD LUCK Starla",

I need help any information that you feel might help please email me at lewis.starla@gmail.com. He took my life and I'm going to get it back one way or another.  I am 10 months post-mastectomy (bilateral) and have been in constant pain every day since. Three basic kinds of pain: a constant squeezing/tightness right through the incisions (I believe it is phantom pain-they still feel like they are there!), a numbness/tenderness mostly under my right arm (doc says most likely nerve damage from surgery) and then sharp, shooting pains that move from place to place. All pain meds that have been tried so far have not given me any relief. Just started on Neurontin last week but have not felt any difference yet. I've been looking for answers but so far only my GP has been willing to really try to help me. Both surgeons have basically told me to \"live with it\" and that it will last up to 2 years. Any advice would be most appreciated!I hate to be the one to tell you this but your surgeons are full of shit. They offensive word removed ed up and can not fix it so they give it some fancy name to cover their ass from a law suit then they will hand you their offensive word removed -up cover-up drug an antidepressant and then they hope you won't come back. They then will continue on with their lives as nothing has happened and you will be left nto suffer for the rest of your life. Some women have been living with this for 8 to 10 years or even more it isn't something that just goes away and there is no help for those of us that are forced to suffer because of what I and many others who suffer consider to be a surgical error. We just don't have the degree that they have and that they use to protect them selves you see you have to be able to find a surgeon who will discredit another and that won't happen until it happens to one of their own. Just like trying to get this information made public it is not of interest until it happens to someone in that line of work or someone who has lots of money and can afford to have their story told. As for us ordinary folk were left just hangin and waiting for it to happen to someone like that so our story will get told. Good luck to you and I would be happy to share with you all of the useless treatments I have been through and all the time they knew none of them would help not only do they take your life but then they try to bleed all of your accounts so your left out in the cold. Watch your back.  ",

      "Content": "How many of you that got a cancer diagnoises were told before you had surgery that you might have to spend the rest of your life feeling like you are being tortured. My bet would be that 95% of the surgeons preforming breast surgeries have never heard of POST MASTECTOMY PAIN SYNDROME and those that do refuse to tell their patients about it. Let me share a little of what I have to live with all because I had a surgeon how was uneducated and unable to diagnoise my symtoms. When I take a shower it feels like razor blades slicing into my chest, drying off is like being scrubed with sand paper,with every movement I make it is like someone is ripping the skin from my body it is like I am being tortured 24-7 I can not even take a breathe without the skin being ripped from my chest. At every turn I've been kick to the curb like a piece of trash. This has left me almost completely disabled I depend on my family for every thing because of the pain I'm sick all of the time I keep increasing the number of cans of pop I drink a day to keep above 100pds. Even quit driving for the most part besides not being able to stand the vibrations the pain has me holding my breathe I'm afraid that I will pass out. And to top it off after I had my surgery I got told by two differant doctors that I did not have cancer and now all off my mamograms have disappeared. Protect your selves get copies of everything and if you can also record every appointment so everything that is being done does not have to be questioned a $50 tape recorder verses your life. mind you these doctors are protected by the papers that you sign so you in turn should protect yourself. One more thing that you ladies need to know there is no help for you if this should happen to you. You can not recieve any disability or nothing if you are a housewife even though you can no longer do your work and if I would have to go back to work to cover my medical noone would hire me anyway One word of advice to all of you never be satisfied with their answers to your questions always demand more even if it causes them to have to do research to get your answer THEY WORK FOR YOU. You write their paycheck demand nothing but the best and if the arn't willing to give it to you you need to go elsewhere because they only want your money they don't have your best interest at heart they have no compassion. Ladies ask your doctors about the syndrome don't assume anything they don't know everything and if this happens to you, you will want a doctor that can make a diagnioses so you can get the treatments you need so you don't have to live the same way as so many of us do. Good luck to all who read this if any and remenber to ask your doctor. Starla",

I now spend my days feeling like I'm being tortured and from my stand point and knowing what I know now I'd take my chances with the cancer at least there would be an end to the pain. This has basicly took my life from me I have depend one someone else to do most everything for me I even gave up driving for the most part because of the vibrations from the car makes the pain so intense that I get sick. I'm tired of being sick the pain is so bad 99% of the time I can't keep food down, I don't sleep, taking ashower is like having razor blades slicing into my chest this is just apart of what my life is now like since I let that surgeon butcher on me.",
