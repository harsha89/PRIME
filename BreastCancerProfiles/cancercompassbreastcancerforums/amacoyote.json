    "Content": "I had bilateral simple mastectomies in January 2005 - no chemo, radiation or meds and no pain problems.  I was started on an ACE Inhibitor -Lysinipril on January 24, 2011.  By April the side effects were so severe that I was a couch potato.  They were identical to PMPS!  I stopped the med and started to feel better within 4 days but was still having considerable chest and back pain.  Next I was put on Losartan K, an angiotenser, and within 3 weeks was back to being in intense chest and back pain.  At this time I have stopped all BP meds, am monitoring my BP and it is fine, and am consulting with the doctors about my next move. I am 81 and in good health. If any of you experiencing PMPS are on Blood Pressure Meds, I suggest that you find some other way to control the BP.  Talk with your primary doctor. Good Luck - Jo  ",
