      "Content": "  On 4/11/2007 Ahlbrand wrote: Good to hear that others experience this bone or joint pain.  I feel like I'm 80 years old when I get out of bed in the morning, or out of my car after driving to work (1/2 hour 1 way)  I have not seen a doctor- and nothing is listed on any of the websites showing this as one of the side effects of Tamoxifen.  My sister experienced terrible leg pain while she was on Tamoxifen for 2 years, then it went away when she started Arimidex (sp?) Do any doctors chat on these to comment? I've managed to hold on for almost 3 years:  2 years on Arimidex and now almost 1 on Tamoxifen.  I am SO discouraged.  I don't know if my depression is my \"usual\" depression or medication related.  I am over weight, hurt much of the time, have VERY sensitive, itchy skin, hot flashes... but they are all intermittent.  If I take enough Benadryl to not itch, I fall asleep and get mad at myself for not accomplishing anything.  The MD gave me an anti-arthritic which helps in the sense that it's all worse when I forget a dose. But getting up in the morning makes me feel like I'm 85, too.  One hip in particular twinges.  And sometimes my ankles.  Suggestions, encouragement welcome.  I'm calling my MD's nurse because writing this makes me realize how much of a trial it is.  Is the suffering \"worth it\"?   ",
