      "Content": "I have been of femara two months. For five years prior I was on tamoxifen. I had breast cancer in 2000. My experience with femara has not been good. My legs ache and I even have difficulty getting up from a chair after i sit awhile. I experience fatigue. But I also am having cramps that feel like menstruation pain. I am 64 and post menapause. I started to spot last night. I called the Dr. and he is to see me after the weekend. It is Saturday. He told me to continue the pills till then. Has anyone else experience this. I have been all over the internet and have not found anyone else with these symptoms",

      "Content": "The Oncologist said my menstrual pain, spotting, and bloating was not from Femara. I didn't think so but when I had my pap smear this week they found a ball (so nurse described it) in my cervix. Also uterus was enlarged. So it was not caused by Femara. I will get a ultra sound soon. Hopefully these are benign fibroids.. Thought you deserved an update.",

      "Content": "to Australia and wonder women. Thanks for the messages especially letting me know about the spotting. Yesterday, my oncologist told me I probably had endometrial cancer (on the phone no less. ) I knew all my problems with cramping and spotting started while on Femara. I too exercise, we have a treadmill in our home. My Oncologist did not know they use Femara to increase a women's chances of getting pregnant and also for decreasing estrogen for estrogen positive cancers. You helped me to relax a little. I get a pap smear and ultra sound this week to be on the safe side. I stopped taking Femara. Does anyone else have menstrual cramps and bleeding when taking this drug? I emailed the drug co. but their reply was generic. No help there. I think the Oncology Dept in the U.S. is not aware this drug has a dual purpose. They (most) know only of the cancer benefits to women. Perhaps more education would be in order. Thanks again for your reply. Greatful!",
