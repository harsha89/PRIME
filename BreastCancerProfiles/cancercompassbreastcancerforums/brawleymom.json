      "Content": "hi all--just checking in in case new people visit here.  I was diagnosed in July 2007 and had a simple mastectomy in September.  i had a very large tumor (6.1 cm) but they say they got clean margins.  I pray they did!  No chemo, no radiation.  Just this passed week I had my gel implant placed so we have come a long way. I will see my oncologist in March after a chest xray and mammo.  that's all the treatment I am receiving.  ACC is strange but I guess in this case that is a good thing. Molly     ",

      "Content": "thank you for your responses.  I am feeling  bit better emotionally, the ache is still there but nothing I can't handle.  Last night I had my husband massage my side rib cage and it felt so good along the ribs, which makes me feel like it is inflammation or fluid like or something. It is definitely less bothersome without a bra, and when I am home I don't wear one.  I am definitely considering massages.  They have been recommended by numerous survivors.  My insurance will cover them as long as a doctor prescribes them.  Honestly, the pain is not that bad.  it's just worrying about mets that prompted my message. Thanks for all of your thoughts. I welcome them and  love to hear from those who have been there. Thanks again. Molly     ",

      "Content": "  On 7/31/2008 platinum wrote: I was diagnosed with a very rare and very aggressive breast cancer-metaplastic carcinoma with sarcomatoid features. Treatment was mastectomy, which showed no lymph lode involvement, followed by dose dense chemo and radiation, all of which I handled very well. Prognosis is fast recurrence within 2 years, or, if not, I am clear. There are virtually no studies on this cancer, its causes, cures, or pattern, so I was just given the most intense treatment available. Does anyone else have this or know about this? Right now, I feel terrific.   Hi--I do not have your very rare cancer, but do have a very rare breast cancer myself.  I am not sure if your cancer is listed, but you might want to check out Sharon Lane's rare cancer forum.  This is the only place I could find people to talk to who had my rare breast cancer, adenoid cystic carcinoma.  My cancer is low aggressive potential so they say, but I know of people who have died 13 months after diagnosis. My cancer does not respond to chemo or radiation so mastectomy was it. My tumor was over 6 cms so you and I get those big ol' tumors!  I am one year out and feel ok--worried about some rib cage pain at the moment.  My cancer can and often comes back even as far as 20 years out.  UCK!  Sounds like you are getting really really good care and I am glad you feel great. I never felt like i was dying that is for sure.   Molly ",

      "Content": "I am almost a year out from my mastectomy but am still doing reconstruction. I have a gel implant and last week had a dog ear removed. Nipple comes next. Throughout my entire cancer journey, my rib cage has been tender, but more so lately.  Is this possible still a year later?  My bra hurts it, and every once in awhile I will get those throbbing pain under the rib cage but most of the time it just aches. It even looks like it sticks out more on that side. Of course I am terrified of bone mets or even liver mets and will ask my onco when I go next month, but my husband keeps reminding me that this has bothered me the whole time--I just think it is worse now.  Some people have said rib cage pain is common--just wondering if it would continue even a year later?  Ache is not bad enough to take anything...maybe an Ibuprofen or something. Also, it does not seem to hurt as much when i get up. Any advice to help my sanity would be great. By the way, I did not have chemo or radiation, nor do i take any pills. Cancer was a wierd one, with a 6 cm tumor. Surgeon told me she was very aggressive in getting all the tissue out. your help is appreciated!   Molly   ",
