Our stories are very similar, yet so different. I'm a 51 y/o male treated for lymphoma. I did develop Lymphedema and that causes many more problems, so not sure if you did or not. I did notice that someone did ask you that question. After doing much research I see that it is not uncommon to develope Lymphedema with any type of cancer in or near the breast, that would contribute to severe pain. It has been two years now that I finished my chemo and radiation. I have been in tremendous pain for the last twelve months. The Lymphedema left me with nerve,tissue and muscle damage. I was learning to deal with it and also working with a physical therapist in my home. During this time I thought I was doing so well until my knee started to hurt and the pain just got more intense. I stopped therapy and had to beg my doctor to look into the problem. One quick MRI showed two tears in my knee. Everyone seemed perplexed since I've been walking with a cane and have had very limited movement of my knee and leg since the lymphedema. It's now several months later and I again have terrible pain, this time in my thigh, and yes another MRI and I have two tears in my thigh muscle. My radiation was near this area of my right leg and this is the area with all the muscle tears. Talk with your doctor before you do ANYTHING. I am not a doctor but I would almost bet that radiation makes the muscles somewhat brittle. I had 4 tears and believe me I am very limited in my movements. I tried a pain management Dr. Had a few injections with vert little relief. I too take morphine and recently started neurontin.....neither seems to really help. Talk with your doctor and check for tears in the muscles. Let me know. Good luck and feel better! .",
