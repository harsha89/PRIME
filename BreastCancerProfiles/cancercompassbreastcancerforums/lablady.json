My grandma is 81 and was diagnosed first with liver cancer by one doctor, this was on Wed, May 23, 2007. Lesions were found on and ultrasound. Understandably, my mom is freaking out. I am 30, also the oldest \"kid\" and \"grandkid.\" So then grandma says her breast looks \"different\" like a day later. She sees another doctor and sure enough breast cancer into the gland. Here's where it gets confusing..she gets a MRI, X-ray and all of this liver function tests and breast biopsey.The two drs. aren't communicating and they are each telling her different things. One says she has cancer, the other says she's fine. She was even set up for a surgery that she didn't know was a masectomy!! Thank God my Mom had figured all of this out when she realized grandma had two surgery appointments on the same day. My Mom ended up somehow getting a head of staff-lady to interviene.  Finally, last friday she saw a specialist (at a different place) and he re-did the MRI cuz the other one was \"nonconclusive\" aka LOST!! So this specialist said \"yes, she has liver cancer, but not sure how bad cuz we don't know how long it's been there. But, she does have a growth on her hip bone\" so, now grandma is to see a cardiologist next week??? what??? Has anyone else experienced such a fiasco?? Grandma says she feels fine (except she sleeps all the time) and she has all this confused, but I guess I'm not 80 and I'm confused. Oh, and my grandpa also found out last week he has a \"spot\" on his lungs  Why is it that when other people aren't going through rough times they act as if it's \"no big deal\"..I actually had a \"friend\" that I was there for 2years ago when her dad died tell me last night that I was \"selfish and I had a pathetic life\" because I wouldn't go out to a stupid bar with her..She had gotten ready and then I told her my headache was too bad to leave the house...I really don't understand people. Xoxo   Dear Seville , what a mess. I really feel for you. My husband in the last week was diagnosed withgr4 GBM by a doctor who told us to basically go home and die. Three days later another surgeon does the operation without much fuss. I personally don't have a lot of faith in doctors and think a lot of the time it's just one big moneymaking business which preys on the vunerable.  I think you could give you friend a miss now. At this time you need people who will support you and be positive.  I wouldn't begin to even try and understand people . My kids and I are living each day as if it were our last. Life is precious. God Bless  ",
