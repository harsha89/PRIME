      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I have tried all three and was finally taken off after 2yrs because of severe joint pain. I have now been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis in my wrist and it has moved to my ankles and feet. I am 55 yrs old and think it is too coincidental that all this started when I was treated with these drugs. Has anyone been diagnosed with an inflammatory arthritis or an autoimmune disease? I have gained 15 lbs from these meds and steriods I have to take for pain. Connie",
