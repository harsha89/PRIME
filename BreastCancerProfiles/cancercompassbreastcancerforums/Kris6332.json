    "Content": "I have heard that breastfeeding lowers your chance of getting breast cancer.   Has anyone else ever heard that?  My mom died 2 years ago from colon cancer, but I also have several aunts who are currently fighting breast cancer.  I'm 31 and mother to three, an 11year old son, an 8 year old daughter, and a 15 month old daughter.  I breastfed all for at least a year or longer.  Sure would be nice to think that what I heard about it lowering breast cancer risk was true.  Thanks, Kristy E.",
