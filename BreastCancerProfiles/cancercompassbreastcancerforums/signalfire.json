    "Content": "Keep in mind that no matter what course you choose, from 'everything they recommend' to 'nothing' that YOU are your own guinea pig.  You're a research study of one and you'll never know if you've picked the best treatment or the worst or what would have happened ...if...   We all have different age of first diagnosis, different stagings, different DNA, etc.  No one else's response or lack thereof, or side effects to treatment, apply to any one of us except anecdotally.  Take it all as information and then do what your gut tells you.  Keep in mind the default doc recommendations tend to be the most treatment (at the greatest cost) and that scans and tests can be false negative as well as false positive.  ",
