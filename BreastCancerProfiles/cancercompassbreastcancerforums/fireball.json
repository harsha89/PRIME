      "Content": "Are you talking about \"Xeloda\". I'm going to start on this pill this Thursday. I heard that was one of the side effects. Does your sister have anything for nausea? Compazine and Phenergan is very good. ( Makes you sleepy). Zofrain works well (this doesnot make you sleepy). Is this the only side effect she has? Keep in touch and I will be praying for her.",
