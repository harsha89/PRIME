I have been on them a while and am doing well, but am disturbed that there seems to be no plan for stopping taking them! If youa re in this category, please let me hear from you!Thanks",

      "Content": "I hate to say it, but you probably should have it checked. I had a discharge which I ignored,and it did turn out to be cancer. Also, in my opinion, as you are young and your breasts are probably firm, a tumor ight not even show up on a mammogram- you may want to check with your Dr. about this, possibly a sonogram or another method is in order. It is true, it is probably not cancer, but wouldn't you rather know fo sure? Energystar",

I am having some minor side effects, dry hands and funny looking toenails, but the benefits far outweigh these. Some people cannot toletate it, and evidently it doesn't help everyone, but it has been great for me.",
