Has anyone \"been there, done that\" that can help with encouragement, expecations? All I hear is \"everybodies different, we can't tell you what to expect, we will give you medication for nausea and vomiting, you will be fatigued and you will be more prone to infections.\" What do you eat? - My tummy is in knots with fear, I've lost 10 lbs - and don't have that much to lose! Bonnie Hi Bonnie,    I have had chemo for ovarian cancer and radiation for breast cancer. Its a horrible thing to go through, BUT if you want to live you have too, as a close friend of mine says, your a \"hero\" to have the willingness and the power to live, by having nasty drugs put into your body. You have to be a fighter and be Positive. I had stage 3c cancer Ovarian and stage 0 breast. Breast was ductal and contained. For ovarian, I had cisplain and taxol for one cycle and then went to taxol and the sister of cisplain, Carbonplatin. I ended that in Jan. 08. I am now on Doxil for a recurrence of the ovarian cancer. I was given Emends too for preventing nausea and also zofran. They both work for me. I had heartburn and indigestion but was told to take prilosec otc for it and that helps greatly. I had cravings for protien, peanut butter, choc. and pasta during my treatments. It also gave me strength. It does or can make you tired. Prevention drugs make it worse but WORTH to take. Eating is good during treatment. Have more meals per day by eating small amounts each time. They like you to gain weight not lose it. I was worse when I had cisplatin and had a reaction to it. Not wanting to eat and feeling light headed and just wanting to sleep, if goes on for more than a day or two, is Signs to call doc. You have to drink lots of water or something to stay hydrated with any chemo drug. Its not that bad once you know how you react, by the third treatment you will know what you can do and not. Side affects start from day one to day five or six and last about 10 days most of time. I was fine after 12 day on most of my treatments. Weak and triedness was the worse after 12 day.  Taxol has a side affect of neuropathy which I had and its more of a pain to have than anything else. I had it in hands and feet. Feet worse than hands. If you get it BECAREFUL walking and when you first stand up from sitting, stand still a minute or two before walking. I fell from it and broke my ankle. I had it bad and still do. I fell in Sept. and I ended taxol in Jan. It can stay with you for a bit.  But that's me. I don't want to scare you more but sometimes knowing is better than getting it and not aware of the affects. I had my sister a doc to help me prepare for things and it helped. It scares you more when something happens to your'e body, not knowing its part of a side affect and its normal. Call your doctor as soon as you feel something not right just to be on safe side. Some one should be around you the days after chemo so youre not alone. Or have a neighbor check in on you every so often. Give them a key so they can get in if needed. Just a precaution to take.   I was scare too the fist time, but I was well informed by sister and my doctor and nurses and had many family and friends supporting me through it. I still do. Think  about and talk about GOOD things and not about Chemo, as you get it. Read a good book or Something to take your mind of what is happening. I had benadrl ?? spelling, before they gave me the chemo, I found eating before, some snack food helped me from getting sleepy or light headed.  They also gave me steriods to take before I arrived and the night before and some days after. I also was given Amends before and after. They do give you enough to help sickness and other side affects. Or they should. You Will BE Fine don't get so worried about it. It is saving your life and that is worth the tramua. Life is priceless and the power of willing to live is what it takes. Good Luk to you! I will pray for you.                                              Nancy  ",
