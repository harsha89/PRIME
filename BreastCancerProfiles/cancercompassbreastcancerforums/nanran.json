      "Content": "I went to Walmart and found what they called a sleeping bra made of very soft tshirt type fabric. You step into it like a sports bra. It was very comfortable. However, as I continue to heal, I feel the bra pulling to one side. I told the nurse at the oncologist's office and was given a prescription for a mastectomy bra (I had a lumpectomy). You go to a place that specializes in this, get measured and, in my case, Medicare will pay for the bras.",

However, where I had suffered with vaginal dryness for several years, I now am wet. Has anyone else had this occur? Is it part of it or should I be worried that something else is wrong?",
