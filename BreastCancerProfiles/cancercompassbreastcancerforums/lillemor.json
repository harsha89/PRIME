    "Content": "Just finished my 3rd try at estrogen feeding tumor and I'm done with the pills!! My shoulders froze,could not bend or use my arms or wrists. Just 3 hrs. of being taken off Feemara and put on Prednisone, I could bend my arms, my head had cleared.  I did not realize how dangerous I was thinking. My husband was amazed. I could not go to the bathroom , take a shower without much help. Towards the end my husband lifted from bed and had to feed me. This is not Life and it is a poor form of existence. I am now eating maitake mushrooms almost daily and am going to look into the Coriolus Versicolan extract.  It has been proven that the maitake mushroom kills the cancer cells. I have been on Aromasin,Tamoxifen and Feemara. lillemor",
