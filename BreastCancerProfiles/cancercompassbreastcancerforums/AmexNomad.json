    "Content": "I was on Arimidex for about 5 months before I made the connection between my horrible sypmtons and this wretched drug. I switched back to Tamoxifen (which I had been on for 5 years prior). It is now 3 months later and my sypmtoms have subsided substantially, but have not completely ceased. I am 54 years old and fell TWICE due to the impact of Arimidex on my legs. I could not sleep due to the back/shoulder pain caused by this horrible drug. I wonder if we're all being poisoned for the extra $ made by the pharmaceutical companies pushing this drug. Good Luck to you.Â ",
