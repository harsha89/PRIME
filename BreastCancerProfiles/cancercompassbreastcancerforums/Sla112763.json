    "Content": "i just had a few questions?,back in 2005 i had a lump removed from my right breast,thankfully a papiloma,non cancerous,but i have now har 5 breast surgery's on both brast,one just last week,while recovering, my left breast began to bleed just like the other 4,i want a masectomy!!!!! i'm not diagnosed with breast cancer,but with the problem's and so many surgeries,i think i should be able to have them removed,the problem is the dr's they say i'm too young.i'm43 yrs old,and i may want to think about it a while,well its been long enough,i told my dr on my visit this past week and he said with all your problem's i would have no problem removing them,but as soon as i said i wanted no reconstruction done ,everything changed.now he want's to talk to his tumor group as he call's it to discuss my case,i don't think those oeolple have the right to make a decision on what i want,it's mt body and if i want it my dr should just follow my wishes,i gurantee if there loved one's have gone through all the test,surgery's ductogram's the work's they would do it in a heart break.i don't know it really upset's me that five strangers have my life in therehand's. anyway's i'm just concerned of what is going to happen if something isn't done soon.i've already had lung cancer 8yrs ago and i have sarcoid and my immune system is weak.i jsut want to have the mesectomy and get on with my life.thank's for your time if you have read this.Â ",
