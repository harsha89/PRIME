Her sister, father, two aunts, a cousin and grand-mother all died from breast cancer, most of them in their 40s. My sister and I have been told we must have gene tests etc. My sister, is refusing to do so, saying she'd rather not know. I have a totally different view. (I'm 31, by the way).  It has been suggested to me that I should consider having an elective double mastectomy. Without wishing to sound flippant, I am quite keen on the idea. Looking at my family history, things don't bode well for me and prevention is better than cure etc. I'd be grateful if you would let me know what you think. It would really help me :-)  Many thanks, Louise Be sure to get genetic testing before you consider a double mastectomy; and read the book Apron Strings by Diane Tropea Greene.  Good luck.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the encouraging words.  My hair is just starting to fall out, 3 days after my second chemo treatment, which is about 17 days after my first treatment.   I made an appointment to have my head shaved tomorrow.  I'll have a friend hold my hand and I will not look in the mirror.  I'll bring my lovely wig (just like my own hair) with me for the hairdresser to put on.  In addition, I plan to wear some kibnd of head covering on my head while at home.  I don't think I can stand looking at my bald head!!  Yes, I am trying to stay positive.  Good luck to you too.
