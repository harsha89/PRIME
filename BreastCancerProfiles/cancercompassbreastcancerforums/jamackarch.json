    "Content": "Hi Chrisjade,Â  I know what you are/were going thru. 4 yrs ago, got mamo, \"dense breasts\" then another mamo, then and 8-core sample biopsy and they insisted on putting in the clip, despite my protestations. So sore. Had to wear a sports bra for like a year. Gained some weight (maybe got a bit more \"padding\" on the right side)... started wearing a regular underwire again. ...Fast fwd 3 yrs to now. Last few months right breast (clip side) VERY sore! Went and had BE, and GP found nothing. Said to go for ultrasound. This coming Thurs will be ultrasound and another mamo. ...I think all this trouble is from teh clip I didn;t want in the first place! (not to mention the biopsy came back clear 4 yrs ago and latest mamo this yr in March was clear. )",
