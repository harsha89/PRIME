      "Content": "I tried to get into a clinical trail for breast cancer at UCSF. I was accepted however choose not to go into trail. My insurance covered the normal expenses, Anything above that the trail needed I never saw a bill for. however those results are not in my record either, one was a omni test for genes. Calf. law says they have to cover normal expenses. Also for the breast cancer there was a state program that also picked up the detuctables that I had to pay out of pocket for, on the breast cancer charges. However the study did not pay for any hotels for me or travel expenses. I did receive some from American Cancer Society and some gas cards from a local Cancer Center also. Every little bit helped.",

      "Content": "About 10 months before being dx with breast cancer on my left side. I was ER/ low PR positive. I became supper sentative to lots of smells. Which I did complain alot to my husband. One of them was to my own body smell. Under My RIGHT arm pit my oder changed, was stronger and more smelling like a man. But the cancer was left breast. ? Also notice a differance in my urin too and it has changed again, could be a new med? After Radiation I did loose hair under the left arm ( not unhappy about that) but the smell still smells different under my right are, just not as strong. It was only me who noticed it. Thankfully. Maybe it was all diet? Or nerves? but it all started before I changed anything. I did ask my Onchologist about this and she thought it was hormons reacting maybe to the cancer. She certainly did not sweep it under the rug. She is young too and I hope open minded.....I am treated at UCSF san fran calif",
