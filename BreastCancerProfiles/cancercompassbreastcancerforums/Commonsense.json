The contention that aggressive surgery is a common misperception and goes along with the \"more is better\" philosophy, which has been shown in many instances and types of cancer., not to be the case.  You would still be put on Tamoxifen or inhibitor no matter what your local therapy is.  If the tumor is large and the breast small and there is no cosmetic advantage then have the surgery.  Both are equal with DCIS.  ",

      "Content": " Actually it is usually the other way around. Lumpectomyis  as successful as breast removal and maybe more so.  I would google the information.  Also there are better inhibtors than Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen has way too many side effects.Tamoxifen is falling out of favour. Femera is a much safer hormone inhibitor and way less side effects.  Please look this up on the net along with \"rates of remission for mastectomy versus lumpectomy\" On 3/29/2007 Spiritsquad wrote: If I have dcis and I remove my breast won't I be removing all the dcis hence lessening the chances. See what I have been struggling with is I just have been notified that I need a re excision due to poor margins I have necrosis cells I have solid pattern with high grade on my first biopsy and intermediate grade on the lymphectomy biopsy. I have no great attachment to my breast and my spouse wants me to have it removed to lesson worry of reoocurrance. with reconstructive surgery as an option I guess the thought of removing my breast w/reconstruction and not having to go through more reexcisions (Possibly) and also not having to go through Radiation as well I am not a gambler and from what I have researched so far a masectomy seems the savest route to take. I have yet to read or hear that lumpectomy with radiation and tamoxifen has a better cure rate than masectomy. I have heard that its about the same I guess I am just a littel confused.  Thanks for your answers they are greatly appreciated.  God Bless,  Spiritsquad  ",
