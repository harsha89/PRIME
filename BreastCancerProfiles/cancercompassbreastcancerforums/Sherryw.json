Usually it's done before the surgery, along with chest xray, blood tests and in some cases, CT scans, PET scans and MRI's.  Each doctor is different in his approach and what one's insurance will allow is also a factor. Good luck in your treatment. Jelly    Jelly, I didn't have a bone scan before or after my mastectomy in June 05..  I wish my doctor would have ordered one.  I had stage 3 cancer in the right breast.  I did 8 rounds of chemo and then radiation for 33 times.  I thought I was cancer free.  I started arimidex in Dec 05 and had to switch to tamoxifem in May 06 because I had a period and was not in menopause anymore.  I started having more pain in my bones in July 06.  (I had been having some pain all along).  I had an x ray in July and it didn't show anything.  They said I must have pulled a muscle since the pain was in a specific area of my left ribs.  That pain kinda went away and then other bones would hurt.  Over Thanksgiving my right leg hurt so bad I couldn't walk and went back to the doctor.  We did CT scans, and a bone scan.  The CT scans didn't show anything, but the bone scan showed serveral tumors.  RT ribs, LF ribs, base of spine, top of spine, RT shoulder blade, RT hip.  I was glad that I insisted upon getting scans.  Of course, I was devestated that my cancer had metastasized.  I was now stage 4.  We did more scans and then a bonee biopsy in December.  It was confirmed on Jan 9.  I started the pink ribbon program on a new drug that day.  All of my perevios tests were used to qualify me.  I am taking zomeda (IV) every 4 weeks,  xeloda (pills) 2 weeks on and 1 week off, and avastin (IV) every 3 weeks.  I hope these meds will shrink my tumors.  We will be doing CT scans every 9 weeks and bone scans every 18 weeks.  I hope when I have a scan that something will shrink.        ",

She had some side effects from the chemo, but dealt with them as best she could with anti-nausea medications and darvocet.  Her burns were also so bad that she had would care every day on them. About one year of xeloda, she had some symptoms in her arm that were first diagnosed as lyphodema.  She found a therapist who gave her a great deal of relief from the lymphodema, but not all of her pain was gone.  The therapist was convinced that there was something other than lymphodema in her arm, and after several different scans they found cancer in the arm.  She was treated with radiation and a higher dose of xeloda.  She was in a great deal of pain with this treatment, but handled it as she knew it was necessary.  Now she has again been diagnosed with metastic cancer on the same side.  This time it is brachioplexus cancer (sp?)  The radiologist did not feel that he could use radiation in the same area again, so the current treatment is Avastin IV chemo with 3000 mg of xeloda a day.   She has now been to the hospital twice in a month.  Both times were shortly after her avastin treatment.  The pain is so bad that she is even crying out in her sleep.  She loves her oncologist and feels that she is lucky to have lived this long.  However, after tonight, I am angry.  He said that on paper she is just fine and that this pain is psychological rather than physiological. He claims that the treatment could not be causing the pain.   I can't believe that he would say that after she has dealt with rather harsh side effects for years with little complaint.   Has anyone else heard of this combination of drugs causing severe body and specifically head pain?  She knows that the pain is not in her head, but right now she is devestated because the person she trusted to take care of her seems to have written her off.   Sorry for the ramble.  I am a bit undone right now.  I'm sorry about your mom.  I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer on December 12, 2006.  I had it in both hips, both shoulder blades and the upper and lower spine.  I was accepted into a clinical trial and have been taking avastin (IV), xeloda (3000 mg daily) and zoleda (to build the bones and for bone pain) since January 9th.  I have had the hand and foot syndrome so bad that my xeloda was reduced from 4000 to 3000 daily.  I still have pain in my lower back along with pain in my left foot.  The good news is that my markers are going down and the CAT scans and bone scans have not found any new tumors since December.  I was really freaked out when my doctor told me what the source of all my pain was (in December).  I now realize that I can still live for years with treatment.  I do have lots of side effects like: headaches, indigestion, hand and foot syndrome, pain, nausea, diahrea, fatigue.  I just keep working each day (I teach 1st grade) and deal with what comes up.  I can't sit at home feeling sorry for myself.  I take oxycodone regularly each day to deal with the pain, which gives me constipation, so eat prunes a lot also.  It really helps to have a good support group at work as well as my family and everyone at the St. Louis Breast and Cancer Institute.  I hope your mom can get the pain under control or that her doctor will at least give her some pain relief medication.",

Hoping I meet criteria. Anyone else involved? What changes have you seen? The Xeloda did shrink the smallest of tumors, Chest, Lungs, and Liver larger tumors stayed same. Thankful nothing \"new\" .I go today to see if I qualify. Please God, I hope I do. Bette     I started on this new trreatment on Jan.9, 2007.  I have had one treatment of zomeda and avastin each on a different day.  I am also taking xeloda pills, two weeks on, one week off.   I haven't noticed any difference yet.  ",
