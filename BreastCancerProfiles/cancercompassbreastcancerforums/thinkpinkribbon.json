In 50% of patients, it negatively affects their daily activities, but they are still able to do most of it. On the other end, 25% of post mastectomy pain syndrome patients suffer from moderate to high negative impact on their daily activities. Such individuals may not be able to do any of their activities and might require 24 hour human support.",
