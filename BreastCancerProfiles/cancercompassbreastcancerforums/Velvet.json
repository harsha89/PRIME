      "Content": "Hello Dorothy, you may well be on a different dose of warfarin to what I was on, mine was only to keep the portacath (A central line)clot free but if you have checked out with your Doc then keep on having the Faslodex shots. In the end if you get a bruised bottom it is worth it if the Faslodex works. Bony secondaries are when the cancer has spread, come back from the first cancer, in my case breast cancer, and has started up new tumours around the body, so I have breast cancer in the bones, also called metasteses. I did have some joint pain at the beginning but it wore off after a short while. Forgive me but you sound a bit panicky, so what if you have to take tablets for the pain or to function, you brush your teeth each day so you don't get tooth decay, so take tablets that prevent pain. In a couple of months you may find everything has settled. Believe me it is not worth quitting your drugs. Keep a diary of all your problems, take it with you when you see your Dr but my guess is that your diary will have fewer and fewer entries before a month is out. For some reason new drugs, that is new to you, sometimes hit hard until your body get used to them. Go swimming, exercise gently, take these problems on as a challenge rather than thinking of giving up. Positive thoughts work wonders. Take care Velvet",

      "Content": "Dear Dorothy, I too was on warfarin for about 4 months whilst having Faslodex shots. I had a portacath but it got infected (after 3 years) and I had a new one inserted by a different surgeon who does NOT prescribe warfarin. (I have breast cancer bony secondaries) I have had Faslodex shots now for a year and I can honestly say I can't tell the difference betweeen shots with warfarin and shots without. I was told that due to the warfarin I might bleed slightly and get a bruise from the shot but I didn't. My nurse presses on the shot site in the same way, I keep the dressing on til evening and massage my bottom lump very gently for a couple of days after the shot as it is often tender if I don't. The Faslodex is very thick and that is why you can get a sore bot however, I am going to have the next couple of shots in the thigh to give my bottom a rest. In a year I have had one very recent, tiny new site and faint at that (I also have Zometa) Faslodex has been a wonderful drug for me I can only wish that it works as well for you, take care, Velvet",
