      "Content": "Thank u so much for your response.I am no where near Boston,and my mom does good to travel anywhere even close to home.The doctors all pretty much know that her pain is nerve damage,but the just prescribe her gabapentin and morphine.Neither one has helped.I am glad u told me about the injections tho,but her pain specialist said he would inject her right in her chest where she had the breast removed and that it really sore.You said yours were in your back.My brother had the injections too because he had back surgery and he says they hurt like hell.Not sure what to do.I will keep trying and pushing to get something done.",

      "Content": "My mother is 67 and had her breast removed over a year ago and still has chronic pain.It keeps getting worse and meds aren't working.She has tryed everything.Vicodines,laracets,morphine,fentanyl patches,Gabapentin and who knows what else.The pain specialist is recommending pain injections.Not sure how bad that might hurt her or if it will even be effective but we have ran out of options.She too has all the same pains as the other women on here.It is sad that people have to go thru such horrific pain and nothing helps.Any advice from someone?",
