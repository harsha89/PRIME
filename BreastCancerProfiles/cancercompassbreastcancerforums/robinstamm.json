You can find the side effects of pretty much any medication by doing a Google search. Here's what came up when I entered \"Side effects, Letrozole\". It gave me a page for Femara, but aches and pains are certainly two of the side effects. So far, I haven't come across an Aromatase Inhibitor that DOESN'T have aches and pains as a side effect, although some women tolerate the drugs just fine. I heard just yesterday that roughly 30% of the women who take these meds suffer from side effects. If you decide to go off the medication, you wouldn't be the first. But if you decide to go off, you might want to look into alternatives such as Turmeric Paste, Iodine (www.breastcancerchoices.org), and Frankincense(!). There are plenty of alternatives to choose from. I chose the three just listed because the feel right for me, so going with your gut instinct is part of it. There's a good book on this called \"Your Medical Mind\". Best of luck to you!",

I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years now, having had a mastectomy in November 2003. Firstly I had hardly any side effects and slowly but surely they seem to be building up, some days far worse than the next. I have never had nausea though, thank goodness. The main side effects which I am experiencing now are aching bones and joints, mainly while trying to sleep at night. Also tiredness and seem to want to just go to bed to rest from as early as 8 in the evening - this is sad as I always went to bed late before my breast cancer. I also contemplated coming off the drug but decided that as the cancer hasn't come back at all in almost 2 years then perhaps I am doing the right thing in taking it every day. Your story, and the story of so many other posters here, is why I refused to take Arimidex and am approaching my treatment with lifestyle changes (diet & exercise mainly).  If you're considering going off it, you might find some of the links here to be of interest: https://www.facebook.com/BreastCancerBandits",

      "Content": "Your mom is experiencing known side-effects of Arimidex. There are several alternative \"dietary\" approaches to treatment. Your mom's sense of what her body needs and doesn't need is important when deciding what treatment course she should follow... along with the particulars of her cancer. I've had 3 primary breast cancers since 2000 (I'm now 63) and had radiation the first time. If I had to do it again, I'd skip all \"standard\" treatment other than surgery, and turn to a nutrient dense diet, as well as supplements through a Naturopathic Doctor, to strengthen my immune system.  Depending on how aggressive the tumor was, the likelihood of your mom having a recurrence is about 15% over the next 5 years. That means there's an 85% chance she'll never get another breast cancer \u2014 without any further treatment than surgery. It comes down to a choice between quality vs. quantity of life. If your mom's life is uncomfortable because of the side-effects she's experiencing, it seems reasonable for her to stop taking the drug and follow whatever diet makes the most sense to her. You might want to check out www.breastcancerchoices.org for info on a variety of treatment approaches being used by many women (and some men) who've opted not to follow the \"standard of care\". The upshot \u2014 IMO \u2014 is that your mom will be fine without the hormone blocker. But I refused to take it myself, so I'm biased.",

Far too many doctors don't discuss the side effects of what they recommend for treatment (even worse, many aren't familiar with the side effects).

      "Content": "From what I've read, estrogen enters the body in different foods. Soy is a major \"estrogen creator\". Estrogen is stored in the body's fat, so if you've got fat to lose, it'd be good to lose that (not that I've succeeded myself)! Alcohol forces the liver to process alcohol first, so the estrogen from foods can go unprocessed and be released back into the body. So cooling it on alcohol is also wise (not that I've fully succeeded in that either!). Finally, estrogen isn't the only contributing factor to breast cancer. There are ER- breast cancers. So far, to my knowledge, no one has yet figured out what causes the different kinds of breast cancer. My opinion: do what feels right for you, and keep all your thoughts as possible as you can (your thoughts affect your cells). Best of luck!  ",

      "Content": "There seems to be compelling evidence that curcumin can stop and/or reverse breast cancer. Curcumin is found in tumeric, and in also available in supplement form. As a 4 time breast cancer survivor (all of them different, so all of the \"primary\"), I take a supplement called Meriva, as well as a teaspoon of organic tumeric each day. The tumeric is available at your local health food store or from Amazon. It's oil soluable and needs a little help getting into the cells, so I take it mixed in some olive oil and with a pinch of fresh ground black pepper (reported to open the cancer cell walls). For a bit more info on tumeric, here's a link to a page with a lot of info: http://www.breastcancerchoices.org/curcumin.html If you're on Facebook, here's a page with many (MANY) posts about supplements and other approaches to cancer treatment / prevention (be sure to scroll!):  https://www.facebook.com/BreastCancerBandits I also take AHCC (a mushroom extract), Indolplex (helps regulate estrogen levels) and 5,000iu D3. If you haven't seen a Naturopathic Doctor, I highly recommend you do. A good one can get you on supplements and homeopathic treatments that could help. A well trained ND also offers acupuncture which (in my experience) works miracles for pain management and treatment of systemic issues.  IMO, more radiation to the hip and lower back runs a high risk of increasing cancer malignancy. Here's just one article on the subject: http://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/07/22/researchers-d The carrot juice recommendations are good, but as one poster put it, if it worked for everyone we'd have a whole lot more carrot crops.

I had a double mastectomy 2 years ago, I chose not to have reconstruction, but it is certainly available. Answering for me: I had originally decided to have a double mastectomy after my third diagnosis but I found myself waking in the middle of the night with sweaty hands, heart pounding, and in tears. This went on for several weeks until I decided to go with a lumpectomy instead. I slept just fine after that. I looked into reconstructive surgery (including meeting with the plastic surgeon) and ultimately opted against it when I read the potential side-effects, and stories of women living with them. I know my body well enough to be 99% certain that if it's \"rare\", it'll happen to me. I'm still experiencing fatigue from the radiation I got for my first breast cancer. It's like hitting a wall of sleepiness that sends me to bed for 8 hours or more. That first happened after my 2nd radiation treatment \u2014 when I had 31 more to go. Fatigue is a known side-effect of radiation while you're getting it, but it usually sets in toward the end of treatment. I got it early. The after effects I'm experiencing are, of course, rare. I learned from my first diagnosis (over 11 years ago) that my body is very loud at letting me know what it needs (and doesn't need). That's why I didn't get chemotherapy with any of my breast cancers. I researched it to make sure I wasn't letting emotion dictate my intellectual choices and it turned out that \u2014 for me \u2014 the \"five-year disease-free survival\" statistics haven't justified chemo. It's been 11 years and that breast cancer hasn't recurred, although two others have developed (the latest in the radiated breast). In other words, I'm dealing with my body as I've come to know it, and I'm at peace with my approach. There are no guarantees of disease free survival \u2014 even after a double mastectomy \u2014 so peace is a good place to land. After three distinctly different brease cancers, my focus is on quality, rather than quantity, of life. I realize I've taken a non-mainstream approach, but I also know I'm typically at the extreme of the bell curve... which is to say that what happens to me isn't what happens with the majorty of patients (even my doctors concur). I've come to accept this and am at peace with it as well.  Hope this helps ;)",

Radiation would follow lumpectomy but not mastectomy. Having trouble deciding which way to go.  Has anyone had 3 lumpectomies?   Hi Verna, I had my third lumpectomy last September, with no additional treatment. The first was in 2000 (Stage 1, triple negative)... surgery followed by radiation. The latest was in the SAME previously radiated breast, but was a distinctly different type of breast cancer. In fact, all three lumpectomies have been to remove three different primary breast cancers. It's hard to tell from your post if you're experiencing on-going recurrences. If so, my input might not be as useful to you as you'd like. Treatment protocols for breast cancer have changed a lot over the last 5-6 years. I'm assuming you really mean DIC (and not DCIS). If it is an on-going recurrence, you've got an insistent cancer there. Even after a mastectomy, breast cancer can form on the chest where the breast was removed. Statistically, a lumpectomy + radiation is the same as a mastectomy. Both have side effects.  Given your age, some treatments (including chemo) can lose their efficacy. My recommendation is to ask your surgeon or oncologist for clinical trial study summaries on patients similar to you (in age, type of breast cancer, etc.), as information for you to consider as you make your decision. The summaries should give you an idea of what's worked best and for how long. Personally, at age 62, I've turned down additional treatment (post surgery) because the side effects would substantially impact my quality of life. But each of us is different, and you (like all of us) need to feel comfortable with your treatment decisions. If you haven't already moved forward, I wish you well with it.
