Anyone else?? Thanks, Ruth       Dear Ruth, After receiving treatment for breast cancer (Stage 1-2 invasive ductal) I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  It seems that I was hypothyroid (Hashimotto\"s) and had pappillary thyroid cancer.    The only reason I am mentioning this is that you may want to get your thyroid checked ,  not that you have another cancer, but that there is a connection for some women with thyroid problems and breast cancer   Any thyroid issues can make you extremely tired and unable to completely heal.  If you have not done so already you may want to see an endocronologist as they are prepared to do better testing for thyroid levels ( simple blood test)  The right Dr. can make all the difference.  I wish you well and send you healing thoughts. It is three years later for me and I am finally feeling like myself again.  Let me know if you want more information..Mimi Thanks Mimi: I'll check into the thyroid issue.  ",
