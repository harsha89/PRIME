    "Content": "Go to another doctor.  AND CONTINUE to go to other practioners until they find out what is wrong with you.  You may have a fungal infection in your ear and not a bacterial one.  That happened to me and for months on end I suffered until I finally saw a doctor who fixed my ear in one visit!!!  Don't give in to \"we can't find out specifically what your problem is\".  Good luck in your search for help - it is there - you just have to find it!!!",
