      "Content": "Hi, I am a 31 year old mom of 2. I have been told by a breast specialist that i have some fibrocrstic tissue in my left breast, but lately my right breast seems to be a bit larger than my left breast. I don't know if it matters or not but I don't get normal periods and havent had one this month I am about a week late and am not sure if this could be related, I plan on going to the doctors I just wanted to get some info on what this could possible be before I go. I don't have any other symptoms.",
