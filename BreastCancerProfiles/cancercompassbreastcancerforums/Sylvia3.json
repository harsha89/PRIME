      "Content": "I first located this message board back in September 2008.. I wrote about my sister, 45 years old battling breast cancer for the second time.. Since then she has been in and out of the hospital.. Her pain unbearable to see and hear.. Now I just found out that the cancer is spreading so quickly now in her liver and brain, her whole body is completely swollen.... The doctors told me in Aug that she had six months and the only thing they can do is keep her as comfortable as possible.... I try to function and I  try to remain strong for her husband and young son... My sister's faith is so strong and yes I have prayed for a miracle to be granted to her, and I have prayed for her to be confortable...  Now she is back in the hospital after the doctors punctured her lung when they were draining some fluid... She is on oxygen now, and her pain medication has increased considerably.. They are once again moving her into a Palliative care unit soon... She is so fragile and it truly breaks my heart to see this again...I want to believe she is going to have a bit more time with us, I want to believe she will overcome this, I want to believe,,, I really want to believe... At times I feel terrible that I pray for her to live longer but I upset myself when I know she is in so much pain...  I can imagine you all have had those mixed emotions from time to time....  ",

      "Content": "My mother passed away with breast cancer 19 years ago at a young age of 58.  Now my sister who is 45 is passing away with Breast cancer.  My deared sister went through Breast cancer 10 years ago and has been in remission until last year.  The second time she decided to pursue the Alternative medicine route. and faithly followed everything in everyway.. Unfortunately, she was getting much worse and the cancer has spread. She is presently in hospital and has been admitted for two months; however, our healthcare system is like any industry short staffed and others who are passing away sooner need the bed in Palliative care.  She will be discharged in a couple of weeks to spend her last few months with her husband and their seven year old son.  Oh, I am truly worried and I know they are all scared. They have no close family near where they live, so they are so much on their own.  I have made arrangements for Home care and if it is decided that she simply can not manage on her own they may have to consider a Care home setting.  I just arrived back from a visit with her, as I fly to see her once a month for a few days..  How do I deal and how do I help my nephew and brother-in-law to cope.  My sister has a very strong faith and she has an amazing positive outlook... God Bless her..   ",
