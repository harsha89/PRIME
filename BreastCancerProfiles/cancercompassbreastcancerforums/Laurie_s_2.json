    "Content": "Hi Lou, Yes, do go to CTCA. My husband had a good experience there with an oncologist named Dr. Kelly, who does treat breast cancer. But we were amazed at how caring and well informed everyone we met there was. They really want to do \"patient centered medicine\" and they have made tremendous progress along that path. Be well. Don't worry; they will help you figure out insurance and all. If you find that you cannot go there, find someone else you feel trusting of. Don't go back to doctors that you feel uneasy about. It's your body! blessings Laurie",
