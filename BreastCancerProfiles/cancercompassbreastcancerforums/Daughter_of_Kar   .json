    "Content": "This is my first post.  I am sorry to be here but I just lost a friend to mel and so I take cancer very seriously.  Today my mother saw the Dr. she has 3 nodules in L breast and will go for high contrast MRI on Friday.  We are not in a large metro area and I am wondering if the Dr's/hospitals and care are sufficient or if we need to get her to NYC or Boston (both within 4 hours of where we live) for evaluation.  She is supposed to see a surgeon on Monday so I guess her Dr. suspects something... Thanks so much for any advice about how to handle these next few appointments.   Love and Light, DOK",
