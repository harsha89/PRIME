      "Content": "hello Barbara  Yes I have twice had a lump in my armpit which subsequently turned out to be malignant breast tumors...that's despite me having had a mastectomy and axillary clearance years before... This is because the breast is tear shaped and the tip ends under the armpit and it's impossible for surgeons to absolutely say they have removed EVERY cancer cell. Having said all that, more than likely the lumps are harmless and benign...but the ONLY way to be sure is to insist they are removed surgically and sent to the lab for analisis...I have had a false negative result twice from both needle biopsis and , before the mastectomy, mammograms.  I am 65 and have had breast cancer 4 times (over 20 years) in the same breast, the last time 5 weeks ago  (I had a tumor removed from under my arm) and i am now on a new Chemo type drug Faslodex for a few months before more surgery. Over 20 years I have had many operations, 5 years on Tamoxifin, 3 years on Aromatise Inhibitors , Femera etc, and am allergic to all of them...I've also had 2 x 10 week treatments of Radiotherapy and 6 months Chemo  I haven't let it stop me from travelling to England from Australia to visit my daughter and her first baby, my first grandchild, to help out where i can.  I have had to cut my time there short from 5 months to 2 months...and will be returning to Aus in Oct for further surgery.  I trust in both medical science and prayer to keep me safe and well...and I expect to live many more years to enjoy my family. The best advice I would give anyone with any lump is...HAVE IT REMOVED for analisis, then you will never be left with an untreated cancer. My very best wishes to you Barbara...I hope your lump proves to be nothing nasty... Jackie    ",

      "Content": "Yesterday I started to take Aromasin...I am hopeful that I won't get the terrible side effects that I have had while taking Femera for 3 years...aching bones, carpel tunnel, unable to sleep, sore cracking lips, excema around my eyes!!!  Before that I had taken Arimadex for 6 months but had  a rash all over my body.  Prior to that I took Tamoxifen for 4 1/2 years but it caused me to become incontinent!  Also caused  thickening of lining of uterus resulting in me having to have a C&D...and leg cramps at night!!  But immediately I stopped taking Tamoxifen the incontinence stopped and have not had that problem since. But although I'm now a young 65 (so my friends and family tell me) taking Femera made me feel 100 years old! I do hope Aromasin will be easier on my body. I first had breast cancer at age 45 in 1989 and had a lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy.  I had BC again, same breast in 1993...this time had mastectomy followed by 6months chemo.  The third time, same breast despite having had mastectomy (under armpit) different type breast cancer.Another lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy. Soon after i had 2 x Melanomas removed!!  Followed by a Basal Cell Carsinoma...skin cancer. THEN my doctors put me on Tamoxifen...and so the adjuvent therapy adventure began...who would ever think such a tiny pill could cause such pain...WHY and HOW I'd like to know??? But be encouraged...I'm still here and active with a great life after 20 years since the forst cancer appeared. And more cures are being discovered all the time...there is always hope. ",

      "Content": "Hello Philip  you asked about breast reconstruction for your wife.  I know when I went through breast rreconstruction 15 years ago, it was a very good thing for me. However, in retrospect, had I known, I would have insisted on silicone implants, rather than saline, as they have become rather 'ridgey'. But despite that the result has been good and at 65 I am reluctant to undergo more surgery.  For my procedure a muscle was moved from my back to form the support for the implant.  The op was long and recovery uncomfortable, in that one feels very 'tight' and can't move much for a few days. But WELL WORTH it!!  I wish your wife well God bless Jacqueline   however in",

      "Content": "Hello I had to stop taking Arimadex after 6 weeks as I got a rash all over.  I was then put on Femera and was ok to begin with but after 18 months began to ache all over, bone pain, stiff hands in the night and morning, many floaters in eyes, depression, night cramps, carpel tunnel syndrome,gout and insomnia and lately sore cracked lips and excema around the eyes....I am 65 but felt 100!!  After 3 years I have been taken off the Femera and put on Exemestane but then had a mouth full of mouth ulcers.  I stopped taking that 2 weeks ago and after various tests have just today been diagnosed with Hip Bursitis and Fibromyalgia (which covers most of the above symptons!)...next week I'm to have Cortizone injections in my hips...and maybe then I'll be able to get a good night's sleep. Prior to Arimadex, Femera and Exemestane I had taken Tamo xifen for almost 5 years resulting in Incontinece (which cleared up immediately I stopped taking it), and also a thickening of the lining of the Womb...resulting in me having a D&C and not taking it any more.  Prior to all these drugs I had had a double mastectomy followed by 6 months chemo therapy, but nevertheless still had an agressive breast tumor pop up close to the very top of the breast...not quite under the arm....4 years after the double mastectomy!  I was subsequently told that the doctors can NEVER say absolutely that they have got EVERY breast cell!  But with a positive attitude and lots of supportive prayer I am still here 20 years after my first (of three) diagnosis of breast cancer and also 2 x Melanomas and 2 X Basal cell carcenomas!  And I am about to become a granny and a wonderful new time of life is still to be enjoyed! Every good wish...there is a big life to live after cancer. Jacqueline XX         Prior to these three drugs I took",
