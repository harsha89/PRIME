    "Content": "Hi, My wife was diagnosed with Stage 4 BC at age 32, 12-6-04. Mets to lymph nodes throughout. It spread to the brain and spine. She's gone through chemo (TAC regimine), rads to the chest and whole brain. Bi-lateral surgery w/ nodes also. She is currently doing rads to the spine and just started taking Temador for the brain tumors that are growing again. She is strong physically and emotionally. Much more so than me I am afraid. Anyway, ref. the prognosis for Stage 4 BC. I asked the nursing coordinator what the prognosis was when we first went there. She said that no one is born with an expiration date stamped on them or with a set of instructions. Everyone handles various treatments differently. The key is to stay positive and always have hope. I know this is not easy, but it is all I have sometimes. Hope and prayer. www.lisawillsurvive.com",
