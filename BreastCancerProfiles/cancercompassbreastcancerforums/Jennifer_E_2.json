    "Content": "Hi Lynette, I too am experiencing lymphedema in the breast I had a lumpectomy on. Mine occurred following radiation. That breast is now two cup sizes larger than my other one. My doctor has said let's wait and see as well. He said the swelling may never go down and that the only real risk is the possibility of infection. He did say that breast massage may help, however I have not tried that. At this point it does not cause me any discomfort except if I lay on my stomach. I did have to purchase a lumpectomy prosthesis to fill out the other side of my bra. Unfortunately I don't seem to have any more info than you do. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. I had never heard of anyone else who had experienced this, and my radiation oncologist told me she had never seen it before. Please let me know if you recieve any more info! Jennifer",
