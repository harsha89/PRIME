The doctor and the 2 nurses talked to me and told me what to expect. They showed me the lesion on my mammograms. I got on the table put my boob through the hole. There was a lot of stretching my boob a lot of squeezing my boob. A lot of pain every time they adjusted and re-adjusted everything. It was an hour of being uncomfortable. Every time they tried to get the lesion to show up it did not work, OMGosh! So they took me into the room with the stand up mammogram and took a few shots after a lot of squeezing and there was the lesion. This time the doctor said it was an 11.4mm by a 6.3mm. Then they put me in a room while 2 radiologists looked at my mammogram. two doctors came back with two nurse s. They said that the lesion is not a cyst, and it does not look like cancer. They said that they cant find it when I lay down on the boob table. They said that they will monitor it, that I am to come back in 6 months to see if there is any growth. Boy was my estranged husband pissed. (He wants me out of the house but not if I have cancer or something like that.) Oh they also told me to stop looking at articles I find on the internet. I am to go back in on August 1st and they say if there is any growth they will biopsy it that day. HOW are they going to biopsy it in August when they cant biopsy it now??? It is right next to my pectoral muscle and they cant see it when I lay down and cant get at it. WTHeck??? My husband is pissed he wants me to go see another doctor. I hope he has the money to pay for all of this because I don't. OMGosh...any body have any advice? Hi! I had a lump they were watching for 6 mo. I told them I had the feeling something was not right and wanted to see a surgeon. Went to the surgeon who was also \"comfortable\" watching. 6 months later it was cancer after they biopsied it. I had a lumpectomy it was stage 1 with no cancer in the lymph nodes. I am now doing chemo and radiation. The only thing I can tell you hon is be your own advocate. If you are worried get a second opinion and forget about the bills.... this is your life. You can make payments like everybody else but take care of yourself and get it checked out. The reason they dont like to biopsy is because it does injure the breast more. They showed me my ultrasound from 6 months ago and it definitely changed shape(like a star) and grew. Good luck and God bless you... Lori",

It is very unusual for me NOT to have done that, but, I honestly felt that I had no choice about taking this drug...just something that was a \"must\"after lumpectomy and 37 radiation treatments. I never related my terrible \"unwellness\"to Arimidex. Until taking this drug, I really felt very well physically and mentally. In retrospect, I am able to trace the \"unwellness\"to this drug...elevated b/p and glucose readings...very poor memory which had always been very good...bone/muscle pain that seemed to increase \"overnight\"to the point where I thought that I had fibromyalgia (although I have never been sure exactly what this was...just knew of the awful pain which I was now experiencing. Perhaps most alarming was the EXTREME FATIGUE...literally dragging myself around on a daily basis...sleeping throughout the day. I have just about decided to opt for quality of life rather than quantity. Of course, at my age (85) that is probably a \"no-brainer\". It just seems to me that my doctor should have taken so many factors into consideration when he prescribed Arimidex...age...stage one...early detection...lumpectomy...radiation...no need for an oncologist. .even stating that I no longer had cancer. I just feel that this happens to be his protocol for all his patients. I will see him this coming week and will ask these same questions. Throughout my life, I have always put my doctors on a pedestal...have always followed their instructions, etc. but, I feel that it is time for me to assert myself...to advocate for myself...that perhaps, in my case, I just MAY know best. Of course, that remains to be seen...but, I have just about opted for that quality vs. quantity. It has been a difficult decision for me even though I have some positive factors in my favor. I stopped taking the drug about 5 weeks ago, and I have to say that I am feeling SO much better. Again...I always want to emphasize that we are all different with different aspects of this cancer, and we have to be guided by many factors. My question is: Is there any \"proof\"that this drug absolutely prevents recurrence; or, that by not taking it, we are assured of non-recurrence? Is there anyone who has taken it and still has had a recurrence? What is the percentage of recurrence in those who opt NOT to take it and those who DO opt to take it? From my research...reading so many women's reviews about this drug, it just seems that those who are cancer-free after the prescribed 5-years relate this to having taken the drug..but, isn't it possible that one could be cancer-free...not because of taking the drug but simply because the cancer, itself, was not going to recur? I know this is long...thank you for \"wading through\" it...I just hope for the best...for all of us...Virginia Thank you for your thoughts on Arimidex. I am just finished with chemo and starting radiation soon and my oncologist wants me to start the drug and I am seriously thinking of not taking it and taking my chances. I still continue to have muscle and joint pain from the chemo( last chemo May) and she told me  Arimidex has that side effect. I just now got over the extreme fatigue from chemo which is the worst. I'm with you and your thinking... maybe the cancer was just not going to come back anyways, maybe it wasnt the drug. God bless you with good health, we are in His hands anyways:)  Lori",

They don't say enough about chemo side effects or radiation. I guess it doesn't matter because I would have gone with it anyways but have you considered acupunture? for the fibro? I have friends who swear by it. When I am done with all treatments I am going for some and a complete cleanse. Something to think about. My prayers are with you... you are too young for all this....  God's peace. Lori",
