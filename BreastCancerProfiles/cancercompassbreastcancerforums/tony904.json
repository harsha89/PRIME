After seeing 2 doctors ,the third one managed to take blood ,an ultra sound , an a mammagram . One week later a biopsy was taken ,I had cancer in my lymphnodes (9) of them . This was determined by surgery left breast taken off and (9) lymphnodes taken out. I've had 8 major chemos/ 33 radiations .I was out of work for one year, I NEVER gave up ! I made sure that every day there was something to keep me occupied ! I really had one of the best oncologist that was ! Most of all the best WIFE that GOD could give any man ! She stood by me through the entire event ' til this day she still does ! I've returned to work , I have lymphfodemia in my left arm ! It swells , but I continue to work So far there has not been a return of the cancer . But , I live for today not tomorrow !
