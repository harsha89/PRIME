    "Content": "My mother has stage IV breast cancer too; we found out late last year.  She didn't even know she had cancer until her spine fractured in a minor car accident; so you can imagine the shock of it to everyone.  I remember her telling me  on the phone that she had some paperwork from the doctor in the mail and read it.  This was the paperwork with her scan results which \"found suspicious lytic lesions that looked like metastasis\".  English is not my mom's first language so I am always there to help her, even though she lives in Florida now.   I remember how she read that line and I was dumbfounded, and chills ran down my spine; poor mom was still in a good mood because she did not know the English word 'metastasis'.  I knew the doctor would not use that term in a report and would not direct my mom to more specialists for any old  reason.  I remember trying not to scare her as I had to try to translate what this may have meant;I remember how we both broke down in tears and how she said \"it finally got me...\".  I remember how our lives turned upside down that day.   She is on Arimidex now and as of yesterday I have been scared to death and worried because she is complaining of heartburn and fullness where the liver is; we are all so scared  and pray to God that it is not liver mets.  I am trying to be strong for her and not cry in front of her so she can stay strong.  I don't know what this journey will bring, but I am working on my relationship with God to help me deal with it and to be there for my mother when she needs me.  I pray she will be around many more years so we can still do the things together that we always wished to do, like take a cruise.  I know this disease is a monster, but I also know my mother is a fighter, and I am too so I can help her fight stronger.  I know all the families, friends and especially the ones with the cancer, are all courageous warriors who will win in the end; no matter how it ends.  I pray for my mother and all who have to deal with this and have dealt with it in the past.  God Bless.",
