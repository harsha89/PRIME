    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 3 er/pr +  her2- in February 2016. Received chemotherapy and radiation. This was hard on my body but have started to gain my strength back.  In May I attended a meeting and my breast was sore and started to swell. This was on a Friday and by Sunday I had to go to ER. Admitted for IV antibiotics and drainage of fluid from breast. Then a pocket developed on the outside of breast and small incision was made. Now we are packing the whole every day.  Has anyone ever had this?",
