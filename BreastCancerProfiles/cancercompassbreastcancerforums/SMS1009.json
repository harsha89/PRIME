      "Content": "Hi everyone I am posting this for my MOM She is 70 yrs old and had been in breast cancer remission for 7 yrs This past December her cancer is back. They put her on arimidex but when she got the blood work back it wasnt doing a thing. The tumors on her spine had grown. Now they are trying fulvestrant for 30 days and if that doesnt change anything they will have to do chemo Has anyone ever been in this boat and if so any advice? Thanks Susanne     ",
