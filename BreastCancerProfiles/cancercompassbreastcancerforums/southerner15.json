      "Content": "Well, I made it through everything okay.   Abused some oxycontin and just paid the price (vomited) six hours post last pill.  Anyway, the table did leave a lot to be desired, so glad my boobs are not any smaller than they are.  Didn't really feel the needle go in, just when they were taking samples and it wasn't too bad.  I would go through it again, minus one pill.  LOL  Now the agonizing wait for results. Thanks for all of your prayers and inputs. Jacqueline.",

      "Content": "Carolyn, Tomorrow is the day (Thurs).  I'll let you know what I think.  I'm going to take a hydrocodone tonight and tomorrow--not that it will do any good since I take it periodically for my shoulder and except for when I took two (script said one or two) and I ended up sitting at my desk with my eyes rolling around.  I had a conversation with self that went like this:  I need to go home, but I can't drive (still obviously rational though).  Ended up vomiting and then was okay and went home.  LOL  Never have taken two at the same time since. The things we have to endure to make sure we are okay sometimes is not fun. Get back with you later. Jacqueline     ",
