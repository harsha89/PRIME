    "Content": "Six months ago I had an ultrasound after noticing a thicker, lumpier area in one breast (no mammogram because I'm only 29) and they found a probably benign mass they wanted to keep an eye on, so I just went in for a follow-up a week ago. During my visit they were able to tell me it hasn't gotten bigger and scheduled me for another follow-up ultrasound in 6 months to keep checking on it, so I went home in relief thinking that was the final word for now and there was no reason to worry. Now my doctor contacted me and is having me schedule a consultation with a surgeon to get their opinion about whether waiting six more months is okay. I'm getting kind of nervous because I didn't expect this and don't know what it means. Should I expect I might have to have a biopsy or what? The appointment has to wait a couple weeks because I'm out of town, so I'm really hoping they're just being extra careful and this isn't urgent.",
