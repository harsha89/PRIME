      "Content": "My mother in law had breast cancer almost 10 years ago. Double masectomy, chemo and radiation. She was just recently diagnosed that the cancer has returned in her lungs. (Stage 4 breast carcenoma.) Now results are showing it is in her spine and vertabrae with chemo treatment starting this friday. Other than experiences with her almost 10 years ago Im not really educated her illness. What are we looking at? Is what she has possible to treat? Or are we just looking at extending her life span?",
