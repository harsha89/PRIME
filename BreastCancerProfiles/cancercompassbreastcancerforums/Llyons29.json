    "Content": "I am 49 years old and for a while now my left nipple has itched and sometimes has a sharp pain and I have pain in my left arm pit that seems to radiate down my arm and into my hand. At night my skin, especially my legs itch so bad that I feel like I could scratch them to the bone. I am so terrified to get checked. I am currently taking care of my husband who has advanced clear cell carcinoma from his kidney. He has had two surgeries since July to have tumors scraped from his spine, which has left him (prayerfully) temporarily unable to walk, so he is wheel chair bound. I am scared to make the dr's appt to be checked. I was admitted to the hospital for what I thought was a heart issue. I woke up with a very sharp pain down my left arm and in my hand with pains in my chest. They did a CT scan with dye, if there was something there, would they have seen it then, or were they just focused on my heart? Any advice or help would be appreciated. I have had to postpone my follow up with my cardiologist for a stress test because of my husband needing me and his treatments. Thank you and God Bless you all!",
