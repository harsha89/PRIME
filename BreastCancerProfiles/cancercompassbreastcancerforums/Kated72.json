    "Content": "Hi - yes, after extensive research, I chose to have my surgery done by PRMA.  My primary surgeon was Dr. Pisano - and he was wonderful.  In my case I was having a bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction using DIEP flaps.  I traveled from Seattle to San Antonio to have the surgery, and it was the best decision I could have made.  The whole staff was wonderful and very helpful.  My results exceeded my hopes. In my case, Dr. Pisano was able to save my nipples, which I had been told by other surgeons was not possible.  I also had the nerve reconnection done which means I have sensation and feeling in my reconstructed breasts.  The doctors at PRMA have incredible experience and their success rate is one of the best, if not the best in the country. From my perspective, everything was great.  If I had to come up with a con, it would only be the distance I had to travel - but it was worth it to get the best reconstruction results possible.",
