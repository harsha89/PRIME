    "Content": "Dear all, At 18 years old I noticed a lump in my left breast after a bar that I didnt saw schocked it. At 19 i understood it could be a lump and that could be a sign of breast cancer because a friend of mine was talking about this cancer. I decided to do nothing about it. Now I am 25 years old and because of work this year I used to sleep under 4-5 hours a day for 3 month in a row. And I was really stressed by the working atmosphere. After around 1 month with a disturbed sleep pattern the lump grow bigger but I continue my work. After I read that sleep deprivation and shift work can increase breast cancer. Now I try to not sleep on my belly cause I feel pressure on the lump. Sleeping on my left side can be also uncomfortable. I sleep quite a lot during the day. I feel my body is kind of weak. I will not do as much sport as before or carry for a long time heavy things with my left arm. Are these part of the untreated breast cancer synptoms? I just had a little red point appearing on my breast few month ago. It didnt grow bigger since. I feel part of the lump is kind of just under the skin. Could it be a start of ductal carcinoma on my outter skin? I choose to do nothing 7 years ago. I even forgot about it with the time. But now that it seems to wake up I am just questionning what to expect next? which symptoms? and at which spead? I didnt find a lot of information on how goes untreated breast cancer. Sincerely, Kaylina",
