      "Content": "I posted this yesterday just thought I would change subject to give a clearer picture  I was recently in hospital for severe double pnuemonia they did a ct scan of chest to check on pnuemonia which showed a 11mm nodule with soft tissue involvement which could represent carcinoma since hospitals do not do mammograms as as inpt a surgeon was consulted and he ordered an ultrasound the ultrasound showed a 2cm hypoechoic mass with minimal shadowing but irregular margins grade 4 suuspicion of breast carcinoma biopsy reccomended  dr also reccomended mammogram at same institution where I had previous mammogram so they could compare, I had mammo today and doc said that there was a mass on my last mammo in same place so not to be concerned but to check with doctor to see if biopsy warranted  anyone else have a similar experience??  it seems strange to me that mass was suspicious on ct scan and ultrasound but not mammo I feel like I am stuck in limbo...celebrate or still be scared I appreciate any info that anyone has",

      "Content": "No they did not .....I am 40 but started having mammos at 35 because I had a benign mass in my 20's so doc recommended I start early Every mammogram I have had they say my breasts are dense so I need an ultrasound which gets done immediately after and has always been ok Today they did not do one since I just had ultrasound In hospital 3 weeks ago I called a surgeon when I got home that a friend used and loved she is in vacation so nurse said to go to my gyno without delay get yet another breast exam and see what he says and perhaps he can refer me to a surgical center for biopsy",
