    "Content": "fantansic....i'm a newbie, learned a lot and have a long way to go...being informed is everything, i mean everything. My husband and I only have one health plan...it's the VA, he is a veteran, yet we really do not have the best plan in the world, yet, so far, so good, a trade off with us is, okay, I take him to the best in the world,  lose our home, lose our savings (which is nominal) and beat the heck out of cancer...my day's are hard to keep up with, 4 months ago, we were getting by....average people, we are, the big C came into our lives and spilled over into all kinds of challenges, IT took our regular normalcy away..we are on the upside with dave's cancer, yet it simply took us into a place that i never would have imagined, our future?  i cannot say, our present time...we just battle on in a strange place that i never, ever knew existed, until now. much love, tawny",
