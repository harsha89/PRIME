    "Content": "I've been on Arimidex for 3 years and a bit. I find that Omega Three (fish oil) relieves my joint  pains almost entirely. I also had very debilitating hot flashes. I took Femarelle  (non-prescription) for hot flashes (it's a compound of soy and flax) and it helped for a couple of years, and then stopped working. Now I take clonidine HCl 25 mcg (nb micro) one in the morning and one at night and that does the trick.",
