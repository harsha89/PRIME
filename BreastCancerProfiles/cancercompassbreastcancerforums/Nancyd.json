    "Content": "My first experience with breast cancer was 8 yrs ago on my rt side. I had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. Margins were clean and 23 lymph nodes were clear. The tumor was estrogen receptive. I was in a clinical trial (tamoxifen vs. arimidex) for 5 years. Life was good and cancer was supposedly gone. This past June I started to have headaches. Soon after, a lump like a \"goose egg\" appeared on the left side of my skull. I had it removed in August and it was shown to be metastasized breast cancer. A PET scan found further tumors in my lung, thyroid and right hip. What I thought was arthritis in my hip was the cancer eating away the bone. Last week I had surgery to have rods put in to stabilize it and hopefully ward off fractures. My Oncologist found out that I received Arimidex for my 5 year clinical trial and has put me back on it. I am also receiving an injection of Fulvestrant once a month. I would like to share experiences with anyone else who is going through this type of therapy.",
