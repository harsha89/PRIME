    "Content": "Dear EG    I had a lumpectamy for breast cancer in 2004. Took chemo and radiation. Doctor put me on Tomoxifin and a year on Herceptin. After finishing the Herceptin I was clear of cancer. And was put on Femera. Well the Femera did not do what is was suppose to do as a cancer preventative. Cancer is back and I was changed to Aromasin. Have not experienced and side effects. After 4 Chemo treatments and now on Aromison. My tumor count is down from 1300 to 76.  Miriam J",
