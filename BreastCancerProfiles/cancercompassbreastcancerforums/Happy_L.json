    "Content": "Yes, I too have bone cancer after breast cancer and liver cancer. I was on Tamoxifen and then my doctor put me on Taxotere but said the tumors were not shrinking as fast as he liked so he put me on Xeloda. I am doing much better and the side effects are minor. Peeling skin and some itching. Let me know too incase this drug doesn't work and good luck.",
