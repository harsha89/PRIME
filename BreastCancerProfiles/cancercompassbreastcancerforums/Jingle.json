    "Content": "Hi everyone,  I'm sorry if this post feels a little misplaced, but I couldn't find a category for fundraising information. I just wanted to let people know about our fundraiser for breast cancer awareness during the month of October.  We're donating one dollar (up to $25,000) to the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund for every new caller who uses 1-800-free411 in October.  For more information, including ways to share health information with family and friends, visit us at www.free411.com/pink.  My best wishes to everyone, Paul ",
