      "Content": "I'm in the exact same situation . Together for 17 years and I am just as lost as you . She had a boyfriend so I took upon myself to start dating as well . Just as I was feeling good about possibly moving on my wife pops up out of nowhere after not speaking for months and is all of a sudden nicer than nice. The last time we spoke I poured my heart out to nothing but cold blooded cruelty. Now again she has come out of nowhere to scramble my mind again . I never wanted any of this to begin with but she has destroyed the very foundation of trust and as much as I'd love be to have everything back to normal I just don't know if that ever wil be possible . She just lost her job and now has no insurance. Like all of you I'm sure this is very concerning. She has been very nonchalant about it . But I still worry. It seems like all rationality goes out the door after treatment. Am I wrong? Has anyone out there reconciled after all this?",
