      "Content": "I had a breast reduction about 17 years ago.  I am 47 and this is the first time my mammogram showed a questionable area at 11 o'clock on my right breast at mid-level depth.  I am having a compression mammogram and ultrasound on Monday.  Supposedly we have a 60% reduced risk since we had the reduction, but I just don't think there are enough studies.  At least I can't find much of anything online.  Wouldn't scar tissue show up pretty quickly?  Hard for me to believe that after 10 years you are just now having scar tissue.  I had a doc tell me I heal really quickly inside my body.  I've had several surgeries and complications from scar tissue because it develops so quickly in my body.  It may be something else entirely, like fibroids or cysts, but I doubt either of us just suddenly developed scar tissue after so many years have gone by.  Just my two cents.  What did your breast specialist have to say?",
