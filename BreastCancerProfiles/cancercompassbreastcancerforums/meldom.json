I was just wondering if anyone else finds these things really flipping annoying. I know it could be worse... But I feel like the bride of Frankenstein.. They are so uncomfortable.. Sleep is hard to come by.  It does get better, doesn't it? hi I just had my 3rd fill yesterday in two more weeks I will have another one bringing me to a size D very uncomfortable but the way I have to look at everything since I got cancer is that I only have a 30 percent chance of getting cancer in the future and even though I'm losing my house and everything else I've worked extremely hard for.Iam grateful for my family and friends who love me;) how big did you go?",

I  insisted that he take it out two days before my operation on my right breast which had DCIS . It  turned out that the lump in the left breast had cancer#!!! I had an MRI many mammograms and  many ultrasounds and it never showed anything. Listen to your body;)",
