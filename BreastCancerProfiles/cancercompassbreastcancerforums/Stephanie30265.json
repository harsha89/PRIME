    "Content": "I watched my mothers cancer go from breast 41/2 years later in her bones lung liver then not long it was in her brain throat intestines. I can not spell please forgive me. The 3 time I was being treated for breast cancer hers started stage 1 mine started stage 3 so I was scared. 4 years 2 months it is in my bones starting in my neck ribs shoulder blade down my spine pelvic and hip area real bad the hip pain is the worse it is in my lungs liver and adrenal gland. They give me 2 years if that. I am taking zomega and herceptin and arimidex. The arimidex is a pill everyday. the herceptin is every 2 weeks in a port like cemo the zomega is every 3 weeks in the port like cemo. For the pain we are still working on it I am on methadone right now but I have found that for me 800 mg of ibuprofen works good my doctor laughed but it really does I have alot of pain and it really works. I think it helps with the swelling around the infected area. Try it if the doctor says she can take it.It doesnot hurt to try. I am sorry to hear that she is like me AND I WISH HER WELL good luck",
