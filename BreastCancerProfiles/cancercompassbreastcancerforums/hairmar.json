    "Content": "i was diagnosed with breast cancer 2/06 had a partial mastectomy and oophrectomy(removal of ovaries) then radiation followed by chemo i was started on aromasin and took it for about 5months my joints ached so bad at night i would wake up with such severe pain in my elbows and fingers ,i felt crippled most of the time and i was only 45 i was worried what i was going to feel like when i got older ,i talked to my oncologist and we decided to try me on arimidex it took awhile but this seems to have worked for  me that severe pain stopped. i still have some pain but not untolerable and i developed osteopinia which i take fosamax for, except for the hot flashes which are pretty untolerable and i hope they subside in time(anyone have a replay to that)its absolutley better than having cancer. my prayers are with all and their families who have battled this disease mary",
