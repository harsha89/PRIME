      "Content": "I have been off of Arimidex for some time now and was placed on Letrozole generic for Femara.  I have had sever pain in my upper abdomen when ever I lay down or sit for any length of time.  Doctors can't find out what is wrong, in the mean time I am exausted because I sleep very little.  I never had this trouble before.  After I went through all the cancer treatment for breast cancer just one day I started with this pain.  Has anyone else experanced anything like this?   Does anyone know if it could be from the Letrozole.  Any ideas would be most appreacted.",
