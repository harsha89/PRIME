      "Content": "\"My own (uneducated) common sense tells me that if, after the first lump removed in 2012, that if her diet and herb treatment was successful, the second (new, non-recurring) lump would not have resulted.\" Ben, one thing to keep in mind is that \"new\" tumor was probably there in 2012, but could have been too small to be picked up on the scans.  Another thing to keep in mind is that alt care can be so much more than diet, supplements, and exercise, though those are important too.  My tumor stopped growing the second I went off sugar practically but it sounds like sugar was never an issue for your gf.   I have not had any conventional care since I was dx'ed back in 11/13, but I have had extensive holistic care that involved things like liver detox, mercury/lead chelation, and getting all my mercury fillings replaced.  I still have the tumor, though after each vitamin C IV I notice some shrinkage.   After all this though, I've come around to realizing that stress has been the main feeder of my cancer and I'm working very hard to deal with present stress and past emotional issues and there's where the truly hard work is.  A good book to read is Mind Over Medicine.  I've discovered EFT too, which may turn out to be the real lifesaver--literally!",

      "Content": "What kind of tips are you looking for?  Is she doing conventional care with maybe some complementary/alternative?  The first thing I did when dx'ed with ILC was to look start taking iodine supplements.  I have never done any conventional tx--only holistic and dx was 1.5 years ago.  I eat nothing with added sugar and have really cut down on dairy. Avoid and/or deal with stress. My treatment has actually been a lot more extensive than that, but that should get you started and I don't want to  post a lot till I know what you're looking for.  ",
