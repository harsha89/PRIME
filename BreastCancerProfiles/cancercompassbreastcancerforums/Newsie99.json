    "Content": "Hello-- I have IBC and it is difficult to detect-- I saw a bug-bite size mark on my breast and a good doctor figured it out the same day, here in London. I am doing a video programme for Al Jazeera-- if you google Everywoman \"Al Jazeera\" \"Diva Diaries\" you will be directed to a you tube version of the programme. spread it around. The fact is, there is no lump, other than getting an ultrasound you will not find it but look out for redness and ask a doctor-- if he prescribes a course of antibiotics or suspects mastitis, persist in questioning more. good luck.",
