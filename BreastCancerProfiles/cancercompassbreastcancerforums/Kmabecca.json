      "Content": "Hello all! I am back with an update of sorts. My Drs visit Monday started out very relieving. My \"bruise\" is just a pigment change in my skin, possibly from sun exposure. Nothing to really be alarmed about. But, since I was there and with my family history my Dr did a thorough exam. He felt something and ordered for a Mammogram. Again, staying the positive person I am and being fiber cystic. Not saying I wasn't nervous, but I had a mammogram on Wednesday. But waiting a week for results in the mail, makes your mind wonder. I am a bit angry to the fact that my Dr could find something that I missed. I faithfully do a self exam 2xs a week Wednesday & Sunday. I got my results in the mail today. I have already cried and am completely petrified. My mammogram needs further evaluation to check a specific area of interest. Not something I want to hear on a Friday night and not being able to set anything up until Monday when all the offices reopen. I am 34 and this is my second mammogram, due to family history. My 13 year old son just point blank asked me \"so do you have breast cancer\". I can't answer that...and it scares me. Of course I told him that I have to go into further tests and we will have to see. I explained how far medicine has come since my Grandmother lost her battle. Boy will this be one long weekend. I didn't shed a tear in front of my son. But, lord knows that now I am scared!!!Â  Becca",

      "Content": "I never had the oppurtunity to meet my Maternal Grandmother, she passed away due to breast cancer when my mother was 12. I am a 34 year old single mom of a 13yr old boy. I had a scare several years ago, but it was only my fibercystics flaring up. Thank The Lord and I confided in my mom. Her only crying plea was that her mother didn't pass her disease to me, because it has been known to skip generations. With research I believe I may have IBC and have made a Dr appt. I have had itching in my right breast similar to maybe a hair being stuck in my bra. I have also discovered an unexplained bruise that is about the size of a quarter, and it is textured (scaley). My appt isn't until Jan 8th at 9:20am. I have not confided in my mother yet on this upcoming appointment and really want to. Did her Mom's cancer start with bruising? I am very afraid right now, but refuse to worry anyone. I even joke about it with a few coworkers that know what is going on. One girl had bumped the left breast with her elbow and I said \"thats right just take out the good one\". She giggled and then got upset because I wasn't showing major concern. I am concerned, lord knows I have a preteen son to raise. I have cried in private but really can't talk to anyone yet. I have over a week to wait and decided to try this site and find some friends that I can open up to. I welcome any input!!! thanks :(",

      "Content": "Well, I have spoken with my Mom. It seems that my Grandmother had breast cancer that spread to her lungs or vise versa. My mom was only 12 when her death happened and she was the oldest child. My Grandfather is no longer with us. My mom said that we can't really worry unless we are told bad news. This will just make waiting for my appointment longer. She did mention that my grandfather had Malignant Melanoma. She brought that up after I showed her my light bruise and she noticed red blotches across my chest area. Well, I guess I just have to wait until Monday. Thanks to everyone for your feed back.

      "Content": "Wow! I just posted a message as \"Happy New Year! maybe not\". I am a very stubborn person and have experienced the itching you mentioned. Now I have an unexplained bruise. I have made a Dr appt but can't be seen until Jan 8th. I feel you should encourage your friend to go in for just a checkup and mention the itching to her Dr. It could just be hormonal changes or it could be the starting of something bigger that could lead to bruising. It is best to have a piece of mind, then to wake up with a bruise from no where. Please have her make an appointment. There are so many Survivors out there that can support her, yourself included. Maybe you can refer her to this site and have her read some of the messages. Becca",
