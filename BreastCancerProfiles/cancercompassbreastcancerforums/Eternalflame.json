      "Content": "Well surgery is over. Went great. Not so impressed with the nursing staff I personally dealt with. Having a medical background. I was so shocked. But poor pain control. I am much more painful than I thought. I have 3 drains, which I hate. They will hopefully be out tomorrow. But they have caused me much discomfort. I'm blessed to have the help I have. Pathology was, the cancer was bigger and more aggressive than expected. But margins are clear. So hopefully with chemo and radiation. I will recover.  Advise,  have a comfy spot, lots of pillows. Get your rest. But yet move around as tolerated. ",
