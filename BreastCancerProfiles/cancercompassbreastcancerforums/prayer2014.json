I have been utilizing PRAYER and alternative medicines w/the tamoxifen. And although, it's there's more bad news! I say \"the devil is a LIAR!!\" I'm not giving up without a fight!",

I get tendonitis regularly, I cant use a pull up bar at the gym, cant use weights either. Basically from the research I have done, mastectomy seems to re jig everything. It messes with nerves and tendons etc. I too am an athlete, runner, tennis player, in good shape for 56, but it is what it is. You have to learn to live with it! Better to be over the hill than under it! Best regards Paula Paula, I like your attitude, girlfriend! You ROCK! I've been diagnosed with late stage this year, and now have a tumor on my back. But like you said, \"it is, what it is!\" Just PRAY and live your life to the FULLEST! Because I know God is so GOOD, ALL the time! I like to workout too! And at 53, get complements on my legs. Praise the Lord I'm tall(6')! But you're right better to be over, than under! God bless!",
