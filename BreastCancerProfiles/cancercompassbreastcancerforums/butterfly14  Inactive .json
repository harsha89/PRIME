    "Content": "Hi--  I had a lumpectomy two months ago with one node positive.  I just had a PET scan last week to determine our course of action and am still waiting to hear back.  What will these results tell me? Is it possible to not have to go through chemo and only radiation if my PET comes back clear? My lump had clear margins with only one node +.  Waiting for the dr call is driving me nuts.  Thanks",
