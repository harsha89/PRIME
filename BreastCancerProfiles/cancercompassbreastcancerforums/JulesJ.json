    "Content": "This message is actually for anyone who has a prayer request. I would like to invite you or a loved one who would like support or would like to post a prayer request on our online bulletins, we would love to help.  We have many survivors, patients, and doctors who can offer help and advice. My grandmother died of breast cancer and I have a few family members who are affected by cancer.  I know just being able to talk  to others going through the same thing is helpful; the web address is www.circlesconnection.com, so please think about joining our cancer community. We would love to offer support in anyway possible.  God Bless.  ",
