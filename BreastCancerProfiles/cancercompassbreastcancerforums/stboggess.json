    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex for almost 5 years. Within the last 6months I developed symptoms that finally forced me to go the doctor (joint pain, swelling in hands and legs, intense itching in my legs, muscle cramps in legs and feet). She found my ANA level elevated 1:1280. Due to the associated symptoms she has referred me to rheumatology concerned that I have Lupus. I asked my oncologist if this can be related to the arimidex and he said no. I took myself off the arimidex for 2 weeks and have seen drastic improvement in symptoms. I am wondering if anyone else has had elevated ANA levels or lupus like symptoms on this medication? I'm hoping that it is just the medicine and not really Lupus.Â ",
