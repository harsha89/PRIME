    "Content": "Hi Ashley, I saw someone share this on a different forum before. They are offering this book for free which is normally being sold. The link still works!!!  So I wanted to share it with anyone who might need it.  It was written by an oncologist who wants to help breast cancer patients, those who fear of having the disease or family and friends of breast cancer patients. This should help answer a lot of your questions. Hope this helps! http://breastcancerhelpcenter.org/bonus/book-download/CpG",
