    "Content": "The current protocol recommends the above aromatase inhibitors.  I had severe bone pain with Arimidex, so have started Aromasin.  Joint pain, not as severe as with the first, sleeplessness, hot flashes (thought to have left behind me forever!!), ankles, feet, hands swollen.  Hobble a lot! My question is this.   DCIS with microinvasions. Why exactly do they think 5 years of this stuff is the hallmark.? I have read No INFO which suggests that 3 years wouldwork or 7years? Had wire insertion to locate cancer. (Awful) Had excisional biopsy, had further surgery for clear margins, sentinal node clear.  Had radiation.  Some fatigue which began to lessen until Arimidex. Much pain.  Change to Aromasin which I understand is also a steroid.  Is drug is worth 5 years of feeling miserable?  Next appt. intend to pick the Doc's brain, why?  How do you know?  Is my cancer such that 5 years of my life SHOULD be given over to this? Frustrated, Fanny   ",
