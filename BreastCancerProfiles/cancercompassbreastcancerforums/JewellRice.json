    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2005 and had my mastectomy the end of the month. I started my chemo ( 6 treatments )Â  and went through 36 radiation treatments finishing in March 2006. I had my other breast removed in May 2006, my cancer was stage 3-B so my doctor thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and have the right breast removed. I started Arimidex in April 2006 and have had joint pain especially in my upper arms. I have also had a couple of bouts with sciatica. One of my biggest concerns is my weight gain, When I was going through chemo I ended up with burning mouth syndrome and lost 20 lbs because I couldn't eat. I was on morphine for over 2 months. Now that I have gotten over the burning mouth the weight has really started to pile on. We live in the Midwest where you can't really do much walking in the winter, so I got a treadmill hoping that would help. I am taking a generic sleeping pill Zolpidem and it really helps although I wake up a couple of times in the night.",
