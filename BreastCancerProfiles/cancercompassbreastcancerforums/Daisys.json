    "Content": "Hi Everyone.  I recently found a lump and had a mammogram done.  During the mammogram they found another lump.  I went and had both lumps biopsied.  The lump they saw in the mammogram turned out to be benign.  The other lump is atypical and they scheduled me to have a lumpectomy this coming Monday.  I really think its cancer.  I'm ok with it because my doctor told me that if it is cancer it is very early.  She can tell by  the size.  What worries me is that I have cancer somewhere else in my body and it spread to my breast.  I don't know if this is possible and I'm probably just over thinking this, but none the less it is a concern of mine.  Does anyone know if this is possible?  That is, I could have cancer somewhere else and this lump in my breast is a result from that?",
