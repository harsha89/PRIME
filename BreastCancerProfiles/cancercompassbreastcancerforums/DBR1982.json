      "Content": "Hello, I have become very concerned with some slight skin changes on my breasts, and after googling have all but convinced myself that I ahve inflammatory breast cancer.  Any information or insight you might provide would be appreciated. Here are some of the changes I have noticed: -Several months ago I noticed that, after intimacy with my husband, I would break out in hives all over my breasts, neck, and torso.  The rash was red and itchy and would last for hours. -upon further inspection, I noticed that my breasts seem to appear slightly pink and very slightly mottled, especially on the underside. It also looks like they are slightly bumpy.  My husband does not notice this. -My breasts become very itchy at random times. any scratching, touching, or pressure causes irritation all over both breasts, and sometimes I break out in hives.  They also become red, warm, and swollen. -I noticed a few small spots that look like very tiny spider or vericose veins. They do not itch and are flat. I am so scared, as I read this is an aggressive, terminal cancer.  I am only 36 years old and have three small children, so the prospect is terrifiying.  My family history of cancer is extensive on both sides, but the only instance of breast cancer was my mother who had DCIS appoximately 9 years ago.   Thank you for reading and/or responding. ",
