The confusing thing is you hear different opinions about shadowing. Some docs say it is nothing to worry about , others say it could be a significant finding etc. It really is frustrating. Good luck to you, also. Linda   I will be thinking of you on the 1st, and may the sunshine, all day long, everything go right, and nothing wrong, May those you love bring love back to you and may all the wishes you wish come true. Good luck to you...........",

I had an ultrasound that showed a cyst and also an area of shadowing that was of great concern to my dr. I had a mammogram that showed \"something\" but I don't have the official report yet. I saw my surgeon again yesterday who did another u/s. The cyst is gone but the area of shadowing persists. He said if the shadowing is related to the cyst then it should resolve itself. He wants me to come back on Mar 1 for another u/s. If the shadowing is still present, he will do a biopsy.  I asked him if he thought this was a malignacy and he said he didn't know. He also said he is not comfortable waiting any longer than a month to see if it is resolved. Just curious if anyone else has had \"shadowing\" on an u/s and what it meant for you. Thanks for your help. Linda Dec. 06 I went in for my first mammogram, and 1 week later I received a letter from the hospital stating that my mam had shown some abnormalities and to contact my dr. office. I ignored that letter hoping that it was sent by mistake, but when my dr. office called to let me know that they had already scheduled me for a sonogram for the following week, well that made me realize that it wasn't a mistake. I went in for the sonogram, 1 week later as I got a call from the nurse stating that the results showed a shadow in my left breast and that the dr. ordered another sonogram for 6mos. So your question was \"what did it mean to you\" well I don't know how I should feel since I haven't told anyone in my family for fear of the unknown, I'd rather wait to see what happens in 6mos in the mean time I try to research as much as I can via internet, but anyways hope that everything goes well for you Linda.",

My question is that my doctor and insurance company decided it would be in my best interest to have sonograms done ever 6mos to see if there are any changes in my health. My next sonogram is slated for middle of august, but for the past 2 months I have felt pain pangs to that area, should I wait for my sonogram in august? Or should I tell my doctor? I thinking that its all in my head and that I should just wait for august. any input?",
