    "Content": "Decision making so I thought I would write to see if others have had the partial breast irradiation instead of the whole breast irradiation. Apparently, 90% of breast cancers recur at the same spot, so focusing on that area after a lumpectomy, is supposed to be a new approach. My tumour was less than 1 cm., so stage I, no lymphatic involvement, and clean margins up to 10mm. Unfortunately, it was a grade III or poorly differentiated. The accelerated treatment is for 5 days, 2 times a day instead of the whole breast which is 5xweek for 5 - 6 weeks. I want to do the best for myself, but many doctors are now doing \"shared decision making\" and will let the patient decide on the treatment after informing them of the pros and cons of each treatment. I've decided not to do chemo (increase survivor longevity by only 3%), I am taking arimidex. Any feedback would be appreciated, especially if you have gone through the accelerated, partial breast irradiation.",
