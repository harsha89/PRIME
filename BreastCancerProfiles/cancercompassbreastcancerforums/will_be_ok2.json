      "Content": "Hi Pat Z - I think we have all said that we couldn't make it, especially after the first one.  It's going to get easier, definitely not the best of times, but easier. The second night after my first treatment I woke up during the night and told my husband I quit!  I felt soo terrible that was never going back for more.  My oncologist told the nurse I was a flight risk and that she was going to have to get out the straps to give me the next treatment.  I found that having a friend or family member commit to meeting me there or going with me gave me something to look forward to also.  Sounds funny but the last couple were kind of fun because I knew the end was near.  You will get your routine of how you are going to feel down and muddle through it.  This too shall pass.  I finished February 9th 2009.  I did 8 dose dense rounds (every 2 weeks).  The hardest part was not being able to take care of my kids because the youngest was 3.  I read the chicken soup books and laughed and kept my spirits up when I could by laughing as much as possible.  Before you know it, people won't know if you were sick before, or just got a funny hair cut ( kind of where I am right now with a little hair on my head again).  If you get nauseous, by all means take the pills!  They were my saviors for that.  I took Lorazapam and Reglan together the first week after treatments along with the steroids.  Do what you have to and take what you have to in order to get through this.  You will be surprised at how fast you will bounce back to your old self when you finish. You'll be just fine.  Hang in there!   Andi",

      "Content": "Hi there - I am a veteran on this site for the last year and have gotten some great advice from you guys and gals.  Usual rundown...I am now 36, had a double mastectomy with immediate recon a year ago.  Permanent implants (silicone) are in.  I have been procrastinating on whether or not to get the nipple procedure done.  Should I get the procedure done or just get the tatooing from a tatoo artist?  I have heard some stories about the nipples becoming necrotic and falling off.  Or they completely flatten out, in some women relatively quickly, and become unnoticable anyway.  I am more concerned about them falling off and making me more disfigured.  The scars are bad enough.  Don't get me wrong...I do appreciate that these things can be done in this day and age but I am always that one percent that gets the wierd things going wrong.  One expander was popped with the injection needle in the middle of my chemo treatments and I needed to have it replaced...DURING CHEMO.  Now I have a hernia in the right implant since the day it was put in and need another operation to place mesh under the implant to hold the implant in place and get rid of the bulge that is now there underneath.  Has anyone out there had the nipple procedure done and have pros or cons to share with me so I can have more piece of mind to make my decision???    Thanks!",

It was especially bad in the morning or when I had been  more inactive. It was so bad sometimes that  I twice went to the hospital for it and had every scan and test for something dangerous and the results were always negative.  The Oncologist chalked it all up to side effects of the drugs.  I was told that this was an unusual side effect (which I hated hearing).  I have been finished with chemo for 2 months now and it has gotten a lot better but still very slightly there. I have been told side effects can last months or even years.  I hope your issue gets better and is nothing more than a temporary side effect.  Good Luck!   Andi",

( I personally don't think it's been so easy ).  My doctor has said that some people who went smoothly through the AC's have a tough time with Taxol.   I have since been reading about Taxol and the pain, pre-treatment drugs and other rumors have scared me a bit.  Has anyone else out there had any experiences with taking the same drugs as me that can offer some advice for getting through the Taxol treatments.

I am a 35 year old caucasion woman with 2 kids (3 and 15).  First of all, this type of tumor is rare and I have yet to meet anyone who has had it.  I am also wondering how I got it if primarily occurs in African American women.  Does ANYONE out there have a \"triple negative\" situation with their breast cancer?",

There were times when I had to take narcotic pain killers to ease the pain.  They are placed between 2 muscles afterall, muscles that we use all the time.   On June 5th I just had my permanent silicone implants put in and I love them.  That discomfort from the expanders is gone.  As time is passing, the permanent ones get softer and more natural looking.  Sleeping is much easier with these and everyone comments on how nice they look.  I will never undermind the pain and discomfort because it was a real part of my life for months.  I just wanted to tell you that it does get better and you will be happy to have done it.  Hang in there, the end is near!   Andi",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply.  Yes, that is definitely a good way to put it.  A major inconvenience!  I was diagnosed last September and as soon as the doctor who told me the news walked out (of course I was in tears and devastated) a nurse came in and hugged me and said \" This is just a bump in the road for you, you are going to do what you have to do and get on with your life\". That's what I did.  I had a double mastectomy, 8 rounds of chemo and am in the middle of reconstruction now.  I will always remember that nurse telling me that because until then I thought I was going to die.  There was a few weeks time in between the doctor finding the lump and the actual diagnosis so plenty of emotions and sleepless nights there! Oh and yes...this tumor did hurt!  I had a sore armpit for 5 months before my diagnosis and thought it was a clogged sweat gland.  Good thing my internist did a breast check at my physical. This is , I am told, is an aggressive form of breast cancer (my oncologist reminds me at every visit), but it also responds well to chemo.  The horomone based tumors are more unpredictable with chemo.  This my oncologist told me as well. Thank you for your response and to all the girls that responded.  I don't feel like the only \"Triple Negative\" girl in the world now!  Good luck with your journey, I will be thinking of you and praying for you.   Andi",

I get 3 or 4 during chemo and some at home.  I too am scared of further treatments.  I have to complete 8 in 16 weeks.  I had a bilateral  mastectomy.  I only had cancer on the right side, but it was aggressive, have no family history ,  it was a triple negative tumor, and I am 35 years old. My doctor said each one can be slightly different, but not terribly.  I am hoping he is right because my first chemo was pretty bad for the first nine days.  The 2nd though seemed a lot better, so I hope yours go easier as you go and not more difficult.  Ask for more drugs if need be!!!  Good Luck!

My chemo was before the surgery because the oncologist said that is how she would be able to judge if the treatments were working to see the tumor shrink.  Find out what type of expander you have and check it out on the web. There is more than one out there. Just ask lots of questions please. Hang in there. Sue   Thanks Sue! He put it in the wrong place!!!  I'd be mad.  Hopefully it all turned out nice in the end.   I will find out tomorrow when they want to do the surgery.  It just stinks because I invested 4 months into filling these expanders and still have 2 doses of Taxol left to go.  I would rather postpone any surgery until I am over chemo and feeling better, but that may not be what they recommend.  This same on has been infected before already and that was no fun.  I will find out my brand of expander and check it out online.  I have heard that the port fails on these sometimes too.  Thanks again!   Andi",
