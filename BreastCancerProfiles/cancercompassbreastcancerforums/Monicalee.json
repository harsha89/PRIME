    "Content": "I am in the medical business, and the worse patient. I also suffer from severe anxiety.  This mamo turned out to have calicifications, and then I had a second magnified mamo, then an ultrasound, then  I was told I  could wait 6 mo, or get a biopsy, then I asked, if it were your breast what would you do- she said get the biopsy.  Then I realized I still need to ask questions and find out about this DCIS potential.  I think I want to know and get it overwith ( scheduled for 12/14) but then part of me thinks I should have a second option, and that there are to many tests being done.  Finally, I really feeling like I am just freaked out about lying down with a breast locked into an hour long proceedure waiting for the needle.  Can someone tell me what the procedure really felt like.  If it is really not painful, then what is all the fuss about.  I have heard a few horror stories, but all second hand with no details.    I hate the waiting game, and don't know if I can wait 6 months.  I really need some stories about what others have been through.  Thanks for sharing any. ",
