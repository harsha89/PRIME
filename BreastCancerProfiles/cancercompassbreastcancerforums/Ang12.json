    "Content": "I took Anastrazole for 5 years and the Drs gave me the option for continuing for another 5 years but I did not want to.  All the Drs could tell me was that they did not know whether Anastrozole would have killed off any cancer cells that had remained after treatment, whether it was just suppressing any cancer cells that remained or whether there were no cancer cells left anyway and I had taken it just as a precaution.  That was 11 years ago and I am still cancer free.  I had a pretty aggressive cancer so that is good news but so much more research has gone on since I took it (when it was relatively new, in the UK anyway) so I guess much more information must be available.  Perhaps discuss it more with your medical team",
