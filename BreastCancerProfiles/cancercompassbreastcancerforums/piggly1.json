    "Content": "First you need to get your pain under control, ask your doctor for strong drugs such as tylenol 3, vicodin, fentanyl transdermal patch or other meds. I just finished (3/26/10) 33 treatments of head/neck radiation and before I started my oncologist told me that I must keep my pain under control in order to allow my body to heal itself. I would also recommend vitamins especially Biotin, D and a good multi that has Selenium. Stay positive and I hope I was of some small help.",
