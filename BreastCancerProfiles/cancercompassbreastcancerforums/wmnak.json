      "Content": "I'm SO Sorry for what you are going through!  I can only imagine ...  my left-only mastectomy was April 30th and my drains were removed May 7th.  Hopefully I'll get staples/stitches out on Monday - and the surgeon is concerned about swelling although I haven't had any (yet?) Were you bound tightly during your surgery?  Apparently this is what helps control the swelling.  Mine stayed on 24/7 the entire first week, and now I take it off long enough to shower every second day.  I wonder if you are doing this, or if it would help?  Asperiating sounds like a painful experience, too.  Do hope you get this under control soon, we need to heal, not endure complications.   Good Luck!

Please share!   My mastectomy was only 3 weeks ago but I truly hope to avoid lymphedema forever and ever .... amen.   Seems all I've read so far is about dealing with, not avoiding or preventing.
