      "Content": "Thanks Melissa for your input on this. Today I am to have my 3rd chemo treatment, depending upon the rash subsiding to a safe point. I will get Leukine as a booster if needed, and probably will be. If rash is unacceptable to the doctor's reasoning then I will postpone treatment until next week. I am on Prednisone 50mg a day now to kill the rash. So far the result is slow, but seems to be improving. Good health to you, and thanks again! Dick",
