    "Content": "I just stated Aromasin and after 3 weeks I have developed a severe rash on my arms and chest. It is big red raised spots. I went to a walk-in clinic 3 days ago and got scripts for 2 antihistamines and a steriod. I have an appointment tomorrow (mon) with my dermatologist and tues with oncologist. I wonder if anyone else has had this experience. I was on Tamoxifen for 2 years but testing proved it was not working for me. Â I have psoriasis and wonder if anyone knows if the AI drugs work through the auto-immune system since psoraisis has been linked to this. The patches I have do not look like my other lesions. There is no scaling and they are redder and itchier. I stopped the aromasin and the patches are getting better, but the skin is starting to peel. Also my ears turned bright res and itchy. They are peeling now. Is this weird or has anyone else having anything like this? My oncologist said they have seen rashes.",
