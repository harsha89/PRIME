      "Content": "I'm praying that they will not find cancer through this testing, but you're not being a baby at all.  Waiting to find out results is very difficult and hearing the diagnosis of cancer, or the possiblity, is very overwhelming.  Please remember that people do survive beautifully many cancers that used to take lives and that every year new treatments are coming into being.  I'm sorry you're going through this, it's daunting.  I am in remission from Stage 3 Breast Cancer with lymphnode involvement and probably lung involvement, and I can tell you the chemo and radiation are horrible, but if they get you to remission, they're a mixed blessing.  May your tests be clear and your mind be calmed.  I'll continue praying for you.  ",

      "Content": "I just accomplished my third year of remission - stage 3 breast cancer, lymph node cancer and probable lung cancer.  I have to admit that although I'm very grateful for the remission, the constant side effects - fatigue, arthritis from Tamoxifen, vision and hearing changes from the chemo, skin and vein changes from the chemo, fear of future chemo - does make me scared sometimes.  I have so much to be thankful for, but I do fall into the poor me, will my Grandchildren remember me, etc., etc., place at times.  There is a part of me that's scared.  Every 6 month check-up causes anxiety.  I'm trying to trust the Lord and accept what I'm going to as a part of life for so many of us, but I do get scared, I can't help it.  Does the fear ever leave?",
