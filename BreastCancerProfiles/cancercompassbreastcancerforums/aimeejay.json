    "Content": "Dear Antia The following link speaks about breast lumps and pain, and as with most breast lumps the cause is usually not cancer.  Still, with your family history it is SO important that you get checked regularly SO THAT YOU CAN STAY ALIVE.  I am a two-time bc survivor and am alive because of early detection.   Please don't let fear paralyze you--take your health in your hands and get your breasts checked regularly.
