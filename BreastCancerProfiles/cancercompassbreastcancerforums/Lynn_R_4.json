    "Content": "Hi, Everyone! I do not have the same situation as you, but my husband, daughter, and I have lymphedema in our legs (Jim & Kristina's are congenital, but mine developed after having lymph nodes removed because of melanoma). Please don't \"wait and see\"! Lymphedema only grows and needs constant diligence to keep it under control. Go to the following website @ www.lymphnet.org Saskia Thiadens developed the National Lymphedema Network, and we know her personally (Jim was one of her first lymphedema patients). She is a nurse who has been working with lymphedema patients for over 20 years. She has organized conferences on this subject for doctors all over the world. Investigate her site and e-mail her if you have any questions. By the way, manual lymph drainage (massage for lymphedema) is definitely effective. However, make sure that you find someone who is certified in this type of massage because it must be done correctly. The right person can train you, and then you can do it at home. Hope this info helps! Lynn",
