    "Content": "I as diagnosed with breast cancer May 2011, had lumpectomy, chemo and radiation then was on Femara until January of 2016.  My doctor said I had a high risk of the cancer returning - news to me - and changed me to Aromasin. I can no hardly walk, my feet and legs are so stiff - both joints and muscles that I am in constant pain.  Walking is like I am made of concrete.  I now have edema and pitting in the feet and legs.  My doctor will not return my phone calls.  This quality of life sux.  I live on pain pills and muscle relaxants that were prescribed by my pain managment doc for other problems.  Not even sure were to turn, but the pain is bad and this is not life.  I am 56 and now overweight and something as simple as walking is almost impossible.",
