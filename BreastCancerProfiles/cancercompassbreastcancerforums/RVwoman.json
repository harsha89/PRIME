I've been on Arimidex since 2/05 and will stop on 2/10. I've always taken a big fish oil capsule with my daily vitamins--and have never had a problem with an Arimidex interaction. I used to have outrageous hot flashes, and my oncologist gave me different prescriptions, now, finally they have dwindled down to a few a week. Good luck! Elizabeth, AKA RVwoman",
