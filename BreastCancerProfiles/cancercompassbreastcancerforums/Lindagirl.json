    "Content": "Had stage 2 breast cancer in 1994.It was homone receptive. Had mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Then I took Tomoxifin for 10 years, and then was switched to Femara for 2 years. I could not make it through the 2 years. First year was OK, but the 2nd year the bone pain started, also muscles and ligiments - not to mention the belly fat. I made it through l 3/4 years on Femara until I could hardly walk, could not go up and down the stairs and was crying for real pain medication. The Dr. took me off. I got a lot of relief, but have found I still have knee pain and hip pain and stiffness that is sometimes bad. My question is: Will this go away in time or will I have to find a way to live with this. I work-out with weights and do quite a lot of cardio twice a week and walk with my dog every day. Tell me what will help? Will it go away? My oncologist says \"it will probably not get any better and the best thing is to keep excercising\". I've been off 3 months and still hurt, but not as bad as when I was on it. And how about the belly fat, will it go away?",
