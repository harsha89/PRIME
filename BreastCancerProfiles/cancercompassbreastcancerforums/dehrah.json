      "Content": "Stage 1 breast cancer 20 yrs ago, lumpectomy, radiation then Tamoxifan for 5 yrs.  Cancer metasticized to bone Stage 4, 1-1/2 yrs ago  Have had 3 rounds of radiation. Also, have alot of arthritis (sclerotic bones.) Am on Femara and monthly infusion of Xgeva (Denusumb) to strengthen my bones.   Problem is pain in lower back, pain in right clavicle - small fracture and newly, shooting sharp pain in my left groin.  I also have numbness when sitting and reaching with right arm am having it now, using the mouse- all down my arm and hand.  Also, numbness back of legs after moving or standing awhile Numbness goes away if I shake my right arm, move my position, walk around.  Another major complaint is that upon getting out of bed - for 1-2 hrs - It seems like my muscles(or tendons) - back and legs have tightened up so much that I yelp in pain when I sit and/or get up to walk Oxycondone 5-10  mg not helping.  Not one dr can answer why am having spasms/numbness  I have just had all my 3 month restaging tests:  PET, BONE,CAT SCANS - Nothing has spread outside of the bones - which is good but does not answer why  Been to Neurologist (brain scan - ok)  Pain Mgmt Specialist etc.  Been given script for Gabapentin 3x day and Cymbalta 60 mg bedtime. On three weeks and of no help.  I am not depressed - just very aggravated not getting any answers. Have any of you have/had  the numbness, tightness in a.m. Only suggestion from pain mgmt dr is above meds, get a personal trainer - low impact or get messages (he said I was tense - well, yes, he'd be tense he lived in my body for even one day) - neither of which can I afford.  Also, since on the fremara (18 mos.) have gained 30 lbs - Oncologist said it is a side affect of femara and Xgeva.  I have to have my left thyroid removed soon - have a 4 cm mass biopsied 2 x - negative but because of the size, my drs. feel should be removed for a total biopsy to be sure cancer not in mass somewhere.  Anyone else have this weight gain  problem?  I can't lose no matter what diet I am on.  I'm not allowed to go to gym (per my oncologist - my bones are fragile) and can only walk - not on tredmill - but I can 't walk more than 1-2 blocks - due to the pain in my lower back - gets so bad it takes my breath away. Any input would be so appreciated. Thanks' for taking the time to read this lenghty message.  ",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the reply. I am n have taken fish oil 1200 mg for at least ten yrs, along with many vitamins. Perhaps krill oil is better? My pain is an equal opportunity pain: lower spine, neck right clavicle (MRI showed a fracture I get numbness n spasms down back of legs n arms). I have not received results yet of the 3 other MRI,s. I have 2 herniated. discs lower spine n 1 in neck. Been to rad 3x seen neurologist brain scan n pain mgmt specialist who prescribed cymbals n Gababatin Not helping!!!!! g. Been 4 wks. Also massage therapy/or personal trainer yeah like I can afford on top of all out of pocket costs Xgeva $400 prr mo. That,s with medicare n BCBS managed care there best plan! sorry am venting!!!). I feel the pain is caused by the discs pressing on nerves. The dr,s only looking for the big c which bone,pet,cat scans show no change since 10/11 initial diagnosis Thanks again for answering.

      "Content": "tks for replying. I have always taken vitamins but per oncologist take dbl vit d n d3. I take magnesium daily. Not potassium. Will try. I too took darvocet yrs ago was great. Don,t like how I feel on oxycodone either. And, yes, we are walking the same walk. I live in NJ I also can barely get out of most chairs n steps are not easy. I am on a monthly xgeva Infusion. I'll ask oncologist about your shot. I have not had any more tumors since first diagnosis 10/11 Other than 10/11 biopsy of clavicle no surgery on other tumors. Unfortunately, I broke/fractured clavicle ,3 wks after surgery. And now is causing much pain need to see orthopedic surgeon. Also have 6/28 surgery to remove the 4 cm mass left thyroid. Have had 2. 3 pass biopsies n were clear but to be sure since its org they feel should be removed Pls read my reply to other response which I ran on about my theory of why spasms n numbness from herniated discs that I have had for at least 20 yrs n had injections 2x which worked. So,last wk, I did what any sane person w/st 4 would do: Hubby, friend n i Drove to Pa n bought a yorkie poo puppy. Ha ha. But I feel she is brightening my days 4 so far n keeps me from dwelling on all this. Diane",
