Two weeks ago she was healthy as a horse, we were at breakfast then went to the casino. A week later she got weak, yellowish and then this today. Â A CAT scan 3 mos ago was positive, the last one the other day was the end of treatment. I sat their today and watch a Dr tell a wonderful lady, she is out of options. I was in absolute shock. I called so many hospitals and when I mention billirubin of 10, they stop me and tell me Good Luck",
