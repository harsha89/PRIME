    "Content": "Two weeks I had sharp chest pains so I called my Doctor's office. While crossing my arms due to the pain in my chest, I found a lump in my breast. I called my Doctors office wanting to make an appointment. I got sent to the emergency room because he said I had heart attack symtoms...After 1 1/2 days in the hospital and going through several test, I was discharged. I was told I had a strong heart and great lungs. I then followed up with an appt. with my regular Dr. He ordered a mamogram. To make a long story short....I was sent to a surgeon who did a biopsy and was told I had breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy on Tues, March 22. I was told on March 25th that I have Infiltrating Ductile Cacinoma and that the cancer was in 3 or more lymp nodes. We still do not have the \"final\" pathologist reports. The surgeon had to go \"deep\" into the chest wall and those test are still pending. He advises that I will need radiation and chemotherapy. They have an appointment set up with an Oncologist on April 1st AND on April 6th with a \"radiation oncologist?\". Before my surgery, I kept asking for an oncologist opinion....I never got one....I had seen an oncologist two years ago because I was told then that I had cancer \"somewhere\". I went through a lot of test, but then I was released by the oncologist stating that he could not find any cancer anywhere. I am very nervous, as the surgeon has the appointment with the SAME oncologist that released me two years ago. I am praying that God will lead me to the \"right\" place. I might also mention, the hospital that I was in and did test prior to surgery, lost my records twice. I had to have two biopsies, because they lost the first results. I would appreciate any feedback.",
