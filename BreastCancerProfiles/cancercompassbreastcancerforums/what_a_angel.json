    "Content": "Dear Judy,  What a strong person you have.  My Mom had  many operations on her breasts her whole life.  SHe developed breast cancer at 70.  SHe didin't want to go for the Mamo. SHe figured why bother.  That saved her life.  She had 40 radititon treatments.  Four years later,  developed Oviavian cancer. Had  3 radiation treatments.  I rember sitting in the office watching everyone come and go.  My father passed away 40 years agao from Cancer.  He had raditation treatment.  They were so bad.  When I hear \"cancer\"  i just want to run.  I pray that   the angles will always be with you.         ",
