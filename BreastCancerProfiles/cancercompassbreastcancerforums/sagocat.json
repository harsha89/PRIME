Should I've have them do a dbl mastectomy and reconstruct all at the same time .. Or get healed and follow treatment on my right breast first.. I have large breast.. that may be an issue.. thank you sabine.. I had a mastectomy two years ago. I too have large breasts. So now that I am thinking of having the reconstruction it seems I have to have quite a big reduction on the remaining breast too. I wish that I had had it all done in one go. But that is just my opinion.",
