      "Content": "I have been on Arimidex 4 months, have all your symptoms and more. Ask your MD for Skelaxin, it's prescription, non narcotic muscle relaxer. I take it at bedtime. I don't wake up quite so stiff. I take a 50mg Trazedone at bedtime and I sleep fine. Trazedone is an old fastioned medication sort of like Benedryl. It's an antidepressant but most MD's give it for sleep not for it's other effects. My Oncologist tells me I will either adjust to the Armidex, e.g. build a tolerence so it doesn't bother me or I will learn to live with it. She says I should feel better after 6  months on Arimidex. If your Oncologists or family MD won't give you the meds see an Othropedic MD. A hot am shower and stretching exercises in the shower loosen my back. Regular exercise really helps. I ride my bike 10 to 15 minutes a day, early in the am to loosen me for the day. I suffer through it  because it helps. If I still hurt I take 2 Tylenol and a prescription tramadol; it's a non narcotic pain reliever. I do upper body repetions with 2.5 lb. weights. It's taken me a few months to get to 2.5 lbs and I'm staying here for a while. I still feel stiff in the am and it's still hard to move if I've been sitting for a 15  minutes. I have learned to cope and if I can't;  I take the meds I've described. Ultram is prescribed for 2 to three times a day. I take it 2 or three times a week. I take Skelaxin @ bedtime  if I do to much and suspect I may be extra stiff the next day. I haven't taken it in about 5 days. My Oncologist gave me the Ultram and Skelaxin because muscle and joint pain are so common. My family MD gave me the Trazedone.  Because I was having so much pain and sleep problems I went to a Psychiatrist. I tried the \"real\" modern antidepressants, which combined with the Arimidex doubled my pain. When I reached the point I could barely walk and had severe limping pain, I refused to take the med anymore and she weaned me off. Then I went back to the normal Arimidex problems.  Good luck.

      "Content": "Hi Libby,  You need more information. You need to talk to your Oncologist. Invasive ductal carcinoma treatment depends on your biopsy results. Terms to know are things like ER+, ER-, and many others. The oncologist office should provide you with a book that informs about treatment options and side effects. Generally speaking in America chemo is the standard of care. I can't afford and didn't want to go elsewhere so I didn't do much research. China, Germany, France and Spain are countries that appear in internet articles a lot. I'm going to tell you about my chemo experience because I wish someone had told me. My intent of course is to reassure you. Some of what I say is scary but chemo and cancer are scary. Some people go through chemo with no problems but hair loss and fatigue. Losing the hair was nothing; I wore scarves or went bald when it was hot. Lots and lots of people continue to work during chemo. I am stage 3 ductal and invasive ductal with 18 positive nodes and my tumor was 96% ER+ ( estrogen receptor  positive). I am overweight, 64 and I have been in remission for a month. My age and weight probably increased my fatigue. I could not have worked for my first 7 days after  each chemo but could have worked the next 14 days until the next dose. I had 8 doses total so that would have been 8 weeks off work. Chemo was harsh but you will manage like all the rest of us if you have to do it. They give nausea meds so I was never sick. I did have cramps a lot. You have to take the nausea meds and they control them cramps too, so you won't have cramps either. Drink water!! Lots!! If you drink water you will be fine, if you don't you may irritate your bladder and intestinal track. I drank 50 to 64 ounces daily. Eat your protein so you can build muscle. I ate 50 to eighty protein grams daily. I got most of mine in milk whey powder shakes. I lost a lot of fat ( 52 pounds ) but no muscle. The weight loss was a choice because I only wanted fruit and milk. You will find the things you crave and create your own special menu's. I lost my toenails but it didn't hurt. They just got dry and flipped off. I've been off chemo 6 months and they have already grown back, along with my hair. Exercise is very important. Chemo was tough but the more you know and do, the easier it will be. Go to the american cancer Society on the web and start to study and find support groups. They are a big help. Good luck, Linda  ",
