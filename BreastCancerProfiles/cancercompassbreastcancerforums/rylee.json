    "Content": "I am looking for information for a friend.  My daughter has a brain tumor, and I am very informed about all the promising clinical trials and advancements for brain tumors.  They are some really informative brain tumor sites.  I was wondering if there are any clinical trials (especially phase 2 or 3) for metastatic breast cancer that are showing great promise or if there is currently good standard treatment for it?   Also what are the most informative and up to date breast cancer sites.   Thanks",
