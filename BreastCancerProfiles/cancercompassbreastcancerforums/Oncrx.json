This over-expression of HER2 causes increased cell growth and reproduction, often resulting in more aggressive breast cancer cells.  Herceptin blocks these receptors, limiting cell growth.  If Herceptin is stopped then the receptors are not blocked and abnormal cell growth resumes.",

Her estrogen and progesterone receptors are negative.  This isnt necessarily bad, it just means the hormonal therapy wont work.  The HER 2 receptor appears to be moderate to weak by DAKO with FISH pending.  This test indicates if the drug Herceptin will be of benefit.  Probably not, but the FISH test may say different.  So, I would say she has an agressive cancer that was caught early.  She will most likely need more treatment, perhaps just radiation, but you should discuss that with her doc.  DCIS, even when agressive has a pretty good prognosis.  Hope this helps a little.",

Recently a link has been found between bisphosphonates and a serious bone disease called osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ). This important discovery clearly shows that Fosamax side effects may include osteonecrosis of the jaw. The discovery, published in the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, prompted both the US, Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Novartis, the manufacturer of bisphosphonates used in cancer chemotherapy, to issue a warning to health care professionals on September 24, 2004. The warning letter contained information about bisphosphonates and the risks of osteonecrosis in the jaw. Bisphosphonates are commonly used in tablet form such as Fosamax ( Alendronate Sodium ) to prevent and treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Stronger forms of bisphosphonates are commonly used in the management of advanced cancers that have metastasized to the bone, where the disease often causes bone pain and possibly even fractures. Several cancers can involve or metastasize to the bone, including lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, multiple myeloma, and others. When bisphosphonates are given in cancer chemotherapy, the drugs are given intravenously, and usually for longer periods of time.",

      "Content": "  On 5/11/2007 Angelocks wrote: I just received the news that my 49 year old sister has HER2-NU Cancer stage 3 of the right breast. She recently had a mastectomy done of her right breast and three lymph nodes removed. No cancer was found on her nodes, however, the doctor says this is aggressive cancer and the prognosis is grim. Needless to say, we are all devasted. I need some feedback from your personal experiences; what my sister can expect, available treatments, nutrion, exercise, and of course prognosis. I hear Herceptin is the drug used to treat this cancer, is this drug FDA approved? We live close to the Mexican border, and I wonder if it can be purchased there without a prescription. I am encouraging my sister to seek a second opinion and not to give up. Together we can beat this horrible decease. I also heard that this type of breat cancer is genetically link. We are six sisters and 12 nieces between us all. What should we look for or avoid? Any advise would be helpful. Thanks! Angelocksstage 3 does imply LN involvement unless its a IIIB, which means the tumor is bigger.  It is true that generally the HER tumors are more agressive and resistant to treatment.  The good news is that Herceptin can be used in HER tumors.  It is FDA approved.  I am not sure about its status in Mexico.   She should probably also get some of her pre surgery chemo, especially if it appeared effective.  Do you know the ER status?  Most breat cancer is NOT inherited and I am not aware that HER + has any genetic link.  Dont worry too much about prognosis.  Others have survived this.",
