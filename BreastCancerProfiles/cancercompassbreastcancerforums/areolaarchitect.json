    "Content": "As an Areola Architect I work with breast cancer survivors (brave mastectomy soldiers, women and men) on a daily basis.  I also work with breast Plastic Surgeons, Cosmetic breast Plastic surgeons and Oncologists.  I have dedicated 30 years to photo-realism fine art training to become the very best in providing 3D areola's and nipples that rival any topless painting by Michelangelo.  The longer I'm in the business the more amazed I am at the stranglehold of information withheld on this super important topic by the medical community in general.  I understand priority is to preserve the life of the patient, until it is clear that life is winning, then all of a sudden the way the survivor looks becomes key to their mental and physical healing over all.  So few are told by their physicians that non-surgical Micropigmentation is the only way to attach permanent color to the human skin and that it is impossible to do so surgically, ever.  I see failed nipple surgery after failed nipple surgery and see the incredible 3D nipple affects I create and want to shout to the world, Im here to help you have choices that work and do not require more cutting that fails!  Surgeons and nurses currently encouraged by America's Byzantine insurance system to do areola tattooing, should not be doing tattooing!  They receive zero fine art training or tattoo classes at all, but they will tell you they can do it using temporary ink that literally disappears in months (they know their skill level is low, so in patronizing the survivor, give them something that looks bad just to make them feel better for awhile, knowing their mistake will be gone soon). This is more than an insult, it flies in the face of honor and should not be allowed by law. I do more repair work from botched areola cutting and nipple surgery than I do regular mastectomy areola\u2019s where the breasts are perfect like a blank canvas for me to apply the illusion of real areola\u2019s and nipples anatomically correct according to an artist.  Why isnt this topic covered in the beginning of the diagnosis, to give patients hope about how great they can look after mastectomy with or without reconstruction?  It would give them something positive to focus on as a reward getting through the journey of it all.  Why aren\u2019t physicians doing their homework on the topic, putting down the tattoo machine they know nothing about, or taking fine art classes to learn to paint and draw an areola/nipple before placating the patient with sub-standard efforts out of their league?  I am available to work with referring surgeons or Survivors one on one across the globe from Seattle to NY, Europe to Canada or anywhere I'm needed.  Education is key - start spreading the word that areola micropigmentation is the answer and not more surgery! Areola Micorpgimentation is covered by health insurance, in or out of network\u2026help survivors understand their rights. Start asking them about this\u2026its all over fb now \u2013 thousands of photos of women who have had areola tattooing. Its not a taboo topic any more so lets start talking about it! Ask the survivors you know this question: (they\u2019ll be glad you care enough to find out) \u2013 How do you feel about the way you look now under your bra? Do you like the way your chest looks now after you\u2019ve healed from mastectomy? Did you know Areola Architects exist to help you feel whole again? Now you do. www.cathi.ink (there is no dot com, dot ink is its own domain)  Comments?",
