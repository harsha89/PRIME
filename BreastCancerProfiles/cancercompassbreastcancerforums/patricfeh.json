      "Content": "Thank you for replying...the oncologist said we could just \"scoop it out\" but it may return. I'm not crazy about another surgery in the area where the cancer was removed. I'm doing alternative as well as some traditional treatment so I guess I'm looking for anything out there that I can try to reduce it without surgery. It's just a constant reminder of the cancer and I would really like to not have the discomfort 24-7.  I've tried some herbal salve that did help..and I heard recently about a type of accupunture and energy therapy that I will try. Good luck with your scar tissue and thanks. ",

Mtnbiker...Thank you.  So except for not getting any benefit from the drugs...which I don't think I would have taken anyway, the treatment is the same I guess. I don't think the medical society should scare us with comments like\"triple negative is the BAD breast cancer\". All BC is bad but if you don't follow blindly, do your research, and keep the faith, we can survive. I chose an intergrative approach with a lumpectomy and \"balloon\" radiation. I said no to double mascectomy and chemo. And if I had it to do over would also say no to radiation..bad side effects, and fears of creating more cancer down the road. But by far the MOST important part of my recovery was a lifestyle change. I went from eating steaks and drinking champagne and never taking time for myself...to being a vegan,yoga, meditating me first ,without being selfess,kinda gal. There are many holistic cancer treatments out there that work.  I recently celebrated my 2 year anniversary cancer free and will never stop living a toxic free lifestyle. Everyone has to follow their gut and I wish total success to you,no matter what your choice of treatment is.  Best Wishes",
