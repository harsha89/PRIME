      "Content": "i have done research on people that have had thyrid cancer have a greater chance of getting breast cancer because of the idoine used to treat thyroid cancer. my endo mentioned it last time i was there because my cancer is back and in the lymphnodes. so i went to my gyno yesterday and mentioned this to her. she said she never heard of such a thing and i can get any kind of cancer blah blah blah. well, i felt a small lump, and i asked her about it. she said she THINKS is may just be a gland. not too promising!!! I asked her to give me a work order for a mamogram because my insurance only covers it if i get a dr. order because i am 29.Â  she said we don't just do mamograms on people your age. if we feel something we look into it. the mams are too hard to read on someone your age!! ok!! why would that hurt her to give me one!! wouldn't a good dr. give me peace of mind seeing my cancer is BACK and i felt a lump. what do you guys think? my sister in law treats cancer patients and she said there are soooo many under 30 that have the worst stage. i am for sure switching drs. that just doesn't seem right. any oppinions?",
