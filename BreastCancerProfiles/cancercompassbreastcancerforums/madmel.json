      "Content": "Hi all.. I am 42 with stage 3 invasive ductal carcinoma... I did the bilateral mascetomy, radiation, chemo thing and then 6 months of tamoxifen at 20 mg a day. The thing is I got soo depressed and generally unhappy in myself. Next week I am having my ovaries and tubes removed - so next on the agenda is an aromatose inhibitor. My concern now is quality of life not so much quantity.. simply put what is the point of living 15 miserable years if I can have 7 putting damn good ones... I am seriously considering not taking the aromatose inhibitor... any ideas or thoughts are welcome as I am trying to make a well informed decision.. thanks :)",
