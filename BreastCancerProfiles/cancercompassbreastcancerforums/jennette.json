      "Content": "hi..so sorry to hear of all your problems. I have been on the salvestrols site here for a while. I got breast cancer in 2011 and was on tamoxifen . three tumours left breast.. I refused the op. took the salvestrols also . the cancers have consistently shrunk and now show no activity at all on a thermogram.please look at salvestrols ...developed by prof gerry potter and prof dan burke. I am a kinesiologist and took other stuff too. look at indole3carbinole vs tamoxifen. krill oil very good . if you want more info ask. or look at my posts very best wishes jennette",

      "Content": "Hi .. I found I had breast cancer in 2011 .. I took tamoxifen for a while and researched etc.Â  I f your wife would look up salvestrols she might start to feel more in control. Also dandelion root, chloroquine, coQ10, fish oils, Indole 3 carbinole, multivite... and others... including homeopathy, which would balance the mood also. There really is stuff out there outside the mainline box --- which works. I had 3 tumours -- but they have shrunk away nicely and one small thin area is the only thing visible now. The doctors say something I am doing is working and the tamoxifen could not have done this. After chemo take chlorella which gets rid of toxins - the japanese use it. The other thing to consider is a thermogram.. which is really easy to have done, and monitors the demise of the cancers. Really there are things she can do -- what is it? dont get mad get even?
