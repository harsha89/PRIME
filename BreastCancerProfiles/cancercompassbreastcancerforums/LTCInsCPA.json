    "Content": "I was diagnosed 9/26/05, mastectomy 10/05, chemo 11/05-2/06, tamoxifen 3/06-3/08, femara 3/08-early 6/08 (side effects aches in knees, legs and fingers and swelling of legs and ankles, 10+ weight gain), amromasin - pain in knees singificant, no swelling, quality of life in jeopardy, thus waiting for prescription of arimidex, however after hearing everyone's comments, I don't expect comfort.  I did go off femara for 1 week before going onto aromasin and I was great.  Terrific timing,since I was preparing for and having my youngest daughter's graduation party from high school.  Before changing to arimidex, I will be off aromasin for 1 wk and look forward to comfort.  I am planning a trip to London in August and my oncologist has approved going off the drug 3 days prior and all during the 8 day trip. Another break from pain. I do take glucosamin/chodroidan, advil and acetaminiphen. What excercises have you found helpful?  I tried biking (stationary bike) and can barely get 30 minutes in at level 5 strength and not the terrific speed, but then am in pain just getting my right leg off the machine at the end.     ",
