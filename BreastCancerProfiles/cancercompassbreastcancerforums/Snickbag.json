    "Content": "Last fall I was diagnosed with phase one breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy and fifteen rounds of radiation. In January I began taking anastozol and at first I didn't notice any side effects worth worrying about but after eight months now it is a different story. I was a very young seventy two year old, in good shape and very active. Now I feel like an old woman. I've gained fifteen pounds that no matter what I do it will not budge. My balance is off, my bones ache I have little bumps all over my body even in my hair which is falling out. I don't think this drug is worth it. There's no guarantee that cancer will return. I cannot imagine feeling like this for the next four years.",
