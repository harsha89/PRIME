The past two weeks have been very difficult for me. On July 15th, my mother, the joy and strenghth of my life informed me that she had found a lump in her breast. The past weeks have been so crazy....however, on yesterday I learned that my mother has breast cancer. Her pet scan is scheduled for next week and I will have more information. It is so hard for me because I reside 1400 miles from her. Of course, I will plan to go home to be with her during this process, but in the mean time...it's really tough. I will use this site for support, education and just as a sounding board to help us through the journey. On last year, I began an advocacy role in the fight against breast cancer for others....not knowing that this too would be apart of my personal life. I am strong and so is she. Together with the grace and mercy of God we will make it! Thanks for having this site Angela You have a wonderful attitude and I commend you.  That's half the battle.  I must say also that I agree with Teresad32 that treatment with herbs, etc. BEFORE treatment, fine, but not during.  Our oncologist told us the same thing.  It can interfere with the chemo.  So, just a word of caution, but check with your own oncologist about this also.",

This was in August 2007 , I had full plastic reconstruction in March 2008.I worked out but never felt anything. I am a fitness instructor and also use the steam room and jacuzzy.I have been feeling a pain in the night I don't know if can be nerves in the arm or the veins are recuperating from the chemo.I have been back to my activity a month ago and sometimes carry heavy bag or food since I do not have any help.   The pain or numbness is in the arm and I have joint pain in the middle of the thumb and index finger more in the right arm and hand than in the left.   Anybody knows something about it.I will not stop my activity and do a lot in the water but never felt anything and my arms are not swelling.   Thanks a lot, Are you taking any bone strengthening medicine such as Boniva or one of the others.  My girlfriend who had breast cancer takes Boniva and has pain in her hands from it.  I think it's just one of the side effects, but check with your doctor.  Not sure about the numbness. ",
