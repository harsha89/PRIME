    "Content": "Caregivers have a really rough time of it; I know, since I'm a patient now, but I've been a low-grade caregiver continually for 40 years.  Don't feel guilty about resenting your role, but instead just understand that it's natural.  Now, what you do about it is another thing; sharing your experiences, frustrations, anger, and resentment with other caregivers can help.  Find some support groups for caregivers, and participate.  Recognize that this is your obligation: to love and care for the woman you married all those years ago.  Be glad that you're well enough to do so.  You may need some counseling; don't be afraid to seek it.  If you believe in God, you probably will acknowledge that God loves you for caring for her.  You will probably need someone to do the same for you at some point in your life.  Don't lose heart, and don't give up!  If you don't exercise, you should; it can give you an outlet.  TALK to someone, regularly.  Good luck, my friend; you're not alone.",
