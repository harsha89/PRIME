      "Content": "Hi ladies sorry to hear you and your mother are going through such stressful times. I just googled breast cancer and collarbone pain because that is my situation right now. I saw my onc last Tuesday after waiting 11/2 mos. for an appt. he reluctantly agreed to a ct scan because I was stage III and it's been 4 yrs. so I \"should be out of the woods\". Now I'm reading your mothers were 11yrs. Post surgery. I had a chest X-ray and Doppler which both came back clear also. I had my ct scan yesterday, waiting for 48 hrs. when I hope I will learn the results. One thing I don't remember either of you mentioning is if either of your moms were short of breath. I am very short of breath, I have asthma which causes some of it but not this bad. I just noticed the dates on these two patients. I would like to hear from anyone else who is experiencing these symptoms post breast ca. I hope both of these ladies are experiencing good health. Bless you all",

Keep us posted as you can. I was going to post the same thing, YOUR MOTHER SHOULD NOT BE IN PAIN AT ALL, do you have hospice, there are hospice agencies everywhere. Talk with your oncologist about ordering hospice.",

      "Content": "I came to this site to find out what I could about my own symptoms but I should have stayed on for anyone who might have had questions for me that I could have helped. Finally after 2 months and several tests I was diagnosed with breast cancer metastasized to bone and lung. The best advise I can give anyone after your treatments are over, insist on a pt scan. If my surgeon or oncologist had done a follow up pt scan, they would have seen that I still had cancer deep in my breast, but it was there!!! I am now undergoing my second round of chemo, the first one this time didn't work, my markers started going back up after 5 months. I started new chemo 2weeks ago, I have a mid- large lump across my right chest to my r arm. Sometimes it's swelled larger than other times. I have some pain but the worst is a great deal of discomfort in my jaws, neck, temples and l&rchest. Anyone else experiencing the same. I forgot I have ca and pain in my r& l rib. My dr doesn't want to discuss my prognosis but I do, anyone have any thoughts.",
