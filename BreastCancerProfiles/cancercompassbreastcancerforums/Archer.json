    "Content": "I am sorry that you and your family are going through this.  I cannot possibly imagine how it really feels right now for you.  I lost my father to bladder cancer in 1990, just a few days before he would have turned 90 years old.  I am the youngest of my siblings, so my children were still quite young at the time.  One of my sons was 10 when his grandfather passed, and it affected him much more than I would have expected.  His immediate reaction was to run to his father (my ex) as though somehow I had failed to protect him from the loss of his grandfather.  Within two years after my father passed, I remarried, and to this day my son has never accepted my new husband and eventually went to live with his father.  Now, many years later, my son and I have somewhat of a friendly relationship, (he is grown now), but will never be as close as I would have hoped.  Time does heal, but not always without emotional scars.",
