    "Content": "In December my sister had a lumpectomy and they found cancer. Then the doctor removed her lymph nodes, she started chemo and took some time off from it.  Then they found another lump. She's scheduled for a mastectomy on Friday and had a body CT scan and it came back all clear! Now, is this really good news or can they miss something? Is it a time for celebration?  Do you think she will get more chemo?",
