      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your mom. After reading her last two messages, I actually began to have hope with this particular type of cancer. I have been reading messages on this website since my very dear friend was diagnosed in February 07.  She was diagnosed with breast cancer in June 06, was treated, and seemed to be \"cancer free\" that November. However, she was one of the 5 out of 100 that get CM as a result of breast cancer. She had a port put into her head and began treatments. Everything seemed to be progressing until this past summer we noticed changes in her. She began to forget things, she said off the wall comments, seemed to hallucinate occasionally, became very paranoid, and just wasn't herself.  After telling the doctors about these symptoms, it turned out the lining of her brain became inflamed as a result of the injections to her port. With this being said, she slowly regressed as the weeks went on. The month of November was awful. She could not move her legs, became paralyzed on the left side of her body, was unable to get out of bed, her pain grew worse, she was not able to eat, only drink out of a straw, her speech was slurred, and all we could do was sit at her bedside and watch our friend suffer. As I sat there, I thought of the way she used to be, fun loving, high spirited 35 year old woman who was withering away right before my eyes. She went on like this for 5 weeks until she passed away last week. I don't know what was worse, watching her suffer and fade away, or knowing she is now at peace and will never suffer or feel pain again. It is very tragic and unfair and I will miss her so much.",

She lost most of her vision and has had a few vp shunt revisions due to infections or her filter clogging with cancer cells.  The most recent shunt surgery was two days ago where she had to have the shunt removed because it was infected.  She has not gotten any chemo in over a month because she was in the middle of being reevaluated (via PET, CT, etc.) to see if the methotrexate was working.  Her cell count was up. She currently has other complications as well. There is a lot of fluid in her lungs and her left side (neck and arm).  At this point, we are trying to make her comfortable by allevating the pain she is experiencing as the cancer has made it to the bone level.   I'm so sorry to hear that. I was hoping for better news. How old is she?  ",

She was cognitive up until the end and pain free thanks to the wonderful people at hospice in Vermont. She tracked this message board until her vision declined in May and felt tremendous gratitude for all the messages and support. She is now dancing in the light. Much love and light to all who are struggling with this disease and have love ones struggling with this disease. What I learned holding my mother when she passed is that this life is only a small fragment in our soul's journey.  Love and light. I am so sorry your mom died. I was following her progress on this website through your updates. My friend passed away last December from CM. Prior to that, I had hope from reading about your moms progress and now it has come to an end. I am sad for you. I had hoped your mom would be one of the first to overcome this horrible disease. I am truly sorry for your loss.",

Since you have read all of the messages, I'm sure you read the one about the woman who lived over 4 years with CM. So I do believe anything is possible. I do not know if there is a cure, however I did read a lot of new information that in Europe they are trying experimental chemo/radiation to the brain and spine at the same time and they are seeing results. I don't know if that information can help you in anyway. I hope you receive some positive news from the spinal tap results. What state does your mom live in?",
