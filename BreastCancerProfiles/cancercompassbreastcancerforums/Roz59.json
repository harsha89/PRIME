      "Content": "I thought this might be a good discussion to see how you all feel as to what may have caused your breast cancer. I, for one, think 99% that it was HRT that caused mine. I was on it for 10 years and I was given the implant that was inserted into my bum (with a couple of stitches) every 6 months. Not just one dose either, I had TWO!!! I could actually feel my body changing within 24 hours of having the implant......I have no cancer my my family, ate right, exercised, had 2 kids when reasonably young, breastfed and did everything do stay fit......yet the big C got me. Has anyone else got views of how they got cancer?",

I read that while sleeping the blood stays in one place and this is what is causing the dreadful cramps and pains, but once you are mobile the blood starts flowing again to help the problem. I need to set my alarm for an hour at a time then walk around the bedroom for a few minutes then back to bed - lol! Oh well I am now trying Aromasin to see how I get on. I also try to avoid pain killers as my Mother had a stroke at quite an early stage. Keep well regards Roz. Hi Mary Anne and anyone else who might be interested. I have taken Aromasin now since December 2005 (18 months) and I am not getting the dreadful joint pains that I got with Arimidex. I am very happy on it at the moment, so just want to let you know that I think some people are better on Arimidex and others are better on Aromasin. I just want to say that if you are in so much pain on the one, then try the other.  Regards Roz",
