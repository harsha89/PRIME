    "Content": "Fortunately, it was not a challenge the first or second time when I discovered I had breast cancer, to get an appointment, diagnosis radiation and the second time a masectomy. It was amazing how quickly things happened - but I did pushed it through. Took the kids to school, went directly to radiation for 38 treatments and experienced no problem at all. Honestly, I ask God to place others in my path to help during treatments. He did and it was so fun. Each day I ended up leaving a surprise in a elderly chemo patient's car. I never knew his name and he did not know until my last treatment who was doing it. On that day I saw him come to the door to see who was doing it. I had so much fun choosing what to leave him. Socks, photos, snacks, toys, ridiculous stuff. Never knew his name. And a couple of years later my cancer returned and the double masectomy on my birthday could not have gone smoother. Went to a ballgame 2 days later. A few months later I went to CTC in Tulsa in an effort to stay on top of things and to learn everything I could to prevent it from returning. This will probalby sound ridiculous but I look so forward to my 6 month visits. (But realize - I am not sick and have never physically felt bad because of cancer - and I certainly realize that many have suffered.) Each time before I go to Tulsa I ask God to place someone in my path. Not only has he done this is a huge way - he gave me one of the greatest gifts of my entire life Dec. 2006 while there. The stories are so absolutely wonderful and creative that I hesitate to even tell them, and at this time will not. But I sincerely, truthfully can say that so much good has come from me having cancer that would not have otherwise happened that I do not regret either time. Understand that I am not a syrupy sweet person who writes things like this normally - but KNOW that this is true. And why should I be surprised? He told us that He will use all things for good for those who believe and place their trust in him. --- hope this encourages someone dho- ms",
