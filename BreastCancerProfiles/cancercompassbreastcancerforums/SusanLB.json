I've switched from Arimidex to Aromasin since April because of worsening of osteoporosis. I don't seem to have the other side effects, other than hot flashes. I've had 5 opinions about my neck pain, which radiates to the right side of my head and don't know where to go from here. I'm trying to decide if it's comforting to know that many others have to take strong pain pills to get through the day. That seems to be the solution for me too. Thanks.

Was warned there would likely be same problems- but just as with arimidex, there was somewhat of a delay in onset of symptoms, so have not yet reported to oncologist. will next month. how are you doing????   On 9/15/2005 Cjgeorge wrote: Please advise if anyone but me is experiencing pain in hands, legs, feet from taking aromasin. I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!! I had a bilateral mactectomy about 4 weeks ago and have been taking Aromasin for about 2 weeks.  For the past few days, I've have very severe muscular neck cramps and only can get relief by lying flat on my back.  While I've had neck cramps in the past, I've never experienced anything so severe or long lasting.  I'm wondering if the Aromasin is at least part of the problem.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?      I just started taking",
