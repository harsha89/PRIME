My mother's oncologist said I need to start having mamograms every year (I just turned 30 this past November).  I spoke with my dr.  He approved for me to have one last year, but now this year he's saying I probably don't need one EVERY year, just every 2-3 years.  He said if I decide to, he'll approve it, but said that my insurance may put up a fuss since I'm so young.  He also said there's really no reason for me to unnecessarily expose myself to that much radiation.  He did suggest getting the genetic testing done, but I'm worried about being declined life/health insurance based on the outcome. Any advice you have would be GREATLY appreciated.  I don't know what to do! Hi, I was in a similar situation as yours. I had a strong family history of breast cancer on both sides of my family. I had a baseline mammogram at age 34. It was clear. I had a false sense of security for several years and didn't follow up. At 37 I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer. It had spread to my lungs, bone, ovaries and lymph nodes. I have been through hell. If I had been diligent with my mammograms I could have caught it early and saved myself the nightmare that I went through. I had a 10% chance to live according to my first doctor. I got rid of him and went to a very aggressive oncologist who by the grace of god saved my life! I had genetic testing done and I don't carry either of the 2 known genes! I feel, as well as those conducting the study, that I may carry a unidentified gene. Please don't make the same mistake as me. It could be nothing but don't take that chance!!!! Keep your eyes wide open and don't stop!!!!  ",
