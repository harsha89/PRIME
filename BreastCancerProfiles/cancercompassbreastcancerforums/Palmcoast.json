Was expecting a lumpectomy  and the margins also were clear but doctors said the best was a mastectomy. Even though the cancer was only in one breast I would not go thru the surgery twice so I elected for a double.  Had reconstruction right away and had a small rash on my chest which was missed by all the doctors and turned out to be cancer. Get more than one opinion, which I had done. Sorry you had to join the club. ",

      "Content": "Jodie, Thanks for answering me. I have been on this board in the past and never got anywhere.  The taxol was the worst for me out of all the chemos. My friend said it was a breeze for her but my first one took 6 hours because the pain in my back was awful so they had to keep slowing it down. You lose eyebrows, lashes and all other hair except my head started to grow back, still have tiny eyelashes and I finished taxol 2-28-07. Told doctors I would rather do the a/c over again. Taxol also cause neuropathy in your feet and hands. My big toe turned black and pus came out the nail one day which was gross. Yes you want to keep lots of cream on your feet. I still use it every morning and night. Also got sores on my toes. Took several months to go away BUT it did go away. Now xeloda made be mean. First time the doctors had that side effect but I am different. Xeloda did not work for me and I tried it twice. If this gemzar doesn't work the only thing left is xeloda and some thing else I can't remember what the doctor said. My doctor can not understand why the herceptin isn't working cause they always get great results with it.  When I first started I was triple negative and then when it came back my her2/neu changed to 3+ which is unheard  almost. My cancer is met to my tissue. Only other woman doctor had with same cancer is dead. Have not been able to find anyone else with it. By the way I did change doctors from the first cancer till now. Hope this helps some. Please keep in touch. Walking inyour foot prints. Sue  ",

I did have a private disability insurance because the post office has none and social security refused me because cancer is NOT a disability. Still am under a lot of debt but you can not get blood out of a stone. I made the mistake the first go round by putting everything on credit cards. Now I make payments monthly and nothing goes on the credit card. The plastic surgeon is going after me for non payment but he screwed up so he will be the last one to be paid. My story in short form. Found a lump on my upper left side that would come and go. Went and had a diagnostic mamogram and ultra sound and it still did not show up. When the doctor asked me to move my arm it shot up and he sent me straight to a surgeon. Had invasive infiltrating lobular carcinoma along with lymph nodes. Went and had ac/t chemo, then double mastectomy and reconstruction. Stage 3A. Wow your cancer is gone. Had a rash during reconstruction and it turned out to be cancer which I even asked the doctors if it could be cancer and was told no. When I had my expanders in they had shifted and when they put my implants in they put the left one in the wrong place. Plastic surgeon came in and said that is not where I wanted them come back in 6 weeks and we will re-do. I was back in for re-do in two weeks cause I needed to get back to work. I have been in pain since then and that was 7-11-7 so you can understand why he will be paid last. Then in 10/07 I went to a dermatologist to have the rash checked out and told him at least we knew it was not cancer. Wrong...now I am stage 4 with metastatic adenocarcinoma. My cancer is on the outside of my body so we can see if it gets better or not. Have new wonderful oncologist and have been on lots of chemos since 11/07. Hanging in there but getting tired. Sorry for the long short story. Every day I say......Lord, keep your arm around my shoulder and your hand over my mouth. Sue  ",

Have been on chemos since 11/07 with new doctor. When I had the first go round I went to Shands Breast Center which should of been the best but things happen. Cancer does not run in my family. I just got in the wrong line. Since I was told I had it I NEVER once thought I was going to die and that is probably why I am here today. Things could be much worse. You could have MS or no use of your limbs. I realize that you are going thru some tough times now and more than likely some more. You need to think about good things and not think about what may be.

( I personally don't think it's been so easy ).  My doctor has said that some people who went smoothly through the AC's have a tough time with Taxol.   I have since been reading about Taxol and the pain, pre-treatment drugs and other rumors have scared me a bit.  Has anyone else out there had any experiences with taking the same drugs as me that can offer some advice for getting through the Taxol treatments. Thanks.   Andi Andi,   Hi.  I also had A/C with little problems other than being tired all the time. Taxol was very hard on me. My first treatment took over 6 hours because of the back pain. The other 3 gave me muscle and joint pain and took every ounce of energy I had. I was 57 at the time and my friend was 38 when she did the same AC/T. She had a hard time with AC but said Taxol was a breeze. It will just depends on how your body responds. Will be thinking of you. Sue ",

Today I am going to have another sample taken and retested because I am not responding to anything. The only side effects I have.... is being whipped after treatment and my hair is thinning. Of course I have the hand and foot syndome from past treatments of other things but B complex helps with that. No bloating.  My LAST treatment is tykerb and xeloda (do not like) they want to try, not sure I want to go that way yet.   You have to remember with or without cancer you only get one day at a time.............live life and enjoy.......best of luck...my prayers are with you.Sue",

The chemo that just started working is gemzar and herceptin with no side effects other than thinning hair. Tried xeloda, avastin, navelbine before this combination. I can understand not wanting to take a chance with the other breast and your doctor should understand plus you have had a second opinion I hope, if not please do. I got 3. I did not want radiation and I am not sure if it would of stopped it from coming back as fast as it did. Started 10/6/2006 and it came back aroung 5-2007. Not sorry I had a double but would of skipped the reconstruction. Had expanders and they shifted and to this day I have pain. Hope this helps some. God Bless Sue",
