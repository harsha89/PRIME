      "Content": "Thank you Becky for your kind words. My friend is still in great pain from the break in L4 that was cemented on Monday.  They had to put the pain pump back on.  Today they did another CT to check for mets to the brain thank God it was negative.  They are going to put some sort of epidural pump in her back so that she will have some relief from that pain, hopefully be able to wean off serious pain meds and hopefully go home soon.  They are talking about radiation to the tumor in the back but so far are continuing to say they don't think chemo will make much difference except to make what's left of her young life miserable.  My hope is to get her home so that we can get a second opinion.  She's in a conventional hospital and I would like to hear a second opinion maybe from a cancer treatment center.  Any advice on that?  She's just to young to give up at 39. I have to hold onto to the hope and faith that God isn't ready for her yet.",

      "Content": "I have a friend who went through breast ca and underwent double mastectomy and some removal of lymph nodes.  She also had chemo and radiation. Treatments were completed about May of 07.  She has now learned she had a tumor at L4 that had fractured it and that she also has spots on Lungs and Liver.  She is hospitlized and came down with bilateral pnuemonia.  Today 3/12/07 she underwent cement fusion of L4 tumor however was left to risky to remove.  Plan is to now insert line for aggressive chemo.  Please give me some hope that there is a chance she can survive this. How much time are we looking at?  Is there anyone out there with a similar story that can bring some solace to this broken heart please help and please be honest.",
