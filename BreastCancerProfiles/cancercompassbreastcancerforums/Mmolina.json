      "Content": "Well there is too much research out there about the hazards of soy that I am convenced that is the reason cancer is raising.  I believe eating right and moderat exercise will allow you to have a better life.  Cancer can come back whenever it wants too.  It is your responsibility to enjoy life to its fullest.  Its ea because that you do have control over.  Immersing yourself in crazy philosophy with no direct scientific evidence is not my strategy to being happy.  My philophy is I want to travel more, tell people how much they matter, and enjoy each day as if it were my last.  Cancer was a good thing for me because it made me stop and smell the roses.  That is what people should be doing not immersing your lives in other peoples philosophy on what they believe will help the cancer stay away.  Cancer shouldn't be feared it should be embraced and delt with as it affects our lives.  I refuse to fight battles that will keep me from enjoying what I have each day.  I am 34 years old and have a lot to live for and my breast cancer is behind me.  I am eating right (just like I was taught when I was a child) and am exercising.  I will not do change my life based on the fear of cancer coming back, I am living for today.",

      "Content": "Chemo is hard on most everyone however my advice to you is to take the Oncologist advice and go through the 4 treatment of Chemo.  It's not going to be easy but you don't want the cancer to come back.  I sat with many people during my chemo treatments that were going through worst stages of treatment and dealing with cancer that had spread because their doctors were not aggressive enough when they were originally diagnosed.  It is your decision but the spread of cancer in the future is horrible.  Your doctor knows what he is talking about and sometimes our gut feeling is based on our fear. Good luck",

      "Content": "This year, 2006, I was diagnosed with Mucinous Colloid Carcinoma at the age of 33.  My tumor was 1.3cm with the cancer in the margins.  After removal of 3 lymph nodes and the healthy tissue around the area of the tumor no traces of cancer were found.  They did determine it was hormonal or caused by my hormones.  I underwent 3 treatments of chemo therapy, Cytokine and Adriomiacin, 35 or 36 treatments of radiation and now I\u2019m on Tamaxafin for the next 5 years.  Question, my husband and I are desperate to have children. Do we have to wait 5 years or can we get pregnant or try now.  If I were to get pregnant could Tamaxafin harm the fetus or child?  Do I have to take Tamaxafin since no cancer had spread?  It was considered early stage cancer and my treatment was considered preventative.  Are my chances of re-occurrence high if I were to get pregnant?  Thanks were desperate for answers. ",

      "Content": "I had breast cancer at 33, last June and completed all the treatment that goes along with stage 1 breast cancer (chemo, radiation etc).  Currently I'm on Tamoxifen (started 3 month ago) here is how it changed my life; 18 until I was 27 years old on birth control because of no period or menstral cycle Suffered very tender breast and lots of headaches throughout my young life. Diagnosed with breast cancer at 33 however before I started my chemo treatment my husband and I decided to rush and do IVF to preserve some of my eggs so we can have some insurance of getting pregnante in 2-5 years.  Here is where the story gets interesting! After a brutal month of IVF(horrible treatment) my Dr. released me from the process because my estrogen level was naturally too high (started with a level over 600, at the end of treatment it was 340, to do IVF they were trying to get it down below 25) So now I'm rushed to Chemo and then on December 06 I had to complete my treatment with Tamoxifen (2 pills a day for 5 years). Since I've been on Tamoxifen I have no more headaches, I have a menstral cycle each month and my breast are not tender.  My thereory is that some women naturally produce more estrogen then others and Tamoxifen has been a dream pill for me. It has decreased my estrogen and made me a new person...although I do get very grumpy and have to exercise because you do gain weight...I did but wow I hope you give Tamox a try it was the best thing thats ever happen to me.    ",

      "Content": "I don't know how similar my experience was however I too had very bad advice from my OBGYN.  I had made an appointment because I too had a lump on my breast.  The OBGYN insisted that I stop drinking my 1/2 cup of coffee and see her in 2 months.  I advised her that I would like to have a mammogram and she refused to schedule one for me.  I then asked her \"if I was her daughter would she give her the same advice\"?  Her face got red and said \"Yes\".  Well furious with her advice I made an immediate appointment for a physical with an MD.  Three weeks later my appointment with the MD revealed that she could care less about my coffee addiction and immediately scheduled a mammogram, sonogram, and a full biopsy of the tumor.  It turned out I had early stage breast cancer and I was very lucky it had not spread to my lymph nodes.  Your story infuriates me and since then I only want to see an MD and I will always get a second opinion.  I guess because I was only 33 years old she did think it was cancer but it was.  This took place last year    ",

I had made an appointment because I found a lump in my breast and my OBGYN told me to stop coffe and see her in 2 months. Well I got a second opinion that same month and found out I had cancer.  If I had waited 2 months my treatment would have been so much worse.  The cancer would have spread no doubt.  I am only 34 years old.",
