      "Content": "Hi, Jane! Thanks so much for writing. I found this site after my Momma died - she'd had breast cancer years ago, but then in 2002 she was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in her left lung; removed 2/3 of it, and in January found that it was back - both lungs, throughout the abdomen, behind her heart, and in her brain. My Dad lives 100 yards away, and I told him even before my husband - Daddy had known that this was a concern for me because of the risk factors - I was taught at a very early age that I had to do exams at least once monthly, etc. He told me (and my husband said almost the exact same thing) that even if I lost a breast I was still a woman, to never forget that. He said Momma was never less than the perfect lady, regardless of whatever had to be done. I don't worry about that - heck, I had a hysterectomy at 24, no living children, and THAT was when I felt less than a woman. This is just a breast. Anyway, thank you again for your response. Please write back. I need to go - my appointment is in 2 hours! Always keep your faith. I'll be praying for you also. Lori",

      "Content": "Hi, Jane and Linda, I haven't heard it myself, my husband got the messages off our answering machine remotely - we're staying with his parents - my brother-in-law just passed away (cancer, again) but he said that the message was \"The mammogram turned out fine\" and that \"I'm good\"! Such a relief! Please know that you are in my prayers. I hope to hear from you both soon. We live in NC and are leaving for Mass. about 4 a.m. Friday (my husband's brother was cremated and we had a memorial service here this p.m. and will have his funeral service and burial in Mass.) We'll be back Monday late or early Tuesday, so I'll check on you girls as soon as I'm awake enough! Thank you both so much! Lori",

      "Content": "Hi! I've been here before (on the message board), but it was concerning the loss of my Momma this past February, in the Caregivers section. She had a radical mastectomy when she was 40. I just turned 36. Found a lump, and went to the doctor on Monday, and am having the mammogram Wednesday. Feeling really scared. Just kind-of needed to \"talk\" to someone. My brother-in-law is dying of adenocarcinoma - doesn't look like he has long left, and just don't want to burden the family with my doc's suspicions. I'd be grateful for any response. Thanks! Scared, Dazed, and Confused (Lori)",
