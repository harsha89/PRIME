    "Content": "I see there are a few older messages in the archive about this topic. I'd like to hear from anyone who can offer suggestions, or who has found relief. I've had pmps since my mastectomy a year ago. I have been treated with elavil, neurontin and methadone but I don't think the meds make much of a difference. I have had extensive occupational therapy. I have spent a fortune on weekly massage. I am now going to try acupuncture. I'd love to swap info and sympathy with anybody else out there. By the way, I'm in Michigan. Anyone near me? Oh, this is not what I bargained for!",
