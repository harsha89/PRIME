    "Content": "I am nearly finished with my treatments and surgeries for my her2, stage 2 diagnosis- Aug 2014. My treatments consisted of 4 treatments every threes of taxotere, Herceptin , carboplatin, and Perjeta. Then I did 3 rounds of FEC (fluorouracil, epirubicin , cytoxan) then I had a double mastectomy and continued with 12 more treatments of Herceptin. My last treatment will be Oct 28th, 2015. My treatments were every three weeks. I hope this was helpful. I had different side effects with each round of different drugs. About 4 days after my Herceptin treatment I feel like I have the flu- very fatigued. That is actually today. So I spend my time on the sofa resting. It lasts about two days and then I start to regain my strength. My oncologist was fabulous and a big supporter of Perjeta and Herceptin effectiveness. I recommend you look into adding Perjeta to your treatment- it may not be for you though. Everyone's journey is unique. Taking the Perjeta along with the Herceptin minimized my rumors almost immediately. By my second round of Perjeta, Herceptin, carboplatin, taxotere, I could no longer feel my tumors in my breast. The best to you! Surround yourself with positive supportive help- it makes all the difference in your recovery and fight against this monster. YOUVE GOT THIS !!!!",
