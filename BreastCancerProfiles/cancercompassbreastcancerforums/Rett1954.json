Oh Thank you, so much your last paragraph was exactly what I said to him when I was in before my first biopsy the very thing you said about his wife, mother or sister...what he said after that was well lets put your mind to rest and ordered the biopsy and it came back stage 2 Thank you, it is a breast surgeon but he is so busy that I think that his office may be a little overwhelmed. I am so glad for this outlet one of my best friends that I could talk this over with died on june 21 of colon cancer and we were both being treated with chemo and could share our thoughts and fears ...she was my dear sister-friend for over 23 years.   Thank you, for caring and sharing , May God bless and keep you.

      "Content": "Is this normal ? 2 Mammo's 1 st 5.2 second 6.25       #651456 - 07/10/07 05:21 PM Edit   Reply   Quote   Quick Reply   I have been having pain in my right breast after lumpectomy in Nov 06 , positive for metastatic carcinoma, single lymph node. I starting having breast pain like someone was stabbing me in May went to my surgeon he assured me that it was just my body awakening after surgery but I had not had any problems before than. Went to my primary sent for a mammo on 5.2.07 results..A spiculated density is seen and not really appreciated on the previous exam of feb 06 pre -operative and most likely is related to post surgical changes. Had another problem went back to primary concerned about itching and pain in my right breast sent for another mammo 6.25.07. Results : Increasing skin thickening and density in the right breast compared to the study form one month ago. The main differential diagnosis would be mastitis , Lymhedema recurrent tumor. I recommend the patient have a surgical consultation for further evaluation. Assesment 4-suspicious abnormality, biopsy should be considered ...Recommendation : Suggestive of malignancy-take appropriate action. My concern is when I told my surgeon my oncologist , my follow-up for radiation that I was in pain and I just did not believe it was normal they said no...it's ok just normal after radiation. But I complained about the rash under my breast and the pain that was waking me up and that I could hardly stand for someone to touch my breast. If this is nothing and it does not feel like that, I am a 52 year old black woman if that matters and from alot of reports it does. What I have read is that breast cancer is more aggressive in African-American Woman ..report dated 7.10.07 Science daily. and that we have poorer prognoses. Let me end with saying that when I first went to this same surgeon he said no you are fine , but because I kept complaining he said lets put this to rest and do a biopsy and it came back stage 2 , with 22 lymph nodes removed 2 positive for metastatic duct carcinoma. So when I went in May he again said if you have had cancer we take that serious but a little over a month I am still in pain and had it not been for my primary doctor I was being put off until September. I have 2 sons and 2 grandchildren and a husband that I do want to live for and myself, I just need some help",

Good Morning, Apparently, our God thought we had the right stuff to be able to go thru this battle. I can remember when I was first diagnoised I told God I wanted to be a good representative, now for a little background.  I was adopted when I was almost 2 the a family in Dallas, Texas ( a Texan)  and my mom died at 41 of Leukemia when I was 9.  But I can remember how she never stopped doing housework or baking.  Well I can't bake !! but I am pretty good.  What I learned was that you can either go thru the things that life has for you standing up or being drugged..well you and I my dear are going thru life standing up and enjoying each and every day. I did a little reading and was encouraged about thyroid cancer I know that the work that our father has started he will complete in your life. You are my evidence that God will send another angel by just when you need one !  My dear I am glad that your doctor was able to take time with you. So we are in agreement that we shall beat this and just live life well each day...I live in Fort Lauderdale, and it's a stormy day today.  So smile you have a friend and I will pray that God will restore you daily !!! Please be blessed and just have the peace that passes all understanding . Rett       ",

Just wanted to say how sorry I am about your dear friend.  It must have helped to have someone who understands what you are going through.  My good friend decided she was too busy or just didn't care to be involved when I was scheduled for my 7 weeks of radiation over 3 years ago.  I'm scheduled for surgery once again on August 1st, this time for thryoid cancer and I doubt I'll hear from her in the up coming weeks or months.  My daughters are young adults and pursuing their own careers etc.  It's been lonely at times going through all of this but it has made me stronger.  My husband tries to be there but he is too close and I don't want to upset him even more so I try to put on a brave face sometimes not so brave.  It is nice to have this outlet to share one's feelings.  Best wishes to you as well and God bless! Good Morning, I feel so blessed to be able to see the message in my in-box, I always spoke to my best friend each morning.  So my dear, you're stuck with me I don't have a computer at home so when I am at work I'll be able to reply you know I am 53 years old and I have been blessed to have some wonderful people around me during this, because early on when I first found out my husband and I were not together and he did not come back at first because of my thinking how shallow I would be , please come back because I have cancer but he did come back this past March, I was diagnoised in Oct 06 , surgery in Nov 06...and all that jazz. Well my dear friend, I trust God enough for you and I will ask that He send his angels to keep you in perfect peace ! So here is the little bit of wisdom that I have , I find that not all of our friends or family can come up to the level that we need and that sometimes you only have people in your life for a certain period and than I finally had to ask myself was I her friend or was she my friend and the answer was that I was her friend and she really was not mind (another I thought hope to die friend that left my circle) you can live and forgive them for not being able to stretch outside of their world. God will give you friends for the journey that will help you weather the storm. Be of good cheer , email whenever ! today is a good day and lets say together that we will be happy today. Hey it's Friday the 13th and it's a good and happy day for us !!!! In Gods Arms Rett    ",
