      "Content": "Hi. You may want to check out Fred Eichorn in St. James, NY. I've heard good things about him and I, myself, am starting his regimen today. He cured himself of pancreatic cancer back in the 70's. The national cancer research foundation in St. James NY. http://www.ncrf.org/ Here's an excerpt from a cancer newsletter authored by Bill Henderson about Fred Eichorn: Fred Eichhorn -- A Noble Gentleman *********************************** In the last month, I have been blessed with a closer relationship with a remarkable man. Fred Eichhorn has been featured in my newsletter before -- in the June 13, 2001 issue. He has founded the National Cancer Research Foundation, which you can learn more about at his web site: http://www.ncrf.org Now that I know a lot more about him, both personally and professionally, I'd like to urge you to consider him as a resource for helping you treat your cancer. In 1976, at age 21, after 5 years and 34 incorrect diagnoses, Fred was diagnosed with islet cell carcinoma. He was given 8 months to live without the delicate surgery required or 1 1/2 to 3 years with the surgery. A Middle Eastern doctor performed the surgery and prescribed a vitamin regimen to combat recurrence. Fred studied medicine in the 1980's, including four years of transplantation research. He taught Chemistry for 3 years and researched the bio-mechanics of the pancreas/endocrinology system. He concluded that cancer research suffers from tunnel vision and that American medicine treats symptoms, not causes. No surprises there to readers of this rag. Fred was injured badly in the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. He had many fractures and internal injuries. During his 2 1/2 year recuperation, he continued his research on cancer and other diseases. He was able to help many people while still in bed. His theory, based on many years of research, is that cancer is the result of a long-term vitamin deficiency combined with low calcium and acidic pH. Correcting these conditions reduces the cancer to levels manageable by your body's immune system. His resolve to expand his program was spurred by the death of his sister, Diana, in December, 1997 from metastisized cancer. Fred had tracked her various surgeries and chemotherapy, frustrated with his inability to convince her to refuse them and trust his treatment. She did take his vitamin treatment before and after her final surgery and had a remarkable recovery. Once home, though, she stopped taking his vitamin formula and refused all other treatment insisting she was cured. A few weeks later she passed away. She was 45 with two children who were 18 and 20 at the time. Fred and his wife, Lora, established a clinic they called Lindenmere, dedicating it to Diana. Up until February of this year, they had a 92% success rate treating all types of cancer in over 2,000 patients. In addition, Fred had found his formula works to reverse multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons and Graves diseases, AIDS, Epstein Barre, Lyme's disease, hepatitis \"C,\" diabetes, glaucoma, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, manic depression, ADHD and even drug/cigarette/alcohol addiction. He says \"I learned of the others by accident, as additional results from cancer patients with additional conditions or their family members who decided to try it.\" Hard to believe? I know. I still have a healty dose of skepticism about claims like those that Fred makes. You should, too. Two things convinced me that you should seek out his treat- ment: 1. The 72 pages of testimonials he sent me. They are very convincing and cover several years of cancer-free survival by many, many people with all types of cancer, most of whom had their system's devastated by conventional treatment before coming to Fred's clinic. 2. And, of course, the following statement from Fred: \"The NCRF [National Cancer Research Foundation] has never taken a single penny from any person we helped...The goal of this research foundation is to help those afflicted at no cost to them, as we do not want any person to hesitate to seek help due to lack of funds.\" The above has been verified for me by two people I trust: One is Ed van Overloop, who I introduced you to in my January 11, 2002 newsletter in the article \"Meet Two Fellow Crusaders-A Wealth of Info For You.\" Ed runs a cancer support group in New Jersey. His group has about 100 cancer patients and survivors as members. Ed knows Fred Eichhorn personally and has assured me that he is \"the real deal.\" He told me that Lindenmere, the clinic Fred operated was a 14-room Bed & Breakfast on Fire Island (on Long Island about 40 miles east of New York's Kennedy International Airport). It is a $2.5 million estate once owned by Imelda Marcos. You can see pictures of it at: http://www.ncrf.org/ Just scroll down and click on \"Image Galleries\" on the left. Look for the first set of pictures, which is all Lindenmere. There are more rooms in a motel-like arrangement on the estate. It has 17 bathrooms with real gold accessories. Fred ran his holistic clinic there, sleeping only 3 hours a night. The other informant about Fred and his work was Steve Davis. Steve lives in New York. He is one of the most skeptical people I have met in my three years of chatting with cancer patients. Here's what Steve had to say about Fred and his treatment in his first communication with me last November: \"Thanks for an informative website. I have an inquiry regarding the NCRF and Fred Eichhorn. I believe you wrote briefly about him in an issue last year. I found out about his work by chance. He's very unusual in this field since he's not in for the money, as I gather you know. I understand he is a very generous and decent person. The question that is bewildering to me is 'why is his work known by so few?' Even the nonprofit alternative cancer orgs. and web sites have nothing listed on his work. And he seems to be helping so high a % of people with late stage disease and with so many different forms...I'm really at a loss to understand this. Can you explain? Any feedback you have on this issue and Fred would be appreciated.\" Since then, I've had several conversations with Steve about Fred Eichhorn and other topics. My only answer on why Fred's work is not better known is that he is well aware of the oppression of cancer fighters like those documented so well in Daniel Haley's book \"Politics in Healing - The Suppression and Manipulation of American Medicine.\" [By the way, if you haven't read this book, do so. It is a sure cure to death from excessive trust in your doctor.] Fred, on the other hand, has submitted his program to the American Medical Association in an attempt to get their \"endorsement.\" This may sound naive to those of you who know, as I do, the history of that organization. At any rate, he has gotten neither approval or disapproval from the AMA. They say they do not have \"enough supportive documentation\" to make a declaration either way. Folks, this is a gentleman of complete integrity devoted to helping his fellow humans cope with a condition he knows a lot about. I have read the 42-page explanation of his theory of cancer causes and cures. I can't say I completely understand it. That understanding would take a lot more medical training than the self-help version I have glommed together over the last few years. It has to do with certain specific functions of the autonomic nervous system and how those react to deficiencies of vitamins, low calcium levels and acidic pH. He discusses specifics about colon, prostate, breast, lung, bone and many other cancers to support his theory. His formula consists of very specific daily amounts of the following: calcium/magnesium (3,000 mg to 12,000 mg); chromium picolinate (600 mcg to 2,000 mcg); vitamin A (1,250 units to 15,000 units); vitamin D (140 units to 1,400 units); Knox gelatin (2 to 4 packages); milk thistle (1,200m mg to 4,800 mg); shark cartilage (4,500 mg to 18,000 mg); vitamin E (1,200 units to 4,000 units); and zinc (300 mg to 1,200 mg). The dosage varies with the reaction you choose -- from \"maintenance\" (the lowest) to \"best reversal\" (the highest). The price varies from $75 a month for the \"maintenance\" dose to $300 a month for the \"best reversal\" dose. [Please don't send me e-mails about the toxicity of Vitamins A and D. These doses are way below the toxic level for both of these vitamins.] Unfortunately, in February of this year, Fred and Lora were forced to move out of Lindenmere because of a problem the seller of that property had with a lien. Nothing that Fred or Lora had done had anything to do with it. It was just that the owner could not clear up the legal dispute on the property and insisted they pay $18,000 a month rent until closing, which might never occur. Fred and Lora finally ran out of patience and decided to move back to their home in St. James, New York. They cannot now take in as many \"live-in\" patients as they could at Lindenmere. Fred has made his formula available for purchase in either a capsule or flavored powder form through a company they have called Cellect, Inc. They are working on a web site where you can order it online. Until that is ready, you can order it by phone at the toll free number: 1-866-MY CELLECT, which is: 1-866-692-3553. To talk to Fred, you can call him at his main number at: 1-631-584-3100, fax 1-631-584-4833, or toll free 1-877-CANCER FREE, which is 1-877-226-2373. Usually he is busy with patients, so leave a number and he will call you back. You can also reach him by e-mail at: fveichh@optonline.net (personal) or ncrf@optonline.net (foundation). Fred and Lora hope that the situation with Lindenmere will clear up and they can move back, but they're not optimistic. Here is Fred reminiscing about their days at Lindenmere: \"There were many people who came out just to get away and sit out on the porch in wicker chairs or at the dock just to get their thoughts together. When they went home, the smile on their face was the best thank you I could receive. There were some who came out here at 11:00 at night because they were in pain, and we would sit on the porch and look at the bay in the moonlight while we talk about their situation, knowing that nobody could hear us because of the privacy yet openness to the world with the bay just open and endless. When we would finish at 2 or 3 AM, they were bright eyed and energetic and they knew what to do, as they drove down that long driveway, you could see in the moonlight that they were happy again. There was a young woman who had AIDS for 9 years and was pregnant and it became full-blown AIDS, the situation was devastating and the hospital demanded that she have it aborted. I was able to start helping her in her 1st trimester to help her get rid of her AIDS. She delivered a perfectly healthy baby and neither she nor the baby have AIDS, the hospital was confused. I would not take a penny from her, but she was so happy, In return, she sold me her new jet speedboat that she was not able to afford anymore because of the medical costs to have the baby. I took over the payments and with the property the way it was, we could take people for a good ride out in the bay. Now we cannot do that. I knew that my sleepless nights on the computer and phone paid off, not only for the gal with AIDS, but for everyone.\" Hope this helps! Thanks, Linda",
