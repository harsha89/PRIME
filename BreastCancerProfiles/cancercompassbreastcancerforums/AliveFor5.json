    "Content": "I am a breast cancer survivor (almost 3 years now) and I'm starting a new project called ALIVE FOR 5 that will help celebrate 5-year anniversaries for cancer survivors. Survivors will be able to send us their upcoming 5-year \"cancerversary\" date and we will announce those survivors on our site on that day - helping them to celebrate this milestone and also giving hope to those that are still fighting every day to survive. For now, we just have a launch page up that allows you to provide your email address so that we can contact you when the site goes live. Please stop by AliveFor5.com  and\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.AliveFor5.com  and enter your email address to show your support.   Thanks! -Kristen AliveFor5.com HealthyCancerChick.com",
