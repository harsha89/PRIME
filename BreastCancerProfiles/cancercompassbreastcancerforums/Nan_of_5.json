      "Content": "I to have dcis, and had it removed. but am starting the radiation treatment in a couple weeks, I am having a tube inserted into the area where the biopsy was done and the treatments are 2 times a day for 5 days and then you are done. I chose that treatment to be done with it. There was a 11-15% chance the cancer would come back even though they said the cancer is not life threatening. I wanted any seeds that might be in there not to grow or get a chance to. I am 53 and have just gotten 2 new granddaughters and I want to do what ever it takes to make sure I am around to see them grow. Nan of 5",
