    "Content": "I just joined this message board. Started taking Anastrozole (generic Arimidex) a month ago following surgery + 33 sessions of radiation for IDC, stage 1, grade 1. I have felt slight nausea round the clock and also have what feels like bad indigestion. I have a constant pain in the middle of my upper abdomen as well as achiness/pain in my lower back and lower abdomen. Does anyone else feel these side effects? I also feel like my hair is thinning!",
