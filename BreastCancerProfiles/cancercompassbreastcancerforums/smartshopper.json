In August 2004, I was diagnosed with metatstatic breast cancer in my lungs and bones. My oncologist currently has me on weekly treatments of Decadron, Benadryl, Zantac. The chemo of choice is Taxol. Since my form of cancer feeds on estrogen, I get monthly doses of Zoladex to suppress my ovaries producing estrogen and Zometa to strengthen my bones which are weakened by the Decadron. I am currently experiencing hip pain and I've been walking with a limp since May 2004. Most days the pain is enough to be a nuisance without requiring pain medicine. The degree to which I limp sometimes varies. Some days - like today - my limp isn't bad, I almost walk like normal. Other days - like yesterday - I looked really bad and those close to me were suggesting I start planning for hip replacement surgery. But the pain and limp continues to be inconsistent. My concern is quality of life. My current oncologist is only concerned with treating the cancer, she seems totally unconcerned that one or possibly more of the drugs are impacting my ability to walk. I saw two orthopedic specialists who both say my condition could be caused by the Decadron. I receive Decadron to avoid having an allergic reaction to the Taxol. I maintain a positive attitude and I know I've been blessed to be able to work 45 hours a week while going for chemotherapy every week. I just can't accept the idea of having to go through another surgery. I have had more surgery and hospital stays in the last two years than in my whole life. I have more doctors, more scars and keloids, more medical vocabulary and more reminders of what I've already lived through than I can shake a stick at. I've read comments from so many others that have asked their oncologist about nutrition or having some participation in their treatment or recovery process and the doctors have no answers about nutrition or any other questions. Has anyone had a similar experience and gone to a specialist who deals in alternative treatments and (1) stopped chemotherapy and (2) is living cancer-free? I'm convinced that there is an alternative treatment out there that is better for me than chemotherapy. I would just feel better knowing that someone else out there had a positive experience with alternative treatments before I embark on this journey of exploration. Frannie,  Please go and check out the Yahoo group   flaxseedoil2  and you will see much information presented about cottage cheese and flax oil and the long time history of progress within this group......just give it a try.....no meds...and an excellent success rate................but for you to see and decide",
