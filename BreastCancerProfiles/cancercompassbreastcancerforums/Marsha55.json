I live outside of the USA and they want thousands of dollars for the test. I am American and can ship from a US address if that would save me money.... thanks joann I just had the test done.  Cost is $3650.00.  They will appeal with your insurance company if it doesn't go through the first time.  They also have a program where it may be free if you fit a certain financial criteria.  If that doesn't do it, they take payment plans.  They are very nice and the last thing they want you to do is worry about paying for this test and letting that keep you from getting proper treatment.  I will get the results of mine 3-21-08.",
