      "Content": "Hi, I was on Aromasin for a year but I could barely walk by the time I switched to Femara. I knees hurt and I was a avid hiker. My calfs hurt, my feet were swollen. I couldn't stand. I gained 50 pounds. I was tired all the time. I finally called my oncologist and said I cannot go on and he switched me to Femara and remarkedly a lot of the symtoms went away. My knees still hurt. I did figure out that Femara makes me sleepy about 8-9 hours after I take it. I wish I would have figured that out sooner and if it was the same with the Aromasin. I now take at around 1 p.m. after lunch and I'm not tired when I wake in the morning and my feet are not so swollen. I joined a water areobics and feel a lot better but cannot hike yet. I hope this helps someone.",

      "Content": "Hi, I was 48 when I got cancer. After the first chemo treatment in went into chemically induced menopause. Great! None of the bad stuff happened except for hot flashes on tomoxifen. I'm on Femera (another story) now but I only see my oncologist once a year and then another doctor for my annual mamogram. I felt I was without my life line but that passed as time went on. Just keeping up with reading message boards helped such as this one to keep in touch with the cancer community. A book I read by Dr. Bernie Siegel \"How to live between office visits\" helped somewhat. I can't go back to hiking yet because of the knee pain from the Femera but go to water exercise twice a week and that helps me. I think just being with people who exercise. I work but that's not the same support. We just need to be dilgent and stay tuned to our bodies and not ignore things just because it's supposed to be old age.",
