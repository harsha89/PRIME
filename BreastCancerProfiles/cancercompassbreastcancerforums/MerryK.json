    "Content": "Glad I found this message board.  I've begun having headaches and nausea in the afternoons.  I thought perhaps it was something invironmental, but reading the posts about Arimidex may have pointed out the real problem.  I had severe pain with Femara and was given Cymbalta by my primary.  My cancer metastisized and I quit taking the Femara when I had surgery and then chemo.  Because I mentioned the pain, my oncologist recommended Arimidex in place of Femara.  I've probably been taking it about four months and noticed I'm having more headaches.  When the nausea started, I thought I'd picked up a bug.  When it recurred, I thought the household might be passing it around.  Now I'm having headaches daily and the nausea in the afternoons.  I am limited as to what I can take for headaches since I also have bleeding in my bladder.  That is a side effect of pelvic radiation.  But I am ALIVE and there was a point in 2005 when that wasn't a sure thing.  (Not that I knew it at the time.)  I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in Nov 2004.  It recurred in 2005 while I was still under the care of the radiation oncologist.  Since my cancer does have estrogen receptors, it makes sense to take one of the aromatase inhibitors, but I think Arimides isn't the one for me. Thanks for all the information. Merry K",
