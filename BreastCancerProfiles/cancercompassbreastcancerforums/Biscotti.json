      "Content": "-Thanks for writing back so soon, I cannot tolerate Tamoxifen because it sometimes causes blood clots and I have had several in my legs in the past. I see the oncologist tomorrow and have nearly decided to go without any drug. Dammed it you do and if you don't. I don't know.

      "Content": "I had stage one breast cancer and had 16 weeks of radiation. At this time (Feb 08) my doctor put me on Arimidex. I had side effects like weight gain (16lbs) in two months. No sleeping and horrible increase in my arthritis. I couldn't hold a pencil. When I saw my oncologist he put me on Aromasin that I have been on for 6 weeks. My arthritis is somewhat better and my weight gain has slowed but I still have hair loss and depression not to mention i don't sleep anymore. The doctor told me I could opt to not take any drug and take my chances. I am totally confused and feel so alone. So do I stop everything? I am sixty-five and would be on it till I'm seventy. Besides all that Aromasin costs me $390 a month. I am a wreck. I would appreciate any input. Thanks Rosalie",

      "Content": "I have been very depressed lately and the doctor recommended a couple months of an anti-depressant. Then I went on line and looked them up, it seems that most anti-depressants cancel out the Tamoxiphin. I do not want to get breast cancer back but I need help. Has anyone had this problem too. My fears are getting the better of me. Thanks, RosalieBiscotti",
