    "Content": "I had DCIS with a mastectomy reconstruction 3 years ago. I was lucky and didn't require any treatment after or medication after. Unfortunately, I've had constant tightness pain in the area of the back where muscle was brought around my back under arm to make my new boob. The pain is excruisiating still. I have now just been diagnosed with osteoporosis. I was wondering if the tightnesss over a period of time could have caused the disfigurment in my back. Has anybody out there suffered and resolved the pain please?",
