    "Content": "Hello everyone, My family and I just found out last Monday that our mom's breast cancer has spread to her spine. She was diagnosed 2 years ago and went through a year of chemotherapy followed by radiation treatments. She did herceptin for a year along with a couple of other chemo drugs that were only for about 6 months that I do not recall the names of. She has not had any cancer treatments for 10 months until now. She was due for a pet scan in 2 months but ended up getting it done early because she was having back pain and that's when they found a growth in her vertebrae. She started radiation this week and will be doing 15 treatments (3 weeks). She will also be taking Xgeva, Pertuzumab, Faslodex, and Herceptin. We are trying to find any information or personal experiences with these medications. We are familiar with Herceptin because of her first round but not the other 3 meds. If anyone can help In any way that would be amazing! We want our mom to be around for another 30 years and will do anything to make that happen! Thank you for taking the time to read this! God bless!
