I have a very sensitive stomach and also have mitrial valve prolaspe(mild). Also strokes run in the family..does anyone know which one might be better for me.. Would like to know what the side effects are on both drugs.Tryed fermera before  and gave me really bad body pains and aches.made dr's think i have fibro myalgia so it makes it worse they say. So now my dr.prescribed tomoxifen i am scared to take it  due to my stomach pain recently waiting for my stomach to feel better then i am going to try it.. Please let me know what side effects are from fermera ,tomoifen and arimadex.. Thanks !  I am currently on femara and have less side effects.  However, all of them cause body aches.  Femara seems to have less.  I took arimidex for two years and started taking only half of one, when I told my oncologist, he reccommended me trying femara.  I think you have to look for the one that gives you the least side affects.  After all, you have to take it for five years.  My sister-in-law has always taken arimidex with no problems.  I guess you and I don't have the same tolerance  as her with these drugs.  May God Bless you and hang in there.  ",
