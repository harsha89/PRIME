      "Content": " I too have been limping and suffering severe back and hip pain.About a month before finding my breast lump I suffered a fall and fractured my hip. They put 3 pins in and then 2 months later I had the lumpectomy on my breast and radiation. That was in July of 2008. I didn't get chemo but the radiation burned my eyes, had to have cataract surgery on both eyes and burned my lungs so I couldn't breath and ended up in the hospital and a month on stereoids. I was walking absolutely fine then after my hip surgery. It was April of 2009 when they told me I had to start taking Femarra. The doctor told me at 60 that I would feel like a 90 year old body. She was sooooo right. After 2 days the pain in my body and the limping started - I could hardly walk first thing getting out of bed and the pain in my hip then created my limp and Femara stated that it causes back pain and it sure did. I had gone to my oncologist and she sent me for xrays because she saw how I was limping but nothing showed up.  After five years of it getting worse I went back to my orthopedic doctor and he said it wasn't too bad but since I was done with that awful pill - he knew what femara did to deteriorate bones - he said now it is time to exercise to strenthen the hip. I was doing that and it got much worse very quickily. Now I'm facing hip surgery of some kind again due to massive bone deterioration which just happens to be one big result of femara. I really wish I had not taken that pill. I was walking fine until taking Femara.  iT IS A SINFUL PILL.    I'm going to my ortho doctor tomorrow to find out the results of the MRI that I went thorugh on Sat.  for my back and hip.  That was  very uncomfotable Sat. morning - 1 1/2 hours in the machine.  My son had told me that if I didn't do something soon by the way I was walking worse and worse and the pain worse and worse I would be in a wheelchar.  Hoping for a solution when I go to the ortho doc tomorrow.",

      "Content": "Following step 1 breast cancer, a lumpectomy and radiation, I have been taking the femara for only 2 years and the debilitating effects are terrible.  Arthritis in my hands is painful enough to bring tears and in the mornings my hands don't even work until I stretch them and work them.  After about an hour I can walk right and use my hands.  I'm thinking of telling my doc to change my medication but she said I have to take it for 5 years.  Are the pains and sore joints going to get worse? I would like to kinow if anyone has taken the full 5 year course on this and what the results are and what you might be taking for the pain.  Thanks Judy",
