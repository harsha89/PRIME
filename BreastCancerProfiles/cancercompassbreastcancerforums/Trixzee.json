Its been a few years now since she was diagsnosed with stage 1 lobular cancer. she was put on tamoxifin and had a double mastectomy...awhile later she returned to show 3 spots on her liver. the doctors read them out as hemangiomas. three months later she came back, she had full blown mets in her liver. just telling that makes me so angry...anyways, back to it. she did the minimal chemo, she believes in organic foods, good nutrition, supplements, alterative treatments. to say the least chemo made her feel horrible and she felt horrible putting that into her body. so she began alternative options and  started to lose support from the conventional docotrs which is a whole other story, that also frustrates me...well she did her own treatments, and felt great, looked great, sounded great...but 5 weeks ago she had a CT and it is progressing, so she agreed to go on femara. now she feels horrible, the pain is intense, her belly is bloated, and i feel so helpless....not to mention scared. i feel sometimes like the anger is overwhelming these days. why my mom, why any of us? why is it so hard to find a good doctor? why is life so unfair?   Any advice out there would be much apprecitate Hello, My name is Tammy I am a mother of 4 and I am 42 years old and I have mets. breast cancer to the liver. My CT was read as a hemangioma or possible cyst and I had the Hemangioma study done and it was neg. and we watched it and it grew and changed so I had the biopsy done and it is cancer, so I have no wonderful advise on treatments but the only advise I wish to give is have days of love and quality time with your mother, forget the why and have the we done this days. Even on days that she feels bad the gift of a smile goes alot further. I know my options are poor but I tell my kids we can have a life time of memorys together if you don't dwell on the negative part, I know it is hard but don't let it run your whole life, because believe it or not I refuse to let it controll my whole life. My best wishes and love to you and your family. Tammy",

But with that said, we found out last week that it is now on the liver.  Found through a CAT scan .  I have been on a blinded trial for \"avistan\" and so they (the docs.) are going to find out if I was actually getting the drug or not...  If not, I will immediatly start gettting it. Will be getting a PET scan on Thursday and am terrified that things really will be as bad as they are.  Is there anyone out there going thru anything like me??? I am trying not to think about it being on an organ, but I know nobody in my area with anything like this.  Even at the clinic, I am the youngest person usually there (am 39).  Not too many people with mets breast cancer stage IV. Yancy I am so sorry to hear about you news. I am a nurse 42 years old diagnosed with breast cancer last year and finished my chemo in Feb this year and recieved a cat scan which showed spots on my liver so I went through pet scan and biopsy to confirm my diagnosis and it is in my liver and no where else at present, now my cancer was HER 2 positive breast cancer and a stage 3 last year. I done so well on the chemo I thought I was going to be just fine for a little while anyway and now this. I have continued to work the entire time and I am at work right now and it keeps me busy especially when you combine my 4 children and 1 grandchild with it. I have not given up, I will fight with everything in me but I know that the Lord is what keeps me strong. I wish I had some words that could help you but I don't my only wish is that if you need an ear to listen I will be there and if you need a friend I will be there. My only advise to you is to live everyday as it was your last and that advise is to all because there is no guarantee of tomorrow, and never give up put a smile on your face and shock the world. My friends and my co-workers tell me I am not normal I shed my 5 tears I told my family and now it is me who will make the ultimate decission on whether I let it controll my life or if I controll it. My best wish to you. Tammy",
