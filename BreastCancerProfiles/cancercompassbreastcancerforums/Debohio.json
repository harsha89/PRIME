    "Content": "Dear Gina,<br><br> I was web surfing for info because my neighbor who is in her early 40's was recently diagnosed with breast cancer.<p> She had surgery last week and returned to work today. <p> I put her son on the bus in the AM and when she dropped him off today I gave her a small jar of marbles.<p> I bought several tiny baby food jars and spray painted the caps. I then added colorful marbles to the jar. (My 10 year old son ate the apple sauce so the food did not go to waste)<p> I gave her the jar and said... \"This is for you.... There are going to be times when you FEEL like you are losing your marbles.... well... you just look at this jar because HERE THEY ARE.\"<p> She busted up laughing. :) I know it's a tiny gesture, but something to remind my friend that I CARE. <p> I've given other friends jars of marbles like this and at times I tie a small ribbon and bow around the lid.<p> Maybe something you could do for your Mom.<p> Actually I was looking for info to help out this friend's teenage daughter. They just told the children... The teenage dtr and a younger son about Mom's cancer last night. If you would care to email me, please do.--- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
