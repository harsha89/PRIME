I can't believe that we have  4 \"baby\" grands that won't remember who she really was....they will remember the memories that we will share so she is alive in their hearts....but not the physical memories,like her silliness, the kiss she fixed a booboo with, or flying the kites on the windiest day of  the year. I am scared  of who I will become when she isn't here anymore.  She is my right hand , she is Lucy to my Ethel.  She is my soul and my heart.   ",

      "Content": "KayleighGrace, Tre and Kittcath,  we have been told that it could be anytime. She is now enrolled with Hospice. We were told in Jan. that it could be 3-4 months. I know that God is the one in charge of the timeline,not the Drs.  I can only tell that she seems to not be as strong as she has been and she is starting to sleep more.  When she feels up for a ride in the country, it doesn't take long before she is ready to go home because she is tired. Today, my husband,my son  and brother-in-law made a ramp so she doesn't have to climb stairs.  Yesterday, was the last day of doing that. She hasn't done chemo now for 4 mths.  She has had (at one time) whole head rad, and the one time she had Cyber Knife was last Sept. They had tried Tykerb and then Abraxane but they made her too sick.  So then you decide if you would rather have quantity or quality of life. She has been fighting this since 03. Started as breast cancer,now has mets in brain. She is my hero.  We are so close.  We share the same driveway, she  lives in an apartment that my husband,myself and her had built in 85. We have been best buds since forever.  Even though we have 3 other sisters, we are the two youngest and the two closest. You might be asking why I don't say all this to them....because they love her  as much as I do....I know they hurt as much as I do...it is easier not to let them see or hear where I am in this. Three years ago, we lost our mother.....seven years ago I (we) lost my oldest son.  Sometimes all of this comsumes me.  I am losing yet again someone that I love..... I pray everynight  that God be gentle and not to prolong this.  No matter how much it breaks my heart, I will not be selfish, I will let her go.  This is one trip that she will have to go without me.................  ",

Cancer doesn't seem to care about age, so don't let these docs push you off because of that. I would get a biopsy right away & see what you're really dealing with. These people are not God & should never be cocky enough to think they know all the answers. Make that appt today & you can have some peace in your mind.

Do not, I repeat, do not think or let them think that just because you are only 27 that this could not be  something that should be looked into.   My son ,was 27 when he was told that the palpations he was having was something  that a million other people lived with everyday.  That was June 12, 2001.  On July 4,2001 he died of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. I believed then as I do now that his age had alot to do with it.  Sometimes insurances say they don't think it would be cost effective to run a battery of tests on someone that \"young\". Don't take that wrong, he had had a stress test, wore an event monitor and a holter moniter.  That is where the \"million of people live......\"comes in. I finally got my act together and took his autospy report and previous results to my cardiologist  and within a blink of an eye he told me that what showed on the autospy was a heart defect that he had to have been born with that made me lose him.. He also said that if certain other tests would have been taken he probably would have been a 27 year old walking around  with a defrillbulater .....yet back then they only had pacemakers I know that I've gone on and on, but what I want you to do is have the biopsy.  If it comes back okay, that's okay.    Be proactive when it comes to you and your health.  You don't always get second chances.  Let us know what you find out,okay?  If it turns out it is something, there are alot of us who can always lend you an ear,  There is strenght in numbers.     ",

      "Content": "On March 31, 9:15 a.m. Kelly left us.   I want to share with you the sister I love so much.  This is a little lengthy.  But the world will be a better place for having known just this much of her. What a gift our mother gave us when she had Kelly.  Most of you know she was the world to me.  Mother always said that we were Siamese twins attached at the hip, born two years apart.  You never saw one of us without the other and if you did you may have thought,,maybe there is only one of those girls afterall. Losing her, I have lost half of myself, my heart, my soul.  Truly she was a gift from God.  She was my best friend, my confidant, my partner in crime. (We never got arrested,ha ha.\") When we were told that there was only a few months, we were talking one day and I asked her what was I going to do without my right hand?  She said go left.  That was Kelly, she could take a bad situation and find a way to make it positive.  Through all that she was going through...never, ever did she ask why me?  Instead she would say why not me.  Kelly was still Kelly through all of it.  She didn't want to be the poster child for cancer. Kelly was the happiest when her family was happy.  She only wanted good things for us.  It didn't matter how big or small as long as she was a part of it. She wasn't materialistic, her greatest possessions were her family.  Her love for all of us was unlimite and unconditional.  She had a unique relationship with each member of our family.  Whichever one she was with at any given time,You were it, You were the most important, accepted, without expectations,  She may not have agreed, but she never judged. The newest baby was Kelly's new toy.  She loved their innocence and couldn't get her arms opened fast enough so she could embrace them with every ounce of herself.  She was a 2nd mother to our children and our children's, children. Kelly was a giver----asking nothing in return.  Any project being done, whether it was a new house being built, she was there with hammer in hand.  A garden being planted--again she was there only this time it was with a rake or hoe. Most of you know that Kelly was independence personified.  In the last couple of months, we as a family gave her our time, our care. WE DROVE HER NUTS!  She hated that we were taking our time to give her the long deserved comfort and care she needed.  I don't know how many times she would say thank you or I'm so sorry.  She never had to say either and most of all---she never needed to apologize. Now she is in God's loving hands, hurting no more, with her beautiful smile and those sparkling eyes and we are grateful.  I ask only one thing.....God hold gently this life which you have created, now and forever. Amen. Thank you for the time you took to read this.  My world is different without her. I am proud to be her sister.  Thank you for the different times I was able to come here and get answers or to vent my  frustrations . You carried me through alot farther than I would have been able to go  by myself.         ",
