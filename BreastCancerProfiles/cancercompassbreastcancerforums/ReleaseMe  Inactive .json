You don't need to encourage her ( she doesn't need a cheerleader) and please don't constantly tell her to positive . It is what it is, some days will be good and some days not so much. Enjoy the good days and hold her hand on the bad ones.",

      "Content": "About six years ago the woman who lived across the street from us told me she had ovarian cancer. She was in her late sixties and didn\u2019t drive so everyone in the neighborhood pitch in to help her out. One day I was talking to her and she told me that she was starting a new chemo pill, at the time I had no idea that chemo came in a pill, but I know now it was probably Xeloda. A week or so later I walked out of my house and saw the police using a battering ram on her front door (her son's couldn\u2019t reach her so they called the police), I ran over to see what was going on and saw her face down on the floor. She was gone. I was shocked because the last time I saw her she was fine and she told me that she was crocheting a blanket for us. I talked to her son\u2019s and they feel that it was the chemo that killed her. But who knows ? My mom had colon cancer and I can tell you from first hand experience things can change in an instant. One minute things are normal and the next they are not. My mom had fevers, infections, passed out twice and was in the hospital more times than I can count. If someone were alone and these things happened, then yes death could happen or maybe it was cancer drugs and compromised immune system. With cancer its hard to say. I am sorry that your friend is gone and you are in such pain. Grief counseling or just talking to someone helps. There\u2019s a bereavement board on this website, everyone on this board will know how you feel.   Take care - Jillian    ",

      "Content": "Hey angel, Im really sorry that your family is going through cancer hell. Reading your post, it sounds like everything you are feeling is normal. There are so many highs and lows when someone has cancer . I understand what you are saying about your mom once being stronger than you mentally, physically and emotionally. I will never forget the look in my moms eyes, it was like she was a child , depending on me for her wellbeing. Its heartbreaking. I know the depression and sadness are overwhelming and some days you just can't smile and that's ok.  You are doing an amazing job taking care of your mom, your siblings and going to school. Yes you should take some time for yourself and do the things that give you some happiness or just some time to catch you breath. Don't feel bad for wanting to take a break form all of the responsibly you have. One thing that really has helped me with stress is yoga, it calms me down and helps me think clearer. Talking to people who are dealing with cancer also helps. This website has a lot of people that can offer support. There should be counseling available on your school campus.  Just live one day at a time.  Sending you strength ~ Jillian",

      "Content": "Angel, thank you . Grieving someone you love deeply is very hard. From my personal experience with my mom and people that Ive talked to who are going through the same thing, I have come to realize that we just learn to live with the pain. We are told that we will \" get over it \" but that is not true. Some days I do feel strong and positive and some days I don't but, either way its ok, we have to go with the flow and play the hand that was dealt to us.   Its good to hear that your mom is doing ok. Maybe she can get some normality back in her life. I know that chemotherapy is hard and your mom is probably greatful to be feeling good even if its for a short time. It sucks that her next chemo is Christmas eve. Its a good idea to celebrate it early, that way your mom will be feeling good enough to enjoy it. Im VERY happy to hear that you are feeling better and more at ease . There are so many ups and downs with cancer, so when the good days come enjoy them ! Wishing you and your family a happy and joyful Christmas.  Jillian ",

We would ask people to do small things like pick up a prescription or get a few things that we needed at the store. I think most people want to help but really don't know what to do .  Hang in there and just go with the flow. Jillian ",
