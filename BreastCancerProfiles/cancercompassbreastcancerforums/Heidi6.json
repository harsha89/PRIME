    "Content": "I tested 3+ strongly positive on the protein test for Her2.So my Dr. recommended Herceptin for 1-year. I started the treatments in Sept. -I did 3-treatments then Both my Drs. decided to give me the Fish-test. My fish test came back negative, so they say now I don't need the Herceptin treatments. The herceptin treatments were no problem! I felt completely normal after each one. I really was upset when they said they were taking me off it. But they really feel the fish test is more accurate on whether you are her2 positive and need the Herceptin. By the way my breat cancer was node-negative. Be sure to have your Dr. run the fish-test on your tumor for her2. Anyone let me know what your Drs. are saying about the overexpression of protein test versus the Fish-test???",
