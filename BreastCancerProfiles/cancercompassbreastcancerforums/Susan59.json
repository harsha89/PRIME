      "Content": "I agree.  If you aren't comfortable asking your parents to take you to the doctor, check out Planned Parenthood.  PP does a lot more than help with family planning.  I don't know where you're from, but our PP provides comprehensive health care to women (including young women like you).  You don't need to tell anyone you've gone, if you don't want to, and you will be charged based on your ability to pay.  Please post back and let us know you've made an appointment with a physician somewhere.",

      "Content": "Hi - Lots of things go on in the breast that aren't cancer.  I had a huge lump and it was just fibrous tissue.  The best thing you can do for yourself is don't assume anything.  Tell your parent(s), get to a doctor and find out what's going on.  If it is cancer, the sooner you take care of it the better off you'll be.  Good luck, sweetie.",
