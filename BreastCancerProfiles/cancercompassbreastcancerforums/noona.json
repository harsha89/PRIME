    "Content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer at the end of September 2008. It was found in some lymphs, lung and the 2nd breast... The tumor was quite large and breaking through the skin, too. And, I was told it was inoperable. I was on weekly doses of taxol and herceptin -and- was on a clinical trial using Tykerb (lapatinib)... #1) I NEVER got sick from the chemo: I did not miss one day from work! #2) In May, no cancer found in any lymphs or lung -and- the tumor was down 50%. So, I had a double mastectomy 3 weeks ago and will be taking radiation later this summer. No more chemo for right now, although I will stay on Herceptin and possible chemo pills forever. OK, I admit that I lost my hair from the chemo (that's why they have wigs covered by insurance and baseball hats!) and occasionally I had some muscle aches. But trust me, I was able to function at 95% of how I normally do! I understand that my side affects were not as bad because they were giving me the same amount of chemo, but in a lower dose once a week vs. the mega dose every three weeks. Whatever, it worked and I did not miss a beat! I did get \"kicked off\" of the clinical trial because of the surgery and we are trying to get my insurance company to agree to pay for it. Anyhow, I intend on living at least another 20-30 years (I am 54)... So, I would say YES, there is hope. Tell your aunt she just needs to dig in and fight! As of last week, my oncologist told me that there was no traceable cancer in my body. She is not going to say cured, nor was she really willing to say remission yet. But, she, the folks with the clinical trial and the surgeons are all extremely encouraged that I am going to be around quite a while longer! Today, they are looking at Stage IV breast cancer as something that can be managed -and- treated as a chronic disease for a long time. But, they need to use every tool in their tool box... Good luck...",
