      "Content": "For 2 years my mother had been feeling very strange in her left breast and she kept telling her gynecologist, he said her mammo was fine and that it was probably her bra type and that she should change the type of bra she was using. My mom kept insisting that was not the issue and kept going back to him, they kept doing tests and things were odd in the tests (blood) but they could not pin point what was wrong.. Here breast had inflammation but her mammao's and sonograms kept coming back normal in every facility. Finally, my mother just walked into a surgeons office and said there is something wrong with me and he sent a letter to her gynecologists to do a biopsy and it turned out she did have cancer, with a tumor so big she needed chemo before it can even be operated on. The diagnosis was on Nov. 2004 She has had a mastectomy and about 25 rounds of 3 different kinds of chemo as well as radiation. (The radiation has damaged her brachial plexus nerve, and it will be damaged forever).  So, Two years later her oncologist tells us that her cancer has spread to her other breast... My mother being the person that she is, didn't let that bring her spirit down she just kept fighing it, she was put  on Tykerb and Xeloda which she had to stop because Xeloda was giving her very bad side effect such as bleeding in the nails, so she started Herceptin. This summer however, her Dr tells us that he thinks everything is going really good and will give her a 1 month break before her PEt scan.. When we get the results the worst news.. The cancer has spread everwhere.. Bones, Liver, Lungs etc.. Only good news it's not inher hormones.. She is currently in the hospital, she was in an induced coma for a week because her lungs keep catching fluids now and after a surgery they did to put a tube to help prevent that from happening her lungs were not responding they decided to put her in a coma, she is still in the hospital. And they have taken her off her chemo They had her on Tykerb alone and Herceptin... I did a lot of research and found many alternatives and said this is the best time to give them to her now that she is off of her chemo, even though the ones that I chose were safe to give when she was on chemo either way ( Just in case) I will not say what they are yet until I see some improvement because I don't want to get anyones hopes up, But i will keep you updated and If i do see results I PROMISE I will let everyone know EXACTLY what I did.   Just remember Stay positive, my mother has been through a lot but is very strong MENTALLY because if you are not strong mentally no matter what you do... it will NOT work.. at least that is what I believe  ",

      "Content": "So my mother has just came home from the hospital today.. And she is starting to do better little by little... She is detoxing and i must say that when she first started to detox she was having the \"detox\" symptoms tiredness fatigue light headedness but now she is better( once again as i stated above i prefer not to say what i am using until we see positive effects) The detox she is on also helps balance her ph and she now will also be on oxygen when needed so that is an environment that cancerous cells DO NOT LIKE.. The other products will be here by the end of the week.... The doctors gave her a 2 week chemo break so her body can become stronger, hopefully she will be feeling so good and we can convince the doctors to test her out to see if the cancer has gotten any worse or perhaps any better ( i know 2 weeks may be waayy to short to get any better but if it hasnt gotten any worse than that alone can be a sign that it may be working) We will see...",

I believe in god and am very spiritual but am not very religious.. any way.. The other day I heard someone say (and I honestly don't know why I paid attention) \"stop saying let it be god's will or what ever god or jesus may want, God wants you to call out and beg and pray every single day, not to say it will be god's will.\" We have to be strong and believe that miracles do happen and prayers are really heard, just last year I knew someone whos child, 11 years old was diagnosed with brain cancer, he had a tumor that the doctors said was inoperable, gave him between 1-3 months to live.. Two weeks later they were at the doctors office to do a CT-scan and some blood work to see if it was even worth giving him chemo and them little boy told his mom that his brain had been \"tickling\" him the whole day... When the Ct-results came back no tumor, no cancer. One year later We still see the little boy who is cancer free.. The doctors say they have no explanation for what happened. His mother told the doctor she would wake up every moring at 3am to pray for her son until 6am. Just be strong.. Stay positive, and you are right eventually we will all be together again  ",

      "Content": " My mother sees 5 different oncologists and we asked 3 out of the 5 why her cancer was continuously missed in her mammograms and all 3 that we asked gave us basically the same response.. \"  mammograms miss many breast cancers\" One said \" A mammogram may miss the location of the cancer, therfore it is not 100 percent effective\"  Also, when we went to see a neurologist because of the nerve damage due to the extensive amount of radiation that she had to undergo, he was shocked to find out that my mom had breast cancer, because she was previously a patient of his.. ( My mother had went to him with symptoms of numbing, but that was actually from her cancer which kept being missed on her mammo's and how extensive it already was) anyways.. He then made a comment: I wish gynecologists would just do biopsies when patients present very bad symptoms because mammograms miss so much. Moral: Yes they are effective, probably about 70%, which is considerably a big number, but when you are talking about cancer 30% is also a big number.. When the biopsy that was done finally resulted that my mother did have cancer her tumor was so big that they couldn't even operate it until they shrunk it with chemo first, and a mammogram was missing that?! Wait two mammograms were missing that, from different facilities.   On 2/11/2008 xraynu wrote: Okay, I'm sorry, but I can not stand it anymore!  As a registered Mammo tech, I will tell you that it is NOT four pictures of each breast-- it is TWO. Four pics TOTAL!  As for the pain, well. it is different for everyone and the exposure takes mere seconds though it feels like an eternity.  This whole thing of the amount of radiation you receive is why you wait 12 months.  Most insurance companies will not pay if you try to go ONE day before 365 days.(Unless you need follow up work).  Radiologic technology has evolved tremendously since 1928 so I would not hesitate to get a test done especially if it shows calcifications that a ultrasound or MRI will not show.  Thermography can't localize it.  And just know that if you go spend a day at the beach-- forget about the amount of rads you get from a mammogram!  If I should ever have the pleasure of performing your test-- please don't ask about any new test because until the FDA approves it-- it ain't gonna happen!  ",

      "Content": "I am very sorry to hear about your sister.. My mother also has stage IV Breast Cancer and the doctors told us that is basically everywhere in her body.. Bones, lungs, pancreas, etc.. They told us her prognosis was not very good and all we can do at this point is pray that the ONLY good news was that it was not in her hormones or her brain... So they put her on Herceptin every 3 wks and Tykerb (without Xeloda because it had previously given her bad side effects)4 tabs. every day.. Anyway.. Her lungs kept filling up with fluids so they had to do surgery on her so insert a tube so they wont fill up anymore but it didn't go as expected.. the doctor said \"her lungs are not responding the way they should\" and she was put in an induced coma for a week. It was the hardest thing seeing my mother in such a state, They just took her off the coma 3 days ago and she is doing better. I am now however looking for alternative medicine to give her because i have NEVER been a fan of western medicine and have done a lot of research and found something that I am def. going to give a try and that is safe to give with chemo although to my understanding Herceptin is not categorized as chemo, it is just another type of cancer therapy.. Anyways I also found many testimonials on this website for the alternative that I am going to start giving my mother.  My mother has been fighting breast cancer for a little over 4 years now and I can honestly say that I have never seen anyone fight for their life as hard as I see her do it day by day, breath by breath.. So I urge you to keep your sisters spirit positive because I really believe that it has something to do with it..   Goodluck and bless you and your family",
