    "Content": "My mother has metastatic breast cancer that is now in her bone marrow and a small amount in her stomach lining. Last March the dr. gave her 2 weeks to 6 months to live. Obviously, the dr. was wrong. Anyway, my mother had radiation and 3 chemo treatments and couldn't tolerate it. She was too sick and weak. We turned to another source, coral calcium. There is a method for cancer patients where the patient takes certain supplements for 30 days then the cancer will be benign after that period. Many patients have tried it and had success with it. They can recommend several good natural supplements that fight cancer and have no side effects. The one that we are so impressed with is called MGN3. It kills cancer cells. Don't despair, there are many options now available for cancer patients. May the Lord bless you and bring healing.",
