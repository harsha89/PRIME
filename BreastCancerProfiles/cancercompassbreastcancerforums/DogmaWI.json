      "Content": "As a 3 year in remission survivor of Inflammatory Breast Cancer, stage 3C, I had chemotherapy- 2 rounds, single-side mastectomy with Lymph node dissection- 23 removed- and radiation therapy in 2012-2013, I feel that I would be remiss in not saying that chemotherapy quite possibly saved my life. I had a complete response to it, and my surgeon said the pathology report after surgery showed no signs of cancer.  My gut feeling is that if you would have been given chemo to start with, you wouldn't be in your current situation.  If I were to be diagnosed with cancer again, I wouldn't go against the Oncologist's recommendations.  I would do it all over again to have more time with my family.",

I felt another lump in my left breast(same side as lump under arm). My dr sent my to my annual mammo and MRI, I also get an ultrasound with my history of dense breast tissue and cancer history in my family.

I would agree that you have cause for concern and deserve a proper diagnosis and treatment.  You have to be your own advocate and make sure that your feelings aren't ignored by the medical professionals. With your family history of cancer, your unexplained weight loss and a general feeling of not being healthy, point to something seriously wrong.  It is possible that you are overtired and exhausted from being a full-time caregiver for your disabled husband and are not taking good care of yourself.  If the lump has grown in size, multiplied and is painful, you should have an ultrasound and a biopsy to rule out breast cancer.  ",

Thanks, I elected not to have reconstructive surgery after my single sided mastectomy, so I cannot speak to that, but I did want to thank you for letting us know that those expanders have metal in them.  I am sorry for what you are going through and feel that the anger you are holding on to is justified, but you should let it go.  People make mistakes, even doctors.  No one likes it brought to their attention that their mistake has caused harm to others and I'm sure the doctor does feel bad about it, but in today's society of lawsuits, she cannot verbally express responsibility for fear that you would sue her if she did accept blame.  I am not trying to diminish your experience in any way, but you are hurting yourself by holding on to the anger.  Let it go.  Feel better.  ",

Also, it doesn't show up on mammograms and does not present with a typical lump, so it can be misdiagnosed. If you feel that there is something wrong, don't ignore that feeling.

My doctor sent me for a mammogram, which was clear. I then had an ultrasound and the doctor said that my lymph glands in my underarm were swollen, so she did a needle biopsy. I then spoke with the surgeon/consultant. She said that there is definitely 'something there' even though there is no lump. I asked if that ruled out cancer and she said not necessarily and to wait for the biopsy results next week. However, I have a gut feeling that there is something wrong. Does anyone know what it might be? Not to alarm you, but that sounds like Inflamatory Breast Cancer.  I was diagnosed in June of 2012.  It started as an itchy breast then progressed to a feeling of heaviness and warmth.  When my breast rubbed against my arm, I could feel a sense of heat and heaviness in my breast.  The skin looked different, kind of like the pores were larger.  It didn't progress to looking like \"orange-peel-looking skin\", but was well on its way.  It was stage 3-C and treated with two rounds of chemotherapy, single sided mastectomy, and radiation.  I am three years free of cancer, in remission.  I remember when I was feeling like you are now.  My lymph nodes were swollen and 23 of them had to be removed.  When will you get the results of your biopsy?  I got mine immediately.  So maybe since there's no sense of urgency on their part, it will not be IBC.  Trust your gut instinct.  You are probably right.  ",

      "Content": "I have stage 3c Inflamatory Breast Cancer. It is HER 2 positive, progesterone negative and weakly estrogen positive ( 10%) . I had a complete response to chemo. , which is rare, and my surgeon said that means I am one of the lucky ones. I had a modified radical mastectomy and auxiliary node dissection with 23 lymph nodes removed. I completed radiation two weeks ago, and am healing from the burns. I get Herceptin every three weeks until Aug. 22, 2013. I have done a lot of research and know that there is a substantial probability of cancer mets. To the bone, brain, or liver. None of my doctors have been so bluntly insensitive as yours seems to have been, telling you that your chances are high for the possibility of it spreading to your brain. To me, that kind of statement is very damaging to your sense of security. My situation isn't that different from yours, and I remain optimistic that my cancer will not recur. If you lose hope, then you've lost half the battle. I'm not suggesting that we ignore the statistics and pretend that we are cured, but we also don't need to have our hopes dashed by our physicians, whom we look to for advice and guidance. Frankly, it really pisses me off to hear that your doctor told you that. Even if it is true, it is not something you needed to hear. It is just as likely that if you remain positive, you will not have a recurrence. No one can predict the future, and to take away your hope is mean and cruel. Don't let anyone take that away from you!",
