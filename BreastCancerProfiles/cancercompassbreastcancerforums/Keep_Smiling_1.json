      "Content": "My mother had breast cancer 10 years ago.  I am not sure what they determined the \"stage\" to be but, I do know that the tumor was the size of  her surgeons 's fist and it was aggressive.  Her lymph nodes were affected as well.  I believe out of 10 , the top 7 were infected. My mom had a mastectomy, 6 months of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation.  it was a tough year and not all of her doctors sounded optimistic.  We knew very little about cancer then and so we learned as we went. Her surgeon was always a good support through her ordeal and explained that she is a reason why it is so hard to predict outcomes of cancer patients. She was cancer free still at her 9 year check up!  Don't give up, there are good outcomes!      ",

In remission for almost 5 years before returning.  It started as Breast cancer, now spreading to the liver, spine, abdomen, and brain.  2 mos. ago, her dr. has told her she has probably 3-5 mos. to live.  My question is, does it happen  fast?  I mean I've seen people who have cancer suffer for weeks or months and then die.  To look at my sister, you would never know she has cancer,  she still has her hair with this treatment (I believe is Doxil) and she looks great.  She has most of her pain in her abdomen and spine but is on alot of painkillers.  The biggest disappointment is her memory,  it is horrible, from one minute to the next she can't remember and gets very discouraged. We're not sure if its from the cancer or the drugs.  So, this is tough to ask but am I holding out hope for nothing, seeing she looks so good and performs her daily tasks pretty well, napping often. Is it possible to only have such a short time to live? I guess I should also say, when she was first diagnosed about 7 years ago with Breast cancer, the drs. told her flat out to get her things in order that she had a very aggressive form of cancer.  She was living on the East coast at the time, so we back on the West coast were not able to speak with her drs. personally.  She had a mastectomy, chemo, and recovered amazingly.  She has a tremendous amount of faith and relies on God thoroughly.  To all of us, it was a miracle, so we are praying and hoping for another miracle.    I would love to hear any similar cases, and honesty. Thank you much and God Bless,    Caring Sister The last part of your message is what caught my eye and \"heart\".  My mother was diagnosed in 1997 (at the age of 43) with Breast Cancer.  She was told to have things in order too as her cancer was an aggressive one.  She had a mastectomy, 6 months of chemo and then 6 weeks of radiation.  She surprised everyone especially the doctors with her recovery.  I think her surgeon may have used the word \"miracle\". It was 10 years later when she was 53 that something unexpected happened.  This time Stomach Cancer...  She had been going to see her family doctor for months but, was diagnosed too late.  The strange thing was that is was a \"Primary\" Cancer not related to her previous battle 10 years earlier.  Time seemed to move so slowly for us but, yet when you are given about 3 months, it is still way too fast. My mother unlike your sister was very weak and wore down (physically and emotionally).  She could not eat which made things worse for her, I suppose.  We had hoped for some semi quality time to share a few more memories but, were not quite so lucky.  My mother passed away 2 months after the surgeon stated 3 months. I can only speak from my own experience but, your experience does seem different.  Hopefully, your sister is going to prove the doctors wrong again but if they are right, it appears that you have some good moments left with eachother.  Cherish them. My thoughts and prayers are with you both.   ",

      "Content": "Hello Toxic Rainbow. Well, I have to say my mother and I suspected that the cause of her stomach cancer was possibly the chemo and radiation she endured almost 11 years ago now.  Its not something I talk about to other people as i don't want to promote the wrong message to people and their families.  I believe you have to do whatever you can to beat this disease.  My mom and I did get 10 good years from her first battle she survived.  I am sure there have been many advances in this treatment in ten years too. Her stomach cancer tumor was located in the upper portion of her stomach.  She had 6 weeks of radiation right close to that spot for her breast cancer 10 years earlier?  We talked with a doctor that works in a palletive care unit and this doctor said from their experience if a new primary cancer is going to develop in a cancer survivor, it usually happens closer to 20 years after not 10 but, they believe that it happens more than we hear about. I will be honest that when my mom was feeling ill before she was diagnosed with the stomach cancer I was concerned it was cancer again.  Her family doctor did not seem to say anything about it and really showed no concern of that fact.  Well, I should say he still did have a barium swallow preformed on my mom and bloodwork and these two tests showed nothing of concern.  This is why he felt confident my mom just had an ulcer or something.  It wasn't until she insisted on the endoscopy of which she had to wait weeks to have done that her tumor was found. My mother did go for yearly mammograms and visited with her surgeon who preformed her mastectomy every year as well.  She was \"clean\" each year.   I have talked with my own physician about the possibility of my mom's stomach cancer being caused by the treatment of her breast cancer.  I told her my concern is that my mom's case won't be documented to reflect her situation.  I want her outcome to be noted so that she can help further the current medicines available to patients battling cancer now and in the future.  My doctor said when I am ready to deal with this emotionally, that she would help find the information I need.  She can help me find out what exact medicines my mom received 11 years ago and the dosages.  We can then compare them from what a similar patient today takes for treatment. My mom's breast cancer did involve her lymph nodes.  7 out of the ten removed were infected.  The surgeon's hope was that the cancer had just started to spread and they caught it in time but, to be sure she had to have a mastectomy and then an aggressive treatment plan.  I do not know at this time the names of any of the drugs she took.  I do know she did a study for tamoxifen.  I believe the study was for \"pre menopausal\" woman to take it and see if it had any advantages.  I can't remember now if she in fact found out if she was taking the actual tamoxifen or not?  I seem to think not?  Again, I need to further investigate this all. You know, my mom did say she would have endured her first cancer treatment again to get the 10 great years she did have.  I just want to learn from her experience. Thanks for offering your insite. My prayers are with all that have to fight this disease. Sincerely K S ",

I am 73 years young, living with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) and on oxygen 24/7.   Seven years ago I had a double mastectomy.  The cancer was only in the right breast but it opted to have both removed.  All the lymph nodes under the right arm were removed and all free of cancer.   Fortunately I did not suffer with lymphedema of that arm but do have a problem under the arm in the area of the surgery.   It is tender all the time to the extent that seams in clothing irritate me.   Also when I try to exervise that arm it feels as if something is pulling when I extend the arm up.    I have checked and despite the fact that it feels \"raw\", there is not a mark to be seen.     I also have arthritis in both shoulders and between the arthritis and this \"whatever\" under the right arm, I am not able to do much.     I am interested in finding out if anyone else has had this problem. I  appreciate any help that might be offered.   Thank you so much and everyone have a blessed day :-). Joan Hi Joan  I am not sure I am the the most experienced person to be responding to your concern.  I have never experienced this for myself but, my mother who had a mastectomy 10 years ago also had her lymph nodes removed.  I remember her speaking of the \"numb sensation\" she felt in the location under her arm area.  It never went away I don't think. If nothing else, I hope I at least let you know that your symptom does exist with another survivor. Take care my friend.  ",
