My husband, Jim, was diagnosed with Stage 4 Esophageal Cancer on July 5 and the oncologist didn't give him any hope of recovery. I started reading and am convinced that the Macrobiotic diet is the answer. We have started on it and Jim is feeling much better. Although tests show the tumor has not shrunk, it also has not spread. The dr. was very surprised that it hadn't spread in the last 2 months. It is a very aggressive form of cancer. I feel quite sure that it is the change in diet from the Macrobiotic diet. Just take some time and read about it. It makes sense. I have been staying up late every night reading all I can on nutrition and lifestyle changes for curing cancer and I really feel that this diet can help. I suggest reading the book \"When Hope Never Dies\" by Marlene McKenna who was almost dead when she started the diet and was totally cured of her \"incurable\" cancer in 5 months. I personally know 2 people who were cured of their stage 4 cancer with this diet. Just do some reading and make up your own mind. Your life is worth a change in diet. Judy T. Holland, MI p.s. Stay away from sugar as it feeds tumors. Hello, I was moved by your article. I pray all is well. I'm 39 and was diagnosed at age 29. I was cancer free for 8 years and then in 2006 off and on back and forth with this mess. I took the first day of Xeloda today. I really wanted to just jump into the Macobiotic diet. Hemmed and Hawwed too long, now wondering if I could do both. I DO BELIEVE WHOLE HEARTEDLY THAT DIET, STRESS AND EXERCISE PLAY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN BOTH RECOVERY AND REOCCURENCE. I will consult someone in reference to this diet, but since I'm here on the internet now, just thought I would ask you. 1. I read if you stop the macrobiotic diet it makes things worse. 2. Is it true that it is a life long lifestyle change. 3. Let's say I have the regular Thankgsgiving dinner and then go right into the macrodiet again. 4. Will this do harm.  5.Can you eat turkey and fish?  6. Any words of advice.   Thank you sooooo much, Thill",
