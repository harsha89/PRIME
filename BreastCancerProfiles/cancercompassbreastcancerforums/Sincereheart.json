    "Content": "Gee: It is 3 years late, I wish I had an opportunity to reply and read others replies. I developed a rare blood disorder from Aromasin, I was on it for three years at 25g, and during that time developed Neuropenia, and Lymphapemia, and was hospitalized with almost no T cell defense. My CD3 and CD4, and 8 supperessor were depleaded, and I had a serious infection. There was not other explanation other than the Aromasin. I have had pain in my joint, pain in my hands and feet even till this day. I say, that darn Arthritis cause no one would understand, when I yelp, ouch. My finger pain, even when I am not in uses. My feet pain, and get pins and needles in both. I was walking three miles two years ago, as I did for years. All of a sudden, I had terrible pain in my toes, not all of them, and I could not even walk back to my car. My whole body every joint hurt. I still have this, some days better than others, but brother, when it is bad, I sit for even 3 minute and then try to get up, it is like super pain every where. I hate stopping until , I am ready to go to bed, there I can spread out, and yes the pain is till there, but getting up is not as painful. I am not sure why. My blood levels are some better, but I am still compromised and getting infections. Twice in the last three months I was in the hospital, and I also ended up with a Pancreatic growth rare, when I was being treated with Aromasin for breast. I hope someone day this pain and the night sweats will go away, it is 3 years since I stopped taking Aromasin. Anyone know, how long or if ever, I guess we have to count our blessings, I had a double pancreatectomy in March of 2007 and that was only because in the first surgery the MRI broke down, and they guessed the margin, and missed, and had to go back in a second time. I know, how fortunate I am to be here writing about it. It is rare they ever see a growth, that is rare in early stages, and this growth is not treatable. There is not chemo, Dana Fiber is seeing more of them, but still not treatment. Sincereheart.",
