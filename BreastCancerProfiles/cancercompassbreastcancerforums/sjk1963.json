      "Content": "There are logical reasons why there are re-occurances with any cancer, the answer may surprize some of you but it will make sense to those who understand the way the body works. You must make the body healthy first. The treatments don't do that. They remove the symptom that's all folks. Take the algae out of the pool water, BUT don't change the environment in the water and what happens...... it comes back because you never  corrected the condition...... comments anyone.",

I am 54, working fulltime, in school, 2 quarters away from completing a degree as a Nurse Practitioner and my plate is already way too full.  To have this... just not good.  I will push forward... I have no choice.  My mother died from colon and lung cancer 21 days after diagnosis... I will not let that happen to me! Don't do something you don't know enough about. I have good info. for you.

Dr's are smart and well trained from the best medical Universities and take an oath to do the patient no harm right?Then how come every person that I have met that was diagnosed with C was never told by these professionals about how important nutrition is for the body. There are only two plausible answers: 1. They don't know, which is pathetic. And  2. They don't care? Which is inexcusable. I'm not referring to a nutritionist. I'm talking about our oncologist who was ready to give my wife chemo without question but had NO clue about nutrition. Once again, follow the money folks.",
