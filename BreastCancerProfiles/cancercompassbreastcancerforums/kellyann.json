      "Content": "Hi Everyone! I have just found out I have Inflammatory breast cancer. I am really scared because I have read that it is the worst of all breast cancers to get because it is so aggressive. I am to get a port put in my chest 3-24 so I can begin chemo. I see my cancer specialist on 3-23. So far I have only had the mammograms,sonograms, and biopsy done. the biopsy came back malignant and the doctor told me I have IBC. I knew it anyway from my symtoms, but it sure hit me like a ton of bricks anyway when the doctor told me and it made it \"REAL\" if you can imagine. Anyway, I am very worried how I'm going to do on chemo. I have chronic lyme disease already and have FMS also, I know, lucky me, haha! I would really welcome any advise you can offer me! Your friend, Kellyann",
