      "Content": "My wife has just been diagnosed with third level DCIS,Estrogen positive. Met with surgeon who will not do a lumpectomy without follow up radiation. Other suvivors of worse cancers are adamantly against radiation, saying that it is like using an Atom bomb to kill a mouse. The surgeon pratically gurantees that unless we have follow up radiaion, that the cancer will come back. We are lean towards lumpectomy without the radiation and attempting to cure through nutrition. I'd like to hear from others who have opted not to have radiation after a lumpectomy.",

      "Content": "Hi Kevin, We have a few friends who chose to forego the radiation and treat themselves through nutrition. They have all been cancer free for about 6-15 years. At this time my wife will definitely be having the lumpectomy and it is 50/50 chance that she will have the radiation. However, we engaged treatment by a well respected holistic naturaopathic doctor who already has us on a strict diet. We also have another well reccommended naturopathic doctor we are seeing today (Memorial Day). Fortunately, both of these doctors came well reccommended and are here in our hometown of Phoenix, AZ. Good luck to you. We'll try to keep our posts of to date on our developments. Gary",

      "Content": "Thank you. Normally, I am leaning towards her getting the radiation, but we have two very credible friends who had cancers much more advanced than my wife's (one had spread to her lungs). They both started conventional treatment only to get fed up with it, and walk out. They turned to nutritional treatment and have both been clear for more than 16 years. Take care and thanks again.",
