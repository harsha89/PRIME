My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily Dear Emily, what your friend needs most right now, is a friend who has a very positive outlook and believes that she will survive.Oh and I almost forgot, help her find something to be happy or laugh about daily. I am reading a book about spontaeous remissions right now (it's called Radical Remissions by Kelly A. Turner and you can find it on Amazon) and since I am pretty much in the same boat as your friend, I have chosen to pick the survival mode it descibes. I don't think either your friend or I can expect much help from medicine at this point. whishing you a calm day",

I bet it costs a lot too. Well, I have never been called venerable before :-) , I wonder if you meant vulnerable ? As for the SPDT being quachery, you might want to do a little more research on it before passing judgement. It is used in a number of main stream Hospitals all over Europe. Not everything that is not approved in the US yet is inherently useless. JMHO Hilde",

It was already stage IV so I declined further treatment and desided to have some fun with the time I have left. I am now 2 years down the road and have mulitple metastases in my vertebrae, so will change to a different approach. Have tried the keetogenic diet for the last year and that seemed to have no effect on slowing it down. So Now I am trying a modified Gerson diet with lots of juicing. Mostly, I just enjoy life and am greatful for each morning when I wake up. wishing you a  shiny new Moring hilde in florida",

I have to add a covet here though, it might just be that I was a bit to scinny to start with. This diet causes some fairly rapid weight loss and I finally had to stop after I had lost 20 pounds I could ill afford to loose. The tumors where doing just fine, I was not doing so hot :-) hilde",
