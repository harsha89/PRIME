      "Content": "My daughter is 33 and asked her GYN about a mammogram and she said no you are too young. I never had any lumps. I had DCICS stage 0 and had a bilateral mastecomy in Jan 09. We tried the lumpectomy, but too many cancer cells in the ducts.  I had calcifications for years and was told by the hospital that was all it was and to and come back in 6 months for another mammogram. They told me my insurance would not pay for an ultrasound, even though I had a script for it. It turned out those calcifications were in fact cancer for me. So yes please switch doctor's and get another opinion. I also had thyroid cancer 10 years before my breast cancer diagnosis. I had my thyroid removed and also the radioactive iodine treatment.  ",

I was very surprised I had breast cancer as I had NO symptoms except some \"calcifacation\"(sp) on my mamogram.    I had my yearly mammogram 6/5/08 and a digital mammogram 6/25/08. I was told that there was an increase of microcalcifications in subareolar & periareolar aspects of the right breast. They appear to be predominantly secretory & benign. Other calcifications are vascular. Six month follow up is suggested. I had a biopsie done 11/05/08 and it was DCIS stage 0cancer. I chose a lumpectomy 11/20/08. The results came back there was too much cancer that spread into the ducts.  I had a bilaterial mastectomy done 1/29/09. I have had fluid issues since the day the drains 1st came out, I never drained after that. I had fluid removed by the surgeon every week for a month. I then had ultra sound guided fluid removal 3/25/09. The fluid came back. The surgeon took off the exess skin 4/30 she put in drains then also. But the fluid came back after the drains came out and I started with an infection. I had another ultrasound guilded fluid removal 6/19/09. The fluid build up and issues seem to be in the left breast that did not have any cancer.  I am so glad I did not listen to the hospital that did my mammogram. They have done my yearly mammograms since before 2005. I did not have reconstruction surgery done with the implants.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed 11/08 with stage 0, DCIS cancer in the right breast. I had  a lumpectomy done 11/08, there was too much cancer but it did not spread out of the ducts. I was not able to have radiation as planned.  My ER was 90% positive and PR was 10% borderline. I had a bilaterial mastecomy 1/29/09. I was told that I would not need any other treatments. I did not need radiation or chemo. I was told then that I was free from cancer and did not have to worry. I cannot help but think could it come back. I have alot of extra skin left as I had a breast surgeon do my surgery and did not use a plastic surgeon. It is ugly what I am left with and I am thinking of having some type of reconstructive surgery or removal of the extra skin. I did not have implants put in at the time of surgery as I feared infection.",
