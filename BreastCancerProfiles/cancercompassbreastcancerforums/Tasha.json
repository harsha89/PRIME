    "Content": "Hello Becky: I was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. After surgery in March I went on a double blind study of taxol, carbo, and avastin last May. Finished 1st 6 treatments and now I have had 4 treatments of Avastin. I know I am getting avastin because of the side effects. Had another cat scan last friday. I would love to talk to anyone about the side effects. I almost quite the study at least 3 times, but was convinced to stay on because of the great results they are having with the drug. Three months ago I was clear and my ca 125 was 3.5. Three weeks ago it has risen to 6.4. I have to go on BP meds now and am taking sucralfate for my intestinal track.",
