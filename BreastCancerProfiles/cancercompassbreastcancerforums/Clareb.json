    "Content": "Hi, I'm a practising homeopath in the UK. I am currently using the Banerji protocol for a patient with a brain tumour and am trying to find detailed information about the use of this method for breast cancer. I found the results of lab tests using Carcinosin and Phytolacca in the International Journal of Oncology but can't find information about how long and what dosage of these remedies should be taken by patients with breast cancer. Does anyone know? Thanks",
