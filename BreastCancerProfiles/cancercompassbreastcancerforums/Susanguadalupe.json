Other suvivors of worse cancers are adamantly against radiation, saying that it is like using an Atom bomb to kill a mouse. The surgeon pratically gurantees that unless we have follow up radiaion, that the cancer will come back. We are lean towards lumpectomy without the radiation and attempting to cure through nutrition. I'd like to hear from others who have opted not to have radiation after a lumpectomy. i just had a lumpectomy for my .3 cm. tumor on my left breast.  i opted for no radiation therapy because i am poor and i cannot afford it. i am using the following on a daily basis together with an 80% vegetarian diet: 10,000 mg of sodium ascorbate (divided within the day), 1,000 mg milk thistle, DIM (diindolylmethane) 2x daily, 1,000 mg fish oil in the morning, 1,000 mg flaxseed oil at night, calcium and magnesium complex (1,000 mg and 500 mg respectively) and a multivitamins plus minerals without iron. lots of physical activities besides my housework. you may discuss this with a nutritionally oriented oncologist and see what he or she will say.  Goodluck! poor  br ca patient from the philippines, susan                                                              ",

I chose a double mastectomy because my left breast had suspicious areas that needed to be watched.  Anyway, all during my chemo and now 3 years later I have consistently had a high CEA level.  Just last month it came down to 9, but will probably jump up again.  I have just finished with CT/Scan, Bone Scan, and in 2 days will have another PET Scan.  My oncologist is somewhat puzzled.  Everything so far shows no cancer.  I also am diagnosed with R/A, Osteoarthritis,Sjogren's Syndrome and now Discoid Lupus.  I am just wondering if any of these other conditions could affect my CEA level.  My Oncologist hasn't really seemed too interested in these other conditions.  He lives and breathes cancer!  Does anyone know if this is possible?   These listed below conditions can cause elevated CEA level: ?? Gastritis ?? Peptic ulcer disease ?? Diverticulitis ?? Liver diseases ?? Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) ?? Diabetes ?? Any acute or chronic inflammatory state - which in your case could be the Lupus and Rheumatoid arthritis. hi there! perhaps you can visit this websitehttp: //www.webmd.com/cancer/Carcinoembryonic-Antigen-CEA?page=2:    and discuss it further with your oncologist.  wishing you the best.",
