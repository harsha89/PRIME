    "Content": "Hi.  I have inflammatory breast cancer and have taken Herceptin.  I didn't have the side effects.  Hopefully the new drug will work well.  At any rate, I know that the disease sometimes is worse on the family and friends than it is on the person who has it.  A few things I've found out -- I do better when people treat me the same as they ever did.  Act as if I have a cold -- sympathize but don't become maudlin.  I gain my strength from the strength of others. Laughter is a wonderful healer!!  Draw close to God.  If you don't have a personal relationship with Him, seek Him out.  He is there for you.",
