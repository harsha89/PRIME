She had a lumpectomy, radiations and chemo over ten years ago and her annual mammograms have all been negative(she had one two weeks ago). To make a long story short, while we were intimate recently I smelled cancer near her left breast ( my mom had breast cancer, and I will never forget the smell) She is going to get and ultrasound, probably within the month, but other than that is not taking me seriously. I am very upset about this. Am I over-reacting? I care deeply for my partner and don't want to lose her. Does anyone have any input?   My mother had cancer also so I know what you mean.  A person I recently came across may can help you. Natural Spiritual healing and can also tell through pictures.  Her name Katherine --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
