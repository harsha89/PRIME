A smell she will never forget.  When my mother's friend got cancer, Mom said the smell was unbearable!  When I got breast cancer, I don't remember any change in my scent, although, after chemo, I didn't get any underarm odour for 2 and a half years!  Small blessings!  I am very curious to know what it smells like.  Can you describe?  The thought of recurrence is always in the back of my mind, this just might be a weapon against this horrible disease. I get that. After menopause, I had almost non existant underarm odor. About a month before my diagnosis, I started to have it again. I thought it strange, until my Dr. said the 9mm tumor in my right breast has probably been growing there 8 to 10 years! I found it by seeing a dimple on the side of my breast. Could not feel it standing up, had to lie down to feel it. Same with the medical personel. Seems we have lots of clues, yet not able to put the cancer puzzle together yet.",
