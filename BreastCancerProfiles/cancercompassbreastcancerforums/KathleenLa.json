    "Content": "Is Nuerontin the same drug as Gabapentin?  My neurologist prescribed me Gabapentin and your dosage with Nuerontin sounds the same as Gabapentin.  I hesitate to take so much of Gabapentin, like the 300 mgs. 3 times a day.  The drug is prescribed for epileptics??  I also hesitate to take it in the day, but that's when it's needed, because of all the side affects it can cause to the mind.  Does anyone here get side affects from taking the high dosages?
