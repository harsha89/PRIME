I had immediate reconstruction with silicone implants.  I agonized for a year over the deision to have nipple reconstruction.  In the end I opted for a local flap reconstruction (the nipple is made from the skin on the breast mound) and tatoos.  The flap proceedure is very simple, painless and can be done in the doctor's office. There is no risk of them \"falling off\" like in a graft procedure where the tissue comes from the groin area.  One of my nipples did flatten out but my plastic surgeon used some Radiesse (filler) to puff it up  and it looks fine.  My original tatoos done by my plastic surgeon were alright, but later I went to a medical tatoo artist who redid them and they look great.  That said, the tatoo artist can do amazing 3D tatoos that could easily pass for the real thing without any surgery. Another argument for this is that you don't have to worry about wearing a bra with thin clothing because there is no nipple protrusion. For me, getting the nipple reconstruction provided some closure on my breast cancer ordeal.  While no one else may see your breasts, you do and the \"mounds\" just don't look like real breasts without nipples. It's like a face with no eyes! Good luck and be well. bluedevil",
