    "Content": "Hi Kathy, I can appreciate your conundrum. I was diagnosed with invasive lobular cancer on Feb. 27th. I was also tested for the cancer gene and tests came back negative. I wrestled with radiation vs. bilateral mastectomy for weeks and a couple things finally opushed me over the edge.... 1) a double mastectomy lets me avoid radiation, and since the cancer is on the left side, I was told it is a good idea to avoid radiation where the heart is. 2) because my cancer is the more rare lubular version, is had already spread to surrounding tissues and they already know lumpectomy wouldn't get it all. When I questioned this, they said Oh, that's what the radiation is for. Not sure I am comfortable going thru a lumpectomy that will not even remove it all. Plus I am told lubular cancers often return in the other breast. 3) if I did choose breast-saving surgery, I would most likely have to be followed by MRI instead of mammography going forward. Unfortunately, MRI is so sensitive, that there is an increase of false positives, and I would have to prepare myself for more biopsies every time MRI showed something suspicious. When I combined all the info available to me, I had to say goodbye to my ta-tas. I am currently awaiting a surgery date and am in mourning for the breasts that I will soon be losing. I actually still have decent breasts at age 49, great cleavage and I can still get away w/o a bra from time to time. Was the ONE and only thing on my body I was still proud of. (I had to have a complete hysterectomy little over a year ago, and now losing MORE girl-parts??). Bottom line for me, I know I would never feel \"safe\" if I only did lumpectomy. Never forgive myself if cancer returned because I was too vain to lose my breasts. At least this way, if it does return, I know I was pro-active from the very beginning and THAT I can live with. Lots of luck to you!! Cat",
