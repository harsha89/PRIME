    "Content": "I read a thread on here similar to the question I am asking but I have more to add. A little over a year ago I found a lump (rt breast 10 oclock).  A year ago I had a mammogram that showed nothing and the discussion with my obgyn was that she would send me back for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound.  Then she said if it was just a cyst it would show up on the ultrasound and if nothing showed up on the ultrasound she would send me to a surgeon because it would need to be biopsied.  Both showed nothing so I went to see the surgeon.  The surgeon felt the lump and looked at the imaging reports and said he couldn't do a needle biopsy because they couldn't see it on imaging.  He said he could do a biopsy if I insisted but it could give a false negative reading because they would have no idea if they actually went into the lump.  That made sense to me.  My choices were to wait and see if it grows and recheck in a year or he could do surgery and remove it.  We reluctantly agreed we would watch it.  Partly because I feel like even though I am worried, they act like I shouldn't be and kind of \"poo-poo\" it for a lack of better words.  Which then makes me feel silly but that doesn't take the worry away.  It's been a year.  It feels a little bigger or as I told my husband there may be two lumps now.  I went to my obgyn yesterday and I didn't tell her anything and she confirmed she felt two lumps and sent me back for another diagnostic mammo and ultrasound.  When I had the mammogram today the gal told me I could leave and I told her I still had to have my ultrasound and she said they didn't need to do one since they didn't see anything on the mammogram.  Grrr . . . I insisted they do the ultrasound because that is what my doctor ordered.  They weren't thrilled and they certainly didn't take much time doing the ultrasound.  The quickest one I ever had.  So now I don't have the results of ultrasound yet but by her words she is saying nothing showed up again on the mammogram.  I know I will be sent back to the surgeon and he will say the same thing.  That I can wait and see or I can have surgery.  I feel like they keep putting me between a rock and a hard place!  What can be done?  Are there any other tests that can be done and determine if it is fibrous tissue or something else?  Or do I just need to have an expensive surgery for peace of mind.  Any help would be good!  From what I read, cancer and tumors don't always show on mammograms and ultrasound so I can't believe they act like it is not a big deal to have bigger lump and a new one beside it but if it doesn't show it doesn't exist to them.  :/",
