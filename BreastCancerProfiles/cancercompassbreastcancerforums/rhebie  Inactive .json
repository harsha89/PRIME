Adriamycin and cytoxen followed by taxol and herceptin.  Finished taxol May 25, 2010.  Hair started to come in.  July I had breast implant surgery and hair fell out.  Finished herceptin on January 25, 2012 and still no hair.  Has anyone experienced this?  Please help...I'm beside myself. I was diagnosed with  breast cancer in 2009. Maybe my hair won't grow because of the many chemo drugs I took. I had epirubicin,FU5,Cytoxan and Taxatere plus 6 1/2 wks of radiation. And I still look like a plucked chicken LOL.",
