    "Content": "It's been 18 years since my modified radical mastectomy and ten years since my breast reconstruction. I recently had a hysterectomy and could not exercise for 3 months. I began my old cardio and weight routines about 2 weeks ago and since then have been experiencing major pain in the breast area, arm, armpit and shoulder. I had an MRI and the silicone implant is intact. Can anyone suggest therapy and weight training guidelines? I've told my doc but was not offered any advice other than stop the weights.Â ",
