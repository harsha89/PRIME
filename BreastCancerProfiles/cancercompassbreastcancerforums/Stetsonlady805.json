      "Content": "My primary physician and I have been discussing genetic testing. My Mother worked with a nurse that elected to have a double mastectomy and reconstruction due to her having a family history of breast cancer. I believe her mother and an aunt had breast cancer. I mentioned this to my doctor. And that is when I learned about genetic testing. Most believe this approach to be extremely \"radical\". But after seeing what cancer did to my Mother I don't view it as so \"radical\". Thank you for your imput on this Danka.",

      "Content": "I have been told that I have to have an MRI every 6 months. My Mother had breast cancer and I come from an area were a lot of my neighbor's got cancer. I have had a mammogram and ultrasound were they found a lot of tumors. Because of this I had to have an MRI. I thought I was through after my first MRI. But no, after 6 months had passed I was told to see a breast specialist and have another MRI. Now I have been told that I need to see a surgeon in 6 months and have another MRI and discuss what I will do next. Is this really necessary? Having an MRI every 6 months is very expensive. My last 2 MRI's I was told that I did not have cancer. Has anyone heard of this before? And yes, I do realize that early detection is essential to survival.",
