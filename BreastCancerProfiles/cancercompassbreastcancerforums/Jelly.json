      "Content": "Yes it is customary to have a bone scan.  The first one is considered \"baseline\", meaning future ones can be compared to the first. Usually it's done before the surgery, along with chest xray, blood tests and in some cases, CT scans, PET scans and MRI's.  Each doctor is different in his approach and what one's insurance will allow is also a factor. Good luck in your treatment. Jelly   ",

On her whole breast with a very deep and sore wound on this breast.  I'm very concerned for her comfort let alone her next hurtle with radiation.  I guess my Question is this. Has this happened to anyone else?  Her sugeon has said clean and pack this wound daily and she dose it dilegently. It refuses to heal. it has started to drain again.  She also is suppose to have a mamo this month.  Really needing some advice. Really concerned for my younger sister.  Thank you Sue Dear Sue,   My heart goes out to your sister.  This has not happened to me and I can't even imagine how horrible it must be.  If this has been going on since April '06, it is about time another surgeon is seen for a second opinion.  She should not be suffering like this for this long a time.

Dear Linda, (((((Hugs to you)))).  So sorry to hear that this disease has struck you and at such a young age.  When reading the message boards, keep in mind that the women who post are mostly the ones who are experiencing some type of complications.  There are almost 3 million women living with breast cancer.  Those who have completed treatment successfuly and moved on with their lives ususally do not post.  Many women are cured and they certainly don't post.  Just look at Betty Ford and she's not the only one.  Unfortunately, there is not a database of survivors' that one can look up for comfort. You are not alone in your thoughts, though.  Most of us have been where you are. Blessings to you, Jelly  ",

I am having another one of those down days.  I just had my 3rd treatmet of AC today and the doctor has now advised that I continue treatment with 4 treatments of Taxol following.  I thought I was almost done (1 treatment left after today) and the rug was pulled out from under me (\"Guess Again\").  She say's that it is purly preventative based on the fact that I am handling the AC so well and that I am so young that I should do all I can to increase my odds. Instead of 2 weeks left I now have at least 11 weeks.  I know for many that's not much, but for me it was a major step backward.  Take Care and Bless You, 2Young Dear Linda,  Having \"down days\" is par for the course with this disease.  I hope you have a good support system (husband, family, friends) to help you cope.  You can always email me at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.  Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html ---- if you wish. As far as more treatment, I'm sure hearing that is a bit depressing but the doctor is probably right.  You always have the option to get a second opinion. My BC was diagnosed almost five years ago and I'm still here!  You'll be here too. All the best to you, Jelly",

My surgeon told me that medically they were all equal. My problem is that I am dreading the idea of daily radiation for six weeks. It would mean travelling two hours to the nearest participating hospital after work every evening. I have a fairly new job that I love, but it requires a lot of planning time outisde the office. I don't know if I can stretch myself that far (not to mention the fatigue associated with radiation). On the other hand, I'm not wild about the idea of getting a mastectomy either. Additionally, I'm a very active person and recovery time is a major factor for me. Can anyone offer me any advice that might help me decide what is best for me? Dear Tina,   Sorry to hear you joined \"the club\".  No one but you can make your decision.  Take your time and think everything out clearly.  It would behoove you to get a second opinion from another surgeon.  Perhaps that would add clarity to your situation.   I've have both...first lumpectomy, then much later mastectomy (however, I never consented to radiation).  We're all different as well as our life circumstances.
