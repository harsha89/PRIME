    "Content": "Hi trees999, My husband had the same problem so we went to an infectous disease doctor. We went on Cipro for a while and compression stockings every day. We found the #40Â  stockings on line that didn't need a prescription (we have a prescription though) for half the price of the medical supply houses. . Every once in a blue moon his left leg swells a little primarily because he forgets the stocking!!!",
