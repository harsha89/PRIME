    "Content": "Cannabinoids such as CBD and THC are just two ingredients in cannabis that cause apoptosis (death from within the cancer cells).  The NIH has funded Israel since 1963 and still does fund Dr Mechoulam and his research has been used by the same NIH that holds the patents in the USA for how to select the proper plants for the proper cannabinoids for various ilnnesses.  While the USA has the research, the plants, and patents on how to make it and they do indeed manufacture pure extracts of the various cannabinoids..yet they remain federally illegal to get even for clinical trials.  Many states  disregard the fedral laws and offer medical marijuana and we can actually buy cannabidiol legally anywhere in the USA, but it is the extracts of cannabinoids that remain next to impossible to have access for us.  Something needs be done and I do not know what it will take for the government to change its position on cannabis of having no medicinal benefits when they KNOW it does and have known at least since the 1970's.  For example...  thcV is known to suppress appetite and offers great assistance / hope for curing diabetes!  CBD has known anti-cancer therapeutic cures yet again is being kept a secret from the citizens that suffer.",
