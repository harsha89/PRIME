      "Content": "I was diagnosed with mets to the bones, stage 4 almost 2 years ago and was told I had appx.2 months left. I did a combination of the medical approach and the alternative and I believe that it was mostly the alternatives that have kept me doing so well! I recommend getting Sherry Rogers book, \"Detoxify or Die\" which gives good info on the necessity of detoxifying our body and building the immune system. You have to figure that if we have cancer, our immune system is down.......and we have a lot of toxins that need to go! I do daily coffee enemas, use a Rife machine, molecular enhancer (both are really helpful in treating the body), use my Infrared Sauna several times a week, take supplements to build the immune system and see a friend/practitioner once a week for a 3 hour session with a QXCI. I am amazed at how well I'm doing. The natural methods have no side effects....the only problems I've had have been from the medical drugs. And at this point, I'm not sure if they're helping...so I'm going to a kinesiologist for muscle testing to determine exactly where I am and what I need. I hope this helps. Tell your mom there's a way through this.",

      "Content": "There is hope. I believe the body has the power to heal if we can provide what it needs in the way of feeding it what it needs to heal through diet, supplements and detoxing. The QXCI is an amazing machine that detects what is happening in the body and then has programs that can help balance what is needed. If you use Google you'll find some good info on it and people who are in your area who could be contacted. The Molecular Enhancer and Rife Machines are also machines that have good explanations if you search on Google. I can't begin to tell you how significant these all have been in my healing and continual progress. I'm not familiar with the supplements you mentioned but there are so many good ones that help immensely. Some of the things I take that have been really beneficial are MGN3, (immune builder and takes cancer markers down), Inositol, selenium, HTP3, Flaxseed Oil, Fish oil, B Complex Vitamins, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Magnesium, Shark Capsules, Graviola (very important), Antioxidants,Cell Salts/bioplasma by Hyland....As you can see, I've been taking and doing a lot.....but it's saved my life. We have such incredible power to heal..and we need to know that regardless of what the doctors say...the power to heal is within when we decide to empower ourselves. Thinking like a victim is poison. We need to know that we do have the power to heal and do whatever research is necessary to move forward with confidence. If I can do this......I know it's possible for anyone. Blessings........",
