I was diagnosed in Oct 2006 with stage 2 breast cancer and am HER-2  positive. I had a lumpectomy, mammosite radiation and chemotherapy through April 2007. I am still receiving Herceptin (until April 2008) to block the reproduction of cancer cells. My oncologist put me on Arimidex and said I MAY experience bone and joint pain. Definitely experience the hot flashes(again). As of Sept 13, he had me discontinue it and am now starting on Aromasin. I was to the point that I couldn't stand, sit or walk without severe pain. A car ride is sheer torture. From all that I have read, including messages here, I will be no better off with Aromasin. I was also diagnosed with multi-focal degenerative osteoarthritis before cancer treatment process. Not uncommon for my age (60 in June), but I was already having so much pain and trouble. It is in my shoulders, lower back, hands, knees, ankles and both feet. Before, I was able to control the pain with anti-inflammatories. Now, nothing helps the pain. I cannot take heavy drugs. My OC said that if Aromasin produced same pain level, we would switch to Tamoxifen. However, I am afraid to take that suggestion. The side effects are more scarey for me. I looked it up and found this info: Side effects of tamoxifen include: blood clots (thrombosis) (I have had bouts of phlybitous(sp)) endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) abnormal growth of uterine tissue (endometriosis) stroke fertility issues hair and nail thinning  I am not telling you this to frighten you, but you might want to look up the information yourself and speak to your doctor. I guess my biggest fear is developing another type of cancer trying to abate the first one. I have almost become a recluse because I cannot function from the pain and the lethargy. I have gained considerable weight from inactivity, which only adds to the pain of the arthritis. I have tried exercise, but become immobile with back and neck pain. Cleaning my house takes forever as I cannot even vacuum a full room at one time. On the other hand, I thank God for every day that I see the sun come up even if I seem to waste that day doing nothing. I wish all of  you on this message board Good Health and Good Luck. Just want to get to that 5 year mark. Ruth",

      "Content": "Hi,Gayle58, I just discovered this site while looking up info on Aromasin and Arimidex. I am being switched to Aromasin as Arimidex was too painful. I wish you all the luck with your treatments. But off the cancer subject, I noticed that you said your employer told you not to come back to work until you could work mandatory overtime??? Are you aware that it is against Federal law to discriminate against employees with disabilities? And cancer treatment is a disability. The law mandates that your employer make accomodations for you until your disability is no longer a problem, If you can manage your regular 8 hours, they cannot tell you you can't work unless you can endure longer hours. You might want to google Federal Employment Laws. I know you do not want to jeopardize your job, but you are protected from this sort of discrimination. I am guessing they sent you home under FMLA? What happens if you can't work longer than 8 hours? Are you then fired? I had a full time job for 15 years(have worked all my adult life), but the pain of going up and down stairs, walking, writing, etc., caused me to have to leave last year. I have multi-focal degenerative osteoarthritis on top of breast cancer. I worked thru a temp agency until the treatments and medications caused so much pain, I can't even walk across a parking lot, let alone climb stairs or sit at a desk 8 hours a day. I would rather be working, but try to get hired when you have weekly Herceptin treatments and take medicines that make it too miserable to sit or stand for any period of time. Unfortunately, I have been forced to apply for Social Security Disability (which is a trip in itself). Please get information of your employment rights. Having breast cancer is not a choice any of us make voluntarily and your employer is not exempt from making accomodations for you. Your state of mind is crucial to your recovery during this time. Good Luck! And Good Health!",

      "Content": "Hi, Jodie, About the lidocaine, you need to get a prescription from your doctor for it. It is a fairly large tube and lasts a long time, since you only have to use it 2 hours before your chemo treatment. I have been using it since my chemo began January 2007. I apply it to the port before I leave for the clinic so that by the time they get to it, no feeling in the area..works wonderfully. You have to cover the area once you apply the cream, but don't use a bandaid or bandage material as it will absorb the cream. I cut a small 2 inch square of plastic wrap and tape it to the site. The lidocaine is great for those of us who are sensitive around the port area. The astringent the nurses use to clean the site does not contain anything to numb the area, it's just a disinfectant. Hope this helps and Good Luck, Ruth",

      "Content": "I too had great discomfort in my breast after lumpectomy and mammosite radiation. I kept telling both my radiologist and my cancer surgeon, but they repeatedly said it was normal. My breast was purplish, swollen, hot to touch, hard, burned and pulling on the sutures (massive scar now). Finally, when cancer surgeon was implanting port for chemo(two months after initial surgery), he and resconstruction surgeon \"decided\" it did not look right. After implant surgery I was sent for ultrsound and they discovered that I had a large hematoma in lower part of breast. They removed 60 cc's of fluid. Afterwards, burning, heaviness and pain virtually gone. I was not persistant enough. The biggest problem was that during the lumpectomy they inserted a temporary balloon for the mammosite radiation and then thoroughly bandage the surgery site. They did not put a drain in my breast to allow blood or fluid to drain, which I pointed out several times ( each time I went in to have the surgery site re-bandaged. They blew it off and I allowed it to happen. My surgery was Oct 06 and just last week I developed a slight infection in the scar (I shower daily & sometimes twice a day). I know it is because of all the pills they have put me on. My immune system is down and healing is slow. My point is, be very adament about any pain or discomfort you are experiencing. The doctors see so many patients per day that they tend to sluff concerns off. Do Not Allow it.  It's your body and you know when something is wrong. Make them check it. Good Luck and Good Health.",

I have to have an ultra sound and a mommagram and I am totally freaking out! how are you doing now? Hi, Karen30, Not to scare you, but no one in my family, on either side, ever had breast. I was diagnosed in October 2006 after finding a lump in my left breast during a shower. I went through all the screenings and the biopsies and had a lumpectomy in December 2006, fortunately my lymph nodes were not involved. I was given mammosite radiation the week immediately following the surgery; 2 treatments a day for 5 days, more aggressive than every day for 30 days. My Chemo began the first week of January 2007. I was told that my body produces a natural protein that allows cancer cells to develop; therefore, I am also receiving Herceptin infusions. It is to block the protein so that further cancer cells won't grow. I am also on Arimidex, an oral chemo medication that is to kill of any cells not  gotten with all other treatments. However, while I was not able to work any more through the treatments(because they were so aggressive and in quick succession), it was liveable. My chemo lasted 6 months and I will finish my Herceptin infusions in April. The Arimidex is no fun, but I am \"living\" with it. Here's the thing, you don't have to panic. The fact that the lumps have been found is a blessing. Breast Cancer treatment has come a long way and is so much more tolerable than even 10 years ago. The radiation exhausted me, granted, but the chemo went easier because they now have a medication you take the day of treatment and the following two days that prevents nausea, which is usually the part that made it so hard in the past for people. I was lucky because my GP sent me to a cancer surgeon immediately, who did the biopsy and lumpectomy and in turn sent me to an oncologyst at a cancer center after my surgery. My oncologyst was agressive enough to do further tests on my biopsy and blood work to discover the protein problem. He did this because no one on either side of my family had ever had breast cancer. The worst thing you could do would be to avoid further testing. Follow your doctors' advice, ask lots of questions and don't be afraid. While it has been a whirlwind experience, I am a survivor and you will be too, whether your tests are positive or negative. God Bless and Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Hi, Jodie, I too am HER2 positve and have been receiving Herceptin treatments since the beginning of my breast cancer treatments. I finished the toxic part of the chemo in June 2008 and am still receiving the Herceptin every 3 weeks until April this year, 2008.  Herceptin was originally given weekly but further testing told the doctors they can give 3 treatments in one session without further complications. Be advised, it is your choice to go weekly or every 3 weeks. Every 3 weeks saves me $120 a month as I do not have to pay the co-pay every week, which is great if your income is limited. I receive a MUGA scan every 3 months and so far have had no problems arise from the Herceptin and I used to be a heavy smoker. In fact, your doctor may recommend a MUGA before starting the Herceptin so that they have a starting point with the condition of your heart. Keep in mind that this is all precautionary. Herceptin may cause congestive heart failure, but the numbers are extremely low. Other than adding to your tiredness, I have had no other side effects. Be sure to tell your doctor is there is a family history of heart problems - mom, dad, siblings, etc. They will be extra cautious and on notice to watch more closely. This is the complication of being HER2 positive, your body creates a protein that allows cancer cells to grow and the cancer can appear anywhere, not just your breast. The Herceptin is supposed to block that protein in order to prevent the cancer cells from growing. I am also on Arimidex that is supposed to kill of any cells that may be left in my body after all the previous treatments. This is all layman terms, as I have been told and read about. Talk to your doctor and ask as many questions as you need to. Talk to the nurses that administer the infusions, they are very helpful and can sometimes give you a more down to earth explanation of the pros and cons. After a year of receiving Herceptin, I am fine. The alternative I'm told would be to risk other cancers and I definitely don't want to go through this again. Good Luck and God Bless, Ruth",
