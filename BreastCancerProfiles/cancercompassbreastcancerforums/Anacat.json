    "Content": "I had a mastectomy June, 2005. I have been suffering with PMPS since my operation. I have been to occupational and physical therapy. I had injections to the area under my arm. I was put on Neurontin. None of these treatments worked. I went to a pain management doctor a few weeks ago. I was to have nerve conduction studies. She had her medical books out at the time of the study to see where to apply the electrodes. When she was done she said for me to take B-12. B-12? I am losing my mind because of the pain. I need to get some relief. Any suggestions?",
