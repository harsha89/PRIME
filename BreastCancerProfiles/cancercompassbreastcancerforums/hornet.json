Sounds crazy but a tumor which showed up as 2.5 in my mamo, was 1.8 in my mri 10 days later!  I still had the surgery, etc. but it goes to prove the power of the mind.  Rest is very important to you so purchasing those tapes can really help you on your journey.  God bless. Roseannhello roseann you hit the nail on the head with your advice so true as you wrote the power of the mind i myself have been in a fight for almost three years now with thyroid cancer at first i was told its the best cancer to have well after having a tyroidectomy then a radical neck disection  many rounds of radiation petscans more tumors found on the opposite side of my neck and now a tiny tumor in my lung and three days ago a uterine ablation im still trying to figure out who decided that this was the best oh did i mention i whine alot lol i also bought some relaxation tapes but still couldnt stop or shut my mind of then one of my sons bought me a bunch of comedy tapes alot of old ones for instance the old george carlin bill cosby and i gotta say laughter for me is the best medicine you should see the looks i get when awaiting biopsys that the needles are very long and im cracking up as i walk into the procedure room!!! this young lady needs all the advice possible and thank god for people like yourself and this site i will pray for her and now you wish me luck  im awaiting now my team of doctors decision on whether more external beam radiation verses chemo???  in the end its my decision but not having anymore control is whats bothersome to me any advice on that would be gratfully appriciated  goodluck          theresa  aka  trroid  ",
