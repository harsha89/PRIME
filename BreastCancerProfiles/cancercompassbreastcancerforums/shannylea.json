    "Content": "Cancer definitely has a smell. I was dignosed with thyroid cancer a few years ago. During the biopsy I was awake and not numbed at all. When they took the cells out of my neck, there was a very distinct smell. It was not a pleasant one. My next biopsy was of a benign lymph node, and, sure enough, no smell. Now, I have more lumps in my neck andmy urine has begun to take on the same smell as those cancer cells. My next biopsies are on August 1st and it will be interesting if it is in fact thyoid cancer back. Also, pets do act different when you have cancer! My dog wouln't stop licking me obsessively..",
