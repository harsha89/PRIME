      "Content": "This has been a rough year.  In January they found thyroid cancer (very small, had a thyroidectomy and now just watching it).  Not long after that I started having pain in my right armpit, right sholder, and right breast.  Had a screening mammogram in Feb (I am 41 and I do them yearly.)  Last year my Bi-Rad was a 1.  Said scattered fibrogladular densities, no microcalcificatons, no signs of abnormalities.  This year it was Bi-Rad2 - said the same thing - scattered fibroglandular densities, no microcalcifications, no signs of abnormalities.  My right breast just doesn't feel right.  Doesn't look differnt.  No changes in skin, but when I put my arm down it just feels differnt and it aches all the time.  My OB/GYN did a breast exam and didn't find anything last month.  Well last week I was in the shower, just cleaning, not even doing a breast exam, when I felt something.  It is a lump, almost in the arm pit, that feels about two cm long.  When I lift my arm I can't feel it, but when I put my arm down it is there.  I don't know if it is attatched to the arm muscle or what.  It is easy to find when I have soap on my breast, but harder to find when you are just doing an exam without something slippery there.  I have lumpy breasts but this lump feels very different from the rest.  I have an ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow and I know I do have dense, large breasts - but I am terrified.  No biological relatives have ever had breast cancer, but we watched my mother in law die from it.  Of the five people I have known who have had breast cancer - three of them are now gone because of it!  I am scared to death!  This could still be something benign right?  ",

      "Content": "I know when my grandma went on hospice they took EVERYTHING away from her. Her digestive enzymes to breakdown food (she had pancreatic insufficiency), her thyroid medication, her blood pressure medication, even the antibiotic she was on for a UTI she had. The only thing they gave her was pain medication. So I know this is common once hospice is involved. You will be in my thoughts and prayers.",
