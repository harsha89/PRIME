    "Content": "Hi everyone, 7 weeks ago I felt a lump near my nipple that to me felt the size of a blueberry... and a thickening underneath my breast where my bra wire would sit. I also noticed that when I was laying down on my back, my skin sunk in where the lump was. Not so much a puckering or dimpling, just sunken. The consultant at the breast cancer centre felt both lumps...nothing showed on either the mammogram or the ultrasound? The radiologist felt the lump herself then pressed very hard with the wand and it still didn't show up. I was told it must be breast tissue and left. The lump and thickening is still there so worried I returned to my GP and asked for a 2nd opinion. I saw the nurse who felt the areas again, said that boob was my bigger one anyway and also thought it was ore than likely just tissue! I have asked her to send me for a second opinion at. Different hospital ( unfortunately I have no faith in my first hospital from past experience) it's all well and good guessing, if they can't see it but can feel it how can they be sure??? Sorry for rambling.. I'm worried sick and have found another small pea sized lump near my armpit....",
