    "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy in February of 2012.  I am in a clinical trial at a cancer center and am taking Arimadex once daily for 5 years instead of chemo. I did not think I was having any side effects from it.  I have had a few hot flashes, not too bad though.  I had a total hysterectomy when I was 50.  I am 62 now. I am really tired though.  About mid day I have to lie down for a while or I cannot make it through the evening.  I thought it might just be from the surgeries.  I had another surgery just 3 weeks ago to remove the dog ears under my arms.  I chose not to have any reconstruction. I am 62.  Other than the fatigue, I have a lot of pain under my arms..Mostly my left where they took 16 lymph nodes and I feel as if I have a very wide constrictive band across my chest and under my arms.   Not so much pain under right where they only took 2 nodes. ",
