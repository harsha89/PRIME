    "Content": "Hi, my mom who is 59 years old has not been well for a year now...we just found out that she has breast cancer (she has a big mass in her breast that she knew about for 2 months and didnt tell me) Her calcium levels were very high too, and possibly liver cancer. She has extreme pain in her hip and knee area as well. We will not know anymore until a biopsy is done. She is living with me, now needs a walker because of her pain and falls. She is tired and sleeps most of the day,does not have much of an appetite, complains that she is going blind. I give her baths. Does this mean that her cancer is very bad. I can't sleep or function knowing that I may lose her. I have 2 boys and staying strong is just too hard. I am so scared! Please help :(",
