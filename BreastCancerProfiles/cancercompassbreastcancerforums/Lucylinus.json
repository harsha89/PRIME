    "Content": "Cherrell, I too am a woman of faith and strongly believe that all the doctors/surgeons/oncologist are creations of God and He has allowed these people to assist him in saving our lives. In order to survive breast cancer you must trust in God and the people he has sent to help you. I was diagnosed a year ago with R breast cancer. I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction and chemotherapy. Of course no one wants to have their breasts cut off but I am alive and well today because I listened to God and He led me through the last year of surgeries and chemo. If you want to live, comply to God and the miracle of modern medicine.",
