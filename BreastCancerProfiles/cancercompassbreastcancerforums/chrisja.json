I have had Gemzar twice and the nausea isn't bad. The doc told me there are other options for stage 4, but I don't know what they are or if they will work for me. I hope you are doing better.",

Has this been the usual response for others? It seems like many of you have tried more estrogen blockers than that. Any info you can give me would be helpful.

How you are feeling is usually the main thing doctors pay attention to, but even though I feel fine with stage 4 bc, my doctor does test for my markers every month.  They have been slowly creeping up, which concerns him, and me.  My CT and bone scan have not shown any progression.  My doctor told me that sometimes when they creep up, it could be that something is going on, but isn't enough to show on the scans, or it could mean something is about to happen.  The way my doctor explained it to me is that the markers are not dependable enough to make a diagnosis, or determine on their own if the cancer is spreading, but they are a guide that is taken into consideration with everything else.  I think the low range is around 30, and mine is now around 90-100.  There are other factors that can affect the markers.",
