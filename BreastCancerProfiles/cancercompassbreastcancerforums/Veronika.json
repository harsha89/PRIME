Chemo and Armidex was working it killied the tumours so it seemed but another spot appeared on the lining of my lung so they put me on Avastin and Aromasin and I have been getting Avastin every two weeks since January of this year. I am due for new scans soon to see if it is working. Ask your doctor about Avastin treatment it is supposed to be a very good new drug. Hi Whitedory, I'm Veronika, 48 years, I have breast cancer for ten years, metastatic breast cancer in the bone since 2003 and in the liver for four months. Can you message me your results with Aromasin and Avastin ? I I hope your doing well and I'm looking forward to your answer. Best wishes Veronika      ",
