    "Content": "my Dad is on gemzar and cistaplatin (which is part of the platin family like carbo). My father has the same mets as your daughter. His started in his tonsils on 6/07. He only has side effects at 48 post chemo. Chills numbness and the other normal side effects. He does have tiredness, all the time. He just started the first part of November so he is still waiting to see if it has results. We hope so since the liver is involved. Is your daughter in alot of pain? My Dad is in alot of pain around his chest and thru his back. I wondered if it is because of the cancer in the spine. I wish you guys the best and hope. michele",
