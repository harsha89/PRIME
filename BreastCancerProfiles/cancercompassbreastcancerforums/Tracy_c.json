I am 43 and feel 63 since one year on femera, aching joints, swollen finger joints aches and pains in hip, feet. Anyone else have this trouble? I thought it was imminent death with second diagnosis but some great 'Hope' stories on this site.",

      "Content": "dear Denise H how long ago was your original cancer, did you have a mastectomy, and were you on tamoxifen. I am due for scan and ultrasound in a few weeks. Would like to keep comparing notes. Will check in this site regularly. I suppose the joint pain is just tough luck if the tumours are stable! good luck Tracy C",
