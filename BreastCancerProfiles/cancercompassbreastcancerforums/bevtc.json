    "Content": "Are you still off Femara?  Is your hair still falling out?  I started taking it in June, then was off 6 weeks for surgery, then restarted it.  My hair is now coming out in handfulls.  I may stop taking it altogether since I am not sure that the severely increased bone/joint pain and all the other side effects are really worth the 10% increased survival rate.",
