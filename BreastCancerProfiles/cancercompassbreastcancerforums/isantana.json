      "Content": "I've had five biopsies, two core needle, two streotactic, and one excisional surgery.  Mammos always show suspicious microcalcifications in two areas.  In about a week, I am going to have a second excisional biopsy--all in the same breast, in the same location that atypical lobular hyperplasia with radial scar was found last December.  I am getting mammos every six months.  Have had three doctors' opinions because I've been trying to avoid another biopsy but after three oncologists have suggested surgical biopsy, I've decided to stop avoiding it.  I'm just wondering if I'll ever stop having biopsies.  I worry they may cause more damage.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I was just diagnosed with carcinoma insitu.  My doctor wants me to take Tamoxifen. Is this what your doctor is recommending?  I've read a lot about it and don't feel safe enough to take it.  I realize it reduces the chance of getting cancer by over 50%.  I'm not sure how this works for those who already have cancer. One of the long term side effects is that is can increase your chance of getting uterine cancer. Since ovarian cancer runs mildly in my mother's side of the family, I am leaning on not taking Tamoxifen but instead monitoring it closely with a yearly  mammogram and MRI. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying.  I am 46 years old.  How old are you? My doctor has been very good about describing my options and I have read a ton about Tamoxifen and am leaning on not taking it.  I tend to be very sensitive to drugs and because one of the long-term side effects is the increased changes of getting uterine cancer, I feel it isn't safe for me.  Ovarian cancer runs mildly on my mother's side of the family.  Anyway, I appreciate your words. Are you now undergoing chemo and radiation?   ",
