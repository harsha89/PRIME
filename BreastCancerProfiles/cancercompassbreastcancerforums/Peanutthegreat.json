    "Content": "anybody out there taking femara? I need help deciding; I currently have a bottle sitting on my counter but cant bring myself to open it. I was diagnosed 10 years ago and had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation; at that time I chose not to take tamoxifen but to alter my life style; vegitarian, vitamins, etc. After 10 years I had a recurrence last november followed by a mastectomy. My oncologist feels strongly that I should go with the drug but the side effects scare me; I have hot flashed constantly now, my hair came back so thin last time that in the right light you can see my brain; I am very physical and the idea of constant pain with the most basic of movements makes me wonder if life would be worth living. After a lot of research I have determined that my fathers family has every type of cancer known to mankind, so I feel that my cancer is genetically driven. Yes, I am a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs, no matter what I do it is wrong. Ladies.....input please",
