      "Content": "Hi my name is Sherry and I live in Georgia. I was diagnosed in May 2007 with ER/PR+ HER- in the right breast. Because of the location onthe back of the chest wall andribs I decided not to have surgery. I have been through Femera,All the AI,s and Faslodex injection. Three of them almost put me inthe hospital. So I by accident went on the net to Europe. England,Vienna, Mayo, Anderson,Tokyo, U of Leeds, Germany, you name it and this is what I found out, When a person is diagnosed in Europe/Asia/China/India,etc the mediacal community takes a totally different aproach to the disease. They look at cancer as not a death sentence but as a \"chronic\" illness that can be delt with. PLEASE look up Dr.Joanna Budwig Protocol. She was nominated 5 times for the Nobel in molecular biology. What she discovered in the 30,s about the cancer cell is truly remarkable. I am now on Flaxseed, the Protocol and the tea.AND NO SUGAR. Sugar(something else doctors will not tell you ) is ESSENTIAl for all cells to live and that is cancer cells too!! My tumor is srinking and so far my markers are coming down. I am NOT saying this is a cure, but do look at other alternatives. A name NO doctor wants to hear you say, after all the adverage cost for chemo in the US is over 30,000 dollors. In England its 8,000. You make up  your own mind. Blessings and good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this board and I REALLY need some help from people who are undergoing treatment  like me. I have ER/PR + 3\" tumor in the right breast. The cancer is on the pectus muscle and apparently attached to the rib. Because of bad heart problems surgery is not possible. I am 58. My oncologist started me on Femera a month ago and the side effects were very severe and he had to stop the medication. He has since started me on  Faslodex injection 250mg once a month. I have had some effects like bad bone pain, irritability,hot flashes, but nothing severe so far. Is ANYONE out there on this drug? If you are could you please tell me how it effects you and what I can expect? Do you loose your hair? I am very scared right now because of what I went through with the Femera. I just need to know that I am not alone with this therapy.Thanks, and God bless.Sherry.",

I have been on Femera,Aramasin,Flasodex injection and all did not work. here is a great piece of advice: YOU HAVE TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!! The doctors will not like it but PLEASE,PLEASE PLEASE get a 2nd an deven 3rd openion.Doctors that DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER.THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. DEMAND a copy of your mammogram, and biopsy report.Make a folder and NEVER go to an appointment alone.Get a friend,worker,neighbor ,etc. THEY an dNOT you will hear things you will miss. By FEDERAL LAW they must give a copy to you. Getting that 3rd openion, LITERALLY saved my life! God bless you hon, an dkeep us informed.",
