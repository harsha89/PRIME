      "Content": "--I take a walk on any good weather days and let the tears fall I seem to cry alot in the car---I have cried in line at the gro store---It is a natural way of dealing with the stress and grief. I am crying less now and fealing better. I presented at stage IV  Sept 2012 at age 51. The fact that you were offered surgery is a good sign, it means that they think they can get a good result with that--maybe some clean up with radiation and or chemo--not easy for sure but doable--I am on my second round of chemo after 5 mos. in remission. I plan on living every moment and if I have to hop-skip & jump every 5 mos. in order seeing my grandkids grow up I'm there---every day we make there are better treatments. With any luck one of us will be the key that makes  prevention/cure a possiblity so no other women will have to follow us.  ",
