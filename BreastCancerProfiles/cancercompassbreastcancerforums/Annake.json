    "Content": "I had masectomy surgery done on June 15th with expander put in on my left breast, and some reconstruction done to my right breast. My drain just came off after 5 days. Yesterday I drained 40 cc in the whole day. What should I do? Should I go to the emergency or wait to see my surgeon tomorrow (I have scheduled appointment). Anna",
