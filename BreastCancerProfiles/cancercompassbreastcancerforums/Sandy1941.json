      "Content": "\"Partial breast radiation\"? Are you referring to mammosite HDR? Whole breast radiation is also available with HDR - brachytherapy. I had the whole breast brachytherapy and it was a breeze. 20 catheters used, 5 days of treatments and no pain whatsoever - and, felt nothing when the catheters removed - no numbing necessary - just clipped and pulled out with no feeling. The parameters for this type radiation are very narrow, and I feel truly blessed to have had the opportunity. Chemo wasn't recommended for me, just the rads. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Hello.  I am a 31 month survivor of bilateral IDC/lumpectomies/HDR brachytherapy to the left and been on arimidex 28 months. (from diagnosis to end of treatment was 63 days).  I was 62 at Dx and in very good health.  Please don't let the horror stories of Arimidex side effects scare you.  Each person is different as are their daily Rx intake that may be affected by Arimidex.  The only changes I've noticed are thinning hair (which stopped after the first 6 months) and swelling in thumb and 1st 2 fingers of (r) hand and 1st joint of pinkie finger on the left.  Mobic (antiflammatory) keeps the swelling and stiffness down for me - cannot take Aleve or Ibuprofen.  Small trade-off if it gives better odds against recurrence, is my thinking.  Good Luck!  And, there are other AIs available if your body does not tolerate Arimidex. ",

Since original surgery in 08/04 I had labs and chest xray every 3 months the 1st year + full body CT scan (just before surgery), and annually ever since. Checkups with Oncologist are now every 6 months w/labs and chest xray and I have mammograms every 6 months (and will continue for next 5 years). In Feb. '06 had stereotactic biopsy for microcalcifications in L side; benign and determined dead cancer cells that hadn't flushed from rads - titanium marker placed. Mammogram in July was clean. Next CT scan is in a couple of weeks. The re-testing is nerve wracking, but I feel SO much better after each one. NED is wonderful terminology, but even 2+ years out reassurance is calming. You never can close the door on cancer. I won the battle, but the War goes on. Now it's up to me (and the Good Lord) to do everything I can to prevent recurrence and 'no more surprises'.

I leave tomorrow for brachytherapy to the left breast. The right breast - the cancer was so small they decided radiation not necessary on that side; and sentinel nodes on both sides were clear. They took sentinel on right and sentinel on left + 2 axillary to be sure. brachytherapy is the best option for me because I have very sensitive skin and external radiation would be very difficult. Internal radiation, brachytherapy, is not available for everyone. depends on size, stage, pathology after surgery, and mets to lymph nodes. I was very, very lucky. But am following recommendations of CTCA physicians. I will also be on Amerivest hormone therapy indefinitely to supress estrogen. Estrogen is necessary for breast cancer to exist. Unfortunately, I was on estrogen replacement Rx for 12 years non-stop. They don't say this is the cause, but oncologists I have talked to say it's not a good plan. I had no menopause symptoms - just prescribed the Rx because it was supposed to ward off osteoporosis. Hold tightly to your faith and loved ones. I wish you luck and will be praying for you.",

I've read that rads or chemo can take up to 5 years to recover from the fatigue completely.

I finally gave in to the joint pain and take Mobic (non steroid anti-inflammatory) and it's much, much better. Hate taking an Rx to offset an Rx, but since I type a lot, that's probably aggravating the joints too. And, just about to turn 65 so plain old arthritis probably rearing it's head.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with bilateral IDC in July 2004. After MUCH reading and web searching for information, I selected CTCA in Tulsa for my options and treatment (\"We fight cancer, that's all we do\"). I was VERY fortunate - after many, many tests, I opted for bilateral lumpectomies. Had not gone to the lymph nodes, so had brachytherapy radiation to the (L) only; the right was 'well defined' in the original MRI, and left was stage 2, right stage 1. My son (35) was freaking out and said 'just get the surgery, Mother...NOW'. The first 2 surgeons (general surgeons, I might add) said double radical mastectomies followed by chemotherapy. After I sought the 3rd opinion at CTCA and ALL the tests were completed, this extreme treatment did not seem to be necessary. Survival and recurrence rates would be the same based on all the tests run. HOWEVER, my son did write me a note saying \"if I were the general in this war, I'd grab the biggest guns in the arsenal. But, I'm not. And I won't be the one to pick up the pieces after the battle is over. Make this decision for yourself, Mother. You've put us ahead of yourself all of our lives - put yourself first this time and do what you feel is right in your heart\". Thus, I proceeded with my surgeries and treatment with the blessing of my family - the \"strongest gun in the arsenal\". Just support whatever decision she makes - that's all you can do.",

I personally have many DEAD family members the last was Jennifer my sister-in-law who was only 25 with a 1 year old son died March 15, 2002 who died from cancer. Jennifer was treated at the Mayo Clinic with the only three ways medical science knows: surgery, chemo and radiation (chop, poision and burn as the cancer patients call it). I also have no female organs, appendix or gall bladder because I USED TO listen to the doctors, if I would have known about Dr. Holland and Doug Kaufmann and their books I would still have all my parts and be a lot healthier and happier. Also The Cancer Treatment Centers of America are good: www.cancercenter.com even though they may use surgery, chemo and radiation (if absolutely necessary) but they also use immune building methods that have saved lots of people who were told there is nothing else to do but die. Personally I would go to Dr. Holland and see what he had to say first. I would trust him the most. Maybe he could consult with doctors at The Cancer Treatment Centers of America if it was necessary to go there. Also a must for cancer victims especially breast cancer!! Dr. Lorraine Day, medical doctor who cured her own breast cancer entirely with alternative medicine!!! No surgery and No chemo or radiation! Videos: \"You Can't Improve on God\", \"Cancer Doesn't Scare Me Anymore\" My prayers will go up for you and I pray you choose LIFE and that more abundantly and that God will bless your efforts and you go to the media with lots of information IF you are cured so that others will know about alternative cures that they may also LIVE! If you receive that cure I hope you go to the media (radio, tv and your local newspaper) with lots of information on HOW you were cured so that others will know about alternative choices that are available and that really do cure diseases so that many more may also LIVE and not DIE! If I had cancer I would invest in all the knowledge you will receive with the information available on this letter. More important links if you eat meat: For Natural Grass Fed Beef - Dry Aged Steaks go to: http://brcsuperstore.com/listings/311.html also: http://www.texasgrassfedbeef.com and: http://storesense01.dynamic.net/grassland/index.html Information on all kinds of health subjects: http://www.mercola.com/article/statins.htm - STOP ALL SUGAR IMMEDIATELY!!! That means all sweeteners including all forms of sugar like fructose, sucralose etc., corn syrup, and all others. Read labels as corn syrup is in a LOT of things including Ketchup etc. READ LABELS! Eat ONLY STEVIA (an herb), which you can find at health food stores, locally and on the internet. I would not even use HONEY the only other safe sweetener until my cancer was 100% gone, but that would be my option due to the fact that fungal and cancer tumors alike feed on SUGAR! Which also means stop all carbs made from flour that turns into sugar in your body. No bread, pasta, cake, cereal, white rice etc. Get the books they explain WHY. another cancer article link: http://www.mercola.com/2000/oct/8/sugar_cancer.htm I am sending this because I really do care that too many people are lied to about what cancer really is and that a cure is still being researched, there is no research needed they already KNOW how to cure cancer, if your doctor sincerely doesn't know HOW or where to find the information give him this letter. May God Bless your endeavor for a cure. Remember the Holy Bible says: \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" - Hosea 4:6 YOU ARE NOW EQUIPPED WITH LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE AND SOURCES TO FIND KNOWLEDGE USE THEM WISELY!

      "Content": "PLEASE contact CTCA for information. There are 3 facilities currently - Seattle, WA, Tulsa, OK, and Zion Il - the 4th in Philadelphia to open soon. I went through a similar experience last year - bilateral infiltrating ductal carcinoma and was sent to a surgeon immediately after biopsies. He said bilateral radical mastectomies with chemo. Got second opinion, another surgeon, same recommendation. I wondered when the oncologist would be recommended? LOTS & LOTS of information on the internet and recommendations did not agree with pathology from biopsies - left was 1 cm stage 2, right was 2.5 cm stage 1. HER results were not in. Breast cancer centers of America (not CTCA) had article showing 'we are way OVERTREATING breast cancer - chemotherapy should not always be automatic'. I was devastated and felt so alone. Then, I remembered (divine intervention?) a TV advertisement for CTCA \"we're here for you 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week\". Went to their website and their home page shows \"We fight cancer - that's all we do\". That was the place for me! I didn't want a general surgeon to operate on a gall bladder, remove both my breasts, then on to an appendectomy. I wanted CANCER experts. You'll find it at CTCA as well as the most caring enthusiastic staff you'll ever encounter. There were patients there (I went to Tulsa) from Mayo Clinic, M D Anderson, etc that had given up hope - and they couldn't say enough for the support and treatment they received at CTCA. Good Luck and you'll certainly be in my prayers as all who have follwed me are daily. I was Blessed - lumpectomies and HDR brachytherapy on the Left, only. NO CHEMO was necessary. Given Arimidex Rx and am Cancer free at 6 months and annual exam coming up in July. Cancer can be beaten. But you need the 3 Fs - Faith, Family and Friends. Their support will be invaluable as you take up the fight. Remember, treatments available now (HDR brachytherapy) were not available 3 short years ago! Not approved for breat cancer treatment by the FDA until 2002. So, take advantage of all information, ASK QUESTIONS, and be comfortable with your treatment options and physicians.
