      "Content": "Hi I saw your message, and just had to reply to you. I was feeling exactly the same way in Oct 06 when told I had breast cancer... I had just returned from my father's funeral, he died from undiagnosed cancer metastactic..... from diag to death in 4 days... I was feeling the same way, I had microcalcifications in two places, no lump... two biopsies, I felt my body had let me down, I eat right, excercise etc etc, so it was a mastectomy, and with 4 nodes positive and her2 I was stage 2b with absoloutely no symptoms other than detection from a mamagram. I came through it well, hardly any pain, recovered fine went to work in 4 days, then started chemo in Feb 07 had mastectomy in Dec06.. Did pretty well om chemo, finished since May 07, have been looking at lots of alternative supplements, and now taking PAW PAW I believe that is the way to go and other whole food supplements. Listen to your Dr, and also your gut feeling, then ask lots of questions, question everything.... I did... good luck and let us know how you are doing. Corinne",
