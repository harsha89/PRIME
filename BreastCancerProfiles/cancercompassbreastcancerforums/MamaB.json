      "Content": "Hi Karen, I am so sorry your mom is having so many problems.  After they do the biopsy, the doctors will know how to treat her. We all have a tendency to lose our appetites and sleep alot when we are diagnosed. I was diagnosed with Renal Cell cancer; if you are interested you can read my story on the Kidney Site, \"Sutent and Fatigue,\" or on the RCC Site, \"Living with Sutent and better days to come\". Cancer is hard on the patient; but I know it is also hard on the caregiver.  My darling husband was my caregiver and he worried about me so very much; I could see how it was affecting him! Karen, I know your heart is broken right now.  You have got to take care of Karen!  Go to the Lord in prayer, asking him for strenght and knowledge to be able to do what ever you will need to do.  Ask others to pray for your mom and you and your family.  Ask  to be put on Church prayer lists.  God is so awesome to hear our cries for help.  These two darling little boys of yours need you to be there for them also. It is important to keep a positive attitude.  Stay strong in mind, body and soul.  Have hope and faith for better days ahead. Don't hesitate  to ask questions, share info with us, just get on here to vent or just to talk; this is a wonderful, caring forum! I hope everything will be all better very soon for your mom. Prayers and blessings, B  ",

      "Content": "Hi K, Welcome to the forum, perhaps someone will have a clue for you. I hate to hear about your wife having cancer.  Cancer does cause us to look at things in general from a different view. So, your wife just up and left after and argument?!?!  Hmmmmmm, you need to think this through and try to contact her to help you understand.  Tell her you cannot file for divorce without first meeting with her and talking. Prayers and blessings, B         ",

      "Content": "Beth, my heart goes out to you!  Seeing your mom so close to deaths door is so very hard! Have you considered a second opinion? I can only suggest that you take her out for drives, if she is able, it helps to get out of the house and see different scenery.  Talk to her about things she enjoyed in the past; even if she has told the same old stories a million times.  Go through the old family pictures, it brings back a lot of happy memories.  Just anything to help her pass the time with happy thoughts. You did not say how old your mom is; but I know the feeling is all the same.  I had to give my mom up at 86; I knew she could not be helped, and it was actually a relief when I saw her go...........I knew instantly that she was with Jesus and she was no longer suffering.  Do I miss her; you bet I do! I pray that God will give you strength and guidance and when the time comes, that he will give you peace. Wishing the best for your mom, you and the family. Prayers and blessings, B",

      "Content": "Hi Rushna, Sorry to hear you are having problems at such a young age. By all means...........definitely...........as soon as possible, You should get yourself to a medical doctor and have a ultrasound or mamogram ran on your breast. Do not just sit by wondering \"IF\".  It could be something, or it could be nothing; but in the meantime, you will worry yourself sick. Have a positive attitude, stay strong in mind, body and soul.  Have hope and faith for brighter days ahead. Prayers and blessings, B",
