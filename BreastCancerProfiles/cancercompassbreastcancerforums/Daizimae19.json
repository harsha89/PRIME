      "Content": "Hi....my name is Maegan and im 30.I started getting mammograms at age 29. You see my mom just passed away a month ago at age 55 from complication from breast cancer and her mom ,,,my grandma died of breast cancer at age 62. My best girlfriend lost her mom at age 45 when my girlfriend was only 17.....we are both looking into getting the genetic testing done...alot of places will do this testing for free because you can become part of a test case.....i live on long island ny and there are alot of hospitals in the city that do this...my moms oncologist said the same thing about the exposure to radiation but you know what??? I'd rather be safe and have some piece of mind......thank God nothing is there but my mom knew that I was going for my baseline 2 years ago and she agreed that it was the right thing to do...so go for it and get it done....it is definetly hereditary. One more thing..one of my sisters girlfriends who is 28 just had a mastectomy and is undergoing chemo...YOU ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG in my opinion.....do yourself a huge blessing and get the mammo done....it is so not a big deal.......let me know how everything is going...best of luck to you......",

      "Content": "Hello, This is my first time visiting this site. My mom passed away 3 weeks ago- April 4,2007. She fought and in my eyes survived stage 3 breast cancer for 11 years. This past January she had a 10 day stay at the hospital for dehydration when coming off of chemotherapy. She had gained 40 lbs of water weight and went home....and lost all of the water weight. She was doing so well and my sister actually got married March 23, 2007 and my mom looked STUNNING...I did her makeup and she wore a beautiful red dress and she had a beautiful wig on....JUST THE OPITOMY OF CLASS!! and it was 1 week later that she started vomiting and breathing heavy and we brought her to the hospital again...the next day we vented her with her permission....the whole family stood bedside vigils for 4 days while the dr's did their best to figure out what was wrong. They gave my mom 15 different antibiotics and it started working then she started to develop \"Third Spacing-fluids building up between the muscle and the vein\" she bloated up so much. The diagnosis was that she had Streptoccocus and some other bacteria in her blood. They put her on dialysis and that worked for a while but her body started rejecting the treatment and we signed a DNR. By Wednesday of the week the Dr said that her body had begun the dying process and that we should consider taking her off of the machines. This was so hard especially because for the first 3 days I was able to speak with my mom and she responded by nodding her head and squeezing my hand and when I would ask if she would get better for me...she would nod yes...so that was really hard......we were all around her when she passed and we were embracing her...and telling her to go with the angels and her mom..my grandma who died of breat cancer 19 years ago....she passed with dignity and grace...we had over 400 people visiting at the funeral home...she touched so many lives.. I always feel her around me...sometimes when I talk to her the lights in my house dim for a second and I know thats her....I also have a little area on my mantle in my room with her picture and and I kiss them every morning and night...she was also buried on holy saturday before Easter...the holyist day of the Catholic religion...so I know she was and is a Saint....Believe in the signs....if you want to see them you will....love can never die....your loved ones are always with you...take comfort and believe in that...Thank you for hearing my story and I wish you strength, love and healing...I am going through this with you....Maegan ",
