In fact, since your mom has already outlived me, I was wondering if she ever had Doxil during her chemo, and if so what her experince was. In any case I wish you well...I have some idea what you are going through...I'm sorry, that's no help... Best of luck, Jackie",

      "Content": "I am trying to decide whether or not to begin Doxil as a next step in Chemotherapy. Can anyone share their own experiences with Doxil or chemo in general. My breast cancer has matastasised to my bone marrow, and now my brain and the docs say I have a 20% chance of a very favorable response as it will be only the second drug they've tried and I did well on the previous one. But, if I only have, say, less than a year... I don't know if I want to spend any of that time with horrible side effects. Is another couple of months, possibly really good months, worth the risk of less quality, or even less time ? Please, somebody help!",
