My husband has stsge4 colon cancer with lung and brain mets. He's on the last chemo they can give him strivarga but we just found out the lesions in his head have grown after radiation. I'm at a loss right now it's been a long three year battle non stop. I love him so much and he doesn't want to die and I don't know what to do to help him. I know there's lots of alternative and natural treatments but with three kids, custody of my little sister and a grandbaby here the cancer has taken all we have. But I'd love to hear more about your daughter! Blessings, Light, and Love, Brandy i am so sorry as to what your husband is going through right now and i really want to help in because my had the same stage four pancreatic cancer which almost took her away from us after a lot of cancer treatment..and that is why i am would love for you to contact doctor allen..he is a good doctor and am glad to refer you to him because he helped my mom and i know he can also help you. please contact him",
