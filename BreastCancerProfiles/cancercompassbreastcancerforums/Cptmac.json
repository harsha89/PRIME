      "Content": "Everyone is different.  But I would say let her go through her emotions.  What made it easier for me is, I had a choice of chemo's.  I knew I could deal with the side effects of the one chemo, but it was the only chemo where I would lose my hair.  Because it was my choice, I tired not to get too down.  I debated about getting a wig, but, with the encouragement of my friends, chose to go the hat route.  I know, that the first day is the worst, because everyone would look.  So my husband walked me to work the first day I came back with virtually no hair.  After that, I knew all my co-workers saw me without hair, I could deal with that. I think the story that helped me the most is, when I got back, a co-worker told me that he was always the cute boy with the red hair.  His hair was so tied into who he was and how he got attention.  That he was upset when he lost his hair, and knew it would be gone forever.  But it took him a while to get over the fact that his red hair was not who he was, it had nothing to do with his personality or his identity.  So, I put a big smile on my face and forgot that I didn't have hair.      However, I work in the Media.  And the first time I had to face a camera and know a lot of people would see me, I became a bit unnerved.  But then I watched the Grammy's and there was Melissa Etheridge with no hair.  I thought if she can do it, so can I.  Although I did go on with a hat.  Because I looked so healthy, people called in wondering why I was wearing a hat.  They thought it odd. So I gave myself a goal of letting myself have two years of bad hair days.  Every day would be a bad hair day and I had a good excuse.      While on chemo, my hair started to grow back.  As soon as it was about an inch long, I quit wearing a hat.  When I went to an unknown city, several people stopped and commented how much they loved my hair and commended me for being so bold for cutting my hair so short.  Two of the individuals worked at a posh high scale clothing store..  This totally boosted my self esteem.  The whole time I thought my friends and family were being nice to me by saying I looked good.  But even strangers thought I looked good.  A couple of guys even hit on me.    I say, if she wants to be sad, let her be sad.  But try and find the positive.  When I was first diagnosed with Stage IV and told there was no hope, I knew I would do anything to live.  It's odd that hair seemed to be the hardest thing to give up.  I saved my hair and put it in a bag.  This may seem odd to some, but it helped me.  I let my hair fall out one by one.  Alhtough I wasn't bold enough to shave it off, I was bold enough to show some people my bald head.  The key thing is, do what feels right for you.  God will only give you what you can handle.  And she can handle this.       ",

All my doctors know this, so they aren't late for my appointments. Otherwise, my appointments snowball into lateness.",

      "Content": "If you don't like your treatment, have you tried going someplace else. I would highly suggest a major cancer center. Certainly a top 10 hospital. I am a Stage IV cc with mets to the liver survivor. I initially went to the best hospital in my city. They gave me no hope, so I travel 8 hours one way for treatment. I get my CT and get my results and see my doctor within 3 hours. I get my blood work and all my other tests at the same time. No waiting. I know right away what is going on. Have you asked to get your results sooner? Whenever I do, I get mine asap. I found out I had Stage IV on a Thursday, I called some major cancer centers on Friday and got in to see people on Monday and then traveled at night to see others on Tuesday. I did not count on busy Dr.'s to make these appointments for me. I didn't go through my insurance company. I just called the front receptionist and got in, got a bunch more tests and moved forward. I did all this, even though my initial Dr.'s said I could die at any minute, I should not travel, fly or lift anything heavy. If you don't like your treatment, go elsewhere. I highly suggest a top 50 hospital. You can find them here. http://health.usnews.com/sections/health/best-hospitals I just had all this done on the 18th. I had my CT at 10:30, I drew labs at 11:20, I had my mammogram at 11:30, I visited my ob gyn at 11:45, she got me into get an ultrasound at 12:30 PM. I ate lunch. I saw my PCP with my results at 1:45, I saw my oncologist at 3:00 PM. I then drove 8 hours home knowing I was healthy. I personally can't imagine waiting for test results. I don't know why anyone else puts up with it. I thought that maybe other patients like to wait.",
