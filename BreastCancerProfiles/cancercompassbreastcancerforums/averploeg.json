    "Content": "In 1985 I was where she was December 2002.  In 2007 I advanced to stage 4 that has spread to my lungs.  I've had many years to hear others' stories with \"I would not take conventional chemo and radiation!!!\"  (I retired April 18, 2015, so have many such \"co-workers\" discussions.)  My comment:  \"I'm only as good as my chemo!!\"  I've had many good friends die because of their \"alternative\" methods. I'm 80 years old.  When present chemo reaches progression the doctor comes up with a new one to try.  Tomorrow will be another such day.  I figure I'm buying time until the ultimate cure gets here.  In the meantime, I am only as good as my chemo. ",
