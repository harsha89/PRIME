      "Content": "Hi, Judy13 - I've been on Sutent for 2-and-a-half years and have suffered from Hand-Fot Syndrome as well. I tried the Henna treatment suggested above but got no relief from it.  Many people do, however. I take 150 mg of Vitamin B6 a day, whether I'm on Sutent or in the off period.  It seems to help some.  Only do this with your doctor's OK as B6 can be toxic in high doses. Gently (and I mean VERY GENTLY) rubbing the H-F Syndrome patches with a pumise stone helps me with the skin thickening and that seems to help reduce the pain.  Don't do this if the skin is torn. Applying Bag Balm helps keep the skin flexible and moisturized.  It's the best product I've found for that, although Amlactin Foot Creme is a very close second.  I find heading off the pain is better than trying to relieve it after it starts, so I take an Advil as soon as I get up in the morning and when I take the Sutent at night.  I sometimes will take an Aleve at night.  It helps control the pain at night and that makes it possible to get a decent night's sleep.  Gold Bond Pain Relieving Foot Cream helps when the pain gets too bad. I've been experimenting with DMSO gel (with my oncologist's permission) on the H-F patches.  It seems to help with the burning that has been my major problem.  I apply it right after taking the Sutent at night and then again in the morning.  I let it dry and then apply Bag Balm, or another moisturizing cream. I've chronicled my experiments at http://thyroidcancerfight.blogspot.com.  It has links to other Hand-Foot Syndrome spots. Hope this gives you some things to try at the very least. John    ",
