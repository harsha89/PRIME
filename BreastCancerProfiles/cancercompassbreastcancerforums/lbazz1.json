    "Content": "Hmm I felt some of these things when I was trying to  help my grandmother who sadly passed away. At the same time as she was dying .......... my mum was battling ov cancer my dad was probably going insane and my sister was in a domestic violence situation with a baby. I understand a bit. It's tough but I know you can do this. In the future when you look back on this time you will be grateful you were there for her and you did your best. I,m marginally alternate so exercise and meditation helped a bit. I also have a close network of friends who continue to be a great help by distracting me on occasion. Go to the beach the bush the coffee shop wherever you can relax for a min. I also consciously choose not to think about some things and try to focus on the activity I'm currently engaged in. I always think things could be a whole lot worse for my family and I'm grateful that we're not trying to get through all this under other circumstances like ..... if we were living in a 3rd world country. Take some time for yourself you sound very sad and this situation is very confronting .All the very best to you Lisa",
