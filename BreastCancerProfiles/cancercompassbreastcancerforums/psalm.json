Trust you gut. Donna",

Do you have a relationship with God?  You must first trust Him in ALL things.  When I am afraid I usually find a Bible verse to help me through whatever I dealing with at the time.  Psalm 56:3-4  When I am afraid.  I will trust in you.  In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. Did you make your appointment yet?  That is the first step.   I will pray for you.  Please keep me informed.  ",
