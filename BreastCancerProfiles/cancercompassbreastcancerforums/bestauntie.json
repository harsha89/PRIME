    "Content": "Hi everyone, This is my first post. I was diagnosed with estrogen based breast cancer in 2015. I underwent double mastectomy And removal of my overies. I was on Aromasin for a year but had to go off due to Severe pain in my legs. So I was then put on Arimidex which I took for six months but it got to the point that could not even walk due to the pain in my legs. I have made the hard choice of going off it. I've been off for two weeks, and I'm experiencing horrible pain! Has anyone had a similar situation?",
