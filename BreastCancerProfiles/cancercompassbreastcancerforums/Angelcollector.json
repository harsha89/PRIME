But with that said, we found out last week that it is now on the liver.  Found through a CAT scan .  I have been on a blinded trial for \"avistan\" and so they (the docs.) are going to find out if I was actually getting the drug or not...  If not, I will immediatly start gettting it. Will be getting a PET scan on Thursday and am terrified that things really will be as bad as they are.  Is there anyone out there going thru anything like me??? I am trying not to think about it being on an organ, but I know nobody in my area with anything like this.  Even at the clinic, I am the youngest person usually there (am 39).  Not too many people with mets breast cancer stage IV. Yancy Yancy, I too have metastatic breast cancer. I was diagnosed in Feb of this year. I had breast cancer 6 years ago, when I was 34. I am now 40, well, 41 on Friday. The cancer I had 6 yrs ago was in my left breast. I had a mastectomy and hysterectomy, and plastic surgery, but no other treatment. None was reccomended. Now, the cancer is in my chest wall, lungs, on my esophegus and trechea and lymph nodes. I just found out las Monday, it has now spread to my liver and hip. I was put on Femara in March, and now am doing double doses of Immunotherapy. More than likely, will be on chemo in 1 or 2 months. As far as the Xeloda, I Have never heard of it. I hope it helps you. As far as the trial, I do know for a fact that they cannot give a placebo to cancer patients, although they can mix drugs. Hopefylly, you are on the right one. Good luck to you and your family. My prayers are with you Rhonda",

I had a mastectomy and hysterectomy and was cancer free in 2004. Now, in Feb of this year, I was told I now have metastatic breast cancer. I was put on Femara. From what I read, the MAIN side effect is arthritis and fatigue. I am having pain in my hips and back, and am tired all the time. My doctor said the fatigue is due to the Femara taking away all my hormones. My cancer is spreading, to my liver and hip, as of this week. I am now also on a double dose of Immunotherapy, every 3 weeks, which also makes me tired. I will probably be on chemo in a month or two. I hope you can deal with the side effects of Femara, and I hope it helps your cancer. I wish they would have put me on something 6 years ago. Good luck with everything, Diana. My prayers are with you Rhonda tooI",

I was sent for another one and Ultrasound.  The 2nd Mammogram got a better up close picture of it...but nothing showed up on the ultra sound. They said it is in my left breast close to the chest wall and in a place that is hard to get to ? So my doc thinks they will have to do a reg. sugical biopsy instead of a needle. I meet with the surgeon...and am overwhelmed with fear. Why are they just skipping the MRI to look at it again?  My question is...has anyone had this type of spot near the chest and had similar experiences? I have been blessed and NEVER had any type of surgery before. The thought of being in an operating room is scaring me ...and the thought of cancer is beyond what I can even think of yet. I also am hoping that if they do have to do such an invasive procedure...if they can have it tested and do the right type of operation right then and there...and not make me come back for more?! Am I naive? Any advise would be so appreciated. PS...I have severe Fibromyagia too so I expect that to complicate matters too. Thanks     Hi, 52 and never had surgery? Wow! You are a lucky one! Anyway, the first time I had Breast cancer was 6 1/2 yrs ago. I had felt a lump, and so did my dr. They did a Mam and an utrasound, nothing showed up, but we new it was there. We opted for a surg biopsy, which showed cancer. I'm not a dr, but I dont think that a test for cancer can be done while your still on the operating table, I would assume the test takes at least a day. I don't know if an MRI would show anything, but you could ask about a PET scan. Thats where they inject you w/ radioactive dye, or something, and it shows cancer cells. Less invasive than surgery. Hopefully, you just have a cyst or somthing minor. I'll say a prayer for you. I am 41 yrs old, and now have metastatic BC, stage IV. And, yeah, it sucks. Let me know what you find out, and take care!

My question is that my doctor and insurance company decided it would be in my best interest to have sonograms done ever 6mos to see if there are any changes in my health. My next sonogram is slated for middle of august, but for the past 2 months I have felt pain pangs to that area, should I wait for my sonogram in august? Or should I tell my doctor? I thinking that its all in my head and that I should just wait for august. any input? Pumas, Don't wait!! The first time I felt a lump, I waited, because it didnt hurt. I waited 8 months, when it started hurting and was diagnosed w/ BC. Any pain in a breast is not normal. Be agressive and tell your Dr. you need your sonogram, or PEt scan, or whatever, but do it now. Don't wait. Good luck to you and take care, Rhonda",
