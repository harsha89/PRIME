    "Content": "You need to ask your doctors all these questions.  You have a right to know.  Don't be shy, you have to be your own advocate.  I keep detailed records of my current health, medications, etc. and carry it with me.  I can't have oxygen because I had lung damage from chemo.  I am on blood thinners because I've had to DVTs.  I ask a lot of questions and I study up on whatever I am dealing with.  It's your life and you have to protect yourself.
