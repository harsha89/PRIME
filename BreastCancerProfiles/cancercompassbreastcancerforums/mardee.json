I think I'd rather go through chemotherapy again than to continue to suffer the side effects of Femara.  I'm in so much pain that I can't walk, thus I cannot exercise or do anything I used to enjoy.  I have no quality of life.  I feel like I'm nothing more than a waste of space.  This should not be.  Something is terribly wrong with these AI breast cancer drugs and we women are the guinea pigs for these companies.  I want to cry every day.  I can so relate to what you are going through.  I started Arimidex last September after being on Femara for five months--during which time the side affects had started.  By December, I had developed such severe joint pain and discomfort that I decided to stop taking--December 13.  I had reached the point of barely being able to get out of bed in the mornings and began suffering bouts of depression; also, pain and swelling inside elbows and ankles.  It has now been about 4 1/2 weeks off the pill, with some improvement, but not near where I would like/should be.  I feel like my knees have been permanantly damaged--I hope I'm wrong about that, but I never had knee problems before, and now they hurt every time I get up from a sitting position.  I have not gained weight, so can't blame it on that.   When I told my Oncologist in early December that the pill was causing me so much pain, he said he did not think the pill was the cause of my problems, and just told me to take hydrocondone.  He did agree to let me get off the pill for a month, then take it from there.  However, I'm 66 years old, and have decided that it is not worth it to me to deal with such horrendous side effects that make me feel more like I'm 96.  So am now thinking that I will NOT try a different pill.  I understand it can take at least three months to get it out of your system, so am counting down and hoping for improvement. Please let me know if you are still taking the Femara and if you continue to have all the problems associated with it.",
