    "Content": "My mom had AC Chemo followed by Taxotere (like Taxol) and got nerve damage (pain and burning and tingling in legs and especially the feet).  It did Not go away after treatment.  A neurologist perscribed \"Nuerontin\" and it really has helped. Started with 200mg twice a day and now takes 300 mg tab. in the morning and two 100 mg at night.  The dosage can go even higher than that if needed...many people take 300 mg 3x day or even more.  If you can't get help from oncologist, try seeing a Nuerologist to talk to him about peripheral neuropathy pain.  Hope you find some relief! ",
