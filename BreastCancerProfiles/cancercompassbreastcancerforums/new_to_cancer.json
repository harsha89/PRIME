Thanks, Judi M.   I am just beginning my radiation treatment and have not experienced this extreme reaction.  I wonder if you've tried the real aloe plant gel.   Peel back some of the skin from one of the \"stalks\" and rub the juice directly in, or in this case, sqeeze it on.\"   Hope it works for you.  IN the mean time, I will pray for complete healing.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2 bc and had a lumpectomy and will be starting 71/2 weeks of radiation next week.  All the margins were clear in the lumpectomy, no cancer in lymph node, PET scan was negative and all blood work is in normal ranges.My cancer was DCIS as well as infiltrating ductal carcinoma and was 2.5 cm large, and graded at a 2.  It had invaded the angiolymphatic vessel and lobeules.  That and size is what put it to stage 2.  I worry about the toxicity of the chemo treatments, am laid off right now needing to get a full time job.  I don't want to damage good cells to and yet was told for every centimeter of cancer there is 1 million cancer cells- yikes!!  My oncologist is willing to let me do the chemo after the radiation if I choose to go forward with it.    I felt at peace with my decision of no chemo til I found out about the 1 million cells of cancer as that gave it a whole new perspective.  The PET scan doesn't pick up things smaller than a cm.    Any thoughts?",
