    "Content": "  You might consider contacting the CTCA (Cancer Treatment Centers of America).  They include alternative therapy with traditional medical approaches. In their dining room (in the hospital) they have mostlty organic foods, and there are naturopathic doctors who work WITH the oncologists there. I take supplements they have recommended to work with my immune system, but they give traditional chemo, too, individualized for each patient. I've had good treatment back home, but went to CTCA for a second opinion when they thought I had mets to the liver from colorectal cancer.  It turned out to be a false alarm so far, but they are keeping their eyes on very carefully.  I go every three to six months for check-ups and work with my docs back home, as well).  In the meantime, they work very hard to provide recommendations for healthy eating and supplements to work WITH my immune system to maximize the chances that my body can fight the return of the cancer.  I love the place even though I had good treatment at home, but honestly the CTCA is even better than good treatment, it's exceptional.  The CTCA (if you look it up on google) has counselors who can speak to you about going there if you so desire, or you can email them, or do a Chat online, then talk to them when you feel ready to do so. Note:  The hospitals (there are four of them so far) were started by a man whose mother died of cancer (and she didn't get good treatment) and he vowed to have a hospital that does it BETTER. They have four hospitals in the US now, and are building two more.  Chicago (main facility), Philadephia, Tulsa, Oklahoma (I think) and one in the Northwest (Seattle, maybe?) that is not a full center yet.  They are building two more, one in Phoenix, and one in Atlanta. The treatment there is very holistic, and includes health and wellness, spiritual couseling, mind-body connection, acupuncture for pain (if you need it), massage, chiropractic, naturopathic doctors, and much more). but within a framwork of traditional, validated empirical treatment. It is like nothing else I've seen in treating the whole patient with respect and dignity and including the PERSON in the treatment plan.  If they don't edit this email, please look into it.  Your mother would love it.  (I do not get anything for telling my story about going there... but I'd recommend it to anyone in my family, and I travel to Chicago all the time to get such good treatment. Please contact them for your mother.  She deserves to be treated optimally! If her side effects are so bad, maybe there is another drug that would help as much without so many side effects, or some alternate treatment that would make her treatment more comfortable...  On 6/18/2007 Daughterdb wrote: Hi. I am a daughter of a mom with metastatic breast cancer to her liver. She is only 53. Its been a few years now since she was diagsnosed with stage 1 lobular cancer. she was put on tamoxifin and had a double mastectomy...awhile later she returned to show 3 spots on her liver. the doctors read them out as hemangiomas. three months later she came back, she had full blown mets in her liver. just telling that makes me so angry...anyways, back to it. she did the minimal chemo, she believes in organic foods, good nutrition, supplements, alterative treatments. to say the least chemo made her feel horrible and she felt horrible putting that into her body. so she began alternative options and  started to lose support from the conventional docotrs which is a whole other story, that also frustrates me...well she did her own treatments, and felt great, looked great, sounded great...but 5 weeks ago she had a CT and it is progressing, so she agreed to go on femara. now she feels horrible, the pain is intense, her belly is bloated, and i feel so helpless....not to mention scared. i feel sometimes like the anger is overwhelming these days. why my mom, why any of us? why is it so hard to find a good doctor? why is life so unfair?   Any advice out there would be much apprecitate  ",
