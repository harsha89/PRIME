    "Content": "I'm looking for those who are taking Taxol and Avastin. I have breast cancer mets to bone and liver.  I'd like to hear from those taking the above meds.  Let me know how these are working for you.  Side effects?  How long you've been on chemo.  Have you experienced bad skin burns while taking these medications or while taking Taxotere?     Linda (muzk2myear@sbcglobal.net) ",
