      "Content": "I understand being so scared, I just had a lumpectomy and sentinal lymph biop. on thurs.  Waiting for Path results and I'm only 40 years old!  Yikes.   But my advice may not be what you need, I am not a doctor and have a elementary Cancer education.  So take this for what it is worth.  What I do know thanks to an old soul and really smart folks, is that our minds are so powerful.  We can think our way into symptoms and moods very easily.  Have you ever been depressed for awhile and caught a flu?  Think they may have been related?  What I have been doing since I was diagnosed is mainly spiritual.  I bought a couple Vegetarian cook books and improved my diet, started yoga, I meditate when I can, listen to music I love, and I stay informed about cancer and how it works.  A great book \" Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book\" has helped me.  Also I learned from a friend in the Med. Industry, If you have certain PPO/HMO Insurance you are eligible for an AB12 coverage. In which, and free of cost, allows you a 2nd opinion at University level and higher Cancer research hospitals.  Your Insurance company may not be eager to tell you about this for economic reasons to themselves.  All of these things I mentioned are jsut personal experience, but with love, I hope something is usful to you.  Worth looking into maybe.",

      "Content": "I am 41 years old, w/ stage II Infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  On the 13 Dec. I will be having Sentinal Lymph Biopsy W/ lumpectomy surgery.  Both my mother and Aunt died of Stage 4 Ovarian CA within the last 5 years.  I am concerned that with my Family HX, this  type of treatment  isn't  thorough enough.   My mother  had  the BRCA  I  & II Ovarian Cancer, and very aggressive.  I spent her last 2 years with her,  But because I have not had children I am very high risk right? I do trust my Oncology surgeon implicitly but need advice from others with Ovarian in there HX. Help! Should I even consider Full Double Mastectomy with axillary node removal to ensure no relapse?  Or am I panicking, everything I've read so far has said the full mastectomy in a lot of cases was unessessary and that the SLB W/ Lumpectomy is very successful with little deformation of the breast. And low side effects and risk.  I've had a low CA125 of 12 for the last 4 years.  Thank you for any replies, Ann   ",
