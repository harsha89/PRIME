      "Content": "thanks so much for your imput. I think i'm gonna give it a try. i'm avoiding anything that mimic's estrogen so i think it's worth the try. my nodes were clear but i had 3 different types of cancer. i didn't have radiation because i started reconstruction at the same time. the implants didn't work out. the first one encapsilated and ruptured and then in oct i got an infection in the implant area and almost died from it. did you do reconstruction? i have lymphedema on the cancer side but not the other side. i'm so happy to hear how well you are doing. having moved to the yearly visit with the oncologist feels like my security blanket is gone. have you experienced osteoporosis or high cholesterol?",
