They found something on mamagram. I have been feeling sick all day. Even tho I don't know anything yet, it is the scariest thing you can go through, Not knowing. So many things go through your mind, it makes you crazy. I lost my 26 yr old son Last January to a rare cancer that 1 in a million kids get( an adult cancer). That was devastating to go through. I am raising 2 daughters on my own. I went through 4 surgery's and 6 weeks of radiation. I caught the cancer at a very early stage too. I am just so afraid that the cancer has come back. Trying to be strong, but don't know for how long!!!    I am so sorry to hear about your phone call....I am a cancer survivor and I can't imagine what must be going through your mind right now. The phone call that all of us survivors never want to receive.  You are so justified in your feelings right now.  The loss of your son, what can I say, I have a 24 year old son and a 25 year  old daughter.  That is something I don't know if I could live through, losing one of them.  I can tell that you are a really strong woman even though you probably don't feel that way right now.  I don't know if there is anything I can say to you right now to make you feel better except that I do believe you must have faith...without it, we don't have anything to believe in.  I hope you keep in touch with this board so we know what is going on with you.  I would love to hear from you and if you just need to vent or talk.....I will be glad to listen....my prayers are going out to you tonight......write back sometime, take care of those daughters and know they love you more than anything....
