    "Content": "I'm with the lady that hates the arimedex.  I took it for a year and didn't seem to have any trouble until the vision fogged up in my left eye and then about six months after that my shoulder went weak and achy, that no sooner went away and my hip started giving so much pain that for awhile I could barely get out of bed.  Six months ago I quit taking it and my vision is clear some of the time and I'm still waiting for the hip to feel like it use to.  How bad do we need this stuff.  Cindy",
