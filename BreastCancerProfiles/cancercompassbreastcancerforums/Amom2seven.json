      "Content": "Hi, I was offered the option of either also. The thing is if she does not get clear margins then they have to go back in anyway so I just opted for the mastectomy w/ lymph node dissection. They also weren't going to take all the lymph nodes but I said get them while you are there. Turns out I had 8/14 positive nodes. I just didn't want to chance having to have surgery again because it is no fun. I also had them put in a port during that surgery also. Not for chemo but for Vit C IV therapy. Of course, I didn't tell them that. If she has any questions please ask away. Sincerely, Marlene",

      "Content": "1. Since you found out you had breast cancer, have you ever asked yourself, why me? If so, what were your conclusions? I have either stage III or IV breast cancer. They have not done any scans but it is in lymph nodes. I feel I was allowed to experience this horrid disease because my heavenly Father needed to get my attention. He got it! And I love Him for it. Cancer has been the best thing to ever happen to me. 2. Since my diagnosis, I have made the following changes in my life_______________ Since my diagnosis I have completely devoted and surrendured my life to Jesus Christ and continue daily to have blessing after blessing bestowed on me. I am not nervous or anxious. I am happy, well-adjusted and have only cried about 5 minutes during the last 30 days since my diagnosis. I am a single mother to seven beautiful children and we love life very much. I have done a radical change in my diet and only eat fruit and vegatables and drink distilled water. I take many supplements, many of which come from BioImmune and Mannetech. I also take Essiac tea and do daily coffee enema's. Soon I will be starting on Vit C IV therapy. I pray a whole lot more now for myself and everyone I can think of. I truly believe in the power of prayer. Besides, if Jesus can split the Red Sea I know he can conquer a small thing such as this. 3. The most important being____________ My positive mental attitude and that of my kids. Their doctors insist they need therapy but really we are fine. 4. When asked what the meaning of my illness is, I would answer___________________________ I think I answered that for the most part in #1 but I do feel God knew how much I would be able to help others because of my attitude and personality. He knew what I would do with this and I have a big job ahead of me. God Bless, Marlene",
