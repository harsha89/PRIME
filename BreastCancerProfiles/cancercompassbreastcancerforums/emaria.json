    "Content": "I have a friend that survived breast cancer. It was along process with the surgery and the chemo treatments, but she made it and is now cancer free. A couple months ago she had a scare and had uterine fibroids with some other things that concerned her doctors. They did some testing and thought some cells might be pre cancerous.  She is in her late 40's and does not plan on having more children so they decided to do a complete Hysterectomy. AFter the surgery they said that everything was fine and there wasn't any cancer.  It was another scary time but it turned ok. We were walking one day a few weeks after her surgery and she said something about going to the tanning bed. She had been a few times before this last surgery and was wanting to start going again. I was shocked! I looked at her and said  \"you're going to the tanning bed?\"  She said yes and nothing more. This really concerns me.  She is a breast cancer survivor and just had this other scare and surgery but she is going to a tanning bed? Am I wrong in worrying about her health? Should I butt out and mind my business or try approaching the subject with her again? Thanks for any advice.",
