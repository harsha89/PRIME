She's 44 and always ate right and exercised. It isn't fair (I know...no one ever said life was fair). She hasn't started chemo yet but will be starting it in the next few days. We're scared too. All you can do is fight. I hope your family/friends are helping. My son and I are trying to help keep Sandy's morale up but the whole thing is so awful. My thoughts are with you. You are not alone and every day I think we get closer to curing the horrible C.   Scott",
