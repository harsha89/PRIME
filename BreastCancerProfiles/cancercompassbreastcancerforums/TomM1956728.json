    "Content": "Hello,   I wanted to ask for your kind help.   My mother has cancer and she has lost almost 20 pounds.   Does anyone know of anything she can take that may help stimulate her appetite?   I\u2019ve heard marijuana may be helpful but my mother has some heart problems, and I\u2019m afraid that could adversely affect her heart rate.   Any suggestions and ideas would be deeply appreciated.   Thank you very much for your kind help.   Tom",
