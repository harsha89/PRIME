      "Content": "Hi Frazzlemom, I am 48 years old and am a cancer survivor. I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2013 and had my thyroid removed and the cancer has not returned. Four months ago I had open heart surgery after being diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Six weeks ago a suspicious area was located during a mammogram in my right breast. I had a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. After those tests I was advised by both the Breast Health Clinic and my family doctor that it appears I have a malignant tumour, possibly two in my breast. Yesterday I had a ultrasound guided core biopsy. I will receive the official results/diagnosis on Tuesday morning. It's a lot to process on it's own but when you have also been dealing with other significant health issues it certainly can feel overwhelming. How are you coping? What is the suggested treatment for your breast cancer and how could it interfere with your heart issue? I'm sorry you're going through this ... You are not alone. Carrie",

      "Content": "In November 2016 after a screening mammogram a suspicious lump was located in my right breast. My breasts are very dense and I was unable to feel the lump. I had additional tests (diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound & fine needle biopsy) I was told that I had a malignancy in my right breast, possibly two malignancies. I had a lumpectomy, no lump was located but an area of suspicious tissue was removed. The results were negative. Dr said it was an area that we would just \"keep an eye on\". Fast forward to today. I recently had a scheduled mammogram and coincidentally located a lump and a fairly large pucker/indentation in the right breast. The mammogram did not pick up on the lump. I saw the Dr at the breast health clinic, she told me that there was a single, solid/hard lump and ordered an urgent ultrasound which I am having Wednesday. I checked the reports from 2016 and this is the exact location that the suspicious area was located. In 2016 there was no palpable lump or puckering at this time. This is new. Although concerned, I believe that it's very possible it is a benign cyst. Based on my history and current symptoms, would you agree? Your thoughts ... Thank you",

      "Content": "I'm sorry you're going through this ... I received the results from the ultrasound from the breast health nurse & my family Dr. Appears to be cancer. I am having a core biopsy on Tuesday morning & then get the official results a week later. A MRI has been suggested by the radiologist as I may have a second tumour in my breast. My Dr said if there is a second tumour then I would have a mastectomy. So much swirling in my mind ... Did they do the lumpectomy & then go back & remove the nodes? How are you doing with the treatments? Sending you positive thoughts, Carrie",

      "Content": "Hi, I had a screening mammogram recently that indicated \"asymmetrical focal density\" in my right breast. I had a diagnostic mammogram and last week had an ultrasound. Today I was advised that I am being scheduled for a core biopsy. Should I assume that the previous tests are suspicious for malignancy & the biopsy will confirm it? Has anyone else experienced this?
