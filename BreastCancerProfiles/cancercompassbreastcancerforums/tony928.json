    "Content": "I am a 47 yr old male. who has dropped 49lbs in 6months without trying. I have had nipple discharge, body pet scan which showed lumps underneath arms, lymph nodes swollen on throat, neck etc.. They did a prolactin test which is negative. WBC count goes up and down, did not do a CEA test yet. had a mamogram 2years ago showed lumps but didn't do anything. I cannot get any answers all tests come back normal, but I know something is wrong, I am eating more than I have ever eatten and still losing weight, all is ok but have not tested for CEA . Can anyone relate and have any suggestions for me. thanks tony",
