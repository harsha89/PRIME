      "Content": "Hello Ladies, I\u2019m a researcher at Stanford University, and my team is developing a non-hormonal treatment for vaginal dryness that would be safe for ER+ breast cancer survivors. We would appreciate feedback on the design of our treatment from survivors suffering from vaginal dryness. If you would be available for a 20 minute conversation to provide feedback on the treatment we\u2019re developing, please contact our director of research, Holly Rockweiler athrock@stanford.edu.
