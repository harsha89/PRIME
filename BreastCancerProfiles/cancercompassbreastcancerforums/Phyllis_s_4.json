      "Content": "Dear Donna: I'm glad to see that you are doing well after 10 years. I had stage one breast cancer 4 years ago and now it spread to my bones and liver. I am scared to death, and I am going to start Chemo on Tuesday. Chemo has always been a big fear of mine, after watching my father go through it 20 years ago. Hearing your story gives me hope. Any words of encouragement you can give me would be appreciated. Phyllis",
