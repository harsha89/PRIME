    "Content": "I was told I have very dense, fibrous breast tissue, thats why the tumor was not seen mammographically. However, this yrs mammo DID pick up the calcifications indicating a tumor. On biopsy it was revealed that I have IDC and my surgeon recommended bilat. mast. The other breast has had biopsies also, all benign so far. I went for 3 opinions, ALL of them said that long term studies have shown that lumpectomy+radiation=mastectomy. For me, since I have other diseases and complications from surgery alone may have been worse for me, I opted for the lumpectomy. I am one wk out and doing fine. I will have to be followed closely, but I think I made the right decision for ME. Others would rather have the mast. and I would have also, if not for operative complications, but thats because I wouldn't want to have to worry about coming back every 6 mo. for mammo/us/mri. I think getting more than one opinion helped me and I hope this helps you. Good Luck, Peachy",
