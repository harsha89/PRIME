He recently was declared cancer free after many CT scans. But in the Last 4 weeks developed vertigo, double vision, trouble with balance, hearing loss, And sciatic nerve pain. They have been treating him for just the vertigo for 2 weeks And he has since developed other symptoms that made his neurologist consider an LC diagnosis. He was admitted for lumbar puncture yesterday and received the results today. They advised he had 2-4 weeks without treatment. I am devastated. Lauren Hi Lauren, That's terrible news about your stepdad symptoms like vertigo and double vision are already difficult to deal with and then he's suffering from lumbar puncture too. I could only imagine.Â http://remedymyvertigo.com/",
