      "Content": "I had Her2 positive cancer.  stage 2 going into stage 3 (it was in my sentenial node) breast cancer. Started with a lumpectomy, ended with a masectomy. It has been 12 years. I consider myself totally cancer free. Whatever your situation, please be positive as hard as that is. Your mind set will make all the difference on how you do in the coming months. For me, I got mad. Mad, that this disease was taking time away from my life. I decided to build a deck on the back of my house during the time I was having chemo. I focused on buying the wood, laying the boards down, anything to distract my thoughts. I wanted to live long enough to build my deck. Then I wanted to live long enough to enjoy my deck. Don't give in, don't give up,  Iknow you will survive. ",
