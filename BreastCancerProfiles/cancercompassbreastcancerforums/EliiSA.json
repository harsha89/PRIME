      "Content": "I am a 63 year old Scandinavian living in the UK. I was operated in January 2016 for breast cancer: Lumpectomy, radiotherapy and then Letrozole treatment. In my case, Letrozole is the only available and suitable for me because of my previous medical history. I took Letrozole for 8 months. My life turned  into a nightmare: not sleeping properly, hot flushes, awful mood swings, dry mouth, joint pains, stiffness, memory loss, gaining weight etc. etc. possibly all listed side effects. Decided to stop taking Letrozole one month ago and feel much better. I am not trying to tell anybody else or agitate to do the same, but just tell that this medication can put one´s life into a different light and cause not only personal but other difficulties with mood swings and even break your life. I took this risk of stopping and enjoy my days without those bad side effects. Risky, but life as such is risky and rather only one or two years ahead instead of 5-10 horribly side-effected years. Anybody else done this?",

I am still feeling a lot betten not taking Letrozole, but possibly need to go a bit deeper into this nutrition and diet matter. Hope your sister is doing better now. All the best to you.",
