      "Content": "Hello, I'm 47 Dx: L breast IDC Stage 1, Grade 1 - PR/ER+ HER2 -, two lymph nodes removed (neg) Lumpectomy and SNB Aug 2015 Currently undergoing 36 weeks ( to start) of whole breast radiation. What, if anything, has anyone done or suggests discussing, with the radiation oncologist re: vitamins, foods to eat, etc. to help keep the bones (especially rib bones) from being so brittle post radiation? My doc said they can break easily up to five years post radiation. I've read other threads here that say broken ribs remain broken ribs. They really don't heal? Just trying to be proactive. Also, my doc said no deoderant, no shaving on that side duing the entire radiation process....until it's done. Thoughts? Thanks!",
