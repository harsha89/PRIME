      "Content": " I am just like you... Her+ and my tumor was invasive, size10 cm per 8, stage III, with axial  nodles when I arrived the hospital in january. Unfortunatly I lost most of my immunity and only got it back at my fifth cycle of neoadjuvant therapy when I started taking xango, than Essiac from Canada and a special food diet: soja milk, goji, golden flaxseed, fish, no sugar (cancer loves sugar), seitan, tofu, and lots of fruit and vegetables, mainly red ones and tropical; watermelon, papaya, cherries, beetroot, carrots,garlic, broculus, all biological of course. I don\u2019t drink tap water- I am overwhelmed with the results for the tumor reduced only now to half it\u2019s size .. and I hanve a normal immunity system now never late   http://essiac.webs.com/   http://www.xango.com/     With the size of your Tumor in my country they first do chemeotherapy, then think of doing mastectomy, radiation and 5 years of hormone therapy. In my perspective radiation is more dangerous than chemeotherapy\u2026 Look up on all the side effects of what they sugest for you\u2026 and then make your decisions on what makes you feel more comfortable\u2026 As if it is possible with this cruel disease --- \u2026 Good luck and doing haste on just relying on what they say, It\u2019s your life, your body, ask as many questions as you can,,,",

      "Content": "I have Invasive Breast Cancer stage III and the first chemeo sessions did hardly no efect on my tumos (Breast and axial) I was disappointed and decided to take anti-oxidant Xango, goji, and a rich diet on vedgtables ( soja milk mixed with kefir, broculos, carrots, cabbage, spinage, watermellon, anona, tofu, soja, saitan, tropical fruit and cerials) no sugar, except frutose nor red meat (chicken, turky, fish specially salome) and lots of spices as gengibre, saffron, I can now say the tumor after the 5th session of chemeo is half the size and my immunity system has normal values. Now I don't feel tired, neither do I need antisminic because of the Sping. I climb stairs easily, do tai chi and even bike ride. Unfortunatly, only 2 chemeo sessions left... I am thinking od takig essiac to avoid the side effects of quimical drugs. Let's see how it turns out",
