    "Content": "I agree that the waiting is the worst.  I have a week to go before my double mastectomy, and I am going nuts.  What is most helpful to me is trying to \"get ready\" in practical ways.  Getting out tops that button down the front and ironing them so they'll feel nice, moving things I use all the time down from top cabinets so I'll be able to reach them, doing cleaning that I won't be able to do for a while, preparing my garden so it will easy to plant my seasonal stuff, and stuff like that.  I may be OVER preparing, but it is helping me to cope with the wait. ",
