I'm no doctor but that just doesn't seem right to me.  My husand has stage IV kidney cancer and has mets to the lungs, brain, and now bones.  He had whole brain radiation which helped tremendously with the many many mets in the brain.  He had his lungs drained..almost 4 litres and then could breathe pretty good, just had femur stabilization for the mets in his pelvis, and is currently on chemo and is having radiation and I can honestly say that today is a great day for him!  He was diagnosed in 4/2013 and had 1 kidney removed in April as well and not once has his oncologist(s) given him a time frame.   I've read so many stories similar to your sis in law and they're doing well.  I don't know, maybe do your research so that you can drill the doctors for other options?  Blessings to your family.",

My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily Emily there is ALWAYS hope as long as there is life!  From my research on cancer (my husband has kidney cancer) so many patients have major health issues on top of their cancer and they are still here today.  Be proactive in your research.  I know it's scary at first, but knowledge is power and you can stay one step ahead of the medical team.  Jump in there and be your BFF's advocate...she'll need one, and by the looks of it, you're her best choice :)  NEVER give up hope for only God knows when and how we will join Him.  Blessings and prayers go out to you and your beloved friend.",

Her biggest complaint is extreme diarrhea and extreme leg weakness. So much so that there have been times she can't make it to the bathroom quick enough. And walking from one end of the house to the other is difficult because her legs get so wobbly. ANY suggestions from anyone who has experienced this would be so wonderful. It makes me so sad that she is going through this but then to have these side effects that are so debilitating makes me even more sad :( Please help us! Ritalin help my husband during his weakest moments.  It does the opposite in adults than what it does for children.  Give her lots of Boost milkshakes too.  1 boost, frozen fruit and some whey protein will build strength.  God bless your mom and you!",
