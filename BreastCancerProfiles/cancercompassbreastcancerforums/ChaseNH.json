    "Content": "I am newly diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer in my right breast, 1.1cm tumor or lesion or whatever you call it. My doctor has given me the option of mastectomy (single or double with reconstruction) or lumpectomy with 3 weeks radiation (Canadian protocol) and 5 years of Arimidex. I decided to go with the lumpectomy, but now I reading horrible things about the medication and the radiation. I am booked for an October 4th surgery. I am wondering if I have made a mistake. The doctor clearly was encouraging the lumpectomy, but did say it was my choice and not to worry--insurance would pay for it and my quality of life and prognosis numbers would be virtually identical. I am confused.",
