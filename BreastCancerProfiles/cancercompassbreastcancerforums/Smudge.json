    "Content": "Hi. I was like you and on Arimidex for possibly 9 months. I coped with all the aches and tiredness, but what I struggled to cope with was the dry mouth which started around the 8th month. My breast nurse told me to come off it for a couple of weeks and the dry mouth disappeared. Then I was put on Aromasin and the dry mouth started almost immediately. I just don't know how I am going to be able to cope with this for another 4 years+. Have you experienced this.",
