    "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy 8 weeks ago & lymph nodes were removed from the right side. The surgeon said they got it all & my margins were all clear. I had a follow-up pet scan on Tuesday & it is showing evidence of right subpectoral hypermetabolic lymph nodes. Report saysÂ  \"right subpectoral has intervally developed suggesting neoplasmic recurrence\" but all other areas show as \"unremarkable\" Does this mean the cancer is back?",
