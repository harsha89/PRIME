    "Content": "Carolyn, You said, \"Have you had an ultra-sound, mammogram or MRI of your breast? That would tell a lot.\" I went yesterday for my first mammogram and ultra-sound because I have a lump. I meet with the surgeon tomorrow. Wanted to know can he tell from these reports \"if\" it may be cancer? I'm sure I will be going for a biopsy but that may be another week or two. Just curious... Thanks",
