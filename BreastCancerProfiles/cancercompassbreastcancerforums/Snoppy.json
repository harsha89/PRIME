    "Content": "I had a family history of breast cancer. My sister died from it and I have 2 first cousins that have been diagnosed in the past 5 years. I had cervical cancer at 38, the doctor did a complete hysterectomy and gave me premarin. I took the same dosage for 11 years. In the fall of 2000 I saw a new gyno, she seem concerned and said we must reduce this dosage. In May of 2001 I had my yearly mamo and it showed a 1.75 tumor it was malignant and estrogen fed. I had a partical mastectomy and reconstruction on my right breast and of course they took me off the premarin. But I truly believe it grew that much in one year because I was taking a drug that was feeding it. No one told me I could get some help or restitution for the doctors not being more up to date on what premarin could do to anyone much less someone with my family history. Does any one in Texas know who to contact for help?",
