    "Content": "Hi, I also live in Wisconsin in the Milwaukee area and am having bilateral Diep reconstruction on Jan 22nd with Dr. Kinney.  I have heard amazing things about him and have talked to nurses, doctors and patients who have worked with him and I have heard he is a perfectionist and is extremely compassionate.  I met with him about a month ago and was impressed with both him and his nurse.  While I am nervous about the surgery I am confident that I've chosen the right doc.  Let me know what you decide and good luck!
