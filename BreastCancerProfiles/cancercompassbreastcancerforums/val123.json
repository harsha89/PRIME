    "Content": "Hi, I had a biopsy yesterday and today my doctor called and said I have breast Cancer. All she said was that the radiologist said it was high grade. She didn't have the pathology report yet. So now I have to wait till Friday when I have an appointment with a surgeon. Is it possible to have a high grade cancer that is stage 1 or 2? I've been a total wreck since I found out and now I have to wait 2 more days . Thanks for any help, I'm so scared.Â ",
