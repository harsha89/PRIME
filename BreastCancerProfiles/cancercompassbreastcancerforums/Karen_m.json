    "Content": "Has she been to the Cancer Treatment Centers of America yet? I had breast cancer Oct '03 and just got back from there today. I made an appointment there because my local oncologist didn't offer any nutritional or vitamin advice. They are awesome there. You see nutritionists, naturopaths, oncologists, etc. and they offer nutrition, vitamins, herbs, and also conventional drug and chemo but they know their stuff. I didn't want to go on the medications but wanted to do it naturally. I was very impressed. The clinic is in Zion, Illinois. Has anyone else refused the typical Tamoxifen and aromodex for breast cancer?",
