    "Content": "Aloha!  I'm a 61 year old female.  In the past year or so my urine has had a different smell and I have noticed \"residue\" build up in my toilet (solo user toilet).  In the past few months, my body odor has changed and become very strong.  The odor is hard to describe but reminds me of apple cider vinegar. I've mentioned this at all my doctors' appointment but all the doctors do is claim it is a \"side effect\" of the medications I have been prescribed.  I've changed medications but the odor persists.  I've changed deoderants about six times. I shower 3+ times a day, I still smell.  My small dogs are very protective of me.  I swim in the ocean near daily and recently have had other swimmers' dogs (strangers) come up to me after I exited the water and the dogs were very interested in my body smell. Yesterday, a German Shepard ran to me suddenly from about 20 feet away and the owner told me the dog had never reacted to anyone like this before.  The dog did not want to leave me.  Also, yesterday I had my annual mamogram and have been called back for another mamogram and ultrasound next week.   Of course, I'm very concerned especially given that my sister, age 61, passed away last November from a seven year battle with breast cancer.  I am probably over reacting since I don't have a diagnosis but could my strong body ordor be a sign that doctors should have considered at an earlier stag?  ",
