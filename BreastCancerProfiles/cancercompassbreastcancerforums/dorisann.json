      "Content": "Thank you for replying. I am so sorry about your mom and will put her on my prayer list. We hear so much about drugs that are approved by the FDA and later found to be detrimental to our health. I don't know who to believe any more. I feel money is number one and they just don't care about the people at all. I was especially curious as to how that small lump my friend had actually disappeared. I know this can happen, have read of some cases, but then I did not read those people had nodes with cancer at the same time and had them removed. I am to the point that I even question mamography. Too many false positives and retesting going on including biopsy. I feel if a lump is not found and disappears, maybe that is a good thing without doing anything about it at all. I don't really know, but I know I am sick wondering if my friend could have lived many more years had she never had that mammogram.",

      "Content": "That is wonderful news about your mom and I hope she will be able to get out of bed too. If you want, can you tell me her first name. I agree with what you say about our foods. All the toxins in our products certainly add to our chances of getting cancer. Our deoderant and household cleaners are loaded with things that are cancer causing agents. I was born in 1944 and believe me I know what food used to taste like. I often say it is sad this generation will never know how good peaches and tomatoes used to be unless they grow them and even then they have to grow on good soil which has been spoiled already by overuse of pesticides.Â  You are good to your mom, bless you for that.I will be praying for you both.",

      "Content": "5 and 1/2 years ago my best friend had a tiny lump that she was told was cancer. She went for surgery and was told the lump had disappeared. They found lymph nodes with cancer and removed them under her arm. she had chemo and started tamoxifen. She celebrated when her 5 years was up. Now 6 mos later she was diagnosed with stomach cancer and has malignant ascites with prognosis of 4 mos to live. I searched for info and have read studies in the UK and Sweeden mention tamoxifen can possibly cause stomach cancer. She also has a blood clot in each lung which this drug is known to cause . I keep wondering if the drug did this to her. I am hearsick over this and just cannot believe her prognosis. She will try chemo if she can handle it (so far side effects are bad for her). Does anyone have any thoughts on this story. Thank you.",

      "Content": "I am sorry to read about your dear mother and continue to pray for her. Bless you both and your family . This is a very hard time. I kept my mom home until the end and I was so glad I could do that for her. You can always take comfort in the fact that you were there for Merie. My friend passed this morning. Two and a half months after being diagnosed with stomach cancer and having malignant ascites. Her husband wrote me that he feels her primary dorctors let her down because they diagnosed her problem as acid reflux and treated that for a couple of months. Also I don't understand why her urologist did not test her for cancer. She was under his care for five years taking that awful tamoxafin. I surely wonder if that drug gave her the stomach cancer in the first place. Take care dear. My heart goes out to you. You are a wonderful daughter.",
