      "Content": "Hi Linsky, I have had 35 radiation treatments. I didn't have any serious problems but did get some burning. I used aloe vera 100% gel and aquafor.  Have you tried shea butter? Not sure if it will help or not but give it a try. Keep your skin saturated for a few weeks and see if it does. It's good stuff... Good luck and God bless...   David   ",

      "Content": "Hi, I completed surgery in Feb 09 and radiation treatment in May 09 and I still have a small amount of pain occasionally. When we get surgery/radiation it does lots of damage. Most goes away over time but some will never completely subside. If you can't get relief from otc nsaids, you might ask your oncologist if you can get something a little stronger until you completely heal.  Good luck, God bless and keep the faith... David  ",

      "Content": "Susan is right, this is another one of the \"witches brew\" cures. They are not cures. There is not a cure for cancer as of now. Some of the alternative treatments may actually be good for us but they are not cures. There are others that can actually do damage. I asked my Radiation Oncologist(M.D./PhD) about some of these treatments and he said he didn't know if they worked or not. There is no proof that they do.  ",
