    "Content": "Hello Fran, Please go to your Library and find or order the Book \"Flax Oil as a True Aid Against Arthritis, Heart Infarction, CANCER and other Diseases\", by Dr. Johanna Budwig. or www.applepublishing.com I've been through Radiation and Chemo for Laryngeal cancer, left with out being able to swallow over a year. This Dr. says she can \"CURE CANCER\" with Flax Seed Oil and Cottage Cheese. Sounds too simple to work but the only thing you have to lose is the Monster in you, Cancer. I only wish I knew of this sooner. I refused Chemo after reading this book and will not allow this Monster to defeat me or even try ever again. You have to believe \"YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THIS BATTLE ALONG WITH THE WAR.\" Some Dr.'s don't treat the individual just the ailment and we suffer the consequences. Take control of your Life, You're a winner so celebrate your Mental and Physical VICTORY, Live on PURPOSE, to be happy. Ray",
