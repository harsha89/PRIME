    "Content": "tommy44, I am SO sorry 4 what u r going thru. But there IS help. The Susan G Komen Foundation offers many services as does breastcancer.org , in addition 2 this site we're on, CancerCompass. Try asking @ breastcancer.orgÂ  4 doctors in your area that accept cancer patients w/ no insurance & who understand chemo brain. Others on this site have made many good suggestions also. There is help out there, it's just a matter of finding it. Sites like this 1 can help a lot w/ finding assistance. Good luck!!!! :)",
