    "Content": "Found out New Year's Eve I needed a stereotactic biopsy on my left breast.  My ultrasound states: \"At the 1:00 location there is a linear anechoic focus suggestive of a dilated duct.  Dilated duct is further from the nipple than typically seen.  There are 2 small groups of microcalcifications.  The anterior groups demonstrates heterogeneous and punctate calcifications with possible nodulartity.  The posterior group demonstrates round and punctate calcifications.\" Bi-Rads: 4  Mildly Suspicious. I wish I understood what this means.  I am in full research mode.  I have to wait 6 more days for the biopsy, then 2-3 days for results.  All the time in a strange city & strange hotel.  Typing this makes me sound like a whiner, but I'm not, I'm just scared.  :-(",
