    "Content": "Dear all, I still can't believe it but both my parents were diagnosed with cancer in the past 3 month! My dad was diagnosed with GBM and after he finished the 6 week radiation and chemotherapy my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. We found out that she has a tumor that is almost sure malignant.Â  We are looking for a good surgeon and oncologist in Central London. We would deeply appreciate any recommendations! Thank you very much, Maria",
