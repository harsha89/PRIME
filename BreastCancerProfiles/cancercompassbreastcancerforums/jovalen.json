    "Content": "I am 40  yr old and awaiting my results of my stereotatic biopsy.  I have calcifications that my Dr. thought were concerning enough to be biopsied.  The biopsy was horrifying and I didnt handle it well at all.  I can not figure out how I have gotten myself in this situation.  I dont have family history of BC and  I only took the advice of my Ob/Gyn to have my mammogram when I turned 40.  I had never imagined it would have turned out this way.  My Dr. tells me there would be a 10-20 percent chance of it being cancer...but when I go online and do research the percentages seem to change of course depending on everyones situation.  I am really confused...what causes abnormal calcifications...I keep getting conflicting answers online...I do have breast implants and I'm pretty sure my doc said they had nothing to do with this...if I fell into the 10 -20 percent I would love to know what I caused for me to have them...",
