Well after two and a half years it did come back but I was on something else in the begining of that time but coinsedently i got off of that too so Ill never know because since it metastisized iam on the hormone blocker foslodex..having many bone problems...I believe someone on this site mention to look on another site for the statistics on Arimedex you know my doctor said it was just a 15 percent of the cancer not coming back does anyone know if this is true? he never told me it was a sure thing or I would be on it. So I feel like you ladies may be doing good all on your own.As for me I was stage three and 18 positive lymphnodes so there wasnt much hope there and still Iam here since 2015. But I guess we can see why he was angry but if he had my bones he would have understood after 35 rounds od radiation and four chemos its not like i didn't try oh plus the surgery twice found it under my right arm in March so 10 more",

      "Content": "Iam also new to this site and after chemo which I seemed to have tolerated i was asked to go on Arimidex well I refused because I saw the side effects were as long as my arm especially when I see bones because we have Arthritis in my family pretty bad and I hurt long before Chemo so my doctor was very unhappy with me well I lasted 2 and a half years and it came back in quite a few places including where I had had surgery in the first place.Now isn't it a funny thing that Iam now on the shot foslodex sounds like Arimidex I believe maybe with more powers since Iam metastisized.So we shall see so much trouble with my bones that the Oncologist has ordered a bone scan and of course my lungs a chest xray and then we wait till next very early spring for a Pet Scan,which will tell all tales and see how the shot has worked other then feeling older then I should and blaming it on radiation because one tumor was found on c2 spine so ten days there, i wish myself and al of you good luck it is a struggle Iam 69 soon to see my 70th birthday.So that is my story i do highly suggest supplements because I haven't been taking them and I feel horrible so I have started back up today as of someone on this site says to do so including roasted pumpkin seeds which I like so I will buy.",
