    "Content": "One minute of radiation in the operating room (OR) could save the lives of thousands of women being treated for breast cancer in the US today. According to a growing body of research, a 60-second course of radiation therapy delivered during surgery dramatically improves results. But, until recently, logistical and administrative difficulties prevented most patients from receiving this crucial treatment until weeks after their procedures. Now, a portable, self-contained radiation therapy system, the Mobetron from IntraOp Medical Corporation (OTCBB: IOPM; Sunnyvale, Calif.), is changing all that. St. Joseph Hospital (Orange, Calif.), one of only 16 prestigious designated National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers, this month introduced the first ongoing intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT) program for breast cancer. During lumpectomy surgery, St. Joseph's patients receive a high dose of therapy focused specifically on the tumor site, known as a \"boost.\" Given the benefits, other facilities are expected to follow suit. Felix Sedlmayer, MD, one of the world's leading IOERT researchers and the principal investigator of IOERT boost trials conducted by six European medical centers over the past decade, concluded that IOERT cut breast cancer five year recurrence rates dramatically, from an average of 5% to less than 1%.",
