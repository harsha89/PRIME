    "Content": "My mom, 78 had a masectomy, 11 lymphnodes involved, in 2006. HR postive, did 6 weeks radiation, Has been on Arimidex since. She had a P.E.T. scan yesterday and her dr called last nite to inform that she now has cancer in her spine, bones and liver. She has 3 to 6 months, tops, and once it hits the spinal cord she'll have paralyis and down hill form there. Dr is talking about chemo, but my mom doesn't feel that is an option. She live 120 miles from a hospital, in New Mexico. She was treated for breast cancer in central Fl so i could take care of her.Now she doesn't want to leave her home in NM for treatment. I can respect that. I want my bro's and sis's to come see her before it gets bad, and all are willing. Mom wants me there now. I will have to quit my job, have someone care for my 12 cats and a dog, and hubby will go with me. Do i go now? Do I wait for the liver biopsy? Do i stay to the end? Has anyone been here before?",
