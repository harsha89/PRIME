    "Content": "My sister was recently diagnosed with DCIS nuclear Grade 3 of 3 with comedo necrosis, HER2 negative,  Underwent lumpectomy with sentinal nodes tested, will have to undergo radiation and chemotherapy. Surgeon wants her to have genetic testing, but she skitters away from that idea (double mastectomy).  My grandmother died of lung cancer, my mom of brast cancer, I am a nineteen month survivor of Lymphoma (which was originally diagnosed as Sciatica, how wrong can you be), so pretty much full up and trying to deal.  I've learned that quite a bit of info on the net is outdated, so am turning here in hopes of some feedback.  Any help is greatly appreciated, and thank you.",
