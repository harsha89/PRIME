    "Content": "Marietta, I have been experiencing pain in my rib cage below the right breast which I had a lumpectomy last Feb 04' I had strong chemo and radiation to treat my aggresive ductal carcinoma. They took one lymph node which was negative. My breasts have been hurting so bad and are so big and swollen lately. (48dd) The nipple and surrounding is different in color (almost yellow and green in color) and the nipples of both breast are sensitive and always hurting. What happened with your test? bless you, Angelheart",
