I have no choice.  My mother died from colon and lung cancer 21 days after diagnosis... I will not let that happen to me! Hi My name is Pat. I was diagnosed with breast and lymph cancer which had spread to my lungs and liver. I refused chemo and radiation. I do believe in alternative ways to heal the body. I have a book called..Outsmart Your Cancer........in it it gives different alternatives to choose from. I chose Protocel..with it you take other things also. I have been on it for a little over a month now and can say the pain in my liver has stopped the tumor in my breast is shrinking and my lymph nodes as well are a lot smaller. My energy is great and feel good. I will go soon to my oncologist to have blood work and at some point maybe an MRI. He is working with me in this even though he wants me to have chemo and radation. To any one who has cancer please look into the alternative things first..if anyone interested I can provide a phone number to order this Protocel. I am not sorry for my decision in the least. ....God Bless........Pat",

Check your notifications I am curious. Why are you against anything medical to treat cancer? I see your replies in a lot of posts and you are always telling people not to get treatment. Why? I do not know if this was meant for me or not but I have an answer to this regardless. I do not judge anyone who decides to have surgery or chemo or what ever. But if one can be healed with out the harmfulness of chemo or radiation and being cut on would you do that? I was diagnosed with breast, lymph cancer. It had spreaad to my lungs and liver. I went the alternative way and do not regret it in the least. I am on Protocel and other things that go with it for a little over a month now. The tumor has shrunk, the lymph nodes also and the pain in my liver is gone. I feel great. My energy is wonderful again.  If one opts surgery then I wish them the best. I still have the body parts the God blessed me with. I was in stage 3.......God Bless",
