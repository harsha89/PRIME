    "Content": "Hi Joyce take serrapeptase ( I take swanson's serrazimes because they are cheap) its a fantastic enzyme from the silk worm, it can help with lots of things not only joint pain, some people find relief in days, but not me, it took a month, I know it works because I had inflammation problems shown by a high ESR and CRP blood test, a second test taken a month later showed that now I am in the low normal range. I also take Nattokinase (google both of them)",
