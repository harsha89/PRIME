      "Content": "I was going to finish my Arimidex last year and the onoologist said I was going on Tamoxifin. So I am on the ten year plan! 4 more to go. You ask some important questions. I am your same age and something new pops up almost every week or month. I am not sure if it's the medicine or just aging. It's your body, but my mom had a tumor removed, didn't like the way Arimidex affected her and stopped. The cancer returned a few years later. I had calcifications the first time. Had a mastectomy with reconstruction. Had no meds or anything with that. 13 years later a lump in the other one. Cancer is very unpredictable. Don't know if this helps, but keep asking questions and see what others experience. We are all unique!",
