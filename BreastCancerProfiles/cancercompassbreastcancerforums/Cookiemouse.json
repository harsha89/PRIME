      "Content": "Hi,  I have used this board before for my mom who had colon cancer.  I actually have a question about myself.  I am 36 yrs old and have 2 small kids...my mom passed in March of this year...I accidentally became pregnant and had to have an abortion in May of this year.  In the past few months, I have had weird breast sensations, hard, tenderness, some discharge when squeezed (only one occasion) and it looked like milk...it kind of comes and goes.   I have just been very aware of it.  I had a mammogram done at 35 (clear, thank god)...have had an irregularity in my menstrual cycle (but I have never been regular before).   Recently had a breast exam by my gyno and he did not say anything was wrong.  My question is:  should I investigate further or do you think it has to do with the pregnancy and menstrual cycle.  And if I should investigate, what should I look at?  Since my gyno was not concerned.  Thanks for all your help. ",

      "Content": "Hi,  I have had breast tenderness for about 1 week...it is not the time for my period where I usually feel tender for about 3 days.  I don't feel any lumps around my breasts...but am not sure.  Is breast tenderness a sign of anything.  BTW, I am 36.  Should I get it checked out or wait another week or so to see if it goes away.  I am due at my ob-gyn in January for a bi-annual exam.  Thanks for the info.

      "Content": "Hi, a friend of mine was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer when she was 32...underwent a lumpectomy, had chemo for 6 months and radiation.  Then she received herceptin for about a year.  Several months later, a mammogram showed another lesion.  The lesion was very small, but at that time, her oncologist and surgeon recommended a bilateral mastectomy and no follow-up treatment as it was not in her nodes.  She underwent the mastectomy and already had reconstructive surgery. My question is:  if she had a mastectomy, is she safe?  is there a way for the cancer to spread if she no longer has breast tissue?  is there something she can do to prevent it?  she is watching her diet and exercising, is there anything else?  thanks for the info?",

      "Content": "My mom is on her 5th round of chemo and they are using Methotrixiate in high dosage, Mitomycin, 5 FU, Oxaliplatin and Leucovorin.  They are also alternating Erbitux with Avastin.  Anybody ever heard of that regimen? It's a heavy combination (one week in the hospital and one week as an outpatient) and is wreaking havoc on her platelet count.  Any suggestions?",
