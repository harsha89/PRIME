      "Content": "Hi i have just read your message and wanted to contact you as i have been diagnosed with Lobular breast cancer.  plus seedlings in top of spine and down each side of ribs, All this came as rather a shock as it was only found when i went in hospital to have my Gall Bladder removed in June. Since then i also am on Femara pill and bone infusion once a month.I find it hard to realise this is happening as i feel great,and everyone says i look so well.  So we must believe them when they say that if this treatment works we can be on it for years.i am keeping a positive mind,plus eating all the right things,for once in my life,and plenty of excerise. It has given me even more hope after reading your note and to know you feel good. Keep me posted and beleive. Anne",
