    "Content": "Hello, I am a 55 year old woman who just had a left mastectomy for invasive lobular cancer. I was subsequently put on Arimidex. The problem is, I have radiation enteropathy in my intestines because of treatment 17 years ago for uterine sarcoma. Consequently, I had a severe colitis attack on the Arimidex (literally constant cramping and diarrhea; had to go to hospital and be put on I.V. fluids, etc.) The same thing happened to me when I was put on Fosamax some years ago, with the result I now have untreated osteopenia. So, my oncologist gave me a perscription for Aromasin. I have two questions: 1. The documentation says this should be used after several years of Tamoxifin, which I obviously have not had. Does this matter? My oncologist seems to think not, but documentation says otherwise. What are the ramifications? 2. I'm scared to start the Aromasin, because of having two weeks of intestinal agony after the Arimidex (I went into my mastectomy a week ago in this condition!) Does anyone have any advice on minimizing the effects on the intestines? Obviously you take with food--is there any other advice out there? To be blunt, my gastroenterologist doesn't seem to believe me--he keeps giving me Flagyl and Cipro, even though those don't work well with me. I will try anything at this point; my chance of recurrence is obviously quite high. Thanks for any information.",
