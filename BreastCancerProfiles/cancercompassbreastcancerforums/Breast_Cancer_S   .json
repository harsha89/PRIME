    "Content": "My wife developed breast cancer as indicated in the medical report below. As indicated in the report we are looking for information from people who have had dealt with a similar situation. Any help is welcome. My name is Pericles. Medical Report: The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer diagnosed in September, 2000. At that time she was pre-menopausal and presented with bilateral breast nodules and underwent bilateral quadrantectomies and axillary dissections. The pathological report from both breast tumors disclosed multifocal lobular invasive carcinoma with 4 out of 16 auxiliary lymphnodes involved by tumor on the left side and 23 out of 23 in the right side. Immunoperoxidase staining of the tumor repeated at MSKCC in New York revealed negativity for immunoexpression of cerb-2 and positive staining for hormonal receptors. At presentation she also had a right superior lobe pulmonary nodule and multiple foci of increased uptake in the bone scan in the sternum, pelvis, right and left proximal femoral bones, and multiple vertebrae. She was started on systemic chemotherapy with AC for 4 cycles followed by Letrozole associated with monthly Leuprolide and Pamidronate. She responded to chemotherapy with disappearance of the lung nodule and a decrease in tumor markers. She also received bilateral breast irradiation with 5040cGy in both breasts. Despite her multifocal bilateral disease, we did not feel she should undergo bilateral mastectomies at presentation because of her metastatic disease at diagnosis. Her disease was stable up until November 2002 she presented with new hepatic lesions and with increased tumor markers (CEA and CA15-3). We substituted Letrozole for Tamoxifen without a response than we attempted Megestrol also without a response. We then started her on UFT plus leucovorin with a remarkable decrease in tumor markers but with appearance of nausea and an increase in her SGOT and SGPT to levels more than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range that subsided upon UFT discontinuation. We than switched her to weekly paclitaxel with progression. We then started her on Novantrone plus Cyclophosphamide with an initial stabilization of her disease followed by progression after 3 cycles. She received then Docetaxel for 6 cycles (60 mg/m2) with disease stabilization. She presently showed an increase in her tumor markers and we stopped Docetaxel and started her on Faslodex. She was maintained throughout all her treatment and also presently on monthly Leuprolide and bisphosphonates (now she is receiving monthly Zolendronate instead of Pamidronate). Since she had a response to UFT and she also had severe hepatotoxicity from this drug, we attempted next Capecitabine which was complicated after the second cycle again for hepatotoxicity but with a significant decrease of CA15-3 and CEA. At this point we started her on Vinorrelbine and I wonder if we could try Tomudex as described by Smith et al in the Br J Cancer 74(3), 1996:479-81. Currently her PS is 100%. I wonder if you agree with attempting Tomudex and if you have any experience with cross-reactivity between this drug and UFT/Capecitabine. Secondly, I wonder if you have any clinical trials she may be eligible for or any further suggestions for her care at this point. Thanking you in advance:",
