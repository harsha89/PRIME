Its not even been a year since I found out I had breast cancer, and now I find my self going threw a divorce, My husband can't deal with the cancer. After 10 years together when I need him the most he's not there. I know I can't be the only one going threw this. I really need the support of others that may be going threw the same thing or has been there and done that!!  Thanks I CAN handle breast cancer! I CAN handle THREE occurences of infidility from my wife (that I am aware of), and up until now, I WAS able to deal with her disrespect and accusations that I don't care about her! Everyone at her chuch, her work, and in her personal life really LOVES HER!! All the while, she has treated me with great disrespect and lack of care and encouragement \"behind closed doors\" for nearly 23 years...Self pride is her greatest enemy and I cannot help her!! My wife and I have been married for nearly 23 years. When I met her, she had a son from a privious drug-related relationship that was an infant and I took him as my son and have raised him and our other three children with love, respect, stability, and great dignity. My wife was diagnosed with breast cancer about nine months ago. right away, I closed my own world off (more than usual) and put my attention toward her and the disease. During her first surgery(lumpectomy), I provided flowers, stuffed animals, cards, and stayed right by her side for 48 hours straight without any sleep or self-care. Her nurses seldomly came into our room as I did all of their work in order to be as loving and helpful as I possibly could be. I did the same thing at her less invaisive, 2nd surgery. We have 3 of our four children, ages 23, 18, and 17 in our home for the time being. I am the only one that works outside of the home and I am responsible for 100% of the bills, insurances, finances, land upkeep ( 7 acres), vehicle upkeep, and for trying to sell a 2nd home which is facing foreclosure due to loss of income and and added expenses from cancer and such. Also, I am a disabled veteran. It would take me far too long to actually list everything here! My wife accuses me of not caring and will not talk to me or give love, care, or affection. I don't mind all of the above except she and her close friends and some family, are convinced that I am an uncaring jerk! Truth is, someone has to maintain the employment and pay the bills. I have made it to many of her routine doctor appointments and a great deal of tests. All to a point that my sick leave ballance was far in the negative. All of her nurses and doctors know me.  I am tired all of the time now! Her disrespect and accusations of lack of care have me STRONGLY considering divorce! Not an abrupt one, but one nonetheless.   Key features to consider: -Has never showed appreation for me having taken her son as my own. -Had affairs with my friend, a co-worker, and her son's father. -Before and during cancer has always filled her life with church, church friends, and everything else but me. When I have sincerely asked her to concentrate on our relationship, she tells me I am being self-centered. Huh? -Tried marriage counceling about five times and she is successful at getting the pastor or councelor to concentrate on me, while she escapes any accountability for HER issues. -She's never tried to encouraed me in our marriage and often plays the \"devils advocate.\" -For about 85% of our marriage, she gives conditional love and affection. -I give massages, write poetry, bring flowers, clean around the house, and I listen...I am affectionate and attentive. I work hard, go to church with her and the family, and I make an honest, and reliable income that is above average. -I haven't left her yet because I have always wanted to be up close to my kids. My dad was very distant and his children suffered intensly as a result.   Just wanting folks to see the husbands side to this disease and in need of support! Thank you!",

I forgot to add that I have listened in our home and I hear that she is energetic, playful, socially energizing, and connected until I get home. Then, she becomes sickly, lacking energy, far less communicative, and lacks ambition while I am around. All of my co-workers with the smae or similar cancer diagnosis have come back to work and are regaining their lives back. My wife goes to as many doctors appointments as possible and is \"hyper-religious\" and goes to church frequently and finds great energy for that whole thing...I am trying while this \"relationship\" is dying!!!  ",
