      "Content": "I am 51 and was just diagnosed a week ago with Stage 1.  I've been having mammograms since I was 30 because my mother had breast cancer in her early 30's and again in her late 50's. She had a mastectomy each time and is still alive.  She's in a nursing home due to Alzheimers, so i can't discuss any of this with her or ask her advise.   Now I am trying to decide how to proceed, I am waiting for results to see if I have the breast cancer gene.   Do I just have the lumpectomy and radiation?  Do i have the mastectomy?  Bi-Lateral mastectomy?    I think I have been afraid of this for so many years, is peace of mind worth doing a bi-lateral? Doctor says she feels comfortable that we caught it early and i would probably be fine with lumpectomy and radiation.  But i am afraid that i will be waiting for the shoe to drop again.   How do you make the decision???",

      "Content": "Two weeks ago yesterday I had a bi-lateral mastectomy with reconstruction surgery. I was only in the hospital overnight and home the following afternoon. Had a rough few days with nausea and vomiting but finally called the doctor for anti-nausea med's and that helped. But then the second week I was very sick from stomach cramps and constipation. Stopped taking pain med's because I heard that can cause constipation. Anyway, today was my first day feeling good all day. Am experiencing the sharp phantom pains in my left side only. I still have not slept in my bed though, have been sleeping on my recliner sofa. Tried bed last night and it is still too painful. Anybody know how long before it's not painful to lay flat? I go in two weeks to have more fluid put in my expanders. Not looking forward to that, all that I have read says rather painful afterwards for a few days but I guess with what I have been through the last two weeks it can't be that bad!!",
