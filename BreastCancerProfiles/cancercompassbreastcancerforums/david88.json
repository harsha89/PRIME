    "Content": "hello everyone i am desperately seeking for some help here our family received the bad news from my mother's doctor 2 days ago and she is really having hard time and depressed. she had breast cancer surgery about 2 years ago and she was fine untill now. she took the PET scan<bone scan and ct scan combined> and result came out to be worse than any of us could imagine. The cancer has spread through alot of places and also to bone. Doctor said 1 year is what she expects to live. I am really heardbroken , no word can discribe this. She never had done anything harmful to anyone, she lived her life supporting me and my brother. Now its my turn to support her and save her from this disease. I'm pretty sure alot of people are going through same situation as my mother. I want to know what kind of choices she have and what can me and my family do to save her life. I heard that theres somthing call \"infusion of zometa\" , where can she receive this treatment?",
