    "Content": "I had Er-positive invasive tumor, masectomy right side, no chemo rad after results if DNA test on cancer cells. Was put on Arimidex. I had been taking ERT since my hysterectomy at age 42. I was told it would be the worst case of menopause. I thought I could handle anything but this was a monster that stole my personality. I was told it was estrogen deprivation psychosis. I agreed to try the only drug known to work, Effexor. That turned me ino a zombie. I lost my 17-yr relationship. IAfter 2 1/2 years I was determinded to quit and try to find myself again. They said I couldn\u2019t quit but with support and tapering advice and CBD i was able to do it. I am now 5 years out. The bone pain has become impossibe to luve with so my doctor said to quit the Arimidex to see how I felt. I am hoping my dried up skin and mucous membranes and hair can recover even a little bit. Its been 2 weeks now and the pain is almost gone. I am having slught hot flashes and I feel nwevous and less patient even with my sweet dog. I opt for quality of life over quantity. Anyway 20 year numbers mean little to me as a 76 year old. I would appreciate any comments about symptoms if stopping Arimidex.",
