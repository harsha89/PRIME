      "Content": "I have had pain in both breasts, and under my arms for about 3 weeks now, I went to the doctors and he prescribed me mefenamic acid and said it was nothing only hormonal however I have only taken a couple of the pills so far along with evening primrose oil but I still have the pain, also down my arm and under both arms, I'm not sure if it's because I keep poking around trying to find a lump and the breast tissue is delicate... I'm 16, and havent any history of breast cancer in the family I'm scared though, my mum thinks I'm making a fuss, now I've been to the doctor's she is telling me not to worry I have bad anxiety attacks and I think this increases the pain I also found a very deep set lump that feels like abit grainy in one of my breasts, I know the doctor said there was nothing to worry about but I'm such a hypochonriac!!!! I worry about the slightest thing, I don't think the anxiety is helping either, I also have slightly darker veins on this breast than on the other and it is slightly larger in size with more montgomery glands. I've also had a slight tingling, numb-like sensation in one of my breasts? along with a sore feeling, have i damaged myself? I would like your advice and will really apprechiate it thanks xx",
