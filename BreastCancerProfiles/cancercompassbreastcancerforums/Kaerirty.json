I am still in active treatment /had all sorts of chemo combinations, including taxol, taxotere/ and having some on and off left knee pain for about ten days now. Its ok in the mornings, then starts slowly during the day, especially when I am on my feet for a while, or on high heels. It's like a stabbing ache and when I sit, it gets awkward when I stand up again.Can anyone share their experience with the similar?? And why chemo / if its chemo/ cause us the pain?? Thanks for any advice and input. http://www.brainalin.com/",
