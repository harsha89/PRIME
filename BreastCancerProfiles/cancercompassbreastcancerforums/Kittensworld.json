      "Content": "Thank you for your information, I thought of this , but had not idea of how to get the Doctors to check for fibromyalgia. I had a bone scan and a CT scan as well as MRI but all came back clear. They put me on celerbrex, but that makes my blood pressure go up , so with the scare of viox and heart attachs, well I decieded not to take it. How many years has it been for you now and what type of cancer?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your response. I did have a bone scan and it came back clear, but then I asked the doctor to run a MRI as well because if it was soft tissue then the bone scan would not detect the cancer, he agreeed, I also had a CT scane at the same time to cover all the bases. They put me on celebrex for the pain but it causes my blood pressure to go up and with the latesest scares about these types of drugs I have decieded to deal with the pain, I feel that most of the pain it related to rheumatriod pain more than any thing at this time. I have a TIN unit that I use to interupt the dain on some days. I am so sorry to hear that you have cancer in these areas because I know from my own pain that yours must be hard to deal with. I hope the best for you.",
