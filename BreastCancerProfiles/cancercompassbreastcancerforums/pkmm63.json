I didn't have reconstruction b/c I had read how much trouble some have with the implants. BUT we as human beings do not understand that we can not make things right with ourselves or anyone else! We have to talk to our creator and ask him what lesson can I learn from this? Turn this over to God and ask him to see you through, that's what I did. I was allergic to all the pain killing drugs and had hives all over me from the Morphine! I said Lord you have to ease my pain b/c I can't take the drugs to numb me. Guess what---I had NO PAIN  at all and that is almost unheard of,after a mastectomy.YOU see our trouble is trying to fix it ourself and we can't,so now we have to turn it over to God and TRUST him to fix our MIND,BODY and SOUL. And he will!!! Dr's and nurses are just helping God out by taking care of his children,BUT the real healing take place under God wonderful hands,that he gives so freely to us.All that he ask in return is our faith and trust in him. No bills in the mail ,just your love for him! I will pray for you and ask God to comfort you and see you through it all. Hugs Shirley thank you so much. this reall help me alot. for god is whit us all if we only let him in our heart's and ask him to help us. thank you so so much.  ",
