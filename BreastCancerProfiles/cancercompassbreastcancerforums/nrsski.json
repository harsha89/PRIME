    "Content": "I am 6 years past bilateral mastectomy with recontruction.  About 8 months ago the muscle band over my left breast has been tightening from breast bone to arm pit.  Sometimes it spasms and is quite painful.  My plastic surgeon says that the muscle will need to be released.  Is this a complicated surgery.  My original surgeon is out of network and was wondering if a less qualified Dr in network could do the job with ease.   Don't have much money but hate the painful spasms.",
