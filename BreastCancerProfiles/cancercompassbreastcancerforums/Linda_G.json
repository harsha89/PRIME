      "Content": "Hi Donna, Thank you so much for this encouraging email. My friend is very much concidering Chemo now. I hope she has as much luck as you have had. I have been telling her about all the people who are on Chemo and are having fewer side effects than ever before. I so appreciate your writing. Linda Linda, I have not heard about that new treatment. I have not been sick with any of the treatments. The only thing is being tired. They have so much to give patients for side effects. I am thankful for everyday and if this is what I have to do to have one more day with my family then this is what I need to do. As I said I do not have any side effect, except tired and have a good quality of life. Thanks to my Dr.'s and family. Have your friends family ask her what she wants. If the treatments are to much then she can decide what she wants to do next. With this new treatment I don't know what the side effect are. Donna",

      "Content": "My friend has been told she only has 6 months to live. She was diagnosed breast cancer Dec 2002, underwent surgery to remove 4 lumps and some lymph glands, and then radiation for 20 treatments. Today she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer which has spread to her lungs and her throat. Is anyone else going through anything like this? What treatments are you taking? She and her family do not want conventional chemo and radiation again. For something this bad, will alternatives methods help her? I don\u2019t want to lose this wonderful friend. She does not want to die. Please if you have gone through anything similar write to me. Thank you for your help.",

      "Content": "Hi Donna, Bless you. That's a long time to be undergoing chemo treatments. Have you been very ill with these treatments? Pearl's family doesn't want her to have chemo, but it may be all that can extend her life. I am so afraid for her. They want to try an experimental treatment which was on the news a few weeks ago. I don't know the name of it but she would have to go to Texas for the treatments. Have you heard anything about this? I wish you all the luck in the world and many many more years Donna. Thank you for answering my call. Linda",

      "Content": "Hi Carol, I did find this website. Have you yourself used this product to build the Immune system? My friend will more than likely be having Chemo, but she will need all the support she can get. Can this be taken with chemo treatments? Thanks Linda Hi Linda, Go to GoogleSearch and put in dr.day.com; you will be able to find her website with some effort as this one is not exact. Do find Dr. Lorraine Day's website. You will not be disappointed! Good luck, Carol",
