I was not the one who wrote satanic attack but it sounds as if I interpreted it differently than you and alice did. When we are not the author, we often don't understand the meaning behind certain words. We can take words differently than what someone meant. I did not understand satanic attack to mean breast's comment but rather that very often when God's words are offered, Satan tries to counter those words and undermine God's work! That happens frequently - I have very close friends who are missionaries and dedicating their life to The Lord outside the U.S. The more good they see from the fruits of their labor, the more Satan worked against them. This went on for a year but as we all know, we've read the book and know who wins in the end. Diana Dlynn, The satanic attack quote was indeed not made by you. I was only agreeing with Alice's opinion of the satanic quote responce.  What was said was \"Your comment is negative and not answering Emily's question.  It's merely a satanic attack.\" The comment means what it says.  At best it means satan is working through \"breast.\" My opinion pertains not only to this statement but others that have been made in the past.  Members have left CC because of how their non religious beliefs were delt with.  Something all Christians should keep in mind when responding to believers and non-believer is this. Colossians 4   Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.  And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.  Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.  Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.  Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone. I too am now bowing out of this discussion.  Charles",
