    "Content": "I am new here and at a point where my head is just spinning. I have a Midwife who handles my OB-GYN care.  Lost trust in the doctors where I live and it took my way too long regain trust in the medical field.  Per her request due to a .25 cm lump and some not so good family history I have been through mammogram (both regular and bi-lateral) and ultra sound.  Both showed to be normal, also note I am only 43 years old and have never had children and only weigh in now 102 lbs.  I have lost 6 lbs over the last 2 1/2 months and it wasn't on purpose. She, my doc wanted a biopsy done sends me to a Dr to find out what this mass is.  Dr views my data and checks me and says I want you to come back in 4 months any changes you call me asap.  There is abnormal tissue per him and I'm like okay I guess I wait. Help explain why I am waiting, I am a bundle of nerves, my dentist and hygenist had a stern talking with me about every reason not to wait.  I made an appt with my midwife so we can talk about this.  I was not expecting to walk out of the surgens office with out the biospy being done. Is this normal?  My Aunt was just diagnosed 3 months ago with Ductal Carsamona In Situ stage 0 because of imaging tech.  We live in different cities.",
