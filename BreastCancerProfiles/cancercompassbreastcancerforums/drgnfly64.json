      "Content": "Hi, I am brand new to this website and just came across it in trying to educate myself on my recently diagnosed breast cancer.  Went to get a mammogram after finding a lump.  After a mammogram, an ultrasound, and biopsies of two suspicious \"sites\" on the same day, 2 days later I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 10/26/12.  Could not get in to see my surgeon (had colo-rectal cancer in 2005), until 11/14/2012.  Had a partial mastectomy on 11/30/2012 and just got the path report back on 12/04/2012 which staged the cancer at a Stage II with no lymph node involvement (removed and tested 5).  I spoke with my surgeon today and he has told me who my oncologist will be, said radiation for sure but not sure on chemo yet.  I have to say, I have had to support everyone in my life with their emotional health and now that the treatments will start soon, I feel myself starting to break down with fear of what this might all entail.  I am scared of chemo and radiation as well but am willing to do what it takes.  Do all stage 2 patients have to have chemo or is there some that don't?  The Her2 results and ER results are not back yet so I don't know if I am positive or negative on those receptors.  Any advice or responses are very helpful to me at this time, and any additional reading anyone can recommend would be very helpful to me as well. Thank you and God Bless! Theresa",

      "Content": "Hi Liza, Thank you for your response, I hate what you are going through and pray that it will get better for you!  I just got back from the hospital and there is still no word on whether I am HER2/ER negative or positive.  I see from all the reading I have been doing, that negative is what I should be praying for.  I haven't even heard from my new oncologist yet so am still in the dark in so many ways. I too, wish you the best and will pray for you! Theresa",

      "Content": "I am sorry to hear what you are going through.  I will pray for you.  I am just tired of feeling I am in the dark with all these tests and the waiting is driving me nuts to no end.  I did find out that the 2 tumors are individual masses that grew on their own and 1 did not break off from the other.  I don't know, but that doesn't sound so good to me.  Sigh..... I hope all goes well for you.  And word from a very humorous survivor friend of mine, she started losing her hair, shaved her head and it grew back in curly and lighter in color. I wish you the best!

      "Content": "Update: Saw my surgeon today for post-op exam.  Incisions are healing great.  Small hematoma in the armpit that will resolve itself with the help of moist, warm heat.  Stage 2, Grade 3, 0/5 nodes, ER positive (89%-tumor #1, 99%-tumor #2, PR positive (63%-tumor #1, 99%-tumor #2) Her-2/neu Negative, score 1+ (on both tumors).  Tumor #1 has a Ki-67/High proliferation rate 25% and tumor #2 has a Ki-67/High proliferation rate 40%.  Surgeon says definitely 5-1/2 to 7 weeks of radiation and in his honest opinion believes chemo will be part of the treatment as well as anti-hormonal therapy.  Says it will be a long haul but he know's I can do it (he is my surgeon from previously diagnosed colorectal cancer in 2005).  I went to get my pathology reports from Clarient Diagnostic services that my cancer tissue was sent to in CA. but they were having \"printer issues\" and asked me to come back tomorrow.  Has all the test results on my Oncotype DX and what-not.  15 page report she said. Still scared but staying positive.  Oh, and does anyone have any information concerning pleomorphic infiltrating lobular carcinoma?  That is what they have named it! Thanks for all the responses and support! Theresa",

      "Content": "Jan, Thank you 1000 times over for your response.  I was so relieved to read what you had taken the thoughtful time to type out.  I go back to my surgeon tomorrow, 12/12/12 for my post-op check-up.  He is referring me to a local medical oncologist who has a very good reputation and our cancer center here has a very good reputation for a very caring staff.  My path came back on my nodes and tumors as follows: Glandular/tubular differentiation: 3, Nuclear pleomorphism: 3, Mitotic count: 1.  5 lymph nodes examined.  0 with metastasis.  Tumor size, greatest dimension: 2.1 cm.  Multiple foci of invasive carcinoma.  2 foci examined: sizes of individual foci: 8mm/2.3cm.    The tumors seem to have everyone confused (for a lack of better terms) because both of the tumors have similar histology, having mixed ductal and lobular features.  The invasive pattern is suggestive of lobular carcinoma, but the tumor cells stain positively for e-Cadherin by IHC.  The e-Cadherin stain confirms the presence of lobular carcinoma in-situ extending into the ducts and no DCIS was identified.  I am still waiting for the path results of the HER2/neu hormone receptor tests which I hope will be available to me tomorrow.  I also hope that I will learn more about what treatments are awaiting me.  I know positively that 7 weeks of radiation await me, 5 days a week until complete.  The chemo is still a mystery to me, as I still am waiting the other results and to meet my oncologist. Thank you once again for your caring response and hope that your recovery continues to be a good one! Theresa",

      "Content": "Thumbs up to that idea!  I was newly diagnosed with breast cancer in October, lumpectomy in November and start chemo next week, followed by radiation and Tamoxaphen.  My boyfriend of 3-1/2 years called me out to the parking lot at my workplace this past saturday stating \"I have something I want you to see\", when I walked out he pulled his ballcap off and had shaved his head!  I rubbed his head and cried.  He said \"I wanted to beat you to the punch\"! Good luck to your Mother and your family! God Bless",
