    "Content": "I had a double masectomy in 2012 because of the diagnosis of breast cancer. I did not take chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Instead I opted to take Letrozole pills. I took them for five years along with shots every 6 months to deal with bone density issues. My oncologist suggested that I would be a good candidate to continue taking Letrozole. Eight months into taking the second round I felt so bad that I had to abruptly stop. I felt I would lose the ability to walk and or would die if I continued taking the medication. I could not maintain my balance. I stayed dizzy and light headed. I woke up in the middle of the night with horrible joint pains. I am now a vegan and hope that the change in diet will keep me cancer free and alliviate the terrible symptoms caused by the use of Letrozole. I question whether or not there are side affects to a complete withdrawal from Letrozole after taking it for close to six years.",
