      "Content": "Hi, I had DIEP on September 16, 2009 in Colorado.  My surgeons are wonderful and I believe they are the only team of docs in Colorado who do the surgery.  They are Chris Williams and Jeremy Williams (not related) at Park Meadows Cosmetic Surgery in Lone Tree (a suburb south of Denver).  I am 7 weeks out and so glad I had the surgery!  I had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.  I am scheduled for phase two on December 18.  As far as their success rate, I was told that 1 in 100 flaps are \"lost\" meaning the blood flow cannot be established.  They are super meticulous during surgery to avoid losing a flap.  I highly recommend checking them out.  Not only are they very educated and well trained but they are nice guys!",

      "Content": "I had lipo suction during my phase two DIEP Flap surgery.  I had it in four spots - on the sides of each breast and on my hips, at each end of the abdominal incision.  My doc told me he removed maybe a 1/4 pound of fat from each spot, so only one pound total. It has been 5 months since the second surgery and I can definitley tell where the lipo was done.  It looks great!  It is amazing that removing a relatively small amount of fat can make such a difference. I went in thinking I would have nipple reconstruction but my cosmetic surgeon made the decision to give me a breast lift (and do the lipo) instead.  I am thrilled with the results of that, too.  He wanted to wait until all the swelling from the lift was gone before he did the nipple reconstruction.  It is an in-office procedure, using local anesthetic.  I have just been too busy to schedule it, but I am not nervous about it at all.  Plus, it's kind of nice not having to worry about nips showing through shirts if I don't want to wear a bra!",

      "Content": "Hi, I had DIEP reconstruction in September 2009 after a bilateral mastectomy.  I too had hard lumps along the abdominal scar, although I didn't get any in the breasts.  My surgeon told me to massage the lumps as much as possible, but when it was time for the second phase surgery in December 2009, the lumps were still there.  The surgeon removed them during the second surgery and told me they were \"consistent with fat necrosis.\"  It is now 8 months after the first surgery and I have no more lumps.  Perhaps discuss with your surgeon to see if he will remove them...?  I assume the lump in your breast could also be fat necrosis.  I wish you luck!  I am very happy with my results and would be happy to discuss my experience with others.",

It is a long surgery (mine took 12 hours) but it would be even longer if the docs did it alone.  Each one works on a breast so it takes a lot less time.  While in the hospital (3 nights) I did not have a lot of pain.  I had a pump with pain meds but only used it once, mostly because I was curious :).  I had 4 drains.  3 came out at 2 weeks and 1 stayed in for 5 weeks.  To be honest, they bugged me more than anything else because I couldn't sleep on my sides.  I am very happy with the tummy tuck part of the surgery!  It's amazing how much better I look.  My breasts feel soft and if there weren't scars no one would be able to tell I had a mastectomy.  The breasts are a bit larger than I would have liked, although I am reserving final judgement on that until after phase two, when they will do some re-shaping and nipple reconstruction.  I had very large breasts (DD) before and as part of the mastectomy/reconstruction I had a reduction.  They are now C cups (I had hoped for B but am still very happy with the huge change).  I would absolutely do the whole thing again.  It wasn't easy, but a few weeks of soreness were worth the new body and no implants!  Feel free to ask questions!",
