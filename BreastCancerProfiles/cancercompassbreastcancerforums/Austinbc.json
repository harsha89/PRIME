    "Content": "As someone who was also diagnosed with hormone receptor negative breast cancer, I can relate to your post. First, it's not the death sentence it seems. There is much research being done on triple negative (meanning ER-, PR-, HER2-) breast cancer. All the news about Herceptin had many hormone positive women feeling left out. Now all the news about aromotase inhibitors (AIs) have the other half feeling the same way. This is how research news affects those of us who have been diagnosed. Much of the news is disseminated to patients in the form of poorly translated PR releases. An excellent example is a current article that CancerCompass currently has on their newsletter site. The article about research on the possible effect of caffeine on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers is misinterpreted. That \"study\" is a preliminary observation and the findings apply only to BRCA1 carriers, not BRCA2 as stated in the article. I don't know who is \"vetting\" the dissemination of news for CancerCompass, but they certainly need to do a better job. It's discouraging to see research being misinterpreted and reported. Please understand that you're not left out in the cold. Existing treatments can still be very effective. There is an ongoing need for better understanding of cancer features. It's an exciting time in the world of breast cancer research. Each body is different and responds differently to therapy. If you haven't read Stephen J. Gould's wonderful essay, \"The Median Is Not the Message\", I highly recommend it. Just Google it.",
