    "Content": "Hello - I am so happy to find this group. I am 34 yrs old was DX with invasive, ++- breast cancer a few months ago. I had a very easy experience with lumpectomy, a very bearable experience with 6.5 weeks of radiation and now a terrible experience with hormone therapy. I did 2 shots of Lupron and never started the AI. I felt so awful - horrible depression and anxiety. I have been on Lexapro very successfully for years and it was as if the Lupron completely overpowered the Lexapro - and me! I am now taking a break. Â Does anyone have any experiece with a bad start on Lurpon and later being able to tolerate and/or a bad start on Lupron but later being OK with Tamoxifin? I worry that the estrogen drop (not the Lupron) was my problem and I am going to have the same issue when I try Tamoxifin. Thanks all!!",
