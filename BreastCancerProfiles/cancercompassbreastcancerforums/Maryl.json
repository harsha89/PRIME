      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer and received my first dose of 5 FU on July 15th, 11 days later I was admitted to the hospital due to severe toxic reaction to the 5 FU, I was diagnosed with grade 4 (4 being the most severe level) - grade 4 leukopenia, thrombocytopemia, stomasitis, mucocitis, and diarrhea. I was in the hospital for 13-days, do not remember anything of the first week. My family was told I may not make it and supportive care was offered. Needless to say I did make it, however 4-weeks later I am still unable to what I had done prior to chemo due to fatigue. I was informed following this episode that it is very rare and they had never seen this type of reaction, and that I apparently had a deficiency in an enzyme called DPD which makes my body unable to metabolize the 5FU. Upon further research I found that approx. less than 5% of the population has this deficiency and those that do have had toxic reactions to 5FU, including death. I also found out there is a test for this enzyme, but was told by my oncologist it is not the standard of practice to test for DPD? I do highly recommed anyone who is about to recieve 5FU discuss with your physician the effects of DPD and 5FU, the odds are in your favor you will not have this deficiency since less than 5% of the population does, but I can assure you if you are in that 5% you do not want to have 5FU, I am truely very lucky to be alive today. I would be very interested in hearing from anyone who has had or knows someone who has had this reaction to 5FU.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I cannot e-mail you apparently this website reads all the messages and edits out e-mail addresses this is what it said after you wrote e-mail me at ... \"Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed. Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.ht Kind of silly, but we can talk through this. How is you breast cancer, any other problems with the colon? I start chemo again on Monday 9/26 will be getting doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. I am still afraid of what could happen, but this time I did research both of the meds and did not find anything that would indicate this enzyme deficiency has any effect on these meds, so I expect it will be as bad as before, I really want to get going with it. I had an MRI on my brain last week and they found and area in the back of my head, said it could be MS or some type of tumor, the neurologist thinks it is a lymphoma, but we have to rule out MS, so he did a spinal tap last week, still waiting for the results, then I saw the neurosurgeon yesterday, he says he doesn't want to do anything with it now, wants to do another mri in a month. Thanks again for responding, hope you are doing well. Mary",
