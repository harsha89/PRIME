    "Content": "Hi, I had a lumpectomy last Jan followed by 6.5 weeks of radiation.  I am now taking Femara with the usually side effects but about 8 weeks ago I started experiencing pain under my left breast in the rib area (same side as the bc).  As a precaution my doctor sent me for a bone scan which is negative but still no diag for this pain.  Anyone out there with a similar situation?  Thanks",
