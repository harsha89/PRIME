After a mastectomy and removal of \"speck\" of cancer with no lymph node involvement, I wonder the same. Blood pressure and blood sugar are slowly rising and it scares me. Will all the things this drug does to me kill me faster than that cancer ever would? How many more drugs will I have to take to counter act it's effects? The oncologist says it's my choice but I have to wonder if this isn't their standard procedure because this is what they do - give cancer meds. Every morning, I feel worse and worse when I get out of bed and only start to feel somewhat normal toward the end of the day (when it's time to take the drug again). The oncologist says taking this drug will give me a 10% greater chance of keeping the cancer at bay. Seems excessive to me and I don't think that number is accurate. Again, I feel like she is \"pushing\" unnecessarily because that is her job. I am hating what's happening to my quality of life - along with all the extra aging factors that will come with this eventually. I am 64 and every day feel older and older. Just don't know what to think or feel anymore either.",
