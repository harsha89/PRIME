      "Content": "I had my 1st chemo treatement Wednesday.  Steroids kept me up the 1st night couldn't sleep.  Then the 2nd day woke up vomiting.  The 2nd day was soooooooooo hard every cell in my body was crying for help.  It was hard to eat and sleep.  Plus the pain from the white blood cell count has my neck in horrible pain.  I'm a very positive person, but found myself thinking I don't know how I can even handle 7 more of these treatments.  Minutes of the day drag by with just trying to get thru the day.  I'm so sensitive to medication I typically just need 1/2 of the dose of any medicine previously prescribed before chemo.  How can I convince my oncologist I don't need such a strong dose of chemo and steriods?  I don't know how I'm going to go on with the treatements.  I'm a single mom with a 20 year old son who is helping me as much as he can.  Thank God he is home from school and can help me during some of my treatments.  How can I stay positive that I'm doing the right thing?  HELP!",

      "Content": "I have breast cancer and completed my 1st A/C chemo treatment about 1 1/2 ago.  I'm experiencing blood in my urine and very thirsty.  I have been trying to keep the blood in urine at bay by drinking a lot of water/gatorade.  If I don't then I start seeing blood in my urine.  I received antibiotics for what the doctor thought might be an infection 3 days ago. Anyone experience this and if so what did you find out what to do?  Should I take cranberry pills? Please HELP!!",
