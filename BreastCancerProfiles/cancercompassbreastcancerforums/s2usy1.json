      "Content": "How very sad and traumatic for you. When my Dad was diagnosed with bowel cancer back in 1999, I was so totally shocked and in denial that I too \"went off the rails\" somewhat.  I started going out all the time and drinking excessively.  I was traumatised within, and yet was unable to discuss my dads cancer with him.  His cancer had spread to his liver and was in his blood, but I could not talk to him about it, despite us being the closest Father and daughter there was.  It was only when he was so desperately ill towards the end and was diagnosed with 8 weeks to live, that I finally faced everthing, and spent every single day and night from thereon at his side.  I did all I could to make up for the time I had spent avoiding him, and was with him, holding his hand as he took his last breath. To this day, I am ridden with guilt that I did not do more for him and did not face his ordeal with him during his final year of life.  Our closeness was in my mind, the reason for my distance at this critical time, and I can therefore, somewhat appreciate what your son is going through - he is simply so distraught and traumatised by what is happening to his precious Mum that he simply cannot face the facts. He needs counselling, and support.  Are there no family members that can help him through this? You both need as much support and help that you can get - I truly feel for you all - and wish you the very best of luck with your ongoing fight    ",

      "Content": "About a week ago, whilst looking in the mirror, I noticed a very prominent and raised vein, which runs across the top of my nipple.  It looked like a varicose vein, and I started rubbing it and thought no more of it. The next morning when I looked in the mirror, the vien had disappeared, and in its place a blueish red patch was appearing, rather like a bruise. This has gradully grew quite large, and has the appearance of a massive bruise, it has gone typically coloured like a bruise, yellow/blue, purple, and there is now a hard lump developed in the place where the vein was! I can actually pick the lump up in the skin of my breast, i.e. it does not seem to be attached to the breast muscle. II went to the Doctor, and he said it looked like I had had a breast trauma, and the lump was most probably dead tissue or a haematoma. However as my Mum passed away to breast cancer four years ago there is obviously more cause for concern. I am having a mammogram this Thursday and was wondering if anyone else had ever experienced anything like this? I have read a little about fat necrosis following trauma to the breast, and am praying and hoping that this is all it is.... P.s. My Mum was 71 when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer, and she passed away at 76",

      "Content": "I pray for your Mums soul, and your well being too. Lost my Mum to  cancer in March 2004. Miss her as much today as I do every single day since the day she died, but with smiles and happy memories now.  My Mum lasted just under four years, but had a good quality of life during her illness, until her last six months. She died of sheer malnutrition and exhaustion. Her cancer never metastisised elsewhere, but the cancer cells made her so ill, she was unable to eat or drink in her last six weeks of life. I wish you well, I wish you peace and I wish the awful memories of your recent times will gradually be replaced by happier memories of times before cancer got a grip on your Mum.  God bless. Losing a Mum is like losing your right arm, only 100 times worse!!",
