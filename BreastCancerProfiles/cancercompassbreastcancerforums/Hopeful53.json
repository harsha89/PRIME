Here is what I am looking for. My mother is 73 and has just been diagnosied with metaplastic spindle cell carcinomia. She will have her first appointment with the oncoligist this week and I want to ask the right questions as far as treatments that have been working, what she should expect and things like that. Also, should she get a second opinion? She had several biopsies with the same doctor. It is pretty scary to hear that it is rare and yet see that it is such a treatable cancer. I just want to make sure to ask the right questions from people that have learned from experience. Again I pray for all that have to deal with this and thank you for any and all help. I do not have any advice for you, but wanted to stay connected to anyone who has or is experiencing this type of breast cancer. I have just been diagnosed with spindle cell carcinoma today. I am waiting for my referral to the cancer clinic where I will find out more about this rare form of cancer. Does anyone know why or how this type of cancer develops? What are the survival rates? Are there varying types of spindle cell carcinoma? What are the chances of daughters getting the same type of cancer? I think more needs to be said about this kind of cancer. Women need to be made aware of it just as recently, inflammatory breast disease was brought out by the media.",
