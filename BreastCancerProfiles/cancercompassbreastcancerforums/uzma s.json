She felt it and was startled at the size, so she started trying to capture it - at one point she said got it - but then moved and it was lost - she brought in the radiologist who then felt the lump, looked puzzled and attempted to find it.. no luck - so i was sent home with an ALL CLEAR come back in a year and a pamplet on dense breast tissue. Is there a chance that this was not picked up on the ultrasound because it is hidden under the muscle? or just a phantom lump that can be felt not seen? no one seems to be worried but me. Since finding it, i am now having pains which shoot from the area of the lump into the breast and nipple area, over the last week i have started to feel extremely tired, edgy due to the pain just below my left shoulder blade and wraping around the left rib cage to just under my breast and as of today .. i have this nagging uncomfortable pain between the shoulder blades...my husband has even started asking me if i am ok inside. Am i just being paranoid - i do not wanna go for more tests and made to feel like i am being a hypochondriac. i cannot see a specialist unless my primary refers me - so how do i get him to send me to specialist when he states..  the radiologist says you are clear for another year. please help Hi Cyndy, It's been almost 5 yrs since you felt this discomfort. I hope you are fine now. Unfortunately, I am having 100% same situation right now from 03 days. I will be visiting the doctor soon.  When I searched my symptoms yor post came on top of the result. I wanted tot know if everything is fine till now. Looking forward to hear from you soon. Many thanks, Uzma Shakeel",
