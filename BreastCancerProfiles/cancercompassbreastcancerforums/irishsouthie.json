      "Content": "Dear fighter 786, My wife's oncologist fought for my wife to receive opdivo as a compassionate case. Since she has received all the latest chemo drugs with no success and since her platelets were below 100 and no chance of getting into any clinical trials, she is considered a compassionate  case.  The cost for each dose of opdivo is $20,000. Opdivo is taken twice a month. We had a benefit to raise money. The night of the benefit, thre drug company called and said they would pay for the drug. My wife has been on opdivo since the first of December. We are just beginning to see small encouraging results. My advice is to have your oncologist see if your dad qualifies as a compassionate case and if opdivo would work for him. Keep me posted on what happens. We are praying that the Lord give you and your dad peace and comfort during this ordeal.  Irish Southie",

      "Content": "My wife has tried all the latest chemo drugs with no positive results. Her ONCOLOGIST started to look for alternative treatments. Opdivo was suggested. My wife is considered a compassionate case. She is receiving two treatments a month. So far she has had no side effects. We were told that we would see some results after eight treatments. My wife has had three treatments so far. Are there other stage 4 breast cancer patients doing this drug? If so, I would like to know how Opdivo is working for you.   ",
