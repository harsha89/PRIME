For a number of reasons; mainly diagnostics, I did not start Arimidex until 7/17/08. I tripped and fell on my right side 2 weeks ago. No pain or stiffness in the first 2 days and felt just fine. Now, almost 3 weeks out, I have terrible pain underneath my whole right breast, underarm and chest wall. At first I wanted to blame it on the fall. I called oncologist who referred me back to oncology surgeon (appt on 10/27).  You know how your mind starts to wonder.. I then start to think it is bone mets. (I was dcis with no lymph involvement; but you still get worried they missed something). After reading these posts, I am beginning to think it IS the drug, not my imagination, not my trip/fall. It hurts on inhalation (although not like pneumonia pain which I have had). It hurts to touch breast or rib cage.  I have my left breast adjustment surgery and nipple reconstruction Nov.6th and just want to put this stuff behind me, but now with the pain, I will always be thinking mets.  ",
