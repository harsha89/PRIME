    "Content": "A friend of mine who has mesenchymal chondrosarcoma has asked me to research possible treatments. I have done a search of PubMed and the U.S. clinical trials database, but am interested in finding alternatives. Could you please suggest where I can locate legitimate alternative treatments, other sources of information in U.S. and abroad, and other patients and their families, who might have ideas on new treatments? Thank you very much. Dan",
