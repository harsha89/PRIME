It is nice to know there are folks out here who are willing to share and support each other.  What a blessing to have discovered this message board! I am also new to this site. My Lumpectomy is next week and I have many questions about which bra to purchase. There are so many types and styles to choose from. Cotton, spandex, front closure, back closure, front snaps, front zipper, racerback, wide straps, pull over, low impact, medium impact? I have found a few 2 - 3 packs at Walmart, but I'm confused. Can someone please suggest which one?  Thank you.",
