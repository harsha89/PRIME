      "Content": "Did your oncologist offer you an oncotype dx test using the breast tissue removed during surgery? the test is used to determine the likelihood of the same cancer reoccurring in your breast and if chemo would be beneficial in treating your cancer..also..you didn't mention if there was cancer in any of your lymph nodes..or if your treatment consisted of chemo or radiation or both...I am doing 30 radiation treatments..cancer in one lymph mode..had lumpectomy..scored 9 on oncotype dx test so didn't have to do chemo...oncologist has recommended Arimidex hormonal treatment for five years but I'm not sure I will do it...I already have joint pain and sure don't need anymore...would love to hear the treatment your doctors have planned for you in case mine comes back...will keep you in my prayers..",
