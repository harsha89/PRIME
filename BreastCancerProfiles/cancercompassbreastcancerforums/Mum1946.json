I had NO history of BC in my family either.  Just to ease your mind, get them to do a needle biopsy.  Don't expect them to take you seriously, I am so totally fed up with Oncologists.  One even had the nerve to tell me that \"For heaven's sake it is only DCIS, not your heart\".  Made me feel like an idiot.   I guess you have to be really cancerous to get their attention.  If it is a fatty tumor, then at least you have peace of mind. DO NOT LET THEM MESS AROUND with your life.  I am due for a check up, but probably will not go. It is not worth the demeaning attitude of these so called Dr.s.    ",

The hot flashes were terrible so someone recommended Black Cohosh. I have been taking it twice a day for the last month and I have to admit that it really  has helped. It hasn't stopped the hot flashes totally but it has significantly cut them by about 70%. One additional side effect that has occured lately is swollen ankles. Not always but some days are better. Has anyone else had this. I'd be curious to find out if it's just me or the meds. Thanks for listening. Barb G After 3 years, the hot flashes have not gotten better, but I am determined to take the Arimidex.  I am getting better results taking 1200 IU of Vit E daily. Black cohosh caused headaches.  The swollen ankles come and go, it does not seem to be tied to diet or anything like that.  The swelling will last about 3-4 days then go away, only to show up again.  Has anyone taking Arimidex experienced pain throughout the body, feels like blood veins are aching, last a few minutes and then always followed by hot flash with profuse sweating?",

Hope we're not all going to have them forever!! good luck with yours. Mogal  I was prescribe fish oil 2400 grams or however it is measured per day.  This was a joint decision with a neurologist and my oncologist.  No ill effects at all.",
