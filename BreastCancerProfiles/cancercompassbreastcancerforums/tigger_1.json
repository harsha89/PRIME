      "Content": "had radical breast cancer surgery, last year the final reconstructive part of the surgery was 1 week before christmas last year. the question i have is why do i still feel alone and sometimes feel like a freak, for lack of better words. when will i start to feel normal and/or like my self again.still feel like crying but not as much as i had in the past few months. feel like i need to talk to someone that has went through the same thing. i'm really new at this and don'treally know if i'm doing the right thing ,but am willing to try and talk with someonethis way  ",
