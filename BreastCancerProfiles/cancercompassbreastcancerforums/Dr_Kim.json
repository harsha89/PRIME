      "Content": "Recent posted messages to this site has made it apparent that many individuals are seeking guidance about the efficacy of MGN-3. Here's my take on it: MGN-3 is a product that has been touted to enhance immunity. While I haven't seen any independent studies specific to the product, I have reviewed test tube and animal studies that prove that the cancer fighting compounds found in the product (glucans extracted from mushrooms, algae, and some grains) have demonstrated the ability to boost immune system response by increasing the activity of IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor. Sounds promising! In my clinical practice, I have observed individuals that have received positive benefits from taking this product. Although I haven't read of reported toxicity or negative side effects associated with the product, I have observed some people get an unexplained rash. For that reason, I typically do not recommend mushroom extracts for individuals who might have intolerances or allergies to molds or yeasts. And, if someone has been diagnosed with candiasis (yeast infection), I have them avoid these kinds of products as well. Cost, as well, is an issue. There are less expensive ways to boost immunity. One of the key things to remember when supplementing your diet with immune stimulators is the rule of synergism. As with anything, a variable approach to fighting cancer naturally just makes good sense. One supplement may aid immunity, but are you supporting healthy cell rebuilding? protecting healthy cells? decreasing your risk of toxicity, etc.? I recommend seeking guidance to cover all of your nutritional bases and to ensure that you are doing everying necessary to achieve optimal results with your nutrition program.

      "Content": "Dear Mary, I'm very glad that you wrote to Cancer Treatment Centers of America with your question. I say that because your question elicits a response that I believe all cancer patients need to hear. As many as 81% of all cancer patients take some form of diet or diet supplement therapy, and most (based on my clinical experience over the past 11 years) have told me that they are confused by the conflicting and overwhelming amount of nutrition information that is out there. Many people begin to self-prescribe their own nutrition regimens. While I believe strongly in proactive nutrition and supplemental therapy for cancer patients, I feel just as strongly that: 1) Doctors should be immediately informed of any changes to the diet or supplements that you are taking. Why? If you develop a reaction (skin rash, pain in joints, etc.) from taking a particular supplement, you would most likely report those symptoms to your doctor, who (not knowing of your supplement usage) might attribute them to treatment toxicity and pull you off of your current chemotherapy or radiation treatments, delay surgery, or treat you with unnecessary medications. You need to communicate to your doctor all that you do so that he or she can best help you recover. 2) Guided nutritional therapy is critical, especially in this world of fast, market savvy information about nutrition. Taking too many supplements and herbs (some of which can interfere with prescription medications or interact with each other), consuming an unsafe or ineffective dosage, or taking the wrong form of a nutrient may delay your recovery and defeat your purpose for beginning a nutrition regimen. Additionally, many dietary supplements are manufactured and sold under the guise of evidence-based medicine and they are nothing more than expensive cure-all promising products that deliver hype and a hefty bill to your door. I recommend that you find a qualified health care professional in your area that has a background both in cancer and nutrition. Or, if you are interested, telephone consultations with oncology nutritionists at Cancer Resource Center 800.940.2882 are available for a fee. These one-hour sessions will guide you about which foods and supplements are safe and effective for your situation. For those individuals who prefer the self-guided approach, my book Challenge Cancer and Win! provides diet and vitamin plans for sixteen different cancers, and includes information on a number of accessory dietary supplements like Essiac tea and shark cartilage. Because I don't know enough about your individual health situation to make judgements about the supplements you are taking (nor do I know dosages or your particular usage of each), I can't comment on the safety or efficacy of your plan. I can, however, tell you that based on my experience and your list, I believe you probably are taking ineffective dosages or hyped up products. My final advice is: before heading to the health food store, check with a professional. Invest wisely in your health and future!

      "Content": "Dear Tommy, IP-6 and MGN-3 are dietary supplements that have reported immune-stimulating benefits. But that is where the similiarities stop. IP-6 is derived from a fiber component known as phytic acid and there have been several impressive anticancer effects demonstrated on animals using this product. MGN-3 is made from maitake and rice bran. Although I've seen product/consumer literature on MGN-3 touting its benefits, I have not seen scientific studies conducted on that particular product. It is my belief that there is no one \"magic\" bullet against cancer. You should aim to stimulate immunity and protect cells with a number of dietary supplements and foods. I would suggest seeking counsel as to the most effective dietary supplements based on your individual needs. Cancer Resource Center, 800.940.2822 offers such services.

      "Content": "Dear Moira, Every cancer patient I talk with is curious about the efficacy or danger of taking antioxidants during cancer treatment, so I thought I'd send out a written response with the hope that many people can benefit from your question! The latest research informs us that up to 80% of all cancer patients take dietary supplements, either on their own initiative or on the advice of a health care provider. The controversial question is: Should cancer patients take dietary supplements during treatment? There are some studies that hypothesize if you take antioxidants during treatment you may decrease the effectiveness of the treatment. However, the majority of animal and test tube studies show that supplementation during treatment may help recovery, well being, immune stimulation, and reduce side effects. A small human study, for example, found women taking 400 mg of CoQ10 during Adriamycin treatment had 20% less heart damage than women only taking Adriamycin. Other supplements like vitamin C,E and omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) have been effective in protecting healthy cells from radiation. Other studies suggest that antioxidants are NOT counterproductive to standard cancer treatments! Some dietary supplements are based on hype and clever marketing strategy. Without education about these supplements, you could be wasting your money, time and effort and possibly hinder your recovery. Essiac tea, for example, is touted as a tea that kills cancer cells. No research to show it, only anecdotal evidence. I will say that in some situations, I do recommend it for some patients, usually those who are getting radiated to the chest or pelvic area. The herbs within Essiac have mucilaginous properties and may help coat and soothe the GI tract. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America, we believe that nutritional therapy, including the use of dietary supplements, is one of the most powerful tools you have to help you recover from cancer. Ultimately, you will have to decide about whether or not you should use dietary supplements. I would urge you to have a conversation with your physician about this. The more your doctor knows about your cancer-fighting regimen, the better he or she will be able to help you. If you intend on taking the supplements, I would suggest you seek professional guidance. My book, Challenge Cancer and Win! can also provide you with specific information about dietary supplements for certain cancers and contains scientific research studies to back up supplement recommendations. Best of luck, Kim Dalzell, PhD, RD, LD Director, Holistic Nutrition Services Author, Challenge Cancer and Win! www.challengecancer.com",

      "Content": "Dear Nancy, Symptoms you describe make me think you may have lymphedema. There are natural ways to manage and prevent lymphedema. I found a wonderful website at www.lymphnet.org that will provide you with tips for reducing the swelling through moderate exercise, massage and nutritional therapies. There are many herbs that act as natural diuretics, including dandelion, that might be helpful to you. In addition, anti-inflammatory natural supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, bromelain may help reduce swelling. If you need additional information on natural therapies for prevention of breast cancer recurrence, contact Cancer Resource Center at 800.940.2822 and ask for their free nutritional packet of information.
