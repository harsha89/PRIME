Its been a few years now since she was diagsnosed with stage 1 lobular cancer. she was put on tamoxifin and had a double mastectomy...awhile later she returned to show 3 spots on her liver. the doctors read them out as hemangiomas. three months later she came back, she had full blown mets in her liver. just telling that makes me so angry...anyways, back to it. she did the minimal chemo, she believes in organic foods, good nutrition, supplements, alterative treatments. to say the least chemo made her feel horrible and she felt horrible putting that into her body. so she began alternative options and  started to lose support from the conventional docotrs which is a whole other story, that also frustrates me...well she did her own treatments, and felt great, looked great, sounded great...but 5 weeks ago she had a CT and it is progressing, so she agreed to go on femara. now she feels horrible, the pain is intense, her belly is bloated, and i feel so helpless....not to mention scared. i feel sometimes like the anger is overwhelming these days. why my mom, why any of us? why is it so hard to find a good doctor? why is life so unfair?   Any advice out there would be much apprecitate So sorry to hear about your mother.  I am 38 and battling colon cancer that has spread to my lungs.  First of all, it's not fair.  It really isn't.  Why do bad things happen to good people?  I think that is a question of faith not for the medical fields.  I sounds like your mother is strong willed and has made decisions base on her beliefs and information she has found.  Unfortunately with cancer, it is not predictable.  Maybe if she followed the doctors advise she may have not have have the good health she enjoyed for awhile before it returned.  No one could tell her what she should have done and could guarantee anything, they could only advise.  People tell me that miracles can happen and that I can look forward to that because it has happened with some people.  I don't know why I would be chosen for a miracle when others are not.  I am not any sort of special person.  I can only hope that my decisions will either buy me more quality time with my family, or possibly put the cancer in remission.  I pray for healing too, but don't know it is God's will or not.  Some things are out of our hands unfortunately.  A strong failth in God though keeps me going and even though I may lose this fight, I have the hope of being remembered by God in his kingdom he has promised in the scriptures.  I don't want to sound preachy but this is what helps me to continue to fight. The chemo with a good solid nutritional diet sounds like a balance way to fight this.  This is what I am doing now.  Sounds like you mother is more than likely doing this too.  Hang in there and be a good support for her. God Bless, Jeff",
