    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage IV lobular in Oct. 07.  I'm doing very well!  My treatment was different from yours.  Everyone seems to be different, but now I take Arimidex daily and Fosamax weekly.  Yes, I, too, have been told I can live for years with this and I feel fine.  I would love to hear from someone who is further out from diagnosis than I am.",
