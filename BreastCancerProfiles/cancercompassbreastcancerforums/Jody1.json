    "Content": "I had Taxol in 2007 and radiation in January 2008 for breast cancer ... at the end of radiation my feet developed a strange sensation like I was walking on pebbles.  That left in a few weeks and I was left with razor-like pains in my big toes and bunion area which never left.  I take 4 to 6 Gabapentin 600mg pills a day to keep the pain bearable.  Gabapentin is generic for Neurontin.  Finger tips still numb, I can't thread a needle, but there is no pain.  I take a B complex vitamin but dont think it helps.  Good luck. My pain will probably be forever.  Hope you have better luck.",
