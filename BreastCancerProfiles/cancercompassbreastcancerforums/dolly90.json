      "Content": "Dear Britt, i'm so sorry to hear your story. However lets look on the bright side. I'm a mum  with stage iv for the last eight years, originally dignosed 20 years ago. Sadly I also cared for my husband who died with lung cancer last year. So I have experience cancer from both side of the fence. For my husband, myself and our only child (age 19 ). 8 years ago life became all about the three of us spending as much quality time together and always living in \"the moment\". Life holds many surprises and we can't always legislate for what will happen. Take each day as it comes and keep you mind free from distraction to take in medical advise. Breast cancer treatments have advanced and many people live full lives with stageiv. So I wish all your family well on this journey. There are many inspiring stage iv stories on www.breastcancer.org All my care Dolly",
