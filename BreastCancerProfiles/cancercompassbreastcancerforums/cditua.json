      "Content": "Hello all. I am charles from Lagos Nigeria. My mother has stage 4 breast cancer, it has spread to her lungs and she has this dry cough. Its really sad because here in this part of the world, top notch medical care is a luxury. We want to start chemotheraphy as soon as possible, we are also looking at this supplement \"Carnivora\" has anyone heard of it? I have read a lot of reviews about people who have used it and they have been able to cure their cancer, though some advance stages require maintenance usage of this supplement. Any suggestions on what to do? The dry cough is making things worse, she can't sleep well at night. Any ideas would be appreciated",

      "Content": "I do need any information I can lay my hand on right now. My mum has stage 4 BC. Doctors here are so slow and un responsive in taking care of her. It makes my stomach churn. We live in Nigeria which makes things a little difficult. She has this dry cough, so its probably spread to her lungs, she also has a small cyst in her liver. I hate seeing her cough so much, is there anything I can get for her now that can alleviate or reduce the intensity of her cough. E are going in for biopsy tomorrow. Nothing was given for the cough except for the pain which was morphine. Please suggestions are welcome. I need to arm myself before I next see her doctor. The doctors are something else to write about...",

      "Content": "We had an xray done of her chest and based on her medical history what we sa there made the doctors suggest its stage 4. I have read about symptoms about people who have stage 4 and it fits with what she has. Her cough is not what over the counter medications can cure. Unfortunately its something much more than that. I appreciate your concern but really I do know what I am talking about. Please people are there any known natural remedies that when used with chemotherapy can go a long way?",
