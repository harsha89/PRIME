    "Content": "I too have been on Femera, and experiencing the same bone, muscle pain plus severe nausea.  My onc does't want to take me off it. Could there be a monetary reason?  What would or could happen if I arbitrarily stoped taking it? I heard some patients respond to the pain by injesting marijuana.  Has anyone else heard of this method and/or  if it works?",
