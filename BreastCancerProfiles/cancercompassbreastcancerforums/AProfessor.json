I'm 48 and I haven't been diagnosed with cancer for years ago I had precancer cells and ended up with a partial hysterectomy. For the last 3-6 months I've had pain and pressure in my vagina and now a smell that smells like someone with cancer. No stds . I'm scared about the odor and the pain. My doctor is starting slow urine test. Can anyone help?My wife has similar symptoms as you are describing. She had a partial hysterectomy in 2013 but now has an unforgettable odor when she exhales. It is the distinct smell of sweet but sickly smell. It is not of rotting flesh but more of sickly yet sweet. It is hard to describe as it is not an odor that we smell normally, the closest I can come to describing it, is that it is like an aldehyde smell or like a glycol mixture. She also leaks from her Vigina that the doctors ran a bladder pressure test but found nothing to be concerned about. Originally, they suggested that it might be a fistula that developed between the reconstruction after the hysterectomy and the bladder while healing--suggested that the organs and reconstructed walls grew together and created vein like growths that now allow urine to leak. They suggested that she have another operation to place a sling on her bladder but have not suggested cancer. I am worried that is cancer and thus am searching sites like this thread.",
