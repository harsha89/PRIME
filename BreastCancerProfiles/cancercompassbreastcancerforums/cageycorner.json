      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in August. I had a lumpectomy in September. I have just had my second chemo treatment AC. After the first chemo treatment my white blood cell count dropped to 1,8 so I was given a series of three neupogen injections, one a day. The pain in my joints--knees, shoulders, jaws, and even in my head were nearly unbearable by the fourth day. About 3-4 days after the final injection of neupogen I developed numbness in the left side of my lower face and jaw. No one seems concerned but me. Did anyone else have a similar side effect? What did your doctor or nurse tell you?",

      "Content": "My rheumatologist has been tracking the calcium level in my blood for five years. It is always slightly elevated. I had a bone scan which showed osteopenia. He started me on fosamax. I finished treatments for breast cancer in March. I went to my oncologist this week for blood workup. He wants me to return next week to recheck my blood because of the elevated calcium level. I have been looking on the internet today and it appears that there may be a link between hyperathyroidism and cancer. Has anyone else had the two conditions? ",

      "Content": "I completed my last chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer three weeks ago. This time I elected not to take the neupogen injections so that I would not feel so bad over Christmas. My WBC is up to 3.0.  I have developed aching pain in my sit bones--pelvic bones. Has anyone else experienced this? What causes it? What can you do besides take pain killers?    ",
