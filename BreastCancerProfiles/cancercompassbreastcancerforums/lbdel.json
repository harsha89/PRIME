      "Content": "Tomslady, Keep your chin up!  This dreaded disease makes you feel and say things that never would have entered your mind prior to diagnosis.  My friends have been telling me to look forward to a \"new normal.\"  Move life forward and say goodbye to the old normal because after a breast cancer diagnosis, life becomes abnormal during the  treatment period (which can be as long as a year for some people) and then you settle into a \"new normal.\"  I'm looking for what my \"new normal\" is going to be.  Try making an outline of what you want your new normal to look like.  Also, there are going to be times that you are mad, sad, angry, pitiful, and generally pissed off.   Accept it, feel it, work through it and get to the other side looking towards that \"new normal.\"  It's kind of exciting to think that there is a new kind of life on the other side.  Today, my new normal includes being and feeling and living a more grateful life.  I always considered myself grateful for those things that made my life content and happy (husband, kids, grandgirls, friends, etc.) but I live a much more grateful life now.  This is a good thing that has emerged from this dreaded horror of a diagnosis.  Sometimes you have to look for them, but something good always comes out of something bad.  Sometimes you just have to dig for it and sometimes it hits you in the face!   Best of luck to you as you progress through both your illness and your relationship with your husband.  My bet is that he will come out on the other side much more grateful to have you in his life!!!!

Goldenseal is a marvelous herbal healer and natural antibiotic.  You can get a salve called \"The Golden Salve\" by Equinox Botanicals at an herb shop or probably at a natural foods store.  A very little bit goes a long way.  I would recommend mixing a dab with the Aquaphor, or with some water-based aloe vera gel.  Make sure to take it out of the jar with a q-tip so you don't contaminate the remaining salve, and keep the opened jar refrigerated.  A 1 1/4 oz jar probably will be $10 - $12, but it is the best healer I've ever used, and that little jar should be all you need to get through this. Apply 3 - 4 x's/d, or you could alternate with the neosporin - just make sure to clean one off before applying the other.  (Do not use the goldenseal if you have a severe allergy to ragweed.) When showering to remove all lotions, antibiotics, etc, before going for your treatment, make sure to use lukewarm rather than hot or cold water, and let the water hit the back of your shoulders and run over your breasts rather than hitting directly on your chest.  This helps prevent further damage to burnt skin and trauma to delicate new skin.  Unless you have a soap recommended by your dr or nurses/techs, use the mildest soap you can find - fragrance free and if possible, salicilate free  (Jergen's White All-Family bath soap is excellent.)  I would also recommend using all-cotton rounds or all-cotton gauze pads rather than a wash cloth. When cleaning your breasts between showers, use steam-distilled water (inexpensive and available in the drinks aisle at the supermarket) and the cotton rounds or gauze pads.  Again, this helps prevent infection and is much gentler on the skin than most tap water and a wash cloth. You have my very best wishes for effective treatment and speedy healing. Tre   I am currently five days out from the end of my radiation and the effects of the burn have been very painful and achy.  I've used Aquaphor on the open, weeping and peeling areas, as well as the nipple which really hurts.  The skin seems to be healing somewhat, but now the entire breast feels like I've been in a fight and someone used my breast as a punching bag - a really deep, sore ache on the inside.  Do any of you think this is normal?   I was not prepared for these after effects of the radiation.  Lynn",

      "Content": "Kisersassy,  Best of luck to you and your grandma.  She has a lot going on and treatments for all of it will be confusing.  Just keep in mind that in this day and age any pain she is suffering from should be able to be kept to a minimum.  My mother-in-law's situation wasn't too dissimilar to your grandma's and in hindsight, we wish we had let her have some quality of life during her last months instead of constantly trying to fix everything which put her through so very much.  When you are in the heat of the battle it can be very, very difficult to make those kinds of decisions, but at 76 years old, consider keeping her comfortable and spend as much time with her talking and hearing all the stories of her life.  Sometimes the treatment can be worse than the disease.  Best of luck to you both.   Lynn",
