Thank you Leemg,  I am 57 and my breast cancer is a stage 1.  I did refuse chemo and it took a bit for me to agree to radiation.  It was during radiation that my neck began to swell. My rad onc had to convince me to continue with the treatments as I was feeling that the radiation was causing the swelling.  So had a biopsy after ultrasound indicated a problem.  As you are aware thyroid cancer is slow growing and there are some studies that link it to  breast cancer.  The thinking being that the thyroid cancer is present first.  I personally feel that if the thyroid cancer was found earlier ( meaning 5 to 8 years ago) I may not have developed breast cancer.  I did have symptoms of thyroid problems but doctors did routine test that I now know  are open to many interpretations.  My intuitive sence really knew something was wrong but I did not act on it as I trusted the testing more than I trusted myself at the time  This whole experience has taught me to trust my instincts more and that is why I question the use of inhibitors for me.  I am interested in finding more inf about progesterone for that reason   There is no history of breast cancer or thyroid cancer that I know of in my family my family kept a lot of secrets so who knows)  Good luck with your RAI.  I am awaiting the pathology from  the thyroid surgery I had last week.I am Levoxyl now.  I am interested in the  syndrome test you spoke of .  I would like to know how you are doing....thank you ...Marilyn",

More concerning in my opinion is it a recurrence/met to low neck or Thyroid.  Lastly it could be a fast growing thyroid tumor and you don't want that for sure.  It needs w/u to find out what it is.  It could be an after effect of hormones or even chemo if applicable. Thank you for your reply.  No chemo or hormones are involved in my treatment ( my decision not to take hormones) and my rad onc assures me he is just treating the breast.  It is a stage one cancer with no node involvment.  I am trying to schedule an ultasound sooner than the two weeks that havs been scheduled.  I still have a fear that radiation is causing this but it was helpful to hear from you...many thanks ...Mimi",

Anyone else?? Thanks, Ruth       Dear Ruth, After receiving treatment for breast cancer (Stage 1-2 invasive ductal) I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer.  It seems that I was hypothyroid (Hashimotto\"s) and had pappillary thyroid cancer.    The only reason I am mentioning this is that you may want to get your thyroid checked ,  not that you have another cancer, but that there is a connection for some women with thyroid problems and breast cancer   Any thyroid issues can make you extremely tired and unable to completely heal.  If you have not done so already you may want to see an endocronologist as they are prepared to do better testing for thyroid levels ( simple blood test)  The right Dr. can make all the difference.  I wish you well and send you healing thoughts. It is three years later for me and I am finally feeling like myself again.  Let me know if you want more information..Mimi",
