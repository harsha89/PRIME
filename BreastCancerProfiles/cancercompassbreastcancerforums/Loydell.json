    "Content": "Two years ago, I was also diagnosed with stage 1 hormone sensitive invasive cancer. I was fortunate to have an excellent surgeon and had minimal disfigurement. A month later, I started 7 weeks of radiation. I tolerated it very well; perhaps because I was careful to eat a high protein bar and drink water immediately following and I also attended a yoga class throughout the treatment. I feel great...if I've had any heart damage, it is yet to surface. I elected not to take the followup hormone blockers. I did have trouble tolerating them. My oncologist tells me I'm \"low risk\". If the cancer reoccurs, I'll just deal with it then. LSJ",
