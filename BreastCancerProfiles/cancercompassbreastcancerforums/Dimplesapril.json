      "Content": "Hi Sharon: I can relate very much to your feelings.It has been three years since my orignal diagnose of BC, and two years since it met to the liver. I have been through chemo twice and radiation. I have been on Herceptin two years the end of this month. I go every other week for treatment. I am in remission. I had another lump removed in the other breast in July, came back benigh.I have had all types of feelings and fears over the last three years. The one thing I have found was to think positive and keep moving. I know that sounds kinda crazy to you right now. Believe me I was a basket case at times and cried. I pulled my boot straps up and decided I wouldn't let the cancer ruin my life. It is hard at times. I don't know what type of support you have, I hope you do have someone to help you, even if it is to talk to. I have pretty much been the strong one in my family. I don't think my husband has really accepted that I even have cancer. I have found great comfort in meeting people just like you on line to chat with, compare with even cry sometimes. It's good to have someone that knows about the feelings and what we each go through. I will keep you in my prayers. I didn't get sick through either times I had chemo. The only problem I am having now is my blood pressure has crept up and I am having a hard time losing weight, my doctor told me he liked fluffy patiences I told him I didn't like being fluffy..lol If you want to talk or ask any questions please do. I went through a roller coaster of emotions in the beginning. Don't get me wrong I have a pity party every now and then...but, who don't. Ask lots of questions of your doctor, that is one thing I didn't do the first round. I changed doctors and he listens to me and explains things to me that made a big difference in how I also felt about my cancer. Well, hang in there hope to hear from you soon. Julia",

      "Content": "Good Morning Sharon. I am glad your first treatment wasn't to bad. It does seem once you get through that first one it helps a little with the stress of thinking about getting it. I can also relate to your friends not wanting you to say certain things, I also had that problem even with my husband. I think it is something we need to say out loud, I know I had all these thoughts and was afraid. Like you everyone thinks that I am this strong brave person to fight this battle, I don't complain to any of them because when I did their response was don't give up. Just because I wanted to scream or cry or just felt really bad did not mean I gave up. I got so much advice I wanted to scream. I feel we are entiltled to have a bad day just like everyone else. I have found in my three years of fighting that people that don't have cancer don't understand or maybe they don't want to. I think my husband is still in denial. I know in the beginning when I found out my BC had met to the liver, I couldn't believe it. I also constantly thought about my future. It is very hard in the beginning when you are trying to digest it all. Then you have to have all these scans, it's frightening you don't know what to expect. I know when the week before my surgery I had to have a muga scan,bone scan,cat scan, Pet scan and a chest xray. I kept thinking with all this radiation they were going to give me cancer. It is an emotional roller coaster. Even now there are days that it just hits me and I feel sad all day and cry. It don't happen as much now, I try to keep as busy as I can it does help. I get treatment every other wed. I am getting Herceptin. I am at my two year mark as of the 27th of getting Herceptin. I get my scans done every six months that is when I get pretty emotional and stressed waiting for the results. I have read so many books and chated with so many BC survivors all the feelings we have are normal, what ever normal is :) You hang in there and what ever you need to say, say it don't hold all that in. I have learned the hard way. Even if I don't have anyone to talk to I write it out. If someone says things to me I don't like or tells me not to say this or that I write it out like I am telling them what it feels like. When I am really angry at the cancer or someone else I tend to tell them off on paper then I throw the paper away, it sounds crazy but someone it makes me feel better. Well I have talked your ear off with this email. Looking forward in hearing from you. You hand in there..:) Your Friend Julia",

      "Content": "Good Morning Sharon: yes I am in the states, unfortunately this messsage board does not allow us to exchange email addresses. I think that would really help a lot of people on here to have someone to chat with and email back in forth instead of posting messages. Oh well.. Just take everything one day at a time. I use to tell myself that tomorrow will be better, sometimes it was. I know this is all so scary. I found out I had BC six months after my mother passed away from cancer. It was pretty hard I wasn't over her death and had to deal with cancer myself. Every time I have to have my scans I get so emotional and stressed out, that it is out of remission. I think we all stay on some kind of emtional roller coaster. I do know how you feel about the news sinking in, I didn't cry or get upset until after my second chemo and my hair started falling out that's when it really hit me, I was a basket case for a while. I had my husband shave my head I couldn't stand it coming out in clumps. I was still working, I was a manager in a bank. It was really hard trying to wear a wig. I finally quit my job after sixteen and a half years. I couln't take the stress of the job and my employer giving me problems on top of fighting for my life with the treatment. I know things kind of get worst before it gets better, emotional anyhow. Try to eat good things, cut down on sugar. Drink lot's of water especially the day of and after your treatment. Talk to your doctor about vitamins. I don't know if I am any help or maybe making you feel worst. I hope it is not the latter. I am here for you. Wish I could go to your treatment with you. Well, hang in there, cry if you feel like it, even scream and holler sometimes just getting all that out makes you feel better. Until our next chat..take care hang in there Your new friend Julia",

      "Content": "Spring: My prayers are with you and your sister. As for me well it has been over a year since my cancer came back and I am doing great. I went through chemo again this time navelbine and herceptin. I was half way through my chemo \"navelbine\" and had scans done all the tumors were gone. My doctor stopped the chemo but I still get the herceptin I was going every week, as of this month I am going every other week. I also take femara. As for the diet well, I eat lots of vegs and fruit. I really don't like red meat any more I think it taste nasty. When I was going through chemo the first time I got taxol among others and was pretty sick at the beginning, the only thing that really tasted good was steamed veg. and grape juice was the only drink that tasted good. Everyone is different, your sister needs to try different things until she finds something that really taste good. I also took three different antinause drugs which really helped. I have also leared that a positive attitude is everything....when my hair grew back I got this funky little hair style all spiked and I just tell myself everyday, that today is the best day of my life even if I feel bad, I look in the mirror and tell myself to suck it up..I really think changing my attitude has helped me. I don't mean to ramble. I wish you and your sister all the best. the hardest thing for me was not being able to find anyone who had cancer that met to the liver. I really think we need each other because we can really relate to all that is happening to us and what we feel. I have met a lot of women and men who have cancer through my infusion lab. When we get a new patience my nurses put me in the room with them so they will have someone to talk to that has been there. I love it, I have met the most wonderful people and have become friends with quite a few of them. I pass out my phone number to any one that might like to have someone to talk to or just go out and do things..I hope all is going well just hang in there and don't give up hope.I have met some great ladies on here, we exchanged email address and a few even phone numbers.

I will be 50 this year.. :) I did not have any problems with the navelbine or Herceptin. The only problem for me was my red count would go down and I would get pretty tired, I had to get aranespt shot for the count. I think I spelled that right. I still get the Herceptin I go every other week. I gained quite a few pounds since all my treatment, I think the most was from the steroids. I joined curves in January, I walk two miles a day and I also dance on the days I don't go to curves. The pounds are pretty stubborn and don't seem to want to come off but, I enjoy getting out. I just keep telling myself to keep moving..believe me some days it is hard. I am not saying I don't have a bad day now and then I think that is natural with what we go through. I am always looking for someone to talk to that has the same treatment as me or that the cancer met to the liver. We are truly the only ones that understand each others feelings. I wish we could exchange email addresses. Some sites that I go to you can which is great, I met a lady that only lives about forty minutes from me.

I started on chemo - Navelbine and Herceptin. In January of this year I had scans done NO CANCER showed anywhere in my body. I stopped the Navelbine but, still get the Herceptin and was switched from Tamoxifen to Femara. The treatment seems to be working for me. I have met two women at the infusion lab who have the same and it has been seven years for them. I do excersise and try to watch what I eat. I just turned 49. My biggest problem is I gained about forty pounds with the steroids and the Tamoxifen. I think there is hope for us. I keep a positive attitude and keep moving. I have found that most of my so called friends stopped calling or coming around and some family memebers seem to have a hard time seeing me for some reason. For me the hardest part was not having a lot of support through my family and friends. I keep my good attitude, keep moving and I suck up the pain in my joints from the meds. Try to get as much info as you can about your treatment, what options you have ask questions. I go every week for the Herceptin and it seems I always have a question about something. My doctor will take the time to explain things or if I read something that I think I could do , he will explain to me why I can't ....so hang in there.... Dimples",

When it met to the liver I went through chemo Navelbine and Herceptin. After half of my treatments with the navelbine I had all scans done and all the tumors were gone..doc stopped the navelbine but kept me on Herceptin. I having been getting Herceptin since Sept of 2004 and so far so good..I haven't had any problems except maybe a few aches and pains from the Femara which I was switched to since the cancer met when I was taking tamoxifen. I was going every week for the herceptin in Nov the doc changed it to every two weeks. I didn't get sick with either of these drugs, I did have to take sternoids which I think is the standard and put on a few pounds but I ask to be taken off of the sternoids and he did take me off of them. I joined curves in Jan to help get me back into some kind of shape. I walk everyday that really seems to help it even helped when I was really tired. It's a hard road we travel but , a good attitude and having a part and a say in our treatment I feel really helps. I am not saying I didn't have any bad days because believe me I did. I just keep telling myself tomorrow will be better. I allow one pity party day a month ..lol I don't know if any of this helps you in any way. I hope it does..I do know how you feel. I found out my cancer had came back some where in my body on my birthday what a present. my tumors markers went way up, then I had the scans done. So I didn't know where it had came back until after all the scans. It's so stressful waiting for results or knowing it's there but, where... I hope you can hang in there ask lots of questions, I changed ono's twice because I didn't like the way I felt they treated me. That is our right too...I have agreat doctor now he listens, jokes discusses things with me. didn't mean to ramble on so much. hang in there. I do hope you have someone you can really talk to about your feelings and it's okay to cry. I actually met the best on chat rooms I have become great friends with two ladies that live in other states. That I think has helped me the most, they know exactly how I feel because they have it too...I have actually met one of them in person and we both feel like we have known each other for ever..

      "Content": "Hi Bobbi: I was in the same situation you are in, except I was trying to work and take off a day or two here and there when was necessary from the side effects. My employer hired someone to take my position with me still working and then had the nerve to ask me to train them. They did everything in their power to get me to quit. They wrote me up because I didn't want to wear a wig when I lost my hair. It became so stressful I finally just quit. I tried complaining too. I even went as far as contacting the EEOC. I could have sued them for some of the things they did to me. Fighting my cancer had to be number one and like you said, putting myself first for once. I just did not have the strength to fight them.My cancer was enough of a fight and I just could not deal with all the stress any more. I worked with my supervisor for sixteen years. I know how you feel. I am now on Herceptin and have been for a year now. When I was told I was stage IV my nurse told me to try and apply for disability so I did and was approved. Have you considered applying for disability? I can now fight my cancer with that positive attitude and not worrying when I need to take a nap or go for my treatments and just enjoy life. Good luck to you. Dimples",
