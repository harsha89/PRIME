      "Content": "Hello, I wrote a brief message last week, as I was at the hospital and I needed to get to a support group meeting.  As I said in my message - I have been trying for almost 4 years to find a message board for carcinomatous meningitis - Leptomeningeal disease and couldn't.  All my info came from on-line research and my doctor.  It was very helpful to me to read people's actual stories. I was diagnosed with Leptomeninigeal disease - as a metatasis of breast cancer. Jan 2004.  I got an ommaya port in Feb and began treatments. (3 different sorts) I completed treatments at the end of July, 2004. (I was 2 weeks into Topacan and stopped because I got very depressed.)  Still had malignant cells in my brain but they were much reduced.  And then, amazingly, I got 3 years off.  Still had the odd symptom now and again - but basically lived my life.  This past September I got some pretty strong symptoms again and have been moderately successful controling them with steroids.  I will be starting treatments again shortly (depocite) and hope they will buy me more time.  The most disturbing  symptoms I am getting this time around is 'losing my legs.'  But I am managing.   I would be happy to converse with anyone who is dealing with this disease.  I feel pretty grounded in my approach.  L ",

      "Content": "Hello, I was fortunate to be treated at Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon NH - my local hospital.  I received 3 types of chemo through a port in my head.  Possibly your loved one is too sick for the insertion of a port or to tolerate the chemo.  I was 'very healthy' going into my treatment.  Unfortunately , I seem to be losing the battle right now.  But I did get 3 years treatment and mostly symptom free.  I also did some supplements and think they helped.  I'd be happy to give you a list - but it probably would be more helpful to contact an ND and hear what might be specifically of benefit. Let me know what else might be helpful, L",

I have been trying to connect with anyone dealing with this disease and this is my first success in 4 years. My strategy has been to keep my immune system healthy. And stay busy.",
