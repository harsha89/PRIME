I have heard that after time your hair does go back to the way it was. I hope so. I hate it now and I cannot do anything with it. Good luck with you hair regrowth. Hello - I was so interested in this message because today is exactly one year since my last infusion (on 1/31/08) and my hair is so terrible.  It's curliest and thickest in the back, and so very thin and strange looking on the top. I'm so worried that I'll never have my thick, thick hair back again. My scalp shows through and I have to really work to try to cover it.  How is your hair now that many more months have passed since you posted that message?  I hope you are doing well in general.   Best regards, Linda  ",
