    "Content": "I'd really appreciate some advice please. My mother has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her sister, father, two aunts, a cousin and grand-mother all died from breast cancer, most of them in their 40s. My sister and I have been told we must have gene tests etc. My sister, is refusing to do so, saying she'd rather not know. I have a totally different view. (I'm 31, by the way).  It has been suggested to me that I should consider having an elective double mastectomy. Without wishing to sound flippant, I am quite keen on the idea. Looking at my family history, things don't bode well for me and prevention is better than cure etc. I'd be grateful if you would let me know what you think. It would really help me :-)  Many thanks, Louise",
