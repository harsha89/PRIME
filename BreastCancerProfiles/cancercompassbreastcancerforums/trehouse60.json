      "Content": "The recommendation to call your dr and ask exactly what they will do is excellent.  It is also a good chance to voice your concerns about being jumpy - your dr can make a note that an IV sedative might be desirable.  Here is a good article on wire localization and biopsy - I cannot say that your procedure will be exactly as this article says, but it is good basic information http://www.health.harvard.edu/diagnostic-tests/wire-localiza They will at least use a local anesthetic for the wire placement. It's possible they may start an IV first and give you a sedative before the entire procedure, but if they need you to be pretty mobile for the wire placement, my guess is that you won't get any heavy duty IV drugs until that is done. Also, on the day of your surgery, an anesthesiologist should come to talk with you before the procedure is done - make sure to mention then that you are nervous - ask them to do what they can to minimize your anxiety. I hope everything goes well for you, and that your biopsies are benign.  Sincerely, Tre  ",

      "Content": "Hi BettyBoob, Sounds like right now you have 2 primary concerns, and have not received reassurance nor adequate treatment for either one:  1.  you have breast pain for which you still aren't being treated  2. you are concerned this could be cancer. Most women experiencing the symptoms you present do NOT have cancer, but with your past history, your concern that this might be cancer certainly is valid and should not be dismissed out of hand.  I recommend that you request a mammogram, or an MRI of your breasts. The specialist may say there is no need for a mammogram - tell him you want one anyway, that with your past history you have a very valid concern about cancer, and that you want the test so you can make sure.  If he will not order it, find another dr. Talk to your GP - and if your GP is still dismissing you, find another family dr, preferably one who has respect for women's health concerns. If you don't have health insurance, check to see if your community has an organization that will pay for mammograms for women, or contact the Susan G. Komen Foundation - they will pay for mammograms for women who have health concerns.  Check to see if there is a naturopathic dr in your area that is willing to see you - this might be a naturopath, a homeopath or an osteopath.  They generally are more receptive to women's concerns and may be able to help with realistic treatment to help get your pain resolved, rather than dismissing you out of hand. Pain in the breast is usually NOT cancer (it can be cancer, and that is why I recommend a mammogram, but it usually isn't cancer.)  Pain in the breast usually is from one of three causes:  cyclical pain - which would be related to the hormone cycle, non-cyclical pain which means there is something else going on in the breast itself, and non-breast origin pain - which means the pain is being caused somewhere else but is being felt in the breast.  I'm going to talk briefly about all 3 causes, in hopes of helping you make some sense of what's happening. Cyclical breast pain correlates to women's productive hormone cycle. For some women, the closer they get to ovulating, the worse their breasts hurt, then once their period starts the pain subsides. You did not say whether or not your ovaries were removed when they did your hysterectomy.  If they were, then this simply cannot be cyclical breast pain for you. If you still have one or both ovaries, it very well could be hormone related pain, but it would still go in the cycle I described, and it sounds like that is not the case with you. Noncyclical breast pain is not hormone related but definitely does reflect a mechanical (physical) problem in the breast. Quite often these problems get labelled \"fibrocystic disease\" (as the 2nd dr has done with you) - and the issue never gets properly diagnosed and treated. Fibrocystic disease, fibrocystic breasts - these are all waste-basket terms, which means basically the people using them don't really know what is going on, don't know how to treat it, and throw a nonsense label on it and tell people it will go away, which is really a bunch of B.S. (The label of fibrocystic breasts is as often used with cyclical breast pain as is is with noncyclical breast pain.) Noncyclical pain isn't influenced by menses - it stays put regardless of the time of month.  It usually is in just one area - you can pinpoint exactly where it hurts. If some kind of trauma has occured to the breast, it can cause substantial pain that takes a long time to heal.  If there is a milk duct or other gland that is blocked or infected, it can cause very specific pain. There are other causes, and sometimes the cause is never known. This is why a mammogram is recommended - it is the easiest way to locate an anatomical problem in the breast, and much more accurate than manual exam. The third type of pain is called non-breast origin pain.  That means something somewhere else has gone wrong, but you feel the pain as if it was in the breast. Costochondral junction syndrome is non-breast origin pain.  Basically the dr is saying that he thinks there is a problem where there ribs bones meet the sternum (the breast bone), but he doesn't know what it is, and perhaps doesn't really care, cause he thinks it will resolve by itself.  Usually costochondral pain is arthritis in the breast bone. If you push down on the breast bone where the ribs are, and that makes it hurt a whole lot more, you probably have arthritis. Or if you take a really deep breath and it makes the middle part of your breast hurt, you probably have arthritis. If aspirin or Advil (Motrin) or Alleve make the pain go away, you probably have arthritis. Arthritis in the breast bone is usually temporary and will go away - it may take a while, but usually over time will resolve.  Aspirin, advil, alleve - over the counter anti-inflammatory drugs are usually sufficient for the pain and to help resolve the problem.  If not, the dr might be able to inject a shot of steroid into the area to help alleve the pain and resolve the condition. Yet you've got another thing that is of concern:  discharge from your nipple over a long period of time, a lymph node that is obviously overwhelmed trying to remove some kind of toxin from the breast, and pain and swelling that seems to be associated with the nipple and has gotten worse over time.  The GP putting you on antibiotics is actually a quite reasonable choice, but since it didn't help, the antibiotics either weren't the right drug, or there is no infection. Collecting a sample of the discharge for culture and sensitivity would show if there is infection and which antibiotic would be appropriate. If that wasn't done, I would ask your GP if he will order it. Possible that you do have an actual physical problem there in the breast, other than infection.  Did the specialist actually look at the discharge?  Did he take a sample of it for any testing?  At the very least, it needs to be tested for the presence of blood - which can very easily be done in the dr's office with a hemacult kit . They should do a PAP smear of the discharge (just like they do PAP smears of the cervix - it's quite accurate), and have it sent to the lab to check for abnormal cells.  Even though you saw a \"specialist\", it doesn't sound like this person did enough to find out why you are having these problems.  Yes, women do normally have discharge from their nipples - but usually it's from both nipples, and not for this long a continuous period of time.  Yes, womens nipples do itch - and there are lots of reasons that can happen - but when the itching is associated with pain, heat and swelling, it usually indicates something physically abnormal going on in the breast.  If it were me in this situation, I think I'd get another opinion. (I hate to sound sexist, but I definitely would be seeking an opinion from a female dr, as many times male drs just don't seem to understand how vital of a concern this can be.) I also recommend that you try to get a look at, and possibly purchase, 2 excellent books.  Dr Susan Love is one of the world's foremost medical experts on breast health.  Her book, Dr Susan Love's Breast Book (4th ed) is considered by many women to be THE Bible on breast health.  Susun Weed is an expert on herbal and nutritional health. I highly recommend her book, Breast Cancer? Breast Health! The Wise Woman Way.  I wish you the best in getting some more satisfactory answers. Sincerely, Tre",

I had chemo and radiation.I contracted shingles after three mo.s and still have them over a year later.They are very painful and there is nothing that I have found to treat them.I take lyrica for the pain but it has a lot of side effects.Does anyone know of anything that will give relief from this.I am thinking of trying acupunture. Addiebelle Hi Addiebelle, Sorry you are having such a persistent problem - shingles is very painful - you must be about ready to pull your hair out. If the Lyrica hasn't helped you by now, it's most likely not going to. And you're right - it does have a lot of side effects, and for that reason  I question that it's the best choice for your immune system right now. Shingles is caused by varicella zoster - the same virus that causes chicken pox. Once we get it, it's very difficult to kill.   Most people will  always have it, but most of the time it goes into hiding in the spinal tract. When an area along the skin nerve tracts becomes weakened and not well protected by the immune system, then it comes out and attacks again. Your cancer woke it up, although your immune system may still have been strong enough to prevent a full-fledged outbreak.  Surgery, chemo and radiation - probably all combined to weaken your immune system sufficiently that you started breaking out, and it sounds like you just aren't recovering well enough from those things to put the virus back into remission or kill it. So, an antiviral and probably all the other stuff you've been using isn't going to work.   You need to fight this virus off from the inside out - that means through immune system support.  I recommend you take a look at this olive leaf tea - it will attack the virus, and hopefully kill it, or at the very least, put it back into remission. It will build up your immune system at the same time, helping you to recover from all the treatment, plus the debilitation caused by the shingles and pain. I'm giving you both the link to the tea, and to the olivus home page, so you can look at their other products.  http://www.olivetea.com/shingles_information.htm http://www.olivus.com/conditions_olive_leaf.htm It will take a few days for shipping of the tea, and probably another few days for it to work.  In the meantime, if you haven't tried Zostrix for pain, it would be worth giving a whirl.  It's a pain reliever for arthritis, but it works very well for nerve pain caused by shingles. You can get it over the counter at your local drugstore - you may have to ask the pharmacist to help you locate it.  If the zostrix doesn't help,  message me back and I will try to find a strong herbal analgesic for you. (You can get a free sample of zostrix from this site - again, it will take a few days for shipping, but if you can't get it at the pharmacy - you can send for it online) : http://www.zostrix.com/pages/samples.asp I recommend two other things for immediate boost of your immune system, that will both help fight cancer and the virus: selenium supplement - at least 200 mcg/day - safe to take up to 400 mcg/day, but I would recommend the higher dose for a limited time only (probably not more than a week, then  drop down to the loser dose.)  You can take the selenium every day for a long time, at least until you are seeing a lot of evidence that you are finally recovering from the chemo and radiation.  selenium is a trace element that our bodies need - unlikely that you will have any problems taking it, unless you know you are allergic to it. The other supplement is zinc - 50 mg/day - TAKE IT WITH FOOD or it will upset your stomach.  Again, you can take this supplement every day for as long as it takes to get you feeling well again.  (Nutrition sites will recommend you take that high a dose of zinc only for a  limited time period, but I know of more than a few people who have taken 50 mg of zinc every day for years and years and never had a problem with it.) If you do try the accupuncture, I would still recommend immune system support, with at least the selenium and zinc. Sounds like you need to do something proactive to not just get rid of the shingles, but also to give your body a big boost to get back to normal. Good luck - I wish you well. Sincerely, Tre  ",

Had the lumpectomy and setinal lobe disection last week and now have to wait until next week and meet with the oncologist to find out what the next step is going to be. My husband has been very supportive through all this but i feel guilty putting him through this. We have been married just over a year and now all this. I don't know that I want to go any farther with treament. I have been cut open 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I am feeling very sick when i look at my scares, I know they are new and they will fade but right now I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to scream.  Intamacy has become a thing if the oast since all this has started and I think that is the hardest part of all this, I need to feel close to my husband, i need hito touch me and love me the way he used to before I got sick. How so I relay this to him without pushing him. It is going to happen sooner then later that I will not physically be able to love him and feel close to him but now while I can he is scared. Does anyone have any advice for me or encouraging words of wisdom. I need something to hold on to right now.  Thanks for listening. Dear Tomslady, Let me encourage you to stand back for a few moments and take a few very deep breaths. REMEMBER: you have not been too long ago diagnosed with a very scary and threatening condition, you have had 4 surgeries in 6 weeks, and you are under extreme stress trying to cope with the change in your body image and about the need for further treatment. This is a crazy-making situation, and right now is probably NOT a good time for  you to be making the kind of decisions you are talking about.  While everything may seem to be happening so fast that you can't keep up, and your health situation may seem to be running away with of a mind of its own, but that doesn't have to be true. Yes, I know there MUST be some actions taken soon, but you are not likely to expire immediately if you first take some time to get ahold of your thoughts and emotions so that later on you can make calm, rational and well-informed decisions.  The best thing you can do for yourself and your family right now is give yourself permission to grieve for what you've just lost, determine to be kind to yourself in facing what lies ahead, and just plain give yourself some time to be still. About your specific issues: #1: don't feel guilty about \"putting your husband through this.\"  You didn't choose to have this cancer, and your husband agreed to take on your problems as his own when he married you, so YOU aren't putting HIM through anything. You are still two individual people, but as husband and wife you are one unit, and if you allow him to support you more (as it sounds he is willing to do), as time goes on this adversity may very well serve to help you become even more unified.  (What doesn't break you, makes you stronger.) #2: continuing with treatment.  The lady who wrote and said of course you must continue with treatment is right.  You have a lot to live for, but you are overwhelmed by all this right now, and fear and pain and grief are talking for you and taking over the conversation.  That is a natural reaction, but does not have to be a permanent condition.  Again, step back, take some deep breaths, and give yourself time to regain your equilibrium.  When you are able to do that, if you would care to private message me, I will be happy to talk with you about treatment options your oncologist may or may not recommend.  (I am a former RN, and I am also a 2-time cancer survivor diagnosed with metastatic breast disease just as I was reaching the magic 5 year mark.  Traditional cancer medicines make me extremely ill, so I am using other methods to beat this thing, and I'm doing well.  I never try to discourage people from traditional treatments, but I do encourage them to use complementary therapies to add more weapons to their arsenal that they use to fight this fight.) #3:  about your breast and your surgical scars:  many, many women feel the same way you do when this happens to them.  If you can't look at yourself in the mirror right now, don't push it.  step back, take some deep breaths, and give it time. Society has done a major injustice to women by conditioning them to believe their appearance determines their worth, especially their breasts. YES, physical appearance is part of desire, but I doubt you and your husband got married believing that both would always and forever continue to look exactly like you did the day you got married.  You just thought the change would take years, and now you've been thrown a loop by having this change come so rapidly.  Again, your grief and emotions are controlling the conversation - in time that should change; indeed you must make it change. In the meantime, try giving your husband more credit on this issue, and let him prove you right in doing so. Maybe he IS scared to touch you - that's normal ( after all, YOU are scared to touch you right now.)   He might be afraid of hurting you.  He probably is acutely aware of your discomfort about the disruption in your relationship and the changes to your body, and he may not know how to start to fix things. So, you will have to learn together how to make things better. You might start by giving him a chance just to see your body again. Just let him look at your breast and ask whatever questions  are on his mind,  like, \"does that hurt?\"  Answer him truthfully.  Hopefully your incisions are healed enough by now that once you are comfortable with him looking at your scars,  you can then encourage him to touch them lightly, gently, with the understanding that at least for the first few times, it's just about touching, about getting used to the way things feel now.  This gives you BOTH the opportunity to learn about the way things are now without feeling pressured to do more than just look and touch. Most women who've had mastectomies have at least some small areas of numbness.  If you do, too, tell him.  Help him to understand that if you don't respond the same way physically as you used to when he touches certain areas of your breast, it's not cause you don't like his hands, but because you don't feel them.  Encourage him to touch both breasts, gently.  Gentle touch to the scars will stimulate circulation and promote healing, while gentle touch to the other side should reassure you that you are still a woman, still have feelings, and that being touched can still be a pleasurable intimate experience for both of you. Most of all, as with time things progress past this point,  make your husband feel valued - show him that you DO need him.  Men not only want to be wanted, they need to be needed. I hope that as least some small part of this helps.  And as I said earlier, if you feel you'd like to hear my thoughts on therapy, once you've had a chance to get your mind together and start to consider options, please private message me and let me know what you're thinking and feeling and considering, and I will be happy to respond, see if I can be of some help. Be kind to yourself. Sincerely, Tre  ",

Hi Pat, You are not alone in either the symptoms you are experiencing, or in your decision to go off the medication.  If you have a little bit of time, go back through some of the earlier posts on this message board about aromasin, arimidex, tamoxifen, etc.  In addition to seeing women talk about how bad these meds made them feel, you will also find posts chock full of answers about things that will alleviate side effects, and help in the battle against cancer. I myself am a survivor of breast cancer (2002), and more recently diagnosed with metastasis to the lungs.  I did not do tamoxifen or arimidex after my surgeries, chemo and radiation (which I quit halfway through due to lymphedema) because they made me sick after just a few doses, and I chose immediate quality of life now rather than the not-guaranteed possibility of quantity of life later.  While I didn't quite make it the magic 5 years before we found the nodules in my lungs (last fall), I don't regret those choices in the least little bit.  They were the best 5 years of my life, and part of the reason is because I wasn't letting treatment make me sick. After surgical biopsy of one of the lung nodules, I was officially diagnosed with mets in Feb this year, I once again had to make treatment choices.  I took 2 doses of the Aromacin - just that little made me extremely ill, so I said \"No more.  I'm not being sick like this.\" My lung nodules were very small, and the oncologist said I had lots of time before we needed to consider chemo, so I did a lot of research and designed my own herbal/supplemental and nutritional food regimen for fighting cancer, and it is working. I also became vegetarian and am concertedly working at losing weight (which I badly need to do.) My PET scan in June was great - some small areas of concern, but overall both the oncologist and radiologist said from that scan they cannot say that the nodules represent cancer. My blood chemistries and cell counts are fantastic - better than they've been in at least 20 years, and the cancer marker I had drawn last week is down despite the fact I haven't had chemo or prescription treatment. And I feel great!   There are herbs and natural treatments that can help you regain your health, put the side effects of aromasin behind you.  My best recommendation is that you see a certified naturopath for help with this process.  A registered nutrionist or a well-respected herbalist could help if you don't have access to a naturopathic, homeopathic, osteopathic or wholistic doctor.  If you need help with this from the message board, I myself, and some of the other frequent responders could help, but I highly recommend that you check our for yourself (through internet research, herb books, persons in the community knowledgable about natural therapies)  advice anyone on the board gives before  trying it for yourself. Not only can herbs, natural foods, alternative and/or complementary therapies help you get over the nastiness of the Aromasin, they can help you continue your fight against cancer.  Right now you appear to be cancer free - sure would be nice to keep it that way without having to suffer the pain and indignities of conventional treatments.  If you are interested in learning what you can do for yourself to prevent the cancer from coming back, I offer the same recommendations as for getting over the side effects. (There are other things to explore - ayurvedic tradition, traditional chinese medicine, diet and exercise, accupunture...) If you are interested in learning more about natural alternatives to conventional prescription treatment, feel free to send me your questions in a private message, and I will try to help you find the answers that are right for you.  Or post your questions publicly on this message board - lots of other people here that can get you started in a direction other than pain and suffering while recovering from the aromasin. I hope this answer has helped, and I wish you the best of health in the months to come. Sincerely, Tre  ",

      "Content": "there was an excellent suggestion about this problem on the message board within the last month or so.  I don't know if I will be able to find that post, but I can try. In the meantime, you can help restore the health of vaginal tissues by applying a tiny amount of flax seed oil once a day.  Just use enough to cover the pad of your finger, and gently rub it in actually up inside the vagina as well as on the outside.  Use food grade flax seed oil with lignans - keep unused oil refrigerated as it will go rancid otherwise.  Within a few days or a week you should really start to notice a big difference in these tissues - a replenishment of moisture and return of elasticity.  Once you notice a difference, decrease the frequency of the flax oil.  I am post-menopausal and have been on a natural anti-estrogen regimen - have got my estradiol level WAAAAY low - whereas at first I had to use it every day, I now only need the flax oil once every two or three weeks. Don't worry about the phytoestrogen content - this tiny amount of flax oil will help locally but is not enough to be absorbed systemically and cause a problem with cancer. It also has the advantage of being inexpensive - you can get a bottle of Barlean's organic brown flax seed oil with lignans for about $9. It will last a VERY long time.  Look in the refrigerator section at a health food store to find it.  If it's uncomfortable to do this treatment at first - if those tissues are really dry and fragile they may need more lubrication than you will get from a tiny amount of flax oil alone - you can mix 1/2 tsp flax oil with a TBSP or two of vaseline, and apply as big a dab as you need.  Do not refrigerate this mixture - it will stay good for about a week to 10 days, as long as you keep it in a clean air tight container and away from heat and light.  If the oil seperates from the vaseline, just stir with a q-tip before applying.  Once you've rejuvenated your natural tissues, something as simple as KY jelly may be adequate to allow for an enjoyable times with your partner.

Hi Kittycath, Congratulations on your great news! Avoiding phytoestrogens altogether and maintaining a healthy diet, including foods with high anti-oxidant value, is practically impossible.  However, there is a difference in many foods, herbs, and supplements as to the strength of the phytoestrogen they contain.    I have read some pretty respectable research indicating that very strong phytoestrogens will be utilized for growth by estrogen-positive cancers, whereas very weak phytoestrogens will act as estrogen-blockers, just as tamoxifen and arimidex do.  And there are many herbs, supplements and natural foods that are natural aromatase inhibitors, which is what Aromasin and many of the newer drugs do.  SOY is one of the strongest phytoestrogens you will find in naturally occuring foods. (This includes raw soy, soy supplements, tofu, tempeh, and , soy sauce, and soy flour. Soybean oil is possibly the least of these villains, as many products with soy oil have such small amounts e.g. breads with soy oil might be ok, breads with soy flour would be a no-no.)   Yams and red clover are also very powerful phytoestrogens, and probably not good choices for anyone with active estrogen-positive breast cancer or a history of estrogen-positive breast cancer. while there is a huge on-going debate about whether wine prevents or causes cancer, there is creditable evidence that for pre-menstrual women, a small daily intake of red wine (not to exceed 3 - 4 oz) and help prevent or fight breast cancer.  Red wine is very high in resveratrol and flavonoids - that combination allows red wine to act as both a natural estrogen-blocker and an aromatase inhibitor.  Grapes, especially red grapes with the seeds in them, are showing excellent results in alternative prevention and treatment of cancer, (or grape seed extract) -  again because they act as both an estrogen-blocker and aromatase inhibitor.  White button mushrooms are also being used with good results in this particular research.   Some time spent in internet research should be fruitful at revealing other nutritious foods that are low-strength phytoestrogens and therefore can be used as natural estrogen blockers. As for avoiding soy and still eating healthy - yes, it is absolutely possible. I do it, and I eat very well.  Being vegetarian helps.  The suggestion of using brown rice milk is excellent - you can make your own inexpensively, and it keeps well in the fridge.  A little vanilla gives it flavor.  (send me a private message if you want my recipe)  Of course, check labels - the only commercially prepared product I consume with soy is 2% or less soybean oil, in bread only.  Virgin coconut oil (expeller pressed from fresh coconut meat) is an excellent choice for cooking, baking, salad dressing, etc - expensive, but using it really makes it easy to avoid soy and the other oil products that are strong on the phytoestrogen range. Infrequent consumption of some soy is probably not going to cause much harm, especially if your diet is high in anti-oxidants, and you counter the soy consumption with natural estrogen-blockers  or other foods or supplements that are showing creditability in preventing or fighting cancer.  (the old saying an apple a day - has a lot of truth to it. very dark chocolate is also our friend!!!)  I love the chinese food prepared at a local authentic chinese restaurant. I eat there every week or two, knowing that soy is a staple of their sauces.  I make sure to also take the herbs and eat the foods I am using to counter estrogen, and my estradiol level is now the lowest it has been since we started tracking it.  I hope this helps.  Again, congrats on no longer having to take that nasty medicine, and I wish you the best of luck!

Thanks in advance NL     I would not do the radiation - too much risk to the heart and lungs.  Tamoxifen causes lots of problems for many women. There are natural ways to inhibit estrogen - pls see my blog: my story http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor my regimen http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Research has shown that many people who do not seek treatment for their cancers live just as long (or longer) as people who have surgery and get chemo/radiation.  Unfortunately I do not know any way to predict who might fit in that category. There is also some concern that surgery may seed cancer to other places, but many people do not accept that this could be possible. And many leading advocates of alternative medicine can point to evidence that tumors do not have to be removed for therapy to be successful in eradicating the cancer, especially if it has been caught early.  So to me the question of surgery vs no surgery is a toss-up. (I did not even consider alternative therapies with my first diagnosis in 2002 - have learned a WHOLE lot more about them since my recurrence was diagnosed in 2008.)  If it were me, and I chose surgery, I think I would have bilateral simple mastectomy, and I would at least consider having flap reconstruction instead of implants.  But I certainly would also give serious consideration to using natural therapy either in addition to conventional treatment. or an alternative to the tamoxifen and radiation.  Many foods, herbs and supplements really can be very effective at fighting cancer as well as boosting the immune system. If you are interested in learning  more about alternatives other than the info in my blog, these are excellent sites:  http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us If you want to try some supplements, many leading advocates recommend at the very least taking these 5 minerals, and I recommend adding a vitamin:  selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max) I hope this reply has helped, and I wish you the very best as you make your decisions and move ahead with treatment.

      "Content": "Hi Pat, I sent you a very long private reply, detailing my personal regimen. However, I forgot to address things you can do now to get over the side effects of the aromasin and arimidex. Basically, the symptoms you had are from estrogen-depletion, a chemically induced menopause, if you will.  While almost everyone agrees that taking actual estrogens when you have estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer is a big no-no, there is a huge raging debate about the advisability of ingesting phytoestrogens (plant estrogens.)  Almost every source I've seen says to avoid soy, because it is such a strong phytoestrogen, but that may not be true.  I think the jury will be out on that one for a long, long time.  In the meantime, maybe best to avoid soy. Emerging research is indicating that foods/supplements comprising strong phytoestrogens will feed estrogen-dependent cancer,  while those with weak phytoestrogens can act as aromatase inhibitors and estrogen-blockers.  There are a lot of weak phytoestrogens in the regimen I am using, but you need something that will take hold much faster.  Flax oil pressed without the hulls is probably not a good choice, but flax seeds and flax oil with the hulls (lignans) could be really helpful to you right now to get over the aromasin and arimidex.  This website does a pretty good job of explaining the benefits of lignan: http://www.wildernessfamilynaturals.com/high_lignan_flax.htm You don't have to buy the product they are promoting on the web page, but please do read the information.  They mention the Budwig diet, which focuses on flax seed and cottage cheese. I haven't studied Budwig in-depth, therefore cannot recommend or speak against it as an alternative treatment for cancer, but I do feel that you should take a look at it, as following it at least for a week or two may help get your body back on track.  You can get organic flax seed at just about any health food store, and you can add it to cottage cheese whole or you can grind it slightly to break up the hulls and make the lignam more easily digestible.  I really would recommend referring to the Budwig diet for amounts.  You could take flax oil with lignan if you don't want to do the seeds/cottage cheese - I would have to do more research before I could recommend how much. Also might be helpful to look at these resources: http://www.susanlovemd.com/    (she has an excellent book:  \"Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th ed.\") \"Prescription for Nutritional Healing\" by Phyllis Balch - it's wonderful but expensive, so if you can get to a good bookstore that has it, take a pen and notepad and take notes rather than buy the book  Since a lot of your symptoms involve joint pain, you might also consider taking an herbal preparation specific for arthritis for a month or so.    Garlic supplement, boswellia, lots of green onions (as food), b-vitamins, maybe curcumin (turmeric spice) - these are things that should help.  Get plenty of calcium and vitamin c, as well as vit D and E.  You might try homeopathic remedy tablets for under the tongue - rhus toxicodendron (do NOT use if severe allergy to poison oak), arnica montana, and/or bryonia alba: used as directed on the label, take in a clean mouth (no food or liquids),  take only one type at a time, wait at least 15  - 30 minutes before taking another type.  Check at a health food store or herb shop near you - they should have these things. The papaya, bromelain and mulberry that I mentioned in my private message  are excellent choices, too, and will help to fight against cancer as well as getting over the meds.  Papaya and bromelain are easily available at GNC or health food stores.  THe mulberry you will have to get from swansonvitamins.com I hope this helps - sure would be nice to hear you say you are feeling better! sincerely, Tre  ",

So were it me, I would not stay on it past 5 years. If you are worried about recurrence of cancer even after 5 years of being on Arimidex, there are many things you can do naturally to minimize the risk of recurrence. Many of these things address the immune system and maintaining an internal enviroment that is non-condusive to cancer; there are things you can do with diet, herbs, and supplements to specifically maintain low estrogen levels so as to deprive nourishment to any remaining cells. I designed an effective natural regimen for myself when diagnosed with metastasis to the lungs (I do NOT tolerate the anti-estrogen drugs.)  My estrogen level was in the 20's a year ago, it is now below 5. I do not recommend anyone else try to design their own regimen unless they have sufficient medical or health care background to really know what they are doing, but I DO recommend that anyone interested in continuing an anti-estrogen lifestyle AFTER treatment with Arimidex, etc, consult a naturopathic/holistic professional for advice on how to initiate and maintain self-treatment. I have published my personal anti-cancer regimen on my blog.  I do not offer it as a prescription for anyone - everyone's body chemistry is different, so not everything that works for me is going to work for someone else; rather I  offer the regimen as an example of those things that people fighting cancer or seeking to stay cancer free can do simply and inexpensively, in concert with personalized recommendations by a professional.  Please feel free to look at my blog - you will find my story there, as well as many other articles that might be of interest.   http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers There are also great web sites that give information on alternative methods of preventing recurrence, including supplementation and anti-cancer diets. these are the best I've found: www.cancertutor.com www.lefcancer.org www.alkalizeforhealth.net I hope this helps.

      "Content": "Fat tissue certainly can die as a result of radiation - either due to injury to the tissue from the radiation itself, or having the blood supply to the tissue cut off because of the radiation. Some who have necrosis of adipose suffer no ill effects - it  eventually liquefies and reabsorbs, and the area fills in with new healthy tissue.  The big risk, however, is of abscess and/or infection - as a nurse I took care of a few people who had to deal with this, and it wasn't fun. Thus you are wise to keep seeking until you find help. Also, ask your dr about the pathology report on the core biopsy.  Are they absolutely sure that the necrotic tissue is adipose, and not dead cancer cells? Necrotic cancer cells also will usually reabsorb over time, without ill effects, but it's important to differentiate whether these are dead normal cells or part of a tumor that died.  If there's any doubt that they might be tumor cells, you will want to make sure there is no evidence of live cells in the surrounding area.  (PET scan might or might not be a good choice for this - if there is inflammation or infection, the scan might show a false positive.) OK - I've not seen any messages about this subject on Cancer Compass in the past 8 - 9 months, but then I haven't seen every message on the board, either.  If you don't get any other responses to your query, you might try doing an internal search on CC to see if there are any past message threads that would have answers for you.  Check for cancers other than breast cancer - radiation can kill off adipose tissue in ANY part of the body, and necrotic adipose tissue might actually be more common in radiation of stomach and colon cancers. I imagine subsequent treatment would be much the same regardless of location.  Other resources you might try are www.drsusanloveresearchfoundation.org and http://ww5.komen.org/ (the Susan Komen foundation).  They might have information on this, or you might try sending them an email asking if they can direct you to someone for treatment.  I believe there is a \"contact us\" link on both sites.

      "Content": "Hi Ninasuzie, I'm sorry you had to join this club.  Scary and disheartening stuff, that's for sure.  I am a big advocate of breast conservation for most women, but invasive cancer can be quite a different beast.  While they can't accurately stage the cancer until the surgery, were they able to grade it based on the biopsy, and have they been able to say how aggressive they think it is?  With staging, the lower the number the better, but with grading, the opposite is true - the higher the grade number the better.  So, if this is a not very aggressive cancer with a higher grade, you might be ok with a very thorough lumpectomy.  However, if this is aggressive (as it might be - 4.5 cm is a pretty big tumor) and/or low grade, you might do well to consider telling them to just take the whole thing so as to maximize the chances of removing all the cancer.  (Also, consider - if the margins AREN'T clear when they do the path exam of tissue from  your lumpectomy - as happened with me - you're gonna have to have a 2nd surgery anyway, at which time they may or may not be able to conserve remaining breast tissue, depending upon the location of the tumor in the breast.) I think societies through out the ages have done women a HUGE disservice to place so much emphasis on the breasts in terms of what constitutes attractiveness and social worth.   Breasts play such a huge role for many women in terms of self image, but I think that's a learned process rather than a trait we are born with.   While our breasts are indeed part of WHAT we are, they really are not WHO we are; WHO we perceive ourselves to be results from the very active decisions we make about how to respond to the world around us. Consider the great women of our time, some of whom are (or were) actually quite flat-chested (and no, I'm not just talking about Twiggy!  Katherine Hepburn, yes!) They forged ahead with life regardless of how much padding they did or didn't have! To combine the comments of two other frequent posters to the board:  They're just boobs.  You can replace the girls, but you can't replace your life! I wish you the best in making this tough decision, and in your treatment.  Please keep us posted on how you are doing.  Cancer Compass is one of the greatest clubs in the world - we collectively try to support those in need, and we all love to do the happy dance when we hear good news!

I would encourage you to talk to your mother about boosting her immune system as much as she possibly can in the days leading up to surgery, chemo, radiation - whatever the treatment might be.  Lots of herbs, supplements, and natural foods available that  both build up the immune system  and fight cancer. e.g. anti-oxidants, cruciferous vegetables, fruits high in citric acid, apple cider vinegar, lots of pure water, ground brown flax seed and/or flax oil with lignins, apples and grapes (eat the seeds, too - a little bitter, but the seeds contain a natural cancer killer), papaya and bromelaine (enzymes), whole grain foods - these are all nutritious cancer killers that also play an important part in immune system health.  Both research and anecdotal experience is revealing grape seed extract as an extremely effective weapon against breast cancer, and it too works to boost the immune system. Exercise is important not just to build up her stamina and oxygenate her body, but to boost her spirits as well.  Doesn't have to be extremely strenuous, but would help to do some type of exercise 20 - 30 minutes a day, enough to release endorphins that may give her a sense of well-being that is so hard to find in times like these.  Add to that some humor, every day.  Belly laughter is extremely powerful medicine, with chuckling and smiling coming in a close 2nd and 3rd.  Especially important to maintain an active sense of humor after treatment has begun. Let us know if have questions about naturally healing foods, etc, to help your mom get ready for treatment, and to sustain her during treatment.  I'll be glad to share references and more ideas, as I'm sure will other posters on the board. I wish you and your mom the best.  Please keep us informed of your progress. Sincerely, Tre    ",

You might consider focusing your efforts on prevention through natural means. Even something as simple as supplementing with a few very basic minerals and vitamins, plus drinking plenty of fresh pure water and getting regular exercise, plus focusing as much as possible on eating raw, fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains/legumes can make a tremendous impact on preventing cancer in someone who's already had it. Leading advocates of natural therapies recommend that at the very least people should take the following supplements (or ensure that they are getting this amount in their food):  selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  These are excellent sites if you want to learn more about natural treatment and prevention of cancer: http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us You are also welcome to look at my blog for examples of natural choices that for many people may fight and/or prevent cancer: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers (There are quite a few other articles on the blog - please feel free to look through whatever interests you.)

Remember, it's ok to be scared, but it's NOT ok to let your fear control you.  Seek help from whatever resources you have:  family, friends, local support groups, etc.  Ask your doctor who they would recommend locally to give you moral and emotional support and assistance such as helping with meals, or someone to go with you to chemo, etc.  Don't do this alone. Try to find humor wherever and whenever you can.  Laughter is one of the greatest weapons in the battle against disease.  And make sure to keep yourself as healthy as you can - eat lots of green leafy veggies, lots of legumes, and fresh fruit.  Drink plenty of pure water (steam distilled water is great for cleansing the body of toxins.)  Try to get some kind of exercise every day.  Fresh air and sunshine are great healers - just make sure to ask your doctor how much you can be in the sun, because some chemotherapy and radiation therapies can make you very susceptible to sunburn.  If you are an animal lover, have pets or someone you know has pets, try to spend some time with them, too.  Animals can be great at giving unconditional TLC.  My cats were a great comfort to me when I was going through multiple surgeries, chemo and radiation. And make sure you have someone to talk to, to give you a hug when you need it, and to just be there for you.  Leaning on another's strength can go a long way toward erasing fear and instilling hope and courage. If the web page I gave you doesn't help, and if others don't answer your message, keep looking on the internet, and talk to local cancer groups - they may have resources that you might not find otherwise.  I wish you the very best.

(Or as the folk saying goes, \"Don't let yesterday take up too much of today.\") At the same time, you can't let tomorrow take up too much of today, either. What will be is in part determined by how we live right now, minute to minute, day to day. In choosing to live in the hear and now, we can be powerfully proactive toward preventing the future from mirroring the past. Find a good cancer diet chock full of fresh raw produce (organic is best) whenever possible.  Drink plenty of fresh pure water (steam-distilled or revers-osmosis filtered are best.)  Get lots of good aerobic exercise.  Make sure you are getting enough of the vitamins and minerals the body needs to maintain a healthy immune and cancer-fighting system.  Most of the leading advocates of natural/alternative therapies say there are 5 minerals that are absolutely essential to anyone trying to prevent or fight cancer, and there is one vitamin that must be added to make these minerals work: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium.

Don't just think that you don't want the beast to come back - become proactive at keeping it away. I highly recommend Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th ed. by Dr Susan Love.  many women consider this to be their bible on breast health.  It is an excellent place to start for information on how to keep one's breast and body healthy.

Some clinicians are coming to suspect that surgical intervention in cancer may cause problems leading to metastasis by seeding individual tiny groups of cells from an area that has cancer to areas that don't have cancer. I have seen some research that indicates this might be possible with prophylactic mastectomy if indeed there are already precancerous cells trying to proliferate.   Here is a link to a report on breast cancer, both causes and prevention, published by AP John Cancer Institute. It's pretty informative about things that can be done to decrease the potential of proliferation of pre-cancerous cells. The second link is to their \"Cancer Detox System\"  - the articles are kind of technical, but I think they are plow-through-able:   http://www.apjohncancerinstitute.org/breast.htm   http://www.apjohncancerinstitute.org/cancer.htm    I am hoping you will take a look at some other resources as concerns using diet/nutrition, herbs, and supplements to boost the immune system and prevent cancer.

      "Content": "Hi Jodie, I'm so sorry treatment isn't working for you. I cannot imagine how heartbroken you must have been when told this news. There is a lot of creditable evidence that as cancer metastasizes, it can also mutate and become drug resistant. Nodules in the lungs, lymph system, other organs may not have the same exact pathology as tumors in the breast, and cancer spots can exist that are too small to detect at the time of biopsy; as treatment progresses, those cancers adapt to that treatment so that while it may be effective for the original tumor or site of metastasis, over time that treatment just won't work for everything.  That may be the case with you. Unfortunately, Herceptin hasn't been in use long enough for there to be much if anything in the way  of long-term study results (10 - 20 years), especially for those who began treatment when they already had advanced disease.  That also might mean that there isn't the kind of info available on how to proceed when Herceptin fails that we would like there to be. (non-sequitor: Before I forget - just for a laugh, being bald might not be bad for a clown - you could paint funny pictures on your head!) But seriously, have you considered complementary or alternative medicine: using herbs, diet, supplements, even a more formal alternative protocol? Your dr may have some suggestions about which he/she feels hopeful (I am wondering if  Taxol will be one of them?), and if you want to keep hitting this hard with conventional treatment, then I say \"Go for it.\" But I would encourage you to at least take a look at natural therapies.  There are things you can do in addition to  chemo, and there are treatments many people are doing instead of chemo.  I may be repeating info I've given you before, but I seriously believe in the ability of the human body to use proper amounts of natural substances to boost the immune system and to fight cancer.  Everybody's body chemistry is different, but there are some nutrients and compounds that EVERYONE needs to fight this disease, and many people just aren't getting them in sufficient quantities: e.g. selenium; zinc; vitamin c; b vitamins; the fat soluble vitamins A, D and E I posted a message to a previous herceptin thread that I'm hoping it will help you to read - my post is a few messages down the thread: http://www.cancercompass.com/message-board/message/all,27787 I very highly recommend the book I mention in the message. I also highly recommend two sites: http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org You are also welcome to take a look at the herbal/supplemental/diet regimen I am using - not as a recommendation for a regimen for you (as I said, everyone's body chemistry is different - what works for me might NOT work for you, especially since our breast cancers are quite different in makeup) - but rather just to get an idea of some simple things that can be done to fight cancer nutritionally.  I am also including the link for my story - I haven't been through as tough of trials as you are now facing, but I am hoping you will take encouragement from what I have written.

      "Content": "Many people forego the radiation. What's most important is that you are at peace with your decision - how we feel about ourselves (the decisions we make) can either positively or negatively influence the chemical balance of our bodies, and that in turn can either work to prevent or promote cancer.  The more postively we feel about ourselves, the better our body chemistry will be. As for the Arimidex, many also forego that, or get into treatment and then decide to quit because the side effects are so bad.  But there is a way to achieve the same results as arimidex, without the side effects, and with the added advantage of being able to control just how much we estrogen deplete ourselves.  That way is through the use of natural therapy to both block estrogen reception and inhibit aromatase, just as the prescription drugs do.  Foods, plants, herbs, and some supplements contain phytochemicals - in this case the active ones we seek are phytosterols/phytoestrogens.  Weak phytoestrogens will act as estrogen blockers or aromatase inhibitors (the desired effect), whereas strong phytoestrogens will act like hormone  replacement therapy (undesired effect.)  Some naturals and supplements affect the body's production of estrogen in other ways.  e.g. plain aspirin, when used once daily as a supplement, inhibits the release of prostaglandins that are needed to produce aromatase. Very simple thing to do - take 325mg aspirin everyday. Not ALL you need to do, but when combined with other natural approaches, very effective. Estradiol is the form of estrogen that cancer uses to feed. My estradiol level was in the 20's a year ago ; with use of natural alternatives it was down below 5 about 3 weeks ago. (Which actually is TOO low - as my skin is protesting, so now I am trying to raise it just a little bit.) Mention that the brain uses estrogen also, and that the effect of arimidex, etc, on the brain has not been studied is very interesting.  The only research I have seen on this was aimed at the effects of herbs - I think specifically grape-seed extract - on estrogen production and utilization.  The study did look at cognitive effects, and did not find any deficits. As long as the body does not TOTALLY shut down production of estrogen, and as long as the naturals being used do not easily cross the blood brain barrier, it seems from this study that the effect on the brain is minimal.  (Of course very severe estrogen depletion WILL limit availability.) So it seems important to use a combination of estrogen blockers AND aromatase inhibitors - cut down some but not totally on the production of estrogen, and use estrogen blockers that do not cross the blood brain barrier but instead will block receptor sites in places such as the breast, the major organs other than the brain. I'm not saying I have a formula for doing that - but I believe it could be done. As for how I got my estradiol level so low, I have published my natural regimen on my blog - you are welcome to look at it.  I do not intend this as a prescription for anyone - everyone's body chemistry is different, and what is a good combination of naturals for me is not necessarily a good combination for someone else.  However, there are many simple and inexpensive things I do that could be of benefit to others, and I have tried to highlight them in my blog article. Please feel free to look at anything else on the blog that interests you. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Please pay attention to my recommendations on selenium, calcium, manganese, magnesium, zinc and vitamin D-3.  Many experts on alternative therapies say these elements are absolutely essential for anyone fighting cancer or trying to prevent recurrence.

In fact, because the bones are so rich in blood supply and so closely tied into the nerves, bone cancer pain can be quite severe, whether the cancer is primary or metastatic, or  very localized or more widely spread through out the bone.  Even if the metastasis is well confined to one point in your mom's back, the pain could radiate so that it seems like everything hurts. some people will have accompanying muscle spasms due to the changing calcium content in the blood stream, and that can be extremly painful, also. One of the risks of bone metastasis is osteoporosis, where the bones lose calcium, become brittle and break.  And yes, that is extremely painful also.  Hopefully the test results will be back soon, so the dr will know whether to treat with pain meds, if there is a fracture, if the Aredia is working, etc.  In the meantime, you might try to help your mom get relief from the pain through a mind technique - focusing on other things present in the here and now. (I've used this myself in a very simplified form.  I look at my cat, focusing solely on the cat, and I say either silently or aloud, \"I see the cat, I hear the cat, I feel the cat.\" and I keep repeating that same thing over and over until the pain is either subsided enough to be bearable or even better, totally gone.) You could get more information about mind techniques like this from the internet (search items: mind techniques to manage pain, or mindfulness technique - which is a somewhat different thing,) or ask your mom's dr about a referral to a pain clinician. I am not specifically familiar with Aredia, although I do know it is being  used mostly for treatment of myeloma, and is supposed to not only slow advancement of disease, but also decrease pain and reduce fractures. Some people on it will still have bone pain due to their underlying disease - I don't know if this lasts as treatment goes on or not. If you don't get any other answers on this message board specifically addressing the Aredia, you might try posting your question on the multiple myeloma board - responders there are sure to know a lot more about the drug than I do, and they may also have suggestions on how to help your mom deal with the pain. I wish you and your mom the best. Sincerely, Tre  ",

Tracie Hi Tracie, Glad to hear your mom is doing better. Difficult to answer your question. Did the dr actually say that there is no metastasis to the bone, or that there was but it is now  all gone? Or did he just say the bone looks better?    Could by saying that \"everything is fine' he have meant that the medicine is doing what it is sposed to do, that there is no bone rubbing against bone, no broken bone, etc - that the pain is normal, to be expected from  the disease and/or the action of the medicine?   Is your mom still on the Aredia?  If so, he's still treating the bone for something, and he expects her to continue to have pain, at least for now. The fact that he did mention radiation leads me to believe he is still treating her for metastasis to the bone.  Call the dr's office and ask (mom may have to make the call if they don't have permission to give information to you.)  If they say it's NOT cancer, ask them to explain what it is, and why radiation would be appropriate if the pain meds don't work.  After all, you're paying them for information as well as treatment! Good luck, and take care, Tre  ",

I doubt that I ever would have found it had I not had very sudden excruciating pain when the tumor started pressing on the nerve,  and hidden so high in the breast that it was unlikely that it would have been caught on mammogram without my already knowing that it was there and being able to tell the tech that she didn't yet have enough of my breast in the machine to show the lump.  My one symptom came very late - it was already stage II when I had my surgery. That's why I encourage women not to depend upon presence or absence of symptoms when a biopsy can give them a definite answer. Best wishes to you, Tre",

      "Content": "I was on Adriamycin and Taxol - I had a pretty healthy dose with each treatment, but I only had 4 treatments, once a month.  (Perhaps I should have had more - 5 years later we found nodules in my lungs - metastasis from the same cancer.) Yes, adriamycin can be a nasty drug.  They don't call it the \"red devil\" for nothing. I lost my hair, which was not that big a deal for me.  I made if fun when I could - which was quite a bit of the time.   I was nauseated quite a lot, but never to the point of throwing up.  Phenergan made me really sleepy, which I couldn't afford as I was trying to still work, so the dr put me on Zofran - very expensive, but very effective.  I just took it around the clock for about the first 5 or 6 days after chemo, then I only needed it once, maybe twice a day.   I was very tired - that was probably also due to the fact that I'd had 3 major surgeries in 4 months before I started chemo.   My blood count never went low - I took Neutrogen the first 2 treatments, then I realized that I really felt like I had the flu after I took my shots, so I didn't take it with the 3rd and 4th treatments, and did ok..  I did try really hard to eat lots of veggies and really nutritious food as much as I could, so I could keep my blood count up and have more energy.  Food just didn't taste good, so it was hard to eat, but I drank purple grape juice (as cold as I could get it) whenever I ate something, and that really helped.  I also found I did much better with bitter or sour foods, rather than sweet or spicy. The biggest problem I had was some shortness of breath - which I again attributed to the fact that I'd had a lot of surgery before the chemo - and chest pain. Both adriamycin and taxol have cause chest pain for some people, more so the adriamycin than the taxol. I was hospitalized overnight for testing and observation, oxygen.  Turns out my heart and lungs were just fine.  They thought the chest pain might be due to irritation of the soft tissues of the chest wall from the chemo. Does the dr want to add the adriamycin to the cytoxan AND taxotere? That would be a pretty tough combination of drugs.  Usually they just do the cytoxan and adriamycin, or the taxotere and adriamycin, or like I had, taxol and adriamycin.  You might ask about having the latter combination, as taxol tends to have less side effects than either the cytoxin or taxotere. Also, for the neutropenia - really try to boost your intake of foods rich in B vitamins, as they are the primary building blocks for bone marrow and blood cells. That and foods that are rich in iron.  Many people say to severely limit intake of iron because cancer cells thrive on iron, but the fact is that if you are only getting a little bit of iron, the cancer is going to gobble it up and there won't be any left for your normals cells.  And we just can't keep up our bloodstream, or our oxygenation, without adequate iron.  If you want to learn more about how these work, and foods that are rich sources of blood builders, take a look at my blog.  I have a series of articles on the B complex vitamins - a little easier and hopefully more informative reading than a lot of what you get on the internet.  Just put vitamin B in the search box on the blog, and start with the earliest article (post #1), and work your way thru to post #10. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com Wishing you the best with your treatment, Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Yes, there have been women whom medical personnel could tell without a doubt that they had breast cancer without having to do a biopsy first - but these were VERY advanced cancers with very serious already evident complications.  My dr was telling me about such a patient last week. This older lady knew she had a problem for months and months and months, but she kept denying it - kept saying it was just infection. By the time she went to the dr, the cancer was so advanced that it was too late to save her life. I don't think you should take that risk. Absent VERY VERY advanced symptoms, a biopsy is the ONLY way to without doubt tell if a spot is breast cancer or not. Some drs will recommend waiting to see if a calcification gets bigger, but if your dr wants to do biopsy now, I think that's pretty sound advice.  If done properly, and there is no nerve involvement with the calcifications, biopsy most likely will be uncomfortable but not painful.   Waiting for the pathology report will most likely be more uncomfortable than the actual biopsy - but at least you will then know one way or the other, and won't have to live second-guessing your decisions. There are risks with needle biopsy, and your dr should inform you of them, but when compared to the risks of having cancer go undiagnosed and continue to grow and cause more and more problems, I would (and did) choose to have the biopsy.

Hi Nanbaja, I'm the lady Shemay was telling you about (Thanks, Shemay!)  How wonderful for you to have caught this cancer so early and to have such a good surgical outcome!  And how wonderful that you want to pursue preventing recurrence naturally rather than the Arimidex!  Surviving cancer really is best when one embraces a natural change in lifestyle to promote optimal health! I too would recommend you look at my blog - if you look at the archive, you can find the links for my story, and my regimen (not intended as a prescription for others, but certainly includes many naturals that you could use as well. My cancer was not progestin positive, so there may be additional very simple things you could do on that front - I have not done any in-depth research for PR positive breast cancer, but from what I've seen in passing, I don't think anything in my regimen is contraindicated with ER/PR positive cancer.) Please take note of my recommendations on selenium, magnesium, manganese, calcium, zinc and vitamin D-3 (outlined in the article on my personal regimen.) There are also some excellent websites you might want to take a look at: www.cancertutor.com    (You want to check out stage I treatments plus the cancer diets.) www.lefcancer.org www.alkalizeforhealth.net Also \"Dr Susan Love's Breast Book\" 4th edition is an excellent reference for both breast cancer and breast health. Dr Susan Love is a breast cancer survivor, deeply involved in research to eradicate breast cancer within her lifetime.  Her book is considered by many women to be the \"bible\" on breast care. I highly recommend you get the book. I have just ordered a book on the herbal treatment of breast cancer and maintaining breast health herbally. The book was shipped today, so I hope to have it within a week.  If you would care to use the email link in my blog to send me your email address, I will be happy to search through the book for additional answers for you once I receive it. Please refer to this message from CC in the subject line so I'll know who you are and  will not think it is spam. Also, once you've had a chance to look at some alternative references to get an idea of what's reasonable in the way of things to do, I suggest you seek out a local licensed or certified naturopath, for at least evaluation and consultation. Everyone's body chemistry is different, so what works for one might not work for another - is good to have a professional make some recommendations, especially if you have any other medical conditions that need to be taken into consideration.  If you can't find a naturopath, consider consulting a homeopathic or osteopathic practitioner, or someone experienced in traditional chinese medicine or ayurvedic medicine. You might also consider an herbalist that has a good reputation and experience in helping with breast cancer.  You don't HAVE to have professional recommendations to proceed with a natural prevention regimen of your own, but I think it would be money and time well-spent, especially if you find somebody you trust that is available to you locally.  I haven't yet said  much about exercise on my blog - other than to recommend walking or swimming, and that everyone should exercise - but I can tell you one of the best exercises for women who've had mastectomy is something fun that can be done quite easily in the home, and doesn't require a lot of time or energy.  Rebounding - bouncing on a mini-trampoline - is EXCELLENT exercise for breast health, especially in keeping lymph fluids moving and preventing or loosening up scarring.  The alkalizeforhealth site has an excellent article on rebounding - you can probably search the site for it.  I think that site's recommendation for frequency and duration of rebounding are not harmful, but perhaps a little more than some women need - I recommend a miniumum of bouncing twice a day for 3 minutes each.  Also, if you purchase a rebounder, it doesn't have to be expensive - I got mine from a national department store chain for $30 - it works just fine! Feel free to contact me if you have questions. Sincerely, Tre  ",

As for the hair loss so soon, everyone reacts differently to chemo.  I Don't know what you're getting, how high a dose - that makes a difference.  it may also be that you're getting really good uptake of the medicine - that is a good thing.  (Remember, bald is beautiful - wear it like a badge, and let it be a proud reminder that you are taking a proactive approach to getting well. I had fun wearing my bandanas and an outrageous hat, and I also thought it was cool to slide my hands over my very round bald head - soft and cuddly  as a baby's behind!) Be sure to stay well hydrated - you need it for the chemo to work, and to detoxify. You might try using a pure glycerin soap on your face.  It's very gentle yet cleanses very well, without allowing a lot of chemical buildup that could harbor bacteria causing acne.  A pure olive oil soap might work as well - the more chemicals you can avoid, the better. Also, make sure you are taking a really good B complex  vitamin supplement - one that has as much of the B vitamins as you can get in it.  That will help  your immune system,  as well as provide essential nutrients for the skin.

      "Content": "Try increasing your intake of whole grains and legumes - especially any kind of beans  (the lignans in the hulls are especially good for treating constipation.)  Ground flax seed is also a good choice - very high in lignans, plus lots of phytochemicals that fight cancer. Mix it up with apple sauce.  Oat meal is a great choice. Grapes, eaten with the skins and seeds are actually very good for getting the bowels to move, and they are cancer fighters also.  (red, black or purple grapes, or purple grape juice)  Apples, eaten with the skin (and you can eat the core, including the seeds - everything except the stem) are an excellent choice.  Apple cider works extremely well - the dark, thicker kind, rather than pasteurized cider that looks like apple juice.  Although apple juice is a good choice if you can't get cider (kind of the wrong time of year for cider.) You might also try drinking a cup of moderately hot water in the morning when you first get up.  Helps to hydrate -  warm and hot fluids are absorbed more quickly into the intestine than are cold fluids - and the heat will stimulate the normal motion of the bowel. Hot tea and coffee can also be used - I recommend green tea, unless you are on a blood thinner.  There is always the good old standby - prunes. Any of these remedies will provide benefit nutritionally while you are on chemo, as well as hopefully getting things moving along while still being fairly gently on the stomach and bowel.

Should I get a second opinion and are there any other alternative or options in term of medication or vitamins that I can take to avoid the biopsy? And If I opt out of the biopsy will I contract cancer at some point?           ADH is considered by some physicians to be a \"pre-cancer\", yet not by others. Many physicians believe that women with ADH are much more prone to develop cancer. (The statistic I saw was about 5.3 times more likely to develop cancer with ADH.) Statistics have also shown that ADH is more likely to become cancer for premenopausal women than postmenopausal women. At 46 that might still be an important consideration for you, especially if you have not yet begun menopause.  Another indicator for what ADH might mean for you has to do with how it was diagnosed. When ADH is found through needle aspiration biopsy or core biopsy, the consensus is that open surgical biopsy is then  indicated, as 20 - 28% of women have been found to have cancer cells next to it, or even an in situ or invasive cancer already developing.  (With larger surgical biopsy you can be more confident that the whole area has been removed.) Even if you choose to get a 2nd opinion, I think you will likely hear that removal of the mass is indicated.   If you choose not to have the mass removed, you will need close follow up to make sure that if this does convert to cancer, you can get treatment as soon as possible (follow up would include physical exam at least every six months and yearly mammogram/sonogram.) Some women choose not to have the ADH removed but rather to have this treated with tamoxifen. Statistics show that women with ADH who took tamoxifen for 5 years had 86% decrease in subsequent breast cancers than those who had no treatment, so it certainly is worth considering this approach.  Right now, as long as there are no actual cancer cells that have escaped diagnosis, this mass can't metastasize.  Regardless of what you do, your focus needs to be on ensuring that it doesn't convert so that it can metastasize. Tamoxifen seems to do that. Removing the mass most likely will also do that - as long as it's certain that it is totally pre-cancerous. Here again, removal of the mass has the advantage of allowing visualization/biopsy  of the tissue around the mass, to make sure that there is no cancer that wasn't seen on mammogram or sonogram. There is natural therapy/approach that may well be able to keep this from converting to cancer, and perhaps even cause the ADH to reverse. (Yes, this IS reversible.)  A much less painful way of approaching the problem (even with tamoxifen you might have some trouble some side effects resembling menopause), and much less expensive than surgery, but it also needs to become a way of life rather than something you can do for a few months.  In fact, regardless of whether or not you have the mass removed, I would recommend adopting this natural kind of lifestyle to help prevent any other problems in the future.  This approach includes diet (the closer you can get to a true vegan diet, the better,) some supplementation, and inclusion of herbs known to help prevent cancer. My best recommendation would be to seek out a holistic practitioner for some advice.  A naturopathic oncologist would be best. If that's not possible, seek out a naturopathic dr, a homeopath, or even some osteopaths have experience with this.  You could also get a consult from someone experienced in traditional chinese medicine or ayurvedic medicine.   If you have access to an extremely reputable and experienced herbalist, they might also be able to guide you.  If you're overweight, you need to lose the extra pounds - obesity has definitely been shown to be a factor in breast cancer. You need to increase intake of cruciferous vegetables and fresh, raw fruit (any kind of berry with the seeds, pineapple, papaya, citrus fruit, and an apple/day - eat the seeds, too.)  High intake of carotenoids and lycopene (tomatoes) is especially helpful. Increase dietary intake of vitamin E and A helps, along with vitamin C-3 and calcium.  Five minerals and one vitamin that EVERYONE needs to prevent or fight cancer are: selenium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc and vitamin D-3.  Exercies if very important, also. One study showed that women who got 4 or more hours of exercise/week had a 58% decrease in breast cancer.  Hydration is extremely important.  Unless you have a kidney problem, 80 to 100 ounces of pure fresh (non-chlorinated) water a day is ideal.  (Steam-distilled or reverse osmosed is best.) Most of my research on naturals and alternatives has been aimed at already diagnosed cancers rather than prevention, but there are many things I do in my personal natural regimen that are good for cancer prevention as well as treatment.  I have published my regimen on my blog, if you want to read through it to get some ideas on simple and inexpensive things you can start doing right now to improve your breast health.  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers (I am NOT suggesting my regimen as a prescription for others, but rather as an example. Also, I still recommend that you talk to a naturopath yourself, as you may have health considerations or factors other than this ADH that should be taken into account.) www.lefcancer.org is an excellent site that talks much about using naturals in prevention as well as treatment.  \"Dr Susan Love's Breast Book\" 4th edition, by Dr Susan Love is considered by many women to be the \"bible\" on breast health. (It is my primary reference for this reply to your message, but you will find MUCH more of value in the book than what I have written.) I hope this helps, and I wish you the best. Feel free to contact me by private reply if you have more questions.  There is also a link to my email on my blog. Sincerely, Tre  ",

Number 3:  You may already be having a buildup of lymphedema, even if it is not measurable.  Even slight lymphedema can be quite painful, depending upon the location.  What the dr is saying is a buildup of scar tissue could actually be tissue that has not scarred, but rather is fibrotic from lymph swelling.  Again, if that is the case, myofascial release is part of the solution. You could also try gentle stretching exercises in a heated pool if your incisions are well enough healed to be in the water (the Y offers a water therapy program for breast cancer survivors - I can't think of what it's called, and I don't know if it's available everywhere, but it wouldn't hurt to call the nearest Y and ask them.) Regardless of whether it's lymph edema or scarring, exercising with a rebounder (36\" mini-trampoline) will also help.  This article explains: http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Gentle bouncing on a rebounder for as little as 3 minutes twice a day can significantly help relieve lymphedema and its accompanying problems.  Rebounders are sold as many department stores, some for as little as $30 (my $30 rebounder supports up to 250 pounds, and works just fine!) You might also try sleeping with your head and shoulders elevated - enough to get your shoulders above the level of your heart, and your heart above the level of your belly button. This will help promote drainage, and ease the pressure on nerves that were affected by your surgery.  I have lymphedema in my arm and shoulder on one side, so I also sleep with my fingers higher than my elbow, and my elbow higher than my shoulder.  Took a lot of creative trials to find a pillow arrangement that works, but it has been worth the effort in terms of the relief I get from improved drainage of the arm and shoulder. Many women who have had lumpectomies or mastectomies suffer from chronic nerve pain. Taking a good B complex vitamin supplement can help with this.  Some have recommended Neurontin - I have not tried it so cannot say if it helps or not. I highly recommend Dr Susan Love's Breast Book  - it is consider by many women to be THE bible on breast health and breast disease, including cancer.  Get the 4th ed if you can, as it is the most up-to-date. There are also many excellent links to articles about PostMastectomy Pain Syndrome on www.cancerlynx.com. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Dear Heather,  Take things one moment at a time.  Step back, take some big deep breaths, and refocus on what you know.  And what you know, right now, is that the dr saw something that he/she isn't sure what it is, so they want to find out.  Biopsy is the best way to do that - get a little bit of whatever it is they see that they can't identify, look at it under the microscope, and find out for sure. Right now you need to just prepare yourself for the biopsy, and not worry about all the \"what if's\" that could be out there. Make sure you understand whatever instructions you've been given to prepare for the biopsy. Make sure that you're well-hydrated - drink plenty of pure fresh water in the next few days.  make sure you have someone to go with you and to drive you home afterward.  Find out if you should take something for pain before they do the biopsy, and what the dr would prefer you take. Make a list of questions and concerns about the biopsy about - not \"what if this is cancer\" - and get them answered before the biopsy is done.  That way you can go into this educated and prepared. FInd something constructive to do to occupy your time between now and the biopsy, and then for the several days that you are likely to have to wait before you get the results.  Unoccupied time is NOT your friend right now - gives you too much opportunity to start worrying again.  With Christmas coming up, I'm sure there is still lots to do in your household for your kids, etc.  Devote yourself to that - it will serve you well. As for biopsy results, again, you just have to take the waiting one moment at a time.  Focus on the things you need to do.  If you've done all that, then look at projects you've been wanting to do but maybe have put off, perhaps because you haven't had time.  Take the time to do them now.  This will help you relax and not be so afraid. Make sure to do some really fun things in the next few days, and the next few weeks.  Encourage hilarity in your daily life, and for your family.  The more you can laugh, the better you will feel.  Laughter and a positive attitude release very important endorphins that lead to a sense of well-being.  Nothing wrong with promoting that feeling of well-being right now.   If the biopsy comes back bad news, approach that the same way - one moment at a time, get educated, ask questions, and breathe, breathe, breathe.  If it comes back really good news, do the happy dance and sing a silly little song for yourself!! And please let us know how this turns out, so that we can either join you in the happy dance, or be there to offer support if you need it! Take care, and have a good holiday! Sincerely, Tre",

I had my ultra sound yesterday and received great news. I have two very small benign cysts that will not require any additional treatment unless they start to bother me.  Now I just need to do the right things to try and minimize the cysts. If I could only come up with a solution to the PAIN I feel every month after I ovulate and the few days before my period starts. My breasts hurt so much that if someone just breathes on them I want to scream! No cancer is great news!! Now, as for dealing with the fibrocystic problems - not always easy, but hang in there.  Relief is available, it just may take some trial and error to find it. I am a great advocate of herbal and nutritional treatment - not necessarily as a replacement for prescriptions and treatment by a doctor, but certainly as an addition to those things.  while I could recommend some herbs that might help with the pain, reduce cysts, etc, not all people are chemically the same in terms of what they can safely ingest and how they react to natural treatment, so what I say helps me or other women, might not help you.  And I certainly wish to do no harm by advising something that might not be a good choice for you personally. So, I recommend that you spend some time on the internet, at the library, at a bookstore such as Barnes and Noble or Dalton's or whatever you have locally, researching the subject.  For internet searches a good place to start is \"herbal treatment of fibrocystic breast disease.\"  (Fibrocystic breasts are a condition rather than a disease, but for years the medical community has treated it as a disease, so use of that terminology will get you results.)  Check out http://www.all-natural.com/fibrocys.html - the site talks about something I mentioned earlier - that wearing a bra may actually contribute to the problem.  Lots of women that are very large breasted find it uncomfortable not to wear a bra, but I think even if those women wean away from bra-wearing gradually, they can get significant relief of fibrocystic pain.) A great reference book is \"Prescription for Nutritional Healing,\" by Phyllis Balch.  Very expensive, so if you can find it in a bookstore or library, make good use of the table of contents and index and take notes rather than buying it. If you do start supplementation with herbs, etc, start slow.  Unless you already know you can tolerate what is recommended, try just one at first, for at least a week.  If you have reactions to it, stop taking it and move on to something else.  If you tolerate it ok, make it the first part of your regimen, and add another.  Probably not everything you find recommended  is going to work for you, nor will you necessarily need to take EVERYTHING that is recommended to get good results.  Some supplements can be expensive, and insurance will not cover them, so it's ok to start with the cheaper stuff first. Exercise can be an important factor in managing fibrocystic changes.  I highly recommend swimming, especially lap swimming in an indoor pool.  (really cold water or too hot water is not comfortable when your breasts hurt.)  If you have a local YMCA or YWCA with a pool, or a local college with a pool(s) open to the public, those can be a great place to swim.  Swimming strengthens the chest muscles to help support breast tissue naturally, and it increases circulation to the breast, which helps to remove toxins and keep cysts small.  Plus it releases natural endorphins that generate a feeling of well-being and relieve pain. If swimming is not an option, try gentle weight-lifting, focusing primarily on the chest, back, arm and shoulder muscles.  Strengthening these muscles increases support and circulation the same way as swimming - you just need to be careful you don't injure yourself.  And you don't need fancy weights or a spa membership - household objects like canned food, laundry jugs filled with water, etc work just fine.  Find stuff that weighs one pound and five pounds and devise your own routine.  start easy and work your way up. And using a rebounder is still a good idea - the NASA astronauts use it for muscular toning and to stimulate circulation.  Last, but certainly not least, you may need to change your routine in the shower.  Many women with fibrocystic breast find it more comfortable to use lukewarm rather than hot water, and to let the water hit their backs rather than their breasts.  Keep in mind there are herbs and supplements, natural foods that will also help reduce the other trials of ovulating and having your period. You may want to include those subjects in your research. Good luck, and hopefully in the future, painfree living to you!! Tre   ",

The radiologist called me this morning and explained that my mammogram revealed 2 small nodules in my right breast. She indicated they were small, round and have smooth edges which she stated was a good thing. She even said not to worry because it looked promising. She said that women my age are subject to cysts and that my breasts are fibrocystic and dense - Perfect place for cysts to grow. I pray she is correct. We will see Weds when I have my ultra sound & mammogram. Dear sjmjuly, Hopefully your doctor will/has talked to you about how to minimize complications from fibrocystic breasts,   If not, please ask.  Many women have  pain unnecessarily, because they aren't taught the basics. One of the most important things you can do is to avoid caffeine, in any form.  If you only do one thing to take care of your breasts, that is the one thing you should choose. Also avoid foods/beverages that are very high in refined sugars, especially soda pop.  (even diet - there is some thinking that aspartame and cyclomates, other artificial sweeteners can contribute to fibrocystic problems.) Most practitioners will recommend that women with fibrocystic breasts wear a good supportive bra. However, if there are dense cysts at points where the bra constricts (e.g. where the strap joins the cup), wearing a bra can be painful.  If so, try wearing a looser fitting sports bra or no bra at all. This actually may be more comfortable.  A non-constricting sports bra is, however, a good idea for jogging or other activities that cause a lot of bouncing. Exercising with a mini-trampoline (also called a rebounder) can also do wonders for minimizing fibrous cysts.  3 minutes of very gentle bouncing twice a day will do wonders - mobilizes fluids to carry them away.  Doesn't require anything fancy - just gently bouncing without your feet leaving the mat, or walking in place on the mat is all you need.  Many department stores sell inexpensive rebounders that are pretty sturdy, or you can order them online.  And it's fun exercise that helps maintain a healthy weight! Good luck! Tre   ",

      "Content": "Hi Dana, Very small lumps can be very difficult to biopsy - even if they do a needle biopsy under ultrasound , they still might not get a true sample if the lump is to small to accurately locate or if it is movable and keeps skimming away from the needle. You might tell your friend to ask the dr about doing a PET scan.  If the lump is too small for needle biopsy, it might also be too small to accurately show up metabolic activity in PET scan, but the procedure is non-invasive and certainly would be better than doing nothing. Another thing you can do is to get your friend started on some cancer-fighting natural elements that can start to work now while she waits to see if this lump gets bigger, etc.  At the very minimum, many leading advocates recommend these supplements: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  Also, recommend your friend drink plenty of pure fresh water (steam-distilled or reverse osmosis filtered are best.)  If she starts taking the above supplements, adequate hydration is important to help them work, and for detoxification.  I understand that you are frightened for what might happen to your friend should this be cancer and she lose valuable time in treating it.  But please remember, everyone reacts to a threat to body image, sense of well-being, possibility of illness in their own way. She might be choosing not to pursue this because she is frightened, too  You can't force your friend to see things your way, but you can offer her support and love and compassion, and by being there for her help her overcome fear and other impediments she may need to overcome.  Sometimes tough love really does need to be tempered with gentility and kindness to obtain the best result.

      "Content": "Hi Cindy, Over the last 5 years your mom's body has learned to cope with a chemically induced menopause. (At her age, a double whammy, as she would have already been through natural menopause.)  That means her body has been functioning on just a tiny amount of estrogen. Once off the drugs, estrogen produced by fat cells, the little amounts she may have still produced by her ovaries, and what she gets through phytoestrogens in food are all now accumulating and starting to fully circulate through her blood stream and into her cells. While this is not a harmful change over the long term, it is sudden, is what is causing her symptoms, and will take a while for your mom's body to get used to being back to normal.  Tell her to avoid soy products, yams, red clover tea, and other foods that are very high in strong phytoestrogens (do a Google or GoodSearch to find out what foods those are - she needs to avoid strong phytoestrogens, weak phytoestrogens are ok)  until she is better getting her equilibrium again.  Then if she wants to reintroduce those foods into her diet, she should do so slowly. Grape seed extract with resveratrol should help. I recommend she take it for a couple of weeks at least, maybe a month.  This will help slow down the influx of estrogen back into her system.  Take the higher dose recommended on the label for a week or two, then go to the lower dose on the label for another week or two. She also needs to drink plenty of pure water.  Even though she is no longer taking the pills, she could still have some of the medicine in her system for as long as 6 months.  Drinking lots of water, plus getting some mild exercise as she can tolerate it, will help her to detoxify. I wish your mom the best. Sincerely, Tre",

This could be a lymph blockage problem - especially if you sleep on the affected side with your arm raised.  This could be scar tissue, muscle swelling, or this could be an orthopedic problem.  Depending on whether muscle tissue was removed with your mastectomy, this could be weakness or absence of the specific muscles needed to maintain that position.   Call your surgeon and ask him, you may even want to make an appt to see him for exam.  If he can find no reason/explanation for your pain, ask him for a referral to an orthopod, so you can get a different type exam and the proper diagnostic tests, treatment, physical therapy, and or medication. Things that you can do in the meantime:  massage, gentle stretching, bouncing on a rebounder.  Gently massage the area several times a day.  If you cannot reach it, have someone else do it for you.  Always massage from the head toward the abdomen, and from the arms toward the breastbone to keep from causing lymph fluids to back up.  Massage may be slightly uncomfortable at first but should not hurt.  If it hurts, you are either massaging too hard and you need to try a lighter touch or there is an underlying injury and you should stop.  Gentle stretching after massage or a warm shower can help break up scar tissue and promote lymph draingage.  While sitting or standing, gently raise your arm over your head, and stretch toward the ceiling in as many directions as you can.  If this causes pain, don't stretch so hard.  If severe pain, stop.  You can also gently grasp your wrist with your other hand, and pull over your head toward the unaffected arm.  Extend your affected arm straight up, place your other hand around the back of your elbow, and pull gently back and toward the unaffected side.  Again, this may at first cause discomfort, but should not cause pain.  If pain, stop.  Rebounding (gently jumping on a minitrampoline - 36\" diameter) is fun, good exercise, and really can help move lymph fluids, gently exercise shoulder joints, help break up scar tissue, and promote a healthy weight while toning up muscles all over the body.  Just 3 minutes twice a day is all you need, although you could certainly do more.  Don't need to do fancy calisthenics on the rebounder - just bounce gently, your feet don't even need to leave the mat.  A simple but sturdy rebounder can be purchased for $40 - 50 at discount department stores, and you can stand it on it's edge out of the way when you aren't using it.  Consult your physician about using a rebounder if you have a serious heart or balance condition or serious arthritis in hips or knees. I started using a rebounder for my lymphedema and to reduce pain from scar tissue.  I have not had to use my compression sleeve since I started rebounding, the pain is gone (including fibrocystic pain,) the scar tissue is palpably MUCH softer, and I have gotten past the plateau I was on in my weight loss program. Hope some or all of this helps.  Good luck!  Tre  ",

      "Content": "Hi Kittycath, If the vaseline bothers you, you can mix the flax oil with something like Replens, or even KY jelly.  Just make sure to start with a brand new container that hasn't been contaminated by handling, and protect the opening of the container thereafter from sources of bacteria. Always wash your hands before mixing, and then again before applying.  And close the mixture up tightly after using.   I also wonder if your skin environment is too acidic - this can cause extreme brittleness of those delicate tissues, as well as bladder/urethral pain and a bladder that is VERY prone to infection. White mulberry is an excellent remedy to alkalinize the urinary and reproductive tracts.  This herb has been used by practitioners of traditional chinese medicine for hundreds of years - it is very safe and very effective. Some health food stores sell mulberry tea - but you have to make sure it is white mulberry, as the other varieties do not offer the same benefit.  I get my white mulberry in supplement form: http://www.swansonvitamins.com/SW1060/ItemDetail?n=429496719 I take 500 mg twice a day - within just 4 or 5 days after I started taking it, my bladder and vulvar symptoms subsided tremendously.  Also important to stay well hydrated.

      "Content": "  On 6/27/2008 JillW wrote: Hi,  I've been searching for information on compression bra's for specifically lymphedema in the breast not extremeties and have only come up with 1 possibly 2 that are available with individual fittings.  There has to be more than 2 that are breast cancer specific and have pouches for changing compression sizes.  Does anyone know of anymore?  This would be a good business venture I'm sure.  Thank you,   In answer to your post and the replies you got: YES, lymphedema in the breast is possible.  The lymph system drains not only the extremities, but also the torso, and if enough lymph nodes were removed from the chest area, or if circulation in the chest is being blocked enough to cause congestion of lymph fluid, lymphedema can result. having had lymphedema, and having had a lot of pain from wearing a compression garment, when i was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer this year I asked my oncologist how to better manage the lymphedema.  She suggested that if wearing the compression garment was painful, then stop wearing it.  she also suggested that if wearing a bra caused me pain, I should stop wearing it. Her reasoning:  these garments may actually contribute more to congestion of lymph fluids than relieve it, because the cause mechanical blockage of the drainage area. There also is very creditable research indicating that compressing, binding garments may worsen lymphedema and may also contribute to cancer by trapping toxins in already stressed cells. I quit wearing my bra, and I no longer have lymphedema pain.  I do, however, continue to do other things to manage lymphedema. I sleep with my arm elevated, making sure my fingers are at the highest point, that my elbow is higher than my shoulder, and that my shoulder is above the level of my heart.  In this way lymph fluids drain by gravity - the same effect that can be achieved by elevating the arm above the head frequently during the day. For breast edema, drainage by gravity at night may be a little more difficult, but I would recommend sleeping with the head, neck AND shoulders higher than the heart.  This will promote drainage to the center of the torso so that fluids can then be processed by the kidneys rather than pooling in tissues. Manual lymph drainage can be done on the chest as well as the arms.  Always massage toward the center of the chest, and downward,  Remember to massage the back of the shoulders, bringing the hand up over the shoulder then down and inward toward the breast bone.  While actually massaging breast tissue, elevate the breast with the same-side hand.  With the opposite hand, gently massage the outside top of the breast toward the armpit, then still keeping the breast elevated,  massage fluid from the armpit across the chest above the breast toward the breast bone.  Do this several times.   Now with the breast still elevated, massage the inside top of the breast downward (from nipple to chest wall) , and then across the chest to the breast bone. To massage the underside of the breast, elevate the breast with the opposite side hand.  Using the same side hand, massage gently downward, doing the underarm area first, then the middle, then the side closest to the breast bone.  Once massaged down away from the underside of the breast, the lymph fluid then should drain by gravity without having to be massaged further toward the center of the body. Gentle stretching of the arms upward, as if reaching toward the sky without tightening the arm muscles, is an easy way to promote gravitational drainage of both arms and breasts, and it helps relieve cell fatigue by promoting circulation.  while stretching, gently wave arms back and forth, or gently shake your hands - this makes your muscles work to increase lymph drainage. Do this exercise as often as possible. (Try doing it for a few seconds every time you use bathroom - it's private, and you'll be amazed at the results you will get!) I am an enthusiastic advocate of rebounding exercise for management of lymphedema.  A rebounder - 36' inch mini-trampoline -  can be purchased fairly inexpensively - you don't need the costly ones to get the lymph benefit you need.  Simple gentle bouncing - your feet don't even have to leave the mat - with your arms elevated for 3 minutes twice a day will do wonders for lymphedema.  Rebounding simulates weightlessness, and this has been documented to increase lymph drainage to the kidneys, regardless of having had lymph nodes removed.  Your calves will hurt the first few times you do it, but once you get used to it,  rebounding is easy, fun, helps tone other muscles, improves circulation , and will help you lose weight! (If you have a medical condition such as arthritis, osteoporosis, vertigo, etc - please check with your doctor before starting a rebounding regimen.) as for the lady who lives in Australia - you probably can't easily get to a department store to buy a mini-trampoline, but they are available on the internet.  The cost of shipping and possible expense/effort of having to go pick it up is well worth it for the benefit you will receive from using it. Good luck, ladies, I hope my suggestions help! Tre  ",

The biggest advantage of the extract is that it doesn't go rancid and spoil because the natural oils have been removed. I did find some sites for ordering Avemar - it's pretty expensive, but maybe with the on-going research, health insurance in the U.S. will start to pay for it.  (Fermented wheat germ extract has been approved for use as a medical nutriment to treat cancer in Hungary, in other nations in the E.U., in the Middle East and Asi, but in the U.S. it's still just considered to be a nutritional supplement.  Until that changes, cost may be prohibitive for a lot of people.) http://www.avemar.co.za/framework/index.asp http://www.avemar.com.au/orders.ews http://www.nextag.com/605939584p/zz2zB4z23/prices-html?nxtg= I don't think fermented wheat germ extract is available in the U.S. through any other product name than Avemar.  I wasn't able to find it online through any other name. I buy my supplements from Swanson - they have great products, give great service, and offer really good discounts I don't find elsewhere.  They carry the same product for about $30 less: http://www.swansonvitamins.com/AMB001/ItemDetail This is a great article about what FWGE does and its history of use: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermented_wheat_germ_extract I hope this info helps. take care, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Blessed6, I'd say the way you're feeling right now is pretty normal. You've spent the last 5 months (probably longer) under an enormous amount of stress, totally focused on getting rid of this and getting well, and you probably haven't really given yourself time or a chance to just sit down and have a REALLY GOOD CRY!.  Well, take the time, give yourself a chance to do that, because you need it, and it certainly is deserved. THe shower, or soaking in a really nice hot bath, is a good place for that cry. Gives you privacy, helps relieve your muscle stress, and makes it easy to clean up your face afterward. Plus, you can imagine your tears cleansing away ALL the yucky stuff that has been happening and all the awful fears, being sick, etc - then they will all go down the drain with the water from the shower or bath. (Throw in a couple handfulls of epsom salt or otherwise soothing bath salts if you decide to do your cry in a hot soak. And warn your kids that mom's going to go have some private time to just let go and just BE for a while, and they are not to worry about you nor are they to disturb you!) The side effects of the chemo WILL go away - it just takes time. And being good to yourself - as good of nutrition as you can manage, and being willing to treat yourself gently and kindly, are the prescription of the day.  My hair didn't start growing back for about 3 months after I finished treatment. But it did come back. In the meantime, I did everything I could to make being bald fun. (I won a few bets as to how fast I could get a stranger to call me \"sir\" when I didn't wear my bandana out in public!) As for the thinking problem - sounds like you have \"brain fog\" from the chemo (plus a whole wheel-barrow full of stress) - that too will go away, it just takes time.  Your kids are old enough to be helping with stuff - maybe you can talk to the oldest about helping you through tasks that require a lot of thinking. Be good learning for them, and really will help them feel like they are contributing to getting you well. As far as being boobless - once you're through treatment, you will better be able to focus on re-establishing a nurturing self-image, that includes your altered body.  So hang in there.  For right now, remember:  better flat-chested and alive than the alternative! Something else for you to consider:  you've just come through 3 VERY scary experiences _- being diagnosed with cancer, mastectomy, and chemotherapy.  Really normal to have the post-treatment breakdown. PLUS, you still have something very scary and unknown ahead of you: radiation.  You feel really crappy after everything you've gone through, and now you're afraid that you're going to feel even worse.  Pretty normal reaction - I'd be more worried about you if you WEREN\"T having some problems coping right about now! So, make an appt with yourself for that really good cry (or more than one, if needed.)  And KEEP that appt.  After you're done crying, take some really big, deep breaths, to get yourself re-oxygenated and centered.  And then anytime later that you feel like you're losing it, again, step back, take some big deep breaths, re-focus, and move on.  You can only live one moment at a time, so sometimes it helps to keep your concentration on the moment you are in right now, and realizing that right now you are surviving, and that's what counts! Also, you might consider asking the doc if you can push starting the radiation back a week, to give you a little more time to get recovered from the chemo, maybe have a few days for yourself to do something relaxing and fun. Sounds like you need that. Especially laughter - find a way to get a good belly-laugh every day.  It will do you a lot of good physically as well as mentally and emotionally.   A week's delay of radiation is not going to make any significant difference in the long run. Please take a look at my blog.  There are some things I do in my natural regimen that I think will not only help fight cancer, but will also help boost your immune system and improve your sense of well-being. Pay attention to the recommendation on selenium, calcium, zinc, manganese, magnesium and vitamin D-3.  Also, consider the thing that I emphasize for detoxification - lots of pure, fresh water and also green tea. You are welcome to email me if you have questions - there is a link on the blog. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers As the poster with the little kitty dangling from the tree branch says: \"Hang in there, Baby, Friday's coming!\"  You've gotten through an awful lot this year, and you've done ok.  Believe that you will get through the rest of this OK too.

      "Content": "I don't think drs realize just how much of a problem fibromyalgia presents on top of everything else.  Many women do not tolerate the anti-estrogen drugs well at all, and then add the FMS and you've got a mess.  You can do anti-estrogen therapy on your own, without the prescription drugs. It's not easy - ya gotta work at it, make sure to stick to a regimen faithfully, eat good food choices, take your supplements, and do some research, but it certainly is doable.  My estradiol was up over 30 - after 6 months on my own regimen without any prescription drugs it was  down below 5, and my cancer is in remission. I've published my regimen on my blog - you are welcome to take a look at it. I can't guarantee that it is exactly what YOU will need, but as I also was taking into account fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease (arthritis), I can say that there are a lot of powerhouse supplements, herbs and foods that can not only decrease your estrogen availability, but also provide the nutrients you need to get relief from the FMS. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers (If you want to read my story: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor ) The very most important elements are selenium, grape seed extract, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese and vitamin D3.  Make sure you are getting plenty of essential fatty acids (I used the conjugated linoleic acid with the grape seed extract and red wine as a kind of triple whammy - but you still need plenty of omega 3, 6, and 9's.) I tried to choose inexpensive supplements that would cover a multitude of areas - both natural aromatase inhibitors and estrogen blockers, really strong OPC's (oligo proanthocyanidins) and other anti-oxidative compounds because I was also actively fighting cancer.  You might not need all of these if you don't have active cells, but I think in terms of the FMS almost everything that I put in my regimen has a component for either rebuilding nerve and muscle function and detoxifying the body, and it sounds like you sure could use that about now. Also, have you had your thyroid looked at?  Many of the world's leading FMS researchers agree that this is a metabolic problem - many are looking specifically at the thyroid for answers. They are finding that many people with FMS are not getting enough free T-3 thyroid hormone, even if they are taking a synthetic thyroid drug. I had been on Synthroid and then Levoxyl for years, but it wasn't until I switched to natural thyroid hormone that my T3 levels started normalizing, and I started feeling much better - even more so than the improvement I had seen after I started my anti-estrogen regimen. Feel free to let me know if you have questions.  My email address is at the top of my blog page.  I wish you the best of success in getting your life back to at least some semblance of normal!

      "Content": "The lymph system is kind of like the garbage collector for the body.  It helps to take fighters from the immune system to areas of inflammation, infection, and disease, and then it carries waste materials away.  So an enlarged lymph node can result from fighting infection or disease of any kind, especially if that lymph node is not getting proper drainage from the lymph nodes below it. A lymph node can also just get clogged up with excess waste material, and sometimes needs a boost of the immune system or medication to get it draining again. Of course it can also mean the presence of cancer cells.  Good idea to see your oncologist.  Possibly he/she will want to get a PET scan and/or a needle biopsy to best determine what is going on. Don't panic - just get it checked out.  It could be nothing, it could be something, or it could be that the doc wants to watch it for a while. (If the latter is the case, I would at least ask for a needle biopsy rather than waiting. Then you would know how to proceed.)

      "Content": "Drs recommend aromasin just as much  as a preventative measure as they do a treatment for active cancer.  Although through surgery a tumor and cancer cells in the surrounding tissues may have been completely removed, that does not absolutely guarantee that the cancer has not been seeded to other areas of the body.  The thinking in prescribing aromasin and the other anti-estrogen drugs is that any estrogen-receptor positive cancer cells that may have already been nesting in other parts of the body, but are not yet detectable by scans or blood work, etc, still need estrogen to survive.  By depriving these individual cells, or tiny clumps of cells, of estrogen, you deny them the means by which they can grow, and therefore prevent metastatic cancer. The studies have shown tamoxifen and arimidex to be effective up to about 3 1/2 to 4 years, then whatever cancer cells that may have survived this treatment might be starting to show resistance to the medication.  Aromasin, and the newer  aromatase inhibitors have not been in use long enough for those kinds of studies to exist - so who knows if they will have the same results.  What IS known is that these drugs do indeed cause very serious side effects for many women, and the medical community has yet to produce an effective answer to this problem that does not also negate the therapeutic effect of the anti-estrogen drugs. Unfortunately, the thing that would be most effective botanically - to increase phytoestrogens thus alleviating the sypmtoms of chemically induced menopause caused by aromasin, et al, - is the one thing that you DON'T want to do because it also negates the therapeutic effect of the drugs.  Joint and bone pain can be managed with things like low-doses of aspirin, garlic, bromelaine and vitamin E, plus mega doses of the vitamin B complex - too mention a few things.  Almost anything that is effective for arthritic pain can be effective for the pain and joint problems caused by the anti-estrogen drugs -  but this seems to vary largely from woman to woman. I find the idea of seeking to prevent metastasis even though surgery is presumed to have removed the active cancer to be reasonable.  It only takes a few cells that have broken away but that find a protected nesting place where they get the nutrition they need from sugars that can be fermented and estrogen and other hormones to provide the start of metastasis.  It may take a very long time for those few cells to grow and multiply into enough cells to actually show up as a lump, nodule, tumor or lesion (usually takes as much as several hundred million cells to represent a nodule 1/4 inch in diameter - which is about the smallest detectable through scans.)  That is why anti-estrogen therapy is ordered for so many years Now the GOOD news:  it takes some work and commitment, but it IS possible to achieve the same or better results than the anti-estrogen drugs, by use of natural therapy.  There are many foods, herbs, and supplements that act to inhibit  production of estrogen, or block it's use by cells that are prone to harboring hormone dependent cancers.  325 mg of generic aspirin a day is just an example of an inexpensive and easy thing that women can do to protect themselves. (Aspirin inhibits production of prostaglandins that are necessary to produce aromatase, which is necessary for the body to produce estrogen. An indirect treatment as compared to aromasin, but I think a much safer treatment for sure.)  Not that taking an aspirin is the ONLY thing you  need to do, but it's a good start.  As for naturals that contain phytoestrogens: if a food or herb or supplement contains weak phytoestrogens, they seem to act as estrogen-receptor blockers (just like tamoxifen, ) so they are good things to include in the diet or a supplemental regimen.  Foods or herbs that contain strong phytoestrogens, such as soy and yams and pomegranate, seem to act as estrogen replacers - that is why they are so very effective at countering the effects of menopause, but that also means they are undesirable for anyone who is trying to maintain an estrogen-depleted state I had 2 surgeries for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer in 2002.  The surgeon felt sure that through the 2nd surgery he had gotten all the cancer, but chemo and radiation was still recommended because the cancer HAD gotten into the lymph system, and there was no gurarantee that it had not spread beyond what was detectable by visual and microscopic exam, and scans.  After I was done with chemo and radiation, the dr wanted me to do tamoxifen.  I was unable to tolerate it, so they said try arimidex - that was worse.  So rather than be sick I decided to wait and see what would happen.  I was just about a month shy of the vaunted \"5-years cancer free\" status, when we incidentally discovered nodules in my lungs. After several months of tests ending in surgical biopsy, the diagnosis was highly estrogen positive metastatic breast cancer. The pathology of the nodule they removed was exactly the same as the origin cancer, so this indeed was the same cancer I had fought in 2002. In other words, the surgery DIDN'T get all of the cancer, and the chemo and radiation weren't sufficient to kill off what had managed to spread and remain undetected. Perhaps the anti-estrogen drugs could have prevented recurrence, but it's a moot point, cause I couldn't tolerate two weeks of them, let alone 5 years. TO make a long story short, the dr wanted to treat my metastasis with the newer anti-estrogen drugs, but my intolerance of them negated that option . Having been a nurse for 16 years, having worked in an herb shop, and having the ability to understand the technical language of serious online research,  I designed my own anti-cancer, anti-estrogen regimen, and a year later my metastasis is in remission to the point that PET scan right before Thanksgiving showed no evidence of progessive disease (meaning it's not growing, and it's not showing evidence of still being active.) You can read my story and take a look at the regimen I designed for myself on my blog: my story http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor my regimen http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers This is not to be a prescription for any one else, but rather is offered as an example of what a woman who is committed to her own health can do to treat active cancer, or to try prevent recurrence. As every person's body chemistry is different, I highly recommend that those who don't have the kind of background and experience that I have, seek professional help through a naturopath, homeopath, or other holistic practitioner.  (Certainly accupuncture, traditional chinese medicine and ayurvedic medicine fall within that category.)  Even reputable, knowledgable herbalists can give excellent recommendations for preventing breast cancer. I also recommend Dr Susan Love's Breast Book  - it is the most excellent comprehensive book on breast health I have found.  Get the 4th edition if possible, as it is the most up-to-date.  Another excellent book is Susun Weed's book: Breast Cancer? Breast Health!  Many might consider Susun's spiritual outlook to be excessively esoteric, but her herbal knowledge is absolutely wonderful. I hope this helps to answer the question of why women should seek some type of preventative measures after surgery, and options available other than these oh so nasty prescription drugs. By the way - as to cost.  Aromasin and the newer anti-estrogen drugs (faslodex, etc) ARE very expensive.  My prescription drug plan co-pay is up to $25 dollars for most drugs, but for aromasin (and lyrica, which is another drug that some women are using to counter the pain caused by aromasin) - the co-pay would be $50.  Some of the pharmaceutical companies offer a plan to offset the cost of these drugs, but I've not heard reports from anybody who was able to avail this as a viable option throughout an entire course of treatment. As for the question about hospitalization, I have absolutely no doubt that had I tried to stick with the aromasin past the 3 doses I took that made me so very ill, I WOULD have ended up in the hospital shortly.  The drug just made me very sick with a broad gamut of symptoms. I drove myself to work on the 3rd morning I took it, and almost passed out once I got there. FOrtunately most women don't seem to have that drastic a reaction, but there is no way of knowing how it will affect you until you take it. I wish you the best of success in staying disease free.

      "Content": "Many women have stopped treatment early due to the nasty side effects. And some, like me, tried only a few doses and said \"Uh unh - I ain't doin' this.\"  If you look back through the messages on the breast cancer forum, you will find dozens of concerns similar to yours. Be patient as concerns the weight loss - it will happen, but it will take time. The weight gain was quite possibly due to severe estrogen suppression.  Taking Arimidex chemically produces just about the same effect as if you had had a hysterectomy and your ovaries removed, or had gone thru menopause.  More women than not report that they gain quite a bit of weight after hysterectomy - 50 pounds is about the average.  (I speak from personal experience!!)  And just so many women report weight gain when on the anti-estrogen drugs. This seems to be the body's attempt to increase estrogen in the body. Fat cells produce estrogen - the more fat, the more estrogen - so the body starts gaining weight by increasing fat storage.  It will take perhaps 6 - 9 months for you to metabolize and totally eliminate the arimidex from your body.  As this process occurs and your body goes back to the estrogen production that would be normal for you at your age and reproductive status, your system will less and less perceive the need to maintain the extra fat cells for estrogen production, and you should be able to start losing the weight.   If you make sure to incorporate lots of cancer-fighting foods - like cruciferous veggies and fresh raw fruit - in your diet, that will also help balance out the effects of the arimidex.  Many foods like broccoli, asparagus and brussel sprouts are also very gentle natural estrogen regulators.  Also increase your exercise as tolerated, as the side effects of the arimidex begin to lessen.  make sure to focus on gentle, low impact exercise, such as walking or swimming  - this will help to strengthen your muscles and bones without overstressing your joints.  It also increases metabolism.  Make sure to drink lots and lots of fresh pure water.  The body absolutely has to have it to promote weight loss, and for healing from the detrimental effects of drugs. You might consider getting a rebounder (a 36\" mini trampoline.)  It's wonderful exercise for weight loss, and you can start with very gentle bouncing and work your way up to a more vigorous routine as your body heals.  This is an especially way for women who have had lumpectomies or mastectomies to exercise, as it promotes lymph drainage in the arms and breasts. http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "My first question is does your friend have someone to be there with her when she has her surgery - to go with her to the hospital, to wait through the surgery and then to be there for her when she gets out of recovery ?  Does she have someone to take her home, and to be with her for the first few days, or a week or so, until she's able to start cooking and doing light activity for herself?  If the answer to these questions is no, then you should find out when she's having her surgery, get your ticket paid for, and pack your bag. If she doesn't need your physical help at this time, then it might be more a question of emotional support.  Does she have someone there who can present a shoulder to cry on if she's scared? Ask her if she would like you to be there for morale support when she has her surgery, and the first few days or so afterward.  If she says yes, and it's doable for you, then I certainly would make the trip. I also would consider going a little bit in advance in either situation - certainly you would need to be there the day before surgery, but even a day or two before that might be really nice for her if it's doable for you.  Can be a real good thing to have that kind of support available as the anxiety of having this thing done and the uncertainty it entails mount up.  I know it was very important to me to have both my partner's physical and emotional support when I had my surgeries (3 major surgeries in 4months time). More than 20 years ago I had a friend who had a radical mastectomy with immediate implant of a saline prosthesis.  I didn't find out about her diagnosis until several days after she'd had her surgery.  (She had not told me because she didn't want me to worry, and she didn't want me to miss work making a trip to see her.  I JUST HAPPENED to call her a few hours after she got home from the hospital, and she told me then what had happened.) I immediately dropped everything - scheduled emergency vacation and drove from KY to PA to give her some support, despite her assurance that my visit wasn't needed.   I arrived at her house about 3 or days after her surgery, and stayed a little longer than a week. It's a good thing, too - her teen-age sister was doing ok with my friends kids, but by the time I got there my friend was exhausted and very emotionally frazzled, and REALLY needed another adult in the house.  I drove her the 3 hour drive for her post-op visit to the Cleveland Clinic to get her biopsy results and discuss therapy, and spent a few days helping her with rehab exercises and just getting her head around the idea of chemo and radiation and trying to take care of her  family.  She said my presence was truly a god-send at that time.  I have never ever regretted making that trip. If you're friend says there's no need for you to be there now, it's still your decision - you know the dynamics of the friendship and how likely she is to be realistic - so make your best judgement and act on your conscience. What your friend's  treatment might be after surgery at this point is probably not really known - they may have said this or that, but really until the surgeon gets in there and gets a good look and they find out just how much they have to remove, how involved it is, they really can't say with absolute certainty what further treatment will need to be. So, talk to your friend about it.  Tell her you want to know what she's going to have to go through once she's able to give you a more definite answer. Help her get through the surgery and immediate recovery if you can, and if it seems like that is needed.  After that, go with the flow  - but certainly make it known that you expect her to be upfront with you, and actually tell you if she needs help! I wish her, and you, the very best. Sincerely, Tre",

Please take the best care of yourself you can while receiving chemo and afterward, so that you can go into surgery in the best physical condition possible.  Hydration is extremely important - at least 64 ounces of fluid a day minimum.  Eat as much as you can in the way of fresh raw fruit (an apple a day, plenty of citrus except grapefruit and bananas, any kind of berries.)  Also try to eat as much as you can in the way of green leafy vegetables, especially broccoli and cauliflower,  asparagus, greens, cabbage, and in moderation - carrots.  Unless you are on a blood thinner or your dr says otherwise, drinking a lot of green and/or black teas will help with detoxification of the chemo and cancer cell death by-products, as well as help to fight the cancer itself. There are many other things you can do in the way of naturals to fight this cancer.  You should of course talk to the oncologist about using naturals to complement chemo, and to make sure you don't take anything that is contraindicated with the specific chemotherapeutics you will be getting. If you can get advice from a naturopathic/holistic practitioner, that would be  best. These web sites offer excellent information on complementary and alternative treatments: http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us You are also welcome to take a look at my blog to learn about some simple and inexpensive things you can use in the way of foods, herbs and supplements to fight cancer.  While many of the things in my regimen have components that make them especially effective against hormone-positive cancers, they all contain phytochemicals that will fight all types of cancer. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Many leading advocates of natural therapy agree that there are certain minerals EVERYONE who is fighting cancer should take: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese : 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max) Feel free to contact me if you think I might be of further assistance - you are welcome to use the email link on my blog or private reply through Cancer Compass.

      "Content": "Dear Garden-800, I think that at some point in time every person who is diagnosed with cancer feels completely alone.  After all, this is something in our body - nobody else can share that, and nobody else can know exactly how we feel at any given moment.  A very scary process. Cancer is a very nasty monster, but also a very strange monster. Some who have smoked all their lives and been diagnosed with cancer are found to have just very small areas of disease that respond well to treatment, while others who've never smoked a day in their lives are found to have extensive lung cancer. (I had an aunt for whom the latter was the case.)  So yes, it is  possible that you have extensive disease, but it is not inevitable. Support from Cancer Compass can be very wonderful, but for you support that is more immediate in terms of physicality  and accessability sounds needful. Talk to your dr - see if he/she can recommend a local cancer support group that would take you, enclose you in their loving arms of care and experience. You can do an online search for a group in your area, but a probably more productive effort would be to call the American Cancer Society 1·800·ACS·2345 and ask them to point you to supportive and knowledgable people in your area.   Their phone line is manned 24/7, and this is the website:  http://www.cancer.org/docroot/home/index.asp You might also inquire about Relay for Life groups in your area.  This is a fund-raising effort to support cancer research, but many, many members of these teams are cancer survivors or family members of cancer survivors, and they have knowledge of resources you need, as well as perhaps being able to introduce you to people who are willing to help you get through the next days and weeks. take things one step at a time - that's all you can do.  Don't borrow tomorrow's troubles - today has enough worries of its own.  Right now you just need to go through the mechanics of finding out just what this is, and working with your physician to make treatment decisions.  Get yourself educated about this disease, but do not let the massive amounts of seemingly dire doom-and-gloom prophesy overwhelm you and send you into despair.  Does not have to be that way, and how you keep it from becoming that way is to just keep taking this one step at a time.  When feeling overcome, or very scared, stop and step back from it.  Take some deep breaths, and focus on something comforting - something that is reassuring and known (for me it was the fact that I'd been through tough times before and had survived - I knew I could get through cancer, too.) After getting yourself reoxygenated with some deep breaths and refocused on what is immediately at hand, you will be prepared to move on.  The ONLY thing that is ever certain is the thing that is right in front of us right now, and as long as we approach life from that viewpoint, there will never be anything in front of us that is too great to bear. I wish you well, my new friend.  Stand fast and learn as have the the rest of us how to almightily kick cancer in the butt!!! Sincerely, Tre",

If you have scarring from the radiation, it's well possible that you might be developing these symptoms this late. Especially if you have scar tissue impinging on the brachial nerve. My question is why is the dr keeping you on the Arimidex.  5 years with this medication is plenty - many of the studies I've read showed no benefit in staying on it any longer, and some indicated possible harm. Some published reports state that the maximum effectiveness of Arimidex and other anti-estrogen drugs is 3 1/2 to 4 years.  You might consider talking to your dr about stopping the arimidex - that would certainly help determine if the tingling is from the medication or something else.  And it certainly would ease your pocketbook. If you are concerned about keeping estrogen levels low without the arimidex, there is plenty you can do naturally to achieve that.  Even something as simple as a plain aspirin everyday will help (inhibits prostaglandins necessary to produce estrogen.)  I put myself on a natural regimen that lowered my estradiol level SIGNIFICANTLY, and put my cancer into remission.   http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers (I'm not saying that this is a prescription for everyone - but certainly if these things helped me, they might well help other women, also.) If this does turn out to be nerve impingement from scar tissue, there are a number of things you can do to help.  For immediate relief, try Zostrex. You can get it over the counter - is formulated with capsaicin and intended for relief of arthritic neuritis and shingle type pain - works well for nerve pain in general. Also, boost your intake of B vitamins - the whole gamut of them.  A good B vitamin complex supplement would help, as well as boosting your intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes.  I have a series of articles about B vitamins on my blog - you might want to take a look at them as well.  Scar tissue can be broken up using several means.  Massage therapy works well, if you can find someone experienced in deep tissue massage and myofascial release. Even self massage can help - work the area of your breast and up into your armpit - massage while in the shower works great!!  You might also call an exercise called rebounding - using a mini-trampoline.  This can greatly loosen up scarring and get tissues lubricated and moving properly again.  3 minutes twice a day of gentle bounding on a rebounder can work wonders, and is fun!! http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Also, make sure to drink plenty of fresh pure water.  If you've got scarring and start to get it loosened up, you need good hydration to ensure the process continues and has a great outcome!

In the past I have recommended pure emu oil for moisturizing, and in the case of eczema or other irritating conditions, the use of well-diluted selsun shampoo (contains selenium) for cleansing and then the application of emu oil (and also sometimes vitamin e oil if the skin has become quite broken and needs quick healing.) Oral supplementation with selenium 200 mg/day is also important. A kind of gross but extremely effective moisturizer and healer is ear wax.  A tiny little dab applied as needed goes a long way!  (do NOT use in the presence of an ear infection, and do NOT get it in your eyes or mouth - stings, and tastes bad, yuck, yuck, yuck!) I still stand by these recommendations, but in the back of my mind I KNEW I was forgetting something.  Just a few minutes ago, BADABING!!! -  there it was:  Zim's Crack Creme, made in the USA by Perfecta Products INc.  An absolutely  marvelous healer, not just for drug-induced skin conditions, but for almost any skin problem involving dryness, irritation, cracking and bleeding.  (For EXTERNAL use only.)

Thanks so much for any advice about how to handle these next few appointments.   Love and Light, DOK Dear DOK, It sounds to me that at this point of the game the dr's orders are appropriate - you know the nodules are there, now time to find out what they represent. Much of the time the next steps that are taken are dictated by the insurance company - while a PET scan or biopsy would possibly be more conclusive than the MRI, the insurance company may be insisting on MRI as the next step.  Also, breast cancer CAN be diagnosed or disproved with MRI, so my advice is just to wait and see what they say.  Not living in a large metro area is not necessarily a disadvantage in terms of treatment for cancer.  I live in a fairly rural area in central PA, get my medical care through a clinic in a town of about 50,000.  When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I discovered that my surgeon is extremely highly respected in the field of breast conservation surgery, considered by many to be one of the finest breast cancer surgeons in this region of the country.  Who knew?? Give the drs a chance - they may be competent, caring physicians who will do what is necessary and appropriate for your mom.  Then when you get the results, feel free to post again to this message thread if you want opinions on what they said.  If you have any reason to question what they are saying, requesting a second opinion is certainly always a reasonable option (and indeed many physicians will offer that option when they outline a plan of treatment.) If you do go for a 2nd opinion and you get the same recommendations as the local physician, then I would consider just staying with the local physician. While we want the absolute best treatment for our loved ones, we also sometimes are wise to consider the toll that travel, etc, might take on that person. Sincerely, Tre  ",

What you said in your post is in large part the answer you seek.  Your sister is indeed part of your heart, as you are part of hers.  Imagine the horrible hole that might have existed in your heart had your sister not been there. She will always be there - no matter what physical state she is in - spiritually and emotionally she will always be there, guiding you, laughing with you, sometimes being naughty with you.  That will never change - you can count on it. Take things one day at a time, or one hour at a time, or even one moment at a time.  If you are overwhelmed, step back, take some big deep breaths and then refocus on the moment at hand.  The only moment of our lives upon which we can have any effect is the moment we are in right now - by staying focused on what it presently at hand, we moment by moment propel ourselves proactively through the rest of our lives, with peace in our inner beings, even if there may be sadness and grief in our souls. Know that to everything there is a turn, and to everything a purpose.  We may never see what's on the other side of someone else's bend, or we may never see their purpose, but that doesn't negate their existence. Regardless what your spiritual beliefs, have faith that the universe will survive on the course that has been set, and that with time many good things will come from present travail. And remember to keep taking deep breaths and keep focused on who and where you are right now. Also, try to bring as much laughter into life as you can.  It's very healing for all concerned, including your precious sister. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "I agree that the dr most likely will want to do a biopsy - quite possibly just numbing you up and inserting a needle to withdraw some fluid and cells.  If that's the case, it will be painful but shouldn't be too bad. Ask if it's ok to take some type of over the counter pain medication - preferably Tylenol - 30 or 45 minutes before time for the biopsy - that will help keep.   Also, consider having someone go with you that can drive you home, cause you will probably be sore adn trying to keep an icepack on your boob. Don't let this drive you crazy while you are waiting for answers.  The fact that the dr didn't schedule you for biopsy immediately after the sonogram indicates that it didn't flat out immediately look like cancer, and that's a good thing.  There are  things this white spot could be  other than cancer. If the dr is leaning toward that opinion but wanting to get a better look before ordering biopsy, he/she may order a PET scan instead. PET is painless and you should be able to get the results the next business day, whereas the biopsy will take a couple of days. THe other good thing is that the doc is recommending further diagnoses rather than adopting a \"let's wait and see what this is\" attitude - far too many women get given that kind of inadequate treatment. In my book it's best to find out what this is now, even if it means biopsy, or even if it means cancer.  Better to get stuff while it is small and easily accessible. I will be wishing you good news!  Please let us know what you find out. Sincerely, Tre",

Thanks. Maryann  Hi Maryann, Congratulations on getting through the radiation. Do not be alarmed - a lot of people have problems after radiation.  The pins and needles sensation should go away with time, as your nerves have a chance to heal.  Consistent dosing with a complete B complex vitamin might do a lot to help speed that along.  Just remember that nerves heal at a slower rate than flesh, so be patient.  Also, talk to your dr - ask them what they recommend to decrease discomfort.  (You might also get responses from others who have been through this and found solutions that worked for them.) As to the lumps and bumps, radiation is VERY hard on both the lymph system and the immune system - you may be retaining lymph fluid in your breasts and that can feel pretty lumpy.  Some women find that their breasts are much more fibrous after treatment. Also, you may find that as a result of the radiation, your breasts are more sensitive to hormones, caffeine and some other foods that can cause lumpy breast tissue. Plus there is bound to be scar tissue that will feel lumpy and bumpy. To be on the safe side, make an appt with the dr, and get a breast exam, find out for sure if that's all this is.  Ask the dr to take a little bit of time teaching you how to examine your breasts - especially teaching you how scar tissue feels compared to normal tissue, and the characteristics of  fibrous densities that may have come about because of the treatment. I also recommend you purchase a copy of Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th edition, and start reading. Lots of very valuable information there on what to expect after treatment, and how to take care of yourself to promote optimum breast health (as well as spiritual and emotional health.)

Appreciate your help!   RosyDosy   Hi RosyDosy, The answer to your question largely depends on how much tissue you had removed with your double mastectomy, and if it's even physically possible to get good imaging of the tissue that remains. I would ask your dr why they change in his recommendation on mammograms, and I would really press him on the issue - if he has learned something new since he told you you wouldn't need mammograms, then you need to know that information so you can make informed decisions. Mammograms with implants is problematic, and special techniques are required.  Even with someone trained and with the proper equipment to do mammography with implant, the implants can still cause shadows on the films that make it hard to determine what the scan is really showing.  Plus there is the question of just how effective the technique is at getting all the remaining natural tissue in the picture - is difficult enough to get a good mammogram of some women, let alone dealing with the implants.  Also,  that's a lot of compression to put on those implants and the surrounding scar tissue. CT scan of the chest for someone with implants is not infallible, either, but then scans are not guaranteed infallible for anyone.  THe most accurate and conclusive scans can be obtained with PET/CT scans, and they are appropriate for a woman with implants.  Anything that shows up on a regular CT, or a PET/CT can then be checked with scintimammography (nuclear medicine - injecting a radioactive dye that has an affinity for cancer cells, and taking pictures with a special camera - no breast compression involved.)   THese procedures are expensive, but possibly quite a bit more accurate than a mammogram or regular CT of the chest, and Scintimammography is definitely more comfortable than a regular mammogram - you lie on a table with your breasts hanging through an opening in the table while the pictures are taken.   Don't be afraid to formulate your questions, write them down so you don't forget them, and then ask your surgeon, and don't be satisfied with an answer like, \"well, I just think it's better.\"  Also, consider getting a second opinion. http://www.imaginis.com  is a really good site for answering questions about breast cancer, implants, etc. Sincerely, Tre    ",

While I do not have the diffuse metastasis that you are dealing with, I was diagnosed with mets to the lungs not quite a year ago.  I am unable to take the anti-estrogen drugs, so I did a lot of research on natural alternatives, and was able to get myself on a regimen that worked to put my mets into remission.  I think a lot of the foods, herbs and supplements I have used could be supportive to you as well. You can take a look at my blog - see how you feel about using some of these things yourself.  (Please check with your dr before adding things - make sure they will not adversely interact with theArimidex,  Zometa or other medications.) http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers  My cancer is estrogen-receptor positive, but progesterone negative, so my regimen focuses on depleting estrogen only.  You might do a web search on natural alternatives to progesterone depletion - there might be things that would be effective that aren't on my list. (My list is by no means all-inclusive on the estrogen front either - I focused on simple things that are inexpensive and easy to take.) The exercise will stand you in good stead.   Also focus on laughter and humor, mirth.  Everyone can benefit greatly from 10 minutes of good belly-laughter a day, and it really can bring about very positive bio-chemical changes in the body.  Also, plenty of pure, fresh water to both nourish your cells and flush away the by-products of the  arimidex and zometa.

You can also look at this information on Reach for Recovery posted by the American Cancer Society:  http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ESN/content/ESN_3_1x_Reach_to_ Underwire bras very definitely are NOT a good idea after lumpectomy - very restrictive and put a lot of pressure on delicate tissue.  A lot of women find that sports bras - especially the all cotton ones - work very well - either front-closure or the ones with no fasteners at all.  (Front closure has the advantage of being able to undo some of the hooks without removing the bra if you find yourself needing less pressure on the chest.)  The big thing to concentrate on is limiting pressure on the shoulder, and beneath the breast on the operative side. Personally, I do not wear a bra at all anymore.  I had my surgeries in 2002 - for years I followed the male surgeon's recommendation to always wear a good supportive bra, and for years I was in agony.  When I was being worked up for metastatic  cancer in Feb 2007, I mentioned my discomfort to the female oncologist I had gone to for a 2nd opinion.  Her response was she recommends for ALL her breast cancer patients:  if wearing a bra causes pain or discomfort, don't wear one. I took my bra off in the restroom before driving home that day, and I haven't worn one since, and I no longer have the pain and discomfort. Certainly a bra can relieve pressure on suture lines immediately after surgery - a somewhat loose-fitting soft sports bra will take care of that - you can go ahead and get one to take with you to the hospital so you have it to wear home. But my best advice is, if you don't want to wear a bra after your incision is healed - DON'T!  (Some theorize that the restrictions of a bra on the flow of lymph fluids withing the breasts may actually contribute to breast cancer, and recommend that unless a woman is just really uncomfortable without the support of a bra, that she not wear one.) Yes, I do understand that for many not wearing a bra raises issues with body - image, and many larger-breasted women need tthe support; I am not trying to disrepect anyone for whom that may be true.  My partner would go braless in public for NO amount of money, and she wears a very old but comfortable bra even to bed, because she feels better with the support.  There is excellent information on bras and breast health in Dr Susan Love's Breast Book (get the 4th edition as it is most current.) Many women consider it to be THE bible on the breast - it really is an excellent resource.  Also, http://www.imaginis.com  is an excellent site for information about breast cancer treatment and recovery.  There are also some excellent articles on www.cancerlynx.com. I returned to work 2 weeks after my lumpectomy.  Of course it depends on how soon your surgeon is willing to release you to go back to work, and what type of work you do,  but I really do recommend not trying to push to go back sooner than the dr recommends.  Recovery isn't just physical;  you may well have some emotional / psychological healing to do before you are ready to be out in the world. There are some specifics about your cancer that you won't know until after the actual surgery - just how involved is the cancer, how much did the surgeon have to remove, how do you feel about what your breast is going to look like.  Getting those answers can bear a toll. Some women breeze through these things without a 2nd thought - for others, they can represent a hitch in the get-along, like dealing with an extremely tight immediate dead-line to get a certain piece of work done, focusing all your energy on getting it done, and then afterward having the shakes as all the adrenaline subsides. So much time and energy goes into finding out you have cancer, learning what to do about it, getting ready for surgery, dealing with all the anxiety and uncertainly, and for some women, the first couple of weeks after surgery can be a pretty emotional time. I recommend using time before surgery to get  big projects at home out of the way .  Get the house in order as much as possible.  Prepare some crock pot meals, casseroles, etc, that can be frozen and then easily re-heated. Keeping busy helps keep the mind off the \"what if's.\"  It's also good preparation for recovery days - gives you the freedom to concentrate on getting well. I also recommend that you deliberately spend some time having fun - goes a long way toward boosting the immune system, as well as shoring up a positive attitude. Also use this time to learn the exercises you will need to do after surgery to strengthen your muscles and speed healing.  e.g. standing in front of a wall and walking the fingers of your affected arm up the wall, isometric exercise of pushing one palm against the other, raising your arms in an arc to the sides and then stretching toward the ceiling. Already having the muscle memory of doing these things will make it easier to start right away to do them after surgery. Do not OVERDO, but be careful yet zealous about these exercises - they will speed you to recovery, and help to prevent formation of restrictive scar tissue in your breast. I wish you the best with your surgery, treatment and healing.  Sincerely, Tre  ",

      "Content": "This week's Cancer Compass newsletter contains an excellent article on holiday foods and their ability to fight cancer, titled \"Tips To Fight Cancer With Your Fork This Holiday Season.\" I just want to make a two comments about the article: 1.  Pomegranates and sweet potatoes (yams) contain very strong phytoestrogens.  As such, they are NOT good food choices for anyone with ER/PR positive breast cancer.  Foods with weak phytoestrogens are ok, as they tend to act like the estrogen blockers or aromatase inhibitors.  Foods with strong phytoestrogens are NOT ok - they act like hormone replacement therapy, and will actually FEED hormone positive breast cancers. 2.  Carrots and sweet potatoes are very high in simple sugars that feed cancer, especially when prepared with added sugar (glazed or made into sweet potato pie.) White the carotenoids in them are indeed good cancer fighters, these two foods need to be eaten in great moderation by ANYONE fighting cancer, e.g. 1 small - medium carrot/day or one small helping plain baked sweet potato/day. People with hormone positive cancers might want to do a little web searching about other favorite foods that mostly appear at holiday feasts, to make sure they contain either no phytoestrogens, or weak phytoestrogens. (Cranberries ARE OK!) As for the suggestion in the article about apples, I would add one thing:  everything about an apple is digestible and full of nutrients except the stem. Especially important to eat the seeds, as they contain proanthocyanidins that get into cancer cells and kill them. Yes, many of us have been taught not to eat the seeds because \"they are cyanide.\"  Not strictly true: while they contain a cyanide precursor, it can only be converted to cyanide by a certain enzyme which is found abundantly in cancer cells, but only a few other cells of the body. It's only when apple seeds are eaten to excess that they present a danger of poisioning. A good rule of thumb:  don't eat any more seeds than you are eating units of that fruit/day.  (If an apple has 5 or 6 seeds, that's ok - still equals one unit of fruit.)  People with cancer should not eat more than 1 apple/day (2 max) due to the sugars they contain. I wish everyone a wonderful holiday! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Cancer has a very distinctly different appearance than normal breast tissue.  While it takes at least a couple of million cancer cells to make a tumor or lesion big enough to see with the naked eye, once it has reached that size it will definitely look different.  If your surgeon is experienced and has seen lots of cancer, she probably is capable of telling whether the tissue looked normal or not.  However, just because tissue looks normal, that doesn't necessarily mean there is no pre-cancer or cancer there, whereas a microscopic exam will tell if it's there or not. So, a surgeon may make a statement about what they saw, because that immediately gives patients something to go on , one way or the other - but that is why they say to wait for the pathology results to know for sure what the situation is. The fact that she didn't see anything abnormal, is however, STILL really goods news.  It means that even if they find cancer cells when they do the path exam, because it wasn't big enought to form a tumor or lesion, it would most likely indicate a very early cancer.  The earlier we can catch cancer , the better the chances of totally eliminating it.  So it's ok to be doing a little bit of a happy dance right now, even though you still have to wait for the microscopic report.  Were it me, I would be relieved that everything looked normal, and would be breathing a little easier while waiting for more news. I hope that it is very good news for you. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Even though scans, blood tests, etc, may all look good after surgery/chemo/radiation are completed, they are not a 100% guarantee that all the cancer cells in the body were killed, especially if there was any lymph node involvement.  Aromatase inhibitors are used as a preventative measure in case any cancer cells survived other treatments.  Estrogen-receptor positive cancers depend on estrogen to thrive and grow and divide/spread. Aromatase inhibitors keep the body from making a lot of estrogen, causing chemically-induced estrogen depletion/menopause.  The theory is that by depriving any remaining cancer cells of estrogen, those cells will eventually starve to death, thus over time rendering the body cancer free. The aromatase inhibitors haven't been on the market long enough for there to be any reliable long-term study results. However, tamoxifen - an estrogen blocker (not quite the same action as an aromatase inhibitor, but still works to keep the cancer cells from getting estrogen) - HAS been on the market for over 10 years, and there are long-term study results that are somewhat disappointing:  it seems that tamoxifen is very effective up to about 3 1/2 - 4 years, then the effect seems to slack off quite a bit, and any cancer that has survived that length of time might actually become tamoxifen resistant.  Some researchers theorize that this might also be the case with aromatase inhibitors - unfortunately it will probably be a few years before those kinds of study results are available. For those who can tolerate the side effects, prescription anti-estrogen drugs might be a very good choice.  For those who can't tolerate (or afford) the drugs, there is another answer.  Women can practice preventative health care on their own without taking any of these drugs - if they are willing to do some research, and are committed to changing to a low-estrogen, anti-cancer lifestyle. My best recommendation is to find a naturopathic/holistic practitioner to assist in determining the best ways to minimize estrogen production without causing the nasty estrogen-depletion side effects, and also for recommendations on diet, supplementation, exercise, etc.  I have published the regimen I use on my blog - it contains examples of foods, herbs and supplements that are effective for both estrogen-blocking and aromatase inhibition, as well as many that are effective at fighting cancer in other ways. This is not intended as a prescription for any other person, but you are welcome to read it to get an idea of simple, low cost things that you can do to help protect yourself from recurrence of cancer. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers I also recommend that women do their own research about the foods they eat:  many foods/herbs/ botanicals contain phytochemicals, including plant estrogens (phytoestrogens.)  Those which contain very strong phytoestrogens are most likely to act as estrogen hormone replacers, thus feeding cancer.  Those which contain weak phytoestrogens are more likely to act as estrogen-receptor blockers, thus depriving cancer of estrogen. There is much controversy about soy as to which category it falls under; therefore, unless a woman has grown up eating soy products and her body is well used to them, I recommend avoiding them as diet and treatment. Use  a simple web search with keywords of the food/herb name and \"phytoestrogen content\" to help determine which foods, etc, are likely to be beneficial, and which it might be best to avoid. One supplement that is very often used as both complementary and alternative treatment of cancer is resveratrol. Some sources list it as a strong phytoestrogen, some list it as a weak phytoestrogen.  However, resveratrol has MANY other very powerful cancer fighting benefits that probably far outweigh any estrogen influence it might have, so resveratrol most definitely is being perceived as a supplement valuable in the fight against breast cancer. If you still have questions about this, take some time and look back through previous message threads on the board.  This has been discussed several times in the past 6 - 8 months - there might be replies that offer information that I haven't included.

      "Content": "P.S.  Despite the fact that your ovaries were removed, your body will still produce estrogen.  This is especially true if you are overweight:  fat cells are the primary source of estrogen once the ovaries are removed or menopause has occured. The estrogen produced by fat cells is called estradiol.  Estradiol production is very dependent on aromatase.  Inhibiting aromatase IS a very effective way to reduce estrogen levels once the ovaries are no longer a factor. Things as simple as one aspirin a day can help to stop estrogen production (a substance called prostaglandins is used to produce estrogen - aspirin inhibits prostaglandin production.)  It won't totally stop production, but can be used as a very simple and inexpensive part of an anti-estrogen regimen.  If you are carrying excess weight, a concerted effort to trim down can also really help decrease estrogen levels.  The less fat cells available to produce estrogen, the better.  Drinking plenty of pure fresh water is also essential in this process. Hope this has helped. Tre",

      "Content": "Dear Jodie, People tell me that I am well able to mingle compassion with realism.  I hope I am able to achieve that with you... I understand that your joy in your grandson gives you focus to continue fighting what must seem like a thankless and never-ending battle.  Indeed, I have known many people with cancer who have had similar motivations, including my own mother, and the very first love of my life.  Some of these people were given free rein to utilize that focus, many were not.  There are probably many more readers out there who understand where you are coming from than you might think. Each person has to find their own way to deal with this type situation, but in order to deal with it really successfully, each person must also face the same reality, the same bottom line:  you can't change the values and actions of anyone but yourself. Yes, that's a hard, cold statement - but one that can be used as a very solid foundation for building a successful coping strategy. As a nurse I often told couples who desperately wanted to have families, but were having extreme difficulties conceiving, to not overlook or just reject out of hand one very important - and needful - alternative:  adoption. There are so many, many lost and lonely children in the world who desperately need loving parents. Couples who can't have their own biological children can still be great parents through the process of adoption. (Flip two flapjacks with one flick of the skillet!) I'm not trying to suggest that any other child could ever take the place of your grandson - they can't.  However, they might serve in a surrogate role for the many times you can't be with your grandson but need joy, laughter, love and compassion to fill the very empty places created in your heart and spirit by this battle with cancer.  I tell people on this board - because I absolutely believe it myself - laughter and a positive attitude are two of the absolutely most powerful weapons we can possess in this fight for our lives.  Your relationship with your grandson provides these for you.  I betcha their are other children who can do the same, and I betcha even more there are other children who desperately need the grandmotherly attention you have the expertise to give. SO, think about it.  If you are interested in initiating \"child stimulus therapy\"  (my name for this endeavor)  - with some creative thinking, I believe you can find a way to make it happen.  Take a look at the resources you have right in your own neighborhood.  See if you can volunteer some time at a daycare center.  Be a playground monitor.  School will be starting again soon - volunteer as a crossing guard, or maybe get a part time job as a school bus helper.  Heck - get your husband involved, too!  See if there is a Big Brother/Big Sister program in your area.  Find out if they need volunteers on the pediatrics floor at the local hospital.  Find out if there is a children's cancer association that needs volunteers.  Call your local support groups and find out if they have childrens' activites that you could get involved with.  See if your area Relay for Life teams are doing things with kids - ask them if you could help.  If you're a church-goer, volunteer to help with the itty bitty kids' Sunday School class, or volunteer in the nursery during the service. Personally, I'm not a real kid-oriented person - I can tolerate them for a while, then I really want to give them back to mommy and daddy!!! - so right now I'm getting really challenged to come up with other ideas!  But I betcha (doing a lot of that in this post - means I believe in you, and even though I'm not crazy about kids, I DO believe in them, too) - I betcha that the ideas I've launched are but a drop in the bucket compared to the ideas and goals you can find, and achieve,  within your own mind and heart. One other thing that I don't talk about near as much in my posts, but that I do mention, and really do believe in, is the power of love.  Sounds like you've got a lot of love to give yet, and that is a powerful reason for living; in fact, when I said I have known a lot of people with cancer who had problems similar to yours, I could just as easily have said I have known a lot of people who kept on fighting their cancer because of the power that love gave them. My 99-year-old grandmother, who is in remarkable good health, still living by herself despite having Parkinson's disease, is a tremendous role model for me.  I know she gets lonely, and some days she gets real tired.  Sometimes she says she doesn't know why she keeps on living, why doesn't her body give up and go?  She takes upwards of 30 pills a day - not a one of them prescription meds.  All supplements - herbs, vitamins - and it's all really good stuff that would do any advocate of alternative therapies proud.  Been doing it for at least 30 years.  And she says that sometimes she wonders why she still takes them, that maybe she should just stop taking them, and maybe then her body would quit.  And every single time I have ever heard her make these statements, the very next thing she says is that then she thinks that she's worked really hard all these years at keeping herself healthy, trying to have the best life she can, being there for other people, enjoying the good things (boy, she sure does love a mean cross word puzzle - she can still do the New York Times in a flash!) So when she looks at it that way, she says that she owes it to herself to keep on keeping on.  (She says she doesn't think she'll make it to 100, but she said that about 97, 98 and 99.  I think I'm gonna be helping her celebrate another birthday come next April!) I think the real reason that my grandma is still alive and doing well is that she's too stubborn to die, but even more important than that, I think it is because she still has a lot of love left to give. Reach in there  - find your stubborness, and your love, and in honor of your grandson, sew those seeds of love and hope wherever you find fallow ground. I wish you all the best. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Jodie, I highly recommend that you consider natural therapy, regardless of what the docs say, and whether or not you get chemo. If there is the slightest possibility that there are still active cancer cells, I think you need to go after them, and natural therapy can be very effective for that. There are some good cancer diets that work to create an internal environment not conducive to cancer cell growth. They also contribute to cancer cell death while nourishing regular cells and tissues. That is a win-win situation. You can find information about cancer diets at www.cancertutor.com. Also, I recommend you take some specific supplements that will help boost your system to fight any cancer that might be there.  (Forgive me if I've mentioned this to you before and sound like a broken record - I really seriously believe in the power of natural treatment to help fight cancer, and I equally seriously believe in doing every thing one can to prevent cancer - and that very definitely means proper foods and nutrition!) I am finding numerous authoritative sources who say there are 5 minerals that EVERYONE absolutely must have to prevent of fight cancer, and these days very few people manage to get enough of these nutrients through diet alone.  Selenium is the absolutely most essential element for a healthy immune system, as it is used by every cell in the body for every immune process.  We need at least 200 mcg/day. Up to 400 mcg/day is ok for short periods of time.  Magnesium - 200 - 250 mg/day, not more than 350 mg/day. Zinc 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day max for short periods of time. Manganese 10 - 15mg/day.  Calcium 1200 mg/day.  We also need sufficient vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb calcium . OUr bodies will manufacture D-3 if we get 15 - 20 minutes exposure to sunshine every day, but I believe in leaving nothing to risk, so recommend supplementing D-3  also.  Most people do well with 1000iu - 2000iu/day,  10000iu would be max for short periods of time.  Also, if there are cancer cells that your body is fighting, or if your immune system is working to repair itself, detoxification of cells and the bloodstream is vitally important.  Drink plenty of pure fresh water. I recommend steam-distilled water - with a home steam distiller you can use tap water and distill it to 97 - 98% pure, which is higher than you will get with all but the most ultra-filtered bottled waters.  (A reverse osmosis machine is effective to create pure water, also.) I wish you the best in getting the answers you need, and peace with whatever you decide about treatment. Sincerely, Tre",

Dr Burzynski's work has been highly recommended by some dealing with brain cancer, which is very difficult to treat, so it may be that how he would recommend treating you is ok.  But I would still recommend that you check out other alternative methods of treatment before making a decision.

      "Content": "Hi Laura, Yes, breast cancer can be a very scary thing, even after treatment is done, because there ARE no guarantees. But if you stop and think about it, life itself could be a very scary thing, because there is no guarantee about anything. One thing that my experiences with cancer has taught me, is to move forward through each successive day as pro-actively as I can. Attitude is extremely important to survivorship. Negative thoughts and emotions can cause chemical changes in our bodies that do physical harm, but positive thoughts and emotions can bring about chemical changes in our bodies that are healing and impart peace.  So choose that which is good, and set aside that which is bad. (And yes, I know that is MUCH easier said than done, especially when you're this close to diagnosis and finishing up treatment.  It does, however, become easier with time.) I am not one to foist my spiritual beliefs on others.  Suffice it to say that since I was first diagnosed with cancer in 2002, that I have found Buddhist philosophy to be very comforting, and actually very instructional in how to live a proactive lifestyle.  Therefore I highly recommend to other women that they also draw strength from their spiritual beliefs, and put into practice the wisdom of those beliefs. On the more tangible level, I recommend adopting a natural lifestyle that encompasses feeding your body for health, hydrating for detoxification and immune and lymph health,  exercising for strength, endurance, and the production of endorphins and other positive chemical changes brought about by exercise, and a good healthy portion of laughter every day. There are lots of foods, herbs, and supplements that you can use to help  fight recurrence, without the side effects of prescription drugs, and WITH the enjoyment of flavor, good nutrition, and the positive effects of knowing that you are LIVING well despite having had cancer. You can get an idea of the types of things I am talking about if you'll take a look at my blog: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers This is my personal regimen that I am using to keep myself in remission from metastasis to my lungs.  I am not publishing this as a prescription for other women - every person's body chemistry is different, and what works for me may not be a good choice for someone else.  However, I have tried to make note of those things that I do that should be good safe choices for most people, so I think that you certainly could at least get some ideas of things you can do for yourself by looking at my regimen.  You are welcome to look at anything else on the blog that interests you - you can find my story if you look at the archive, and I have a link you can use should you wish to contact me via email. I listed some online sites in my other reply to this message thread.  Those sites have information on prevention of recurrence as well as treatment of active cancer.  I have discovered a wonderful book that I think every woman should have if she is interested in maintaining good breast health: \"Dr Susan Love's Breast BOok\" 4th edition.  Considered by many women to be the \"bible\" on breast cancer and breast health. Gives a lot of great advice on how to proceed after treatment of breast cancer; offers stories of women who've been through many trials with this disease but still have found ways to live life with great zest and fullness. Let the love, joy, and laughter of your children and your grandchildren carry you forward.  No, we don't have a cure for this disease yet, that will collectively eradicate suffering for all women, but individually we can avail ourselves of our best personal resources, rejoice in surviving every day, and plan on having a multitude of days in which to rejoice.  I think those 7 grandkids could probably help you with that a lot! I wish you the very best! Sincerely, Tre",

You need to make sure you are taking good care of yourself, also.  A broken down caregiver is no good to anyone.  Make it a point to include laughter as part of every day - even if at first it is forced laughter, that's still ok.  Laughter is a non-discrimination therapy - it will bring about positive body chemical changes regardless of whether the laughter is real or not.  Exercise your senses by reason of use:  make yourself see humor in everyday life, and laugh out loud.  Ask those around you to help. Also, share the humor with your mom.  Rather than seeming to make fun of her situation, shared humor is very important for her also, because it emphasizes the normalcy of everyday life (which can be very reassuring to someone who is very ill), and shows her that she is loved and still considered to be an important part of the family. Make sure to talk to your mom, about anything and everything. Encourage everyone else to do the same.  Keep her in the loop, unless she tells you otherwise. At some point things may start looking very grim for your mom.  This is an excellent preparatory article about end-stage cancer: http://www.virtualtrials.com/btlinks/death.cfm  Sincerely, Tre",

If there is someone else that can clean the litter box for you, that is best.  If not, wear gloves, and make sure to practice good hand-washing afterward. Also, I recommend you get one of those rubberized litter mats that catch the litter from your cats paws as they jump out of the litter box.  (the ones that look like shag carpet or artificial grass are nice - very effective at cleaning a kitty's paws so they don't track litter over furniture, etc) Other than that, enjoy your kitty. My mother's kitties seemed to know she was really sick when she was getting chemo - she ALWAYS had a kitty by her side - seemed like they took turns playing nurse and making sure she had company and reassurance that she was loved.  My cats pretty much did the same with me when I had chemo - was really comforting to have that fuzzy warm body cuddling up to me when I really felt crappy. Also, I knew my kitties needed me - gave me incentive to do what I had to do, push on with the surgeries, chemo, etc, because my little guys and my partner both needed me! I wish you wellness!

I have cramps and stomach trouble I can't sleep at night My hips ache most of the time If I am not feeling chilled...I am breaking out in sweats! I get cramps in my legs as well as achey feet....Is there anyone else out there who is experiencing what I am?  I would love to go off the pill...but I am so afraid that the cancer will come back!  Has anyone tried taking the femara less often...perhaps every other day? Hoping to share some opinions! Murphy Your side effects are not uncommon - in fact, from what I've been seeing on the internet, they seem to be more the rule than the exception.  You might get relief from switching drugs, if your dr is willing to work with you to find something you can tolerate, and if you have the patience and adequate insurance coverage to go through that process. You might also get relief by adding herbs/natural foods and supplements, but I urge you to be EXTREMELY careful if you do so, especially if you continue the prescription drug.  While research has identified some herbs that will enhance the action of anti-estrogen drugs and decrease side effects, many natural substances commonly used for hormone replacement therapy can cause serious problems in combination with both aromatase-inhibitors and estrogen-blockers.   At the very least, natural hormone replacers can negate the action of the prescription drugs, giving the cancer free rein to do what it wants.  (e.g. Grape seed has been shown to help with some drugs, resveratrol is very controversial, as is red clover. Most of the researchers/drs opinions that I've read put SOY at the top of the \"stay-away-from list.) If you can't get on to a more tolerable drug, and want to try to stay on the  Femara, take some time and do some extensive research on line about herbs and supplements that 1) act as aromatase inhibitors, 2) act as estrogen blockers, 3) work to build up bone and muscle health and relieve arthritis pain.  (You may not have arthritis, but many of the natural compounds that help with arthritis pain will help your joint pain, as well as containing powerful anti-oxidants that will fight the cancer.  e.g. garlic, up to 1500 mg a day.  The odorless tabs work great, or you can put garlic oil caps in the freezer - the oil thaws once it reaches the colon where it is absorbed without causing all the burping, etc associated with garlic. )  Good search items are \"herbal alternatives for breast cancer treatment\" and \"complimentary alternative treatment for breast cancer.\"  If you encounter language you don't understand, do a search on that language - many, many sites out there that break down medical terminology into layman's language.  Takes time to ferret out, but well worth it to understand what you're reading.  Also try to verify information on herbs and supplements by checking one site against others. Once you've gotten started better educating yourself about what herbs/ supplements and natural foods  can do to alter the body's production and use of estrogen, then you can talk to your doctor about adding them to your daily routine.  He/she may already have patients who use natural additives to improve treatment and overall health.  If not, ask them to refer you to a naturalist, an osteopath or homeopath or naturolopath, a nutritionist, or whoever is available in your community and that your doctor feels he/she can work with to get you to a point where you can comfortably continue the Femara.  This referral may or may not be covered by your insurance, but would be well worth the cost of self-pay if it helped you find supplements that would help you comfortably stay on the Femara, or that might have some chance of continuing to fight the cancer if you have to go off the Femara. Alternative supplementation might also be a good idea with the other drugs available, but again, use caution and make sure to get your dr's approval for whatever you take.  Good luck, and hang in there!!  ",

Goldenseal is a marvelous herbal healer and natural antibiotic.  You can get a salve called \"The Golden Salve\" by Equinox Botanicals at an herb shop or probably at a natural foods store.  A very little bit goes a long way.  I would recommend mixing a dab with the Aquaphor, or with some water-based aloe vera gel.  Make sure to take it out of the jar with a q-tip so you don't contaminate the remaining salve, and keep the opened jar refrigerated.  A 1 1/4 oz jar probably will be $10 - $12, but it is the best healer I've ever used, and that little jar should be all you need to get through this. Apply 3 - 4 x's/d, or you could alternate with the neosporin - just make sure to clean one off before applying the other.  (Do not use the goldenseal if you have a severe allergy to ragweed.) When showering to remove all lotions, antibiotics, etc, before going for your treatment, make sure to use lukewarm rather than hot or cold water, and let the water hit the back of your shoulders and run over your breasts rather than hitting directly on your chest.  This helps prevent further damage to burnt skin and trauma to delicate new skin.  Unless you have a soap recommended by your dr or nurses/techs, use the mildest soap you can find - fragrance free and if possible, salicilate free  (Jergen's White All-Family bath soap is excellent.)  I would also recommend using all-cotton rounds or all-cotton gauze pads rather than a wash cloth. When cleaning your breasts between showers, use steam-distilled water (inexpensive and available in the drinks aisle at the supermarket) and the cotton rounds or gauze pads.  Again, this helps prevent infection and is much gentler on the skin than most tap water and a wash cloth. You have my very best wishes for effective treatment and speedy healing. Tre   ",

The best place that I know of to get started on a protocol is Dr R Paul St Armand's site: http://www.fibromyalgiatreatment.com/index.htm.  I use Mucinex as my source of guaifenesin.  It's a little more expensive than some other sources, but it can be bought over the counter, is widely available,  and is a sustained-release, which provides me more even relief.  I also recommend printing out a list of herbs, foods, etc, that contain salicylates and therefore should be avoided, as salicylates will nullify the effect of the guaifenesin.  This can be obtained thru the referenced site. If you start a guaifenesin protocol, please be aware that in the first few days your symptoms may actually seem worse, due to a release of toxins into the bloodstream.  Please persevere - this lasts only a few days.  Dr Armand's protocol is very helpful in dealing with this. I also have breast cancer - 5 years after initial treatment I have recently been diagnosed with stage IV disease.  My oncologist says there is no contraindication to staying on the guaifenesin while undergoing other treatment for cancer.  Best of luck to you.    ",

I had a Partial and Sentinal Node Dissection (1 node positive).  I am now scheduled for a ALND (all nodes).  Because of the side effects I'm thinking about backing out - if it's going to efffect my quality of life (what I have left) I think I can skip on it.  And no radiation or Chemo.  Does anyone have any info or experience with this? Thanks  -  Happy Holidays  -  Jill Hi Jill, If you're thinking you only have a few months left, then skip the surgery.  If you live longer, you can still have the surgery later.  However, if there's a chance you have longer than that to live, there are alternatives to both surgery, chemo and radiation. I think I may have given you these references before, but figured it wouldn't hurt to give them again.  http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us Perhaps you can effectively address your cancer naturally without the quality of life issues that surgery, chemo and radiation bring about. As for lymphedema, that can also be managed naturally.  There are foods and herbs that promote movement of lymph fluids even without the lymph nodes, and pooling of fluids can be prevented or managed with postioning, utilizing gravity, compression garments, and rebounding (exercising on a mini-trampoline.)  With all the nodes removed you are likely to have some problems with lymphedema, but that doesn't mean your life would be over.  Minor lymph edema is just an inconvenience; many women live with moderate or even severe lymphedema and manage quite well. Yes, sometimes it means altering the way you do things, and living with discomfort, but the alternative of choosing NO treatment at all is pretty radical and irreversible.  I only lost half the nodes on one side, but I live very well with mild lymphedema in both the arm, shoulder and upper chest. Losing all the nodes definitely would present more of a problem.  If you choose not to have the surgery - I can understand that to be a reasonable choice, but please still consider consulting with a naturopathic/holistic dr or practitioner, and spend some time looking at the alternatives to orthodox medicine. Even something as simple as adding supplements to boost the immune system  can make for a better quality of life, no matter what the quantity. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Jodie, You know how it is when you're trying to think of something and can't bring it to mind - if you just let go of it and think of something else, the thing that was eluding you will just all of a sudden pop into your head? I've been trying to sleep for quite a while - just too much stuff spinning around in my head - keeping me awake.  Not cancer compass stuff - just other stuff.  All of a sudden, it pops into my head:  be a clown. I have a friend  - I'll call him Ed - who volunteers as a clown. He used to work the rodeos, as a professional clown to protect the bull riders, until he was injured and could no longer do it. Took the joy out of his life.  Then his mom passed away - that really took the joy out of his life.  Knowing that Ed was having a hard time, a friend of his that often volunteered with a group of clown for kids in the hospital asked Ed to fill in for him for just one day while the friend was out of town.  There actually were other people who could have done this, but the friend knew Ed needed the joy and laughter of children to replace the grief in his heart.   Ed wasn't real enthusiatic about filling in, but he owed the guy a favor and agreed to do it. Turns out Ed's friend was a pretty smart man.  Ed went to the hospital, worked with the kids, made them laugh, and lo and behold, they made HIM laugh. Showed him that there was still room in his heart for love and joy and victory, instead of grief and sadness and defeat. When Ed next saw his friend, he asked to join their volunteer clown group. He's been with them for a number of years now - he says he never gets tired of doing it.  And he doesn't just visit the kids - he goes to see church members that are in the hospital, shut ins in their homes - all kinds of people, and he does it for free. He sure gave me a big boost the day I was walking down the hall of the hospital just hours after I'd had my gallbladder removed,  trying to get myself mobile so I could go home.  This big clown came lumbering up the hall, grabbed me gently, shook my hand with his clown buzzer, and made me laugh!  Made my belly hurt a little bit, but sure took my mind off the discomfort of walking!  I didn't even know who he was until he took his mask off.  Said he was on his way to see the kids, so I was thankful to have also gotten the benefit of his visit. If you feel up to it, maybe you could check out if there is a volunteer clown group in your neighborhood. I'm sure they'd be glad to have some help, as you feel able and comfortable. You don't have to be able to do anything special tricks, or wear a really fancy clown get up.  A painted smile and a funny nose, a floppy hat, and some baggy drawers - that gets good laughs, and sick kids sure do love getting a balloon, or a box of crayons and a coloring book.  And they sure get happy when the clown sits down and colors a picture with them, or reads a story to them. ( A lot of the adults seem to like the clowns, too.)  And you know how kids are - they can be quick to give back the love and kindness they receive.  Just like Ed:  therapy for them, therapy for you. Wishing you the best, Tre",

I had been feeling \"not right\" for months - breast exam, mammogram looked good, no reason to think my cancer was back. Then I had a CT scan of abdomen trying to find the cause of pain that turned out to be not cancer related, but the scan showed nodules in my lungs.  Testing was non-conclusive, and my oncologist wanted to wait and rescan in 4 months.  I said no way and got a 2nd opnion - surgical biopsy proved metastatic breast cancer. Not saying this is you, but if you aren't feeling right, as the other poster said - listen to your gut and get it checked out.  And don't let them put you off saying it's nothing and you're just being silly.  You know your body better than they do!!!

      "Content": "Hi Dave, I think the most important thing you can do is to let your wife know that you love her, and will support her decisions, whatever they might be.  No sense striving with her over this stuff, when you already know she's stubborn and is gonna do things her way, anyway. As for your son, he's old enough to understand the situation, or to ask good questions when he doesn't.  Just tell him straight up what's happening, and let him choose to interact with this in his own way.  Do let him know that one of the best things he can do to help his mom is the same thing I just told you - to let her know he loves her and supports her decisions.   Be there for her - if she wants to do chemo, then that's the right thing to do. they're probably going to give her some whopping big chemo treatments, and there are going to be times when she really feels like crap.  Ask her what she needs you to do to help, and  remind her that her job right now is getting well, and you and your son can make up the slack. There are lots of things that she can do to help this chemo work - these sites have excellent information about natural therapies that are complementary to chemo: http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us Make sure to check with her dr before adding natural therapy - some things can interfere with chemo. Diet is an extremely important issue.  You didn't way whether her cancer is hormone receptor positive.  If it is, and your wife is interested in the Budwig diet, would probably be better for her to use ground flax seed instead of flax seed oil, and to limit to 2 - 3 tsp ground seeds per day, as flax has the highest concentration of phytoestrogen of all the plants. You can read about nutrition on the sites I gave you.  Green leafy veggies and lots of fruits are key (no bananas - if she needs potassium, there are lots of other foods that have potassium in them without the high sugar content._Limit to one apple per day. Pomegranates are not a good choice - they also are very high in phytoestrogen.  Any kind of berry is ok, as are citrus fruits, except grape fruit.)  She also needs to get plenty of pure fresh water, both for hydration to help the treatments be more effective, and for detoxification - removal of all the nasty by-products of the chemo.  No refined sugar - specifically cane sugar, or artificial sweeteners.  Use small amounts of either  crystallized fructose (available at health food stores and online), pure honey, pure maple syrup, or stevia. These are good supplements for her to take - very important for boosting her immune system and fighting her cancer.  Again, check with the dr to make sure it's ok for her to take these with her particular chemo.  selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max) When you get scared or frustrated, remember to step back away from things, take some big deep breaths, and refocus.  Keep your thoughts in the here and now, and don't give in to all the \"what if's\".  It's really difficult when you love someone and want to help them, and they aren't receptive to that help - you just gotta do the best you can do, and let go of the rest.  Remember to take good care of you, and of your son.  Way too easy for caregivers to overextend themselves, but broken down caregivers don't do the patient (or themselves) any good.  Laughter is an extremely valuable part of life - do everything  you can to find humor, and put it first place in your home.  And remember that you can come back to Cancer Compass anytime you have questions or need to vent, or want to let us know what is happening.

      "Content": "Two things: estrogen helps keep cholesterol down. You are taking a drug that inhibits production of estrogen - that certainly can be contributing to high cholesterol.  Make sure to at least some leafy greens and cruciferous veggies, whole grains, and beans of any kind.  They contain lower levels of phytoestrogens that aren't as likely to interfere with arimidex as the higher level herbs, and they will quite possibly really help to bring your cholesterol down.  Oats prepared in any fashion are especially good - a bowl of oatmeal in the morning can do wonders.  second - are you eating a lot of foods or taking supplements that are high in vitamin b-17 (as many people do, trying to supplement drug treatment.)  For some people, vitamin b-17 can cause a drop in blood pressure, even severe enough to cause loss of consciousness. If you aren't consciously taking b-17, you might still be eating a lot of foods that contain it (there are over 1200 common foods that contain b-17)   Barley powder and wheat grass are two very common supplements for people with cancer - they are both very high in b-17, as are buckwheat and chia seeds.  This site contains a pretty good list of the more commonly eaten foods that are rich in b-17.  If you are eating a lot of these, you might try cutting back on some of these, see if that helps. http://ezinearticles.com/?Vitamin-B-17-Rich-Cancer-Fighting- Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "I have not had Herceptin, but I can tell you from my nursing experience, my own personal experience, and from what I read on the board, that every woman diagnosed and treated for breast cancer goes through the same emotions.  No one has any guarantee that treatment will work, regardless of what the treatment is.  We all get nervous, and we all get scared - the wonderful thing is that we learn to work through that and get on with the business of living. Becoming educated about breast cancer and your treatment - in this case herceptin - is extremely important to survival.  You need to know what to expect, you need to know what questions to ask, you need to know what is normal and what isn't, and you need to be able to recognize signs that the treatment is or isn't working.  What you DON'T need is to overwhelm yourself with too much information.  TMI is crazy making - don't go there. Take this thing in doses that you can handle - one day at a time.  Or when you don't feel so good, one hour at a time or one moment at a time.  No sense borrowing trouble from tomorrow when today has concerns enough of its own.  Deal with what's on your plate today - in doing so you will always be taking care of tomorrow. If your nerves start to get the best of you, step back from them.  Breathe, breathe, breathe.  Allow yourself to refocus on the hear and now, what you know for sure.  And what you know for sure right now is that you're surviving, and you're doing ok at it!!! While you're checking out more information about herceptin, etc, please also be sure to check out what you can do to supplement the medical treatment.  Lots of good foods, herbs, and supplements that will help boost your immune system and that in and of themselves are very effective at fighting breast cancer.  You need to make sure that anything you add to your diet or personal regimen in that respect is not going to counteract the Herceptin - e.g. if you decide to start drinking a lot of green tea, make sure it's ok with your dr, that it isn't contraindicated with the medications you are currently taking.   Your best source of information on natural agents to help in this process would be a naturopathic oncologist.  If you do not have access to someone like that, seek out other professional naturopaths or holistic practitioners in the area.  There is plenty of information online and in reference books galore - again, could be TMI.  Personal interaction with someone experienced in recommending natural augmentation of therapy would help you make practical decisions in light of your particular situation.  (Everyone's body chemistry is different - what might work well for one lady taking Herceptin might not work well for another.) I highly recommend every woman fighting breast cancer at least take a look at Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th ed. Dr Susan Love is a breast cancer survivor herself, is a highly respected clinician, and is extremely dedicated to not only helping women with breast cancer survive and live full, productive lives, but also to eradicating breast cancer in her lifetime.  Her research foundation is among the premiere organizations in the world in terms of working to combine natural with conventional treatments, as well as understanding and treating the complications of therapy. I wish you well. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Bonniee, Actually, there is LOT that you CAN eat, so rather than give you sample menus, I'll just tell you good food choices. Fruit:  Any kind of berry is great, and you should eat berries as much as you can - just avoid added sugar (fructose or honey is ok.)  Tart cherries (black cherries) or tart cherry extract are excellent choices. Any Citrus fruit - except grapefruit and bananas (unless you need them for the potassium - then one banana a day is ok.)  Especially papaya and pineapple - either eat the raw fruit or get extracts (papaya tablets and bromelaine extract.) Lemons and limes are great. Apples - the more sour apples are better.  No more than 1 large or 2 small to medium apples/day, and eat both the skin and the seeds.  Cantelope provides needed vitamins plus vitamin B-17.  Seeded Grapes - concord are best, but red or black will do - eat the skins and the seeds (try to get organic grapes, if not - wash well with warm soapy water and rinse, rinse, rinse.)  If you can't get seeded grapes, use Welch's 100% concord frozen grape juice concentrate, and make it with steam-distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water. (Any kind of water with chlorine in it is a no-no for drinking and cooking.) Black currants are a great choice. DO NOT eat pomegranate or drink pomegranate juice.  Juices:  Welch's concord as mentioned above.  Mangosteen, noni, goji.  NO orange juice unless unsweetened and then only a little bit. DO drink Lemonade from unsweetened 100% pure lemon frozen concentrate or actual squeezed lemons - mix with pure water. Apple cider vinegar:  get an organic brand, use as much as you can tolerate as often as you can tolerate, on salads, vegetables, in cooking.  If you can tolerate it, drink a tsp in an 8 oz glass water/day.  Apple cider vinegar extract tablets are ok, too. Vegetables:  cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts, kale, spinach, endive, radishes, beets (pickled beets are ok, but not Harvard beets - too much sugar added.)  Carrots in moderation ( no more than 1 medium carrot/day).  Celery in moderation.  Lettuces and greens.  Asparagus. Cabbage. Bok choy and chinese cabbage.  Parsnips (but not turnips.) Peppers - red, orange or yellow are best as green peppers can cause a lot of heartburn, especially with chemo. AVOID peas and corn and sugar snap peas . Lima beans , snow peas, are ok but in small amounts infrequently.   NO SPROUTS. Tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes - as many as you can eat, in whatever form you can eat. If you can't get tomatoes, get a lycopene supplement and follow the label directions. Rhubarb is an excellent choice - as little sweetener as possible to make it palatable.  Sweetener: organic crystallized fructose - available at health food stores, some grocery stores in the organic/health food aisle, and online.  Can be used for cooking and on cereal, in tea, etc.  Use as little as possible. The herb stevia is an excellent choice.  You can also use very small amounts of pure honey and pure maple syrup.  AVOID:  nutrasweet, aspartame, phenylalanine, any kind of artificial sweetener.  Dairy:  as little dairy as possible.  For milk, raw goats milk is the best choice.  Raw cow's milk or sheep's milk is ok.  If you can't get raw, you need to try to find organic milk from grass fed cows that are not given any hormones. 100% organic butter rather than any kind of margarine. Any kind of cheese should be organic - hard cheeses are a better choice than soft (except cottage cheese, which I will address later.)  Limit intake of cheese.  Ice cream IS NOT a good choice, although a little bit now and then is ok.   YOGURT should be limited, and should be unsweetened - no more than once or twice a week, unless you want to use it with flax seed instead of cottage cheese (see below.) Eggs:  organic, farm fresh from range fed chickens. No need to limit intake, but should be soft-cooked  - just enough to be done, as too much heat destroys the sulfur, protein and other nutrients in the egg.Try to eat at least one egg a day. AVOID HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.  AVOID ALL FORMS OF SODA POP.  (Exception:  ginger ale or lemon-lime soda if needed for nausea or heartburn.) Nuts and seeds:  almonds, walnuts, macadamia nuts are ok. Apricot kernels are an excellent source of vitamin b-17, if you can tolerate eating 5 - 6 a day (if not, don't worry about it.)   Roasted pumpkin seeds are a great source of omega fatty acids and protein - see my blog.  Squash seeds can be roasted the same way. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/roasted Avoid sunflower seeds, peanuts and brazil nuts.  NO peanutbutter.  Oils:  100% pure organic virgin expeller-pressed coconut oil from raw coconuts (not dried chopra.)  Expensive, but absolutely the very best choice of oils - melts at a much lower temp, so you won't need to use as much.  Can be used for cooking, salads - even on your skin - anything that you would use any other kind of oil.  Next best choice is 100% pure organic extra virgin olive oil. Avoid:  safflower oil, corn oil, any kind of vegetable oil that has hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated fats (also known as trans fats.) Linseed oil = flax oil - I do not advise using it. Meats:  the less, the better, although if you go totally meatless, you do need to supplement with a good vitamin b-12 (see my blog, \"buzzing the B's - vitamin b-12).  I totally avoid fish and sea food - the earth's water supply is drastically contaminated, and it gets into the fish.  Wild Alaska salmon, or any fish/sea food that comes from far northern very deep cold waters would be the best choice if you want to do fish.  I recommend fish no more than once a week. If you want to supplement with fish oil, I recommend krill oil - very expensive, but really the only way to ensure that you are getting uncontaminated fish oil. Chicken - best if range fed that isn't given any hormones.   Beef - needs to be grass fed without hormones.  Pork - not a good choice.  Lamb/mutton - infrequent. The average person in industrialized nations eats WAAAAAAY too much meat - I recommend maximum intake of 3 - 4 ounces of meat 3 - 4 times/week.   Turkey needs to be range fed without hormones. Be very careful with organ meats - no more than once a month.  Beans/legumes (except peas):  as much as you can stand to eat.  Dried organic beans/legumes  are the best choice - soak in pure water before cooking (soak at least 8 hours to break down the components that cause bloating/gas.)  This is a major source of protein and roughage, and contains MANY cancer fighters.  Beans and legumes cooked with onions and garlic add an extra boost. Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Grains: Organic brown rice is best, otherwise long-grain rice.  (White rice is a poor choice.) Whole grains:  wheat, oats, spelt, etc - I have an article on my blog listing good choices.  Avoid, white flour and processed pastas - whole wheat or spinach pasta is ok.  Cous-cous is ok. Buckwheat pancakes is an excellent choice - go ahead and use butter and maple syrup on them!  Barley is an excellent choice to add to soups, stews, chili, etc. Chocolate:   dark chocolate that is at least 70% cacao is an excellent choice.  NOT fattening, but offers a lot of cancer-fighting nutrients.  ALCOHOL:  avoid ALL alcohol except red wine.  3 - 4 ounces of red to dark red table wine/day is ok - will help fight the cancer - the sugar in the wine carries the phytochemicals to the cancer cells, so is ok. Do not use a beverage wine for this - way too sweet.  I use Taylor Lake Country Red Table Wine -  that is the very least tannin content and sweetness you want.  Anything that's darker or dryer would also be ok. Juicing/smoothies:  - a great way to get nutrition fast.   add a 1/2 tsp organic powdered brewer's yeast, and powdered lecithin for nutrition. You may need to add just a little fructose or honey with these to make it palatable, and it's good to add some crushed ice.  Barley grass powder or wheat grass powder are also very powerful additives. If you don't juice or make smoothies, I suggest you supplement with barley grass or wheat grass tablets.  Just remember to take with food. SOY:  I would avoid completely. FLAX:  breakfast only - this is my routine: I make sure to eat no later than 1 hour before going to bed. I do not eat or drink anything other than water  for another 8 - 10 hours.  First thing when I get up - a handful of grapes with seeds (concord, red or black grapes.)  If I can't get grapes, I use 6 - 8 ounces of Welch's 100% pure concord grape concentrate - non-pasteurized, mixed with steam-distilled water.  THen I eat about 1/2 cup small curd cottage cheese (organic when I can get it) with no more than 1 tsp ground flax seed. I add salt and pepper for taste, and I sometimes throw in  no more than 1/4 cup roasted pumpkin seeds or a small handful of dried black currants. Cranberries would work just as well.  I drink 10 ounces of brewed green and black tea - I just use 1 green tea bag and 1 black tea bag, and I steep it pretty strong, adding fructose to taste. . (you could do one or the other if you don't like them combined.) COOKING tips:  as much as you can, use onions (fresh, frozen, or powdered or minced), garlic (fresh or powdered - but not garlic salt), crushed red pepper, turmeric, and cumin. If you don't like cooking with onions or garlic, or if you're getting chemo and can't handle the spice food, I recommend you take an odorless garlic supplement. Fresh, raw, organic fruits and veggies are the very best choice - but not always possible.  Flash frozen is the next best choice - canneries do a pretty thorough job of washing fruits and veggies before freezing them, and with todays technology, everything you get in the freezer section is now being flash frozen, except ice cream and dairy products.   Canned (unless home canned in glass jars) - should be the very last choice.  Exception is tomatoes - but try to buy brands that do not have the plastic coating inside the can, as this is broken down by the acids in the tomatoes.  If there is anything specific that I haven't mentioned, and you want to know if it's ok to eat, just send me a message.  I'm not sure where you live, so don't know what regional foods you might choose.   I have a few recipes on my blog - they are all ok for anyone with cancer to use. Take a look at my series on the B-vitamins \"The Buzz on the B's\" - there are like 8 or 9 articles (I don't have my B-17 article published yet, and that one may take a while - have hit a few road blocks!)  Unless I have specifically mentioned to avoid something above, ALL of the foods that I list in the vitamin B articles are ok to eat.  Look at the articles on ancient seeds and grains, and on functional foods.  Take a look at the Lemon Volcano Drink (enter that in the search box - it will pull up several articles - one has a recipe.)  That is an excellent detoxifier, if you can stand to do it with the cayenne pepper.  It provides the cancer fighting benefits of citric acid , capcaisin in the pepper, and maple syrup. In fact, I recommend that you read through the whole blog, as you get time.  I've scattered cancer fighting information, including a lot about foods, throughout just about everything I've written on the blog.  There also is other advise, such as incorporating humor and laughter, exercise, detoxification, etc. I cannot emphasize enough that you need to be drinking plenty of fresh pure water. Minimum 64 ounces/day, as much as 80 - 100 ounces /day if you can tolerate it.  (If you weigh less than 125lbs - not more than 72 ounces/day.) Steam-distilled or filtered by reverse osmosis are best. I purchased a home steam-distiller when I found out I had metastasis - one of the very best investments I've ever made.  My partner and I know use steam-distilled water exclusively for all our drinking and cooking needs.  There is a link for A-1 Distillers in my blog.  I purchased the 1 gallon, metal-topped distiller - came to just under $120 including S&H, and the service is great: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Let me know if you have more questions.  You're welcome to use the link on my blog to send me email - just identify yourself as Bonniee from Cancer Compass in the subject line the first time you write.

      "Content": "The important question about commercial tea preparations:  do they contain crystallized fructose, or is it high fructose corn syrup?  If it's crystallized fructose, there is no harm in drinking it - in fact it may help.  Cancer cells get energy by fermenting sugar - the process called glycolysis. (unlike normal cells, that get energy by burning sugar)  Fructose, along with citric and acetic acid, work to inhibit glycolysis, thereby depriving cancer cells of the process they need to get energy to live.  That's why so many fruits, and actually quite a few vegetables are powerful cancer-fighters - the fructose in the food provides energy for normal cells while at the same time depriving energy from cancer cells.  Plus the fructose easily crosses cell barriers, carrying the anti-oxidants and other necessary phytochemicals (e.g. vitamin b 17) with it into the cells where it can do its job. High fructose corn syrup is a totally different story. This is a man-made process that concentrates the fructose component of corn many times beyond its natural sweetness. High fructose corn syrup can really screw up metabolism for most people - it's no longer a simple natural sugar but rather is made to become a very complex carbohydrate that has some extremely nasty effects on the body and is a major contributor to the problem of obesity in industrialized nations.  (See my blog article on fructose and stevia for the difference between fructose and high fructose corn syrup, including links that go into detail as to why high fructose corn syrup is such a bad food additive:   http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/fructos   ) This is also another reason why soda pop is such a terrible beverage choice for people with cancer:  sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, and made fizzy with phosphorylation, which is extremely hard on the liver and kidneys.  Making green tea used to be a major chore, as you had to get leaves and brew and strain them.  But these days green tea in bags is really quite common - even my local grocery store chain carries their own generic brand of green tea bags now - and I find it every bit as flavorful as the expensive brands.  True, it's probably not as potent and effective as loose tea imported fresh from wherever, but I think I probably am getting much more benefit from using tea bags and brewing my own, than I get from commercial bottled green tea. A lot of people say they don't like green tea unless prepared with honey and ginseng, but I've found it to be quite palatable with a little bit of crystalized fructose, or even with no sweetener at all. Another thing that people might try if they don't like green tea, is mixing green and black tea together.  (I just use one tea bag each, but don't steep them as long.)  It's a different flavor, and is a quite effective cancer fighter.  Teas not only contain anti-oxidants (flavonoids, polyphenols from catechins) but they also contain other classes of cancer-fighting phytochemicals:  theoflavins and theorubigins, as well as EGCG (higher content in green tea than black tea.)

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Hope you are doing well. Some answers for your questions: 1.  Why are sprouts not allowed?  Does this include broccoli sprouts? Brussels sprouts are actually an excellent choice for a cancer-fighting diet.  Very high in anti-oxidants, B vitamins and vitamin C,  plus sulforaphane, which is another phytochemical that helps inhibit cancer cell processes. The sprouts that one should avoid are salad sprouts - like alfalfa and bean sprouts.  This type sprouts are very easily contaminated with bacteria and fungi - not worth the risk of introducing infection into and already compromised immune system.  (I've seen some opinions that if a person is raising their own sprouts, knows the conditions under which they are grown and can guarantee that they are absolutely fresh, then it's ok to eat them, but just too many reports of inadvertant contamination even among the most careful of growers - just doesn't seem worth the risk to me when equal nutritional value can be gotten from safer foods.) 2.   My dr. (at one of the top 100 hospitals in the US) told me NOT to use any soy products, no grapefruit, NO green tea, NO flax - because the tumors were estrogen/progesterone positive. There's a lot of varying opinions about soy, but I personally agree with not using soy at all.  There are several different kinds of isoflavones in soy that have been researched in cancer treatment - genistein, and something else (I can't think of the other one right off the top of my head.) There's still a big controversy between these researchers as to which of these compounds might be safe in treating estrogen/progesterone positive cancers, and which might be harmful - so far as I'm concerned, I steer clear of soy. (With the exception of the very small amount of soy sauce I might get when I eat at my favorite chinese restaurant, at most several times a month!) As for grapefruit - that is also on my no-no list  for treatment of any kind of cancer.  Citrus fruits are great for fighting cancer, but grapefruit is best left alone. The reasoning goes a lot deeper than phytoestrogens - I have those notes somewhere among 6 - 8 months worth of other stuff!! As for flax and green tea, I think that's something that people really have to make their own choices about.  I definitely agree that flax seed oil in the diet is NOT a good choice for hormone positive cancers - the phytoestrogens in the oil are just WAY too concentrated to make it worth the risk of taking it, at least for me.  However, I've read some pretty convincing debate that the much lesser concentration of phytoestrogens in very small amounts of ground flax seed ( a tsp or two a day at most)  is more likely to act as an estrogen blocker rather than estrogen replacement, thus actually working to deprive cancer cells of estrogen, while also utilizing the cancer-killing properties of the lignans in the flax seed.  (I hope that has made sense to you - I got interrupted while I was typing this, kind of lost my train of thought for a few minutes!!) The same thing may be true of green tea - indeed of black tea, also. Tea does contain some phytoestrogens - the question is do the benefits of the antioxidants, OPC's and other cancer-fighting phytochemicals they contain outweight the risks of the phytoestrogens they contain?  When I've looked at charts detailing foods and phytoestrogens, how much they contain - whether they are strong or weak phytoestrogens, I didn't consider tea to be that high up on the list, so I chose to use tea quite a lot in my regimen. Now for me there are other health benefits that I considered - tea is very detoxifying, and it offers a lot of benefits for arthritis and fibromyalgia and asthma  - so I considered the known benefits for me to outweigh the potential risk. And that's a choice that everybody has basically got to make for themselves, as concerns many foods, supplement and herb choices. (One might note that MANY foods, including most of the cruciferous vegetables- broccoli, asparagus, etc, actually contain quite a bit of phytoestrogens and other phytosterols. It's believed that those kinds of foods act as estrogen blockers because they contain weak phytoestrogens, but that may also depend upon what phase of reproductive timing a woman is in - premenopausal womens' bodies handle exogenous estrogen one way, whereas postmenopausal womens' bodies seem to handle it a different way. Butthe fact is that we can't cut out EVERYTHING in our diet/self-care that might provide estrogen to our bodies.   I think what we can do is try to determine for ourselves which foods, etc, contain the highest amounts of phytoestrogen, and make our own choices from there, having faith that in the broader range of considerations we are doing the right thing.  And we can also do some things like take an aspirin a day - 325 mg, any generic or name brand will do - to inhibit prostaglandin production that helps our bodies make estrogen. Take grape seed extract - it inhibits aromatase production. Things like that...) 3.  I typed Lemon Volcano Drink into the search bar.  It gave me 3 options for that, and none of them had the recipe.  Can you give it to me? Gladly, and bon appetit!  LEMON VOLCANO DRINK: 1 qt unsweetened lemonade (use one lemon and pure fresh water, or organic unpasteurized frozen lemonade concentrate and pure fresh water); 1 - 2 TBSP 100% pure maple syrup; a large pinch organic cayenne pepper (more if you can stand it!); shake vigorously! - drink daily as a tonic for cancer prevention; adjunct cancer treatment; to boost the immune, circulatory and nervous systems; detoxification; and to clean out your sinuses! (You might want to read my blog article that gives the history of this drink for me - I think it's kind of funny, and you might get a few chuckles reading about \"jiggling the fat.\") http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/jigglin Take care!  Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Noahgail, I would imagine that your physician is anxious to get this surgery done and treatment started as soon as possible because this is an infiltrating cancer, which means more aggressive, and they know it's already stage II, which yes, does mean it's possible that it's gotten farther than they've been able to tell so far - but more realistically, they just don't want to give it any more chance to get any farther. However,  I think the other poster's advice is valid.  While it indeed may be important to act on this very quickly, I don't feel that you should be rushed into this until you feel comfortable that  you've had your questions answered, and that you understand what all the drs are sure of, what the risks are, of what the treatment will consist, why they haven't mentioned radiation, etc, etc.  Unless there is some reason that the surgeon can't wait a week to do the surgery, might be unlikely that asking to postpone the surgery a few days or a week or even two is going to be that hugely detrimental to your recovery.   So, if you want more time to get this all under your belt, to have a chance to feel more in control, I think it's very reasonable to tell the docs that you aren't yet comfortable with all this and ask if the surgery can be rescheduled for a week or two later. And yes, you should ask if postponing will make that big of a difference.  If the doc says yes, it will, then insist that you get your questions answered NOW, so that you have time to assimilate as much of what's happening as you can before you have the surgery. I know that when I had my surgeries, I was frustrated that I had to wait several weeks from the point of definite diagnosis until I could get the cancer removed.  Man, I wanted it done tomorrow.  However, in retrospect I was able to see that the longer time interval allowed me to get some things done at home, to prepare, and to get myself educated about what was being recommended.  However, I did not have an invasive cancer.  And that does make a difference, and time there can be of the essence. So, I recommend that you talk to the dr and ask for more specific answers - why surgery so fast, specifically what follow up therapy, why he doesn't think radiation.  Start a notebook and/or file folder.  Keep a list of your questions, and write the answers down, too.  It's real easy to think that you've absorbed what's been said in the dr's office, etc, and then get home and realize you've forgotten what was said, or that you just don't understand it, or have more questions you should have asked.  Keeping these things written down really helps. Also, keeping copies of written reports, labs, scans (and getting cd's of the scans is helpful too - in case you have another dr that needs to see them later on), etc - is valuable for keeping track of your care and progress.  After your surgery you should be able to get a copy of the operative and pathology reports, either from your dr or from the hospital medical records dept. You should be able to get reports of scans from whoever does the scan, once your dr has seen the results. I know this is a really scary time for you.  If you start to feel overwhelmed, step back, take some slow deep breaths, and refocus on whatever it is you have to deal with right then and there, rather than all the stuff that looms so threateningly in the future.  The only moment that you have any control over ( that ANY of us have any control over) is the moment that you are in right now.  Keep that in focus, make that your reality, and you will do ok.  That's how everyone gets through cancer, one day at a time, one hour at a time, one moment at a time.  You may find yourself having some big sighs - that's ok - it's good to get some really deep breaths - helps keep your head clear and everything in perspective. And don't be afraid to have a cry or two, if you need it.  Tears are very cleansing, and your emotional reaction is just as valid as your intellectual reaction.  The shower or tub is a really good place to cry - it's private, the hot water is relaxing, and after you've gotten everything all cried out, take a nice soft washcloth and gently clean off your goopy face, and let yourself feel the peace that such a cry can bring.  Might be a little bit of a trembly peace, but the more you move through this process, the stronger you will feel. Please let us know how things go - lots of good people at Cancer Compass who will be rooting for you! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "finding out you have cancer is really hard when you already have other issues on your plate that you are dealing with.  I think you'll find a change in perspective on those issues - not that they won't be important any longer, but that they might sit on the back burner at times.  That isn't all bad - as long as  you get back to those issues as you are able, especially as you may find that the issues have continued to resolve.  As for what one does or doesn't hear from the therapist as regarding the cancer, as long as the focus remains on effective coping, the therapist is doing their job. Thinking about mortality in a more immediate way can bring about many unanticipated changes - not all of them are bad.  Surprisingly, many people find out that they are much stronger than they ever thought they were before the diagnosis of cancer. Therapy for some other very serious problems had already taught me many great coping skills by the time I was diagnosed with cancer - I actually found that having to think about the cancer issue  showed me that I had already achieved quite a bit of inner peace about my life, and that peace undergirded me as I set forth to deal with this new physical issue. Takes time to get there, and everyone journeys at their own pace and along their own path.  It's good that you've contacted your therapist, to let her know that there is this new threat in your life. Just remember to continue to be kind and gentle with yourself in the coming days.  Cancer literally thrives on anger, fear, hatred, bitterness, resentment, jealousy - any kind of negative emotion can bring about actual physical chemistry changes in cells that benefits cancer.  Love, compassion, joy, humor, tenderness - all these also bring about physical chemical changes in the body, but the changes from positive emotions nurture normal cells and act to deprive cancer of what it needs to grow.  Hopefully your therapist will encourage you to recognize the darker emotions floating around right now, to confront them and get them all out (which is why I recommend that people who are newly diagnosed give themselves permission and opportunity to cry - more than once , as needed), and then move on to a gentler, kinder, more nurturing self-acceptance.  We'll be thinking about you on Tuesday.

( I've posted a couple of those message responses myself, but I don't remember in which particular threads, and I haven't been able to access my message center to get the links for you.) If you haven't already, check with your drs about this pain to make sure it isn't recurrence - a PET scan should be sufficient, even if there is a lot of scarring from the radiation. Talk to them about getting on some pain meds, to help you with activities of daily living, and to get you through  rehabilitative therapy. In terms of therapy, two things you might investigate: a form of massage/physical therapy called myofascial release, and  rebounding - exercising with a 36\" mini-trampoline.  Here is the link that explains how this will help: http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Sincerely, Tre",

I understand what's expected to happen next...surgery, chemo, the side affects have been discussed.  Yet whoa! Slow down a second.  Can anyone tell me what happens if I opt to do nothing?  What is the process that happens to my breast then?  Or is it too painful to discuss?  Or is it just not done?  Everyone immediately says 'yeah, cut off my breast!'  I guess I need to hear the gruesome side to go w/ the scary side so I can weigh my options.  Thanks for letting me rant & and thanks for any answers. Dear Universecntr, Everyone's head reels when they get the diagnosis of cancer. Best thing to do is just step back a moment, take some big slow deep breaths, and re-focus on one moment at a time, until you start getting a handle on it.  And you can repeat that process anytime subsequently that you feel things starting to overwhelm or slip out of control.  You ask some really loaded questions; I will try to give you some fair but realistic answers.  What happens if you do nothing depends largely on the characteristics of the cancer - is it fast-growing/aggressively invasive of other tissues, or slow-growing. Has it already gotten into the lymph nodes or any place other than the breast? Is it estrogen dependent or not, and are you pre-, peri-, or post-menopausal? I realize that most of those questions you may not yet have an answer to - I'm not actually asking you to answer them, but rather trying to show that the answer to what happens isn't cut and dried. If you have a slow-growing cancer that is in the very early stages, you can go a very long time and stay quite well. My tumor was about 1 - 1 1/2 inches long when I found it, and the dr said that it had to have been growing for at least 2 years, but it could have been growing for as long as 8 - 10 years. It was so high up under my armpit that I wouldn't have found it when I did, except it was pressing up against a nerve and started causing excruciating pain. By the time I had it removed, it had already spread to the lymph nodes - which means had I not gotten treatment of some kind, I could absolutely depend upon it very soon  spreading to at least one major organ or my spine or other bones. As it was, 5 years after my last conventional treatment, we found metastasis to the lungs, and now I have put it into remission using my own natural regimen.  If you have an aggressive, or a fast-growing cancer, even if you have found it early, it may not be that long before it gets away from the breast and starts causing problems elsewhere. If you have an estrogen-dependent cancer and are post-menopausal, it may not grow as fast and/or spread as far than if you were pre- or peri-menopausal.  So what happens when it does leave the breast?  There are several places that all but the most rare types of breast cancer really like to go via the lymph system: the lungs, the eyes, the brain, the liver, the rib cage, and the spine. Again, if it's a slow growing cancer, it can take some time - even many years, to start shutting these organs down or causing a lot of pain. If it's a fast-growing or aggressive cancer, once it spreads, it may only be a matter of months before those organs start shutting down or pain becomes a major problem. But undisputably, if breast cancer is not eradicated by SOME means (and I include natural therapies in that category, along with surgery, chemo, and radiation,)  it will keep growing, getting bigger, and it will eventually get into the lymph nodes, and via the lymph system spread to other parts of the body.  In the end, women who \"die of breast cancer,\" aren't really killed by the cancer, but rather because the organs it invades eventually stop being able to function, and the body shuts itself down.  There indeed are women who choose not to have mastectomy, but to treat the cancer either thru chemo and/or radiation and/or CAM (complementary and alternative therapies.)  And many of those women are successful in at least extending their lifespans, and some even have succeeded in eradicating the cancer, or holding it at bay for many, many years.  Many factors go into how successful NOT getting rid of the tumor(s) may be: general overall health, how damaged is the immune system and can it be successfully boosted to defeat the cancer, diet and lifestyle, and what is done to kill the cancer.  I certainly understand your considering just not doing anything - I dealth with that line of thinking, more than once. However, my first experience with cancer helped me to see that life can be a very precious gift, worth living every day, if we but  make viewing it that way a priority. Consequently when I have those moments in which I think perhaps it's not worth fighting what may be inevitable, I soon kick myself in the butt and tell myself to get on with the business of living, and leave dying for some other day!  I just posted a reply to another message thread, about the effectiveness of and considerations that should go into alternative treatments. Perhaps you would like to take a look at the general comments I made and the references I gave: http://www.cancercompass.com/message-board/message/all,27993 I included a link to my blog in that post - perhaps you would also like to take a look at my story (check the blog archive - I believe \"my story\" was posted on Aug 23),  as well as my personal regimen.

Our stress levels, as many of you will know hit the roof many times. I am 44 years old and recently found a lump in my left breast, I have been to the specialist breast unit and they said they thought the lump was ok but wanted to do a fine needle aspiration .  I was told to return just to get the results.  When I got there I was told to undress from the waist up.  I thought it rather strange , so I asked what was wrong.  I was told I needed a core biopsy done under ultra sound.  What does this mean ?  Are they airing on the side of caution.  My friend who also had a lump had fine needle aspiration and was told that they would send her results in the post.   I know I shoudn't worry yet but I re live the day my Dad got told he had cancer over and over again. I need to get a grip on this situation so was just wondering if anyone else had experienced a similar situation.  I know they say 80 % of lumps end up being benign.  My lump is a moveable lump but quite big. Thanks for listening.   Gail   Hi Gail, Sometimes lumps are difficult to biopsy by needle aspiration, even if they are quite large, and especially if they are movable. Tumors can have a very thick protein layer surrounding them that is hard to puncture.  A movable lump can slide away from the needle. It sounds like the radiologist or pathologist is not sure they got a good biopsy, or there is something suspicious in the results of the needle biopsy that they want to confirm. Doing it under ultrasound helps to confirm that they actually locate and biopsy the lump instead of surrounding tissue.  Am unsure from your message whether you already had the core biopsy or not (sounds like you did??)  If not, make sure to take something for pain before the biopsy, and make sure you have someone to drive you home - core biopsies are much more painful than needle biopsies.  Sit down and write up a list of questions you have, take it with you to the dr's office when you go to get the results of the core biopsy. Take extra paper and something to write with so you can make notes if the biopsy showed cancer, or if they tell you that they want to keep an eye on this thing.  Best if you have someone else go with you, and have them take the notes - it can be really hard to take everything in when you get bad news, and it's really easy to forget what the dr says.  Also, if you aren't understanding what the dr is talking about, tell him/her right then and there.  And persist until you feel you understand - sometimes drs don't want to take the time to explain things in down-to-earth nitty-gritty terms, but that's what you need right now, and that's what you are paying them for.  I am hoping for you that this lump is benign.  But I want you to know that if it isn't, having breast cancer is not the end of the world.  Yes, it's very scary, especially since you lost your father so recently.  But one of the best ways to beat fear is to become informed.  So, if this is cancer, do some homework. Start a file folder for treatment.  Get a written copy of the biopsy so that you will know exactly what kind of cancer you have, and you can start learning about it online and through reference books. Also get written copies of lab reports, scans - anything you have done. (If you have scans, also very helpful to request a CD of the scan - that way if you ever need to go for a 2nd opinion or switch docs for some reason, you already have the scans for them to look at - just make sure they give you the cd's back.) Keep track of treatments in your file, also.  What medications you are given, doses, dates, and any side effects of reactions. Keeping track like this will help you feel like YOU are in control. That is the other thing that is important:  YOU are in control.  Not the drs, not your family.  YOU are the one who will ultimately make major decisions.  All the more reason to become informed.  Don't let anyone pressure for a decision until you feel you understand the situation and the options, and have time to make a decision with which you are most comfortable.  Even if that means you have to leave a dr's office, think about things, and go back.   If this is something for which you need treatment, consider complementary and/or alternative medicine/treatments.  There are  foods/herbs/and supplements that can work to increase the effectiveness of surgery/chemo/radiation as well as decrease side effects.   Many naturals also work to slow or stop cancer growth, as well as actually killing cancer cells themselves. If you find out that you need treatment, take a look at these sites: www.cancertutor.com www.lefcancer.org www.alkalizeforhealth.net http://www.alternativecancer.us  Regardless of whether this is malignant or benign, I recommend you get \"Dr Susan Love's Breast Book\" 4th edition, by Dr Susan Love. This is considered by many women to be the \"bible\" for breast health and treatment. It is a most comprehensive and excellent resource for understanding not only how to achieve and maintain breast health, but for understanding how hormones affect women's lives, things that we can do for mental and emotional health, and where to look for support when needed. Please let us know how things turn out.  If you get not such a good report, then we will try to support you as you move into a trying time of life. And if the report is benign, we will all be thrilled to do the happy dance with you! Sincerely, Tre",

Kasey's Grandma If you want to continue taking the Femara, you might consider adding some natural therapy to ease the joint pain. Curcumin (from the spice turmeric) has shown in clinical trials to be an effective pain reliever for both arthritis and estrogen-deprivation joint pain.  (That's what the femara does - it deprives your body of estrogen, a hormone that women need for healthy joints and bones.)  It also has shown in clinical trials to be effective at inhibiting cancer, so it actually might increase the effectiveness of  the femara.  This link talks about this anticancer research (the language is a little hard for a layperson to understand, but your dr should certainly understand it): http://search.lef.org/cgi-src-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&pa There are many internet sites that document proven anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin, and  that makes it a good choice for joint pain. Another good anti-inflammatory herb being used for joint pain is boswellia.  Again, you can find plenty of sources on the internet that document how it works and how to take it safely. Unfortunately curcumin and boswellia aren't cheap, and they won't be covered by your insurance drug plan, but they will be well worth the expense if they help you live a more normal and pain free life. A little known effect of garlic is that it both helps to relieve joint pain and has properties that make it a good anti-cancer herb.  Added benefits are that it is cheap, and isn't reported to have nasty side effects, other than the smell and the gas it can cause.  Odorless garlic tablets or capsules are available at many herb shops and pharmacies - that takes care of the garlic odor coming thru the skin, and it causes less gas.  Gelcaps containing garlic oil can be kept in the freezer.  Just take the  gelcap while it's still frozen.  it won't totally thaw until it gets way down into the bowel - preventing it from mixing with stomach acids to form gas.  this  eliminates a problem with burping, etc.  And the oil is absorbed perfectly well throught the bowel, so you still get all the benefits. Curcumin and boswellia should be taken according to the label directions. garlic supplements can be taken in amounts as tolerated. Some people take only about 500mg a day, but I get little gelcaps that contain 1500 mg and take one of them a day. Always check with your doctor before starting a nutritional supplement. Take care, and my best wishes that you be well! Tre  ",

      "Content": "Spontaneous remission or even disappearance of cancer DOES happen, regardless of what drs would have us believe.  While we all wish it would happen a LOT more frequently, and TO US, we can still rejoice that your cancer is gone. It sounds to me like the PremPro was feeding the cancer.  When that ready source of estrogen disappeared, it probably weakened the cancer spots enough that your own immune system/cancer-fighting components was then able to wipe it out. I would be careful about eating foods/taking supplements that have very powerful phytoestrogens  e.g. soy.  If you want to use flax seed or oil for it's health benefits, might be wise to really limit your intake - maybe no more than 1 - 2 tsp ground flax seed or 2 or 3 tsp flax oil a day, if even that much. (Still a lot of controversy among researchers as to whether soy and flax act as estrogen blockers or estrogen replacers. As long as there is no concensus and questionable one way or another, I think might just be safer to avoid them all together.) Any of the herbal and food remedies for menopause should be approached with caution.  Things like red clover flowers contain a lot of phytoestrogens, as do black cohosh and evening primrose.  Yams and sweet potatoes are also very replete with phytoestrogens.  The less supply you give your body, perhaps the less likely you will have a cancer situation arise again.   You can do a web search for foods containing strong and weak estrogens - I would emphasize the weak estrogens in diet more than the strong estrogens, as it does seem that weak phytoestrogens will act as estrogen-receptor blockers while strong  phytoestrogens will act as hormone replacement therapy. Congrats on the good news!!!  I wish you many years of happy wellness!! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Carolyn, Hope you are doing well. Some answers for your questions: 1.  Why are sprouts not allowed?  Does this include broccoli sprouts? Brussels sprouts are actually an excellent choice for a cancer-fighting diet.  Very high in anti-oxidants, B vitamins and vitamin C,  plus sulforaphane, which is another phytochemical that helps inhibit cancer cell processes. The sprouts that one should avoid are salad sprouts - like alfalfa and bean sprouts.  This type sprouts are very easily contaminated with bacteria and fungi - not worth the risk of introducing infection into and already compromised immune system.  (I've seen some opinions that if a person is raising their own sprouts, knows the conditions under which they are grown and can guarantee that they are absolutely fresh, then it's ok to eat them, but just too many reports of inadvertant contamination even among the most careful of growers - just doesn't seem worth the risk to me when equal nutritional value can be gotten from safer foods.) 2.   My dr. (at one of the top 100 hospitals in the US) told me NOT to use any soy products, no grapefruit, NO green tea, NO flax - because the tumors were estrogen/progesterone positive. There's a lot of varying opinions about soy, but I personally agree with not using soy at all.  There are several different kinds of isoflavones in soy that have been researched in cancer treatment - genistein, and something else (I can't think of the other one right off the top of my head.) There's still a big controversy between these researchers as to which of these compounds might be safe in treating estrogen/progesterone positive cancers, and which might be harmful - so far as I'm concerned, I steer clear of soy. (With the exception of the very small amount of soy sauce I might get when I eat at my favorite chinese restaurant, at most several times a month!) As for grapefruit - that is also on my no-no list  for treatment of any kind of cancer.  Citrus fruits are great for fighting cancer, but grapefruit is best left alone. The reasoning goes a lot deeper than phytoestrogens - I have those notes somewhere among 6 - 8 months worth of other stuff!! As for flax and green tea, I think that's something that people really have to make their own choices about.  I definitely agree that flax seed oil in the diet is NOT a good choice for hormone positive cancers - the phytoestrogens in the oil are just WAY too concentrated to make it worth the risk of taking it, at least for me.  However, I've read some pretty convincing debate that the much lesser concentration of phytoestrogens in very small amounts of ground flax seed ( a tsp or two a day at most)  is more likely to act as an estrogen blocker rather than estrogen replacement, thus actually working to deprive cancer cells of estrogen, while also utilizing the cancer-killing properties of the lignans in the flax seed.  (I hope that has made sense to you - I got interrupted while I was typing this, kind of lost my train of thought for a few minutes!!) The same thing may be true of green tea - indeed of black tea, also. Tea does contain some phytoestrogens - the question is do the benefits of the antioxidants, OPC's and other cancer-fighting phytochemicals they contain outweight the risks of the phytoestrogens they contain?  When I've looked at charts detailing foods and phytoestrogens, how much they contain - whether they are strong or weak phytoestrogens, I didn't consider tea to be that high up on the list, so I chose to use tea quite a lot in my regimen. Now for me there are other health benefits that I considered - tea is very detoxifying, and it offers a lot of benefits for arthritis and fibromyalgia and asthma  - so I considered the known benefits for me to outweigh the potential risk. And that's a choice that everybody has basically got to make for themselves, as concerns many foods, supplement and herb choices. (One might note that MANY foods, including most of the cruciferous vegetables- broccoli, asparagus, etc, actually contain quite a bit of phytoestrogens and other phytosterols. It's believed that those kinds of foods act as estrogen blockers because they contain weak phytoestrogens, but that may also depend upon what phase of reproductive timing a woman is in - premenopausal womens' bodies handle exogenous estrogen one way, whereas postmenopausal womens' bodies seem to handle it a different way. Butthe fact is that we can't cut out EVERYTHING in our diet/self-care that might provide estrogen to our bodies.   I think what we can do is try to determine for ourselves which foods, etc, contain the highest amounts of phytoestrogen, and make our own choices from there, having faith that in the broader range of considerations we are doing the right thing.  And we can also do some things like take an aspirin a day - 325 mg, any generic or name brand will do - to inhibit prostaglandin production that helps our bodies make estrogen. Take grape seed extract - it inhibits aromatase production. Things like that...) 3.  I typed Lemon Volcano Drink into the search bar.  It gave me 3 options for that, and none of them had the recipe.  Can you give it to me? Gladly, and bon appetit!  LEMON VOLCANO DRINK: 1 qt unsweetened lemonade (use one lemon and pure fresh water, or organic unpasteurized frozen lemonade concentrate and pure fresh water); 1 - 2 TBSP 100% pure maple syrup; a large pinch organic cayenne pepper (more if you can stand it!); shake vigorously! - drink daily as a tonic for cancer prevention; adjunct cancer treatment; to boost the immune, circulatory and nervous systems; detoxification; and to clean out your sinuses!

This acts as a pump to get lymph fluids moving in places where there are inadequate lymph nodes to do so. http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm While I recommend continuing self-massage (doing it in the shower  under warm water helps!), I think you would get great benefit from myofascial release. You can have this done by a physical therapist, neuromuscular therapist, or massage therapist.  IF you find a compassionate therapist, they may be able to teach you to do the myofascial release yourself at home - although I do not know that you will be able to reach all the points yourself to get good results.   Nutrition also plays an important role in management of lymphedema. Many women's immune systems have been nutritionally compromised, leading to breast cancer in the first place.  Not a lot of conventional practitioners really work at helping women have better immune health after treatment for breast cancer.  If they did, women might not be having the problems post surgery and treatment that they do. Starting with a simple combination of minerals and vitamins can help.  At the very least, these 6 elements are necessary to get the immune system back on track - and taking them WILL help your body start to mobilize collected lymph fluids: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  You can find many wonderful articles on lymphedema and organizations that deal with it - do a web search through www.cancerlynx.com Sincerely, Tre  ",

My husband and I could not believe the news, and I think the surgeon himself was a little surprised.  I am due for another surgery next week and hopefully radiation after that.  Has anyone out there had more than two lumpectomys????    I am 67 years old and still in shock.  Thanks for any info,  Monika        Hi Monika, Yes, I went through this, as have many other women.  It is not uncommon to have cancer cells in the tissue surrounding a lump.  In fact the drs expect this and generally will take a wide margin of tissue from around the lump when they remove the lump. Unfortunately, sometimes the cells have spread farther than the dr expected when he/she did the lumpectomy, and then they have to go back and remove these additional cells. This technically is not considered 2 lumpectomies, but rather a lumpectomy (medical term is \"partial mastectomy\") and then \"revision of partial mastectomy.\" This does not have anything to do with how fast-growing the cancer is.  Those loose cells in the tissue surrounding the lump had probably already been there for quite some time, but not long enough to have gotten into the lymph nodes (which is GOOD - makes your prognosis better, even with having to do the revision to remove cells.) Probably the most difficult part for you, other than having to have another surgery,  will be that your drs will want to put off chemo/radiation for a while, to give you a chance to heal from the 2nd surgery. And that is really important - not only will you have a larger wound to heal, but you will have more anesthesia from which to recover. (Even though the obvious effects of anesthesia wear off quickly, it can take our bodies months to totally metabolize the drugs out of our systems - the more anesthesia we have, the longer that takes.)  Be sure to drink plenty of pure fresh water and eat lots of high antioxidant foods to help your body detoxify these chemicals.  Drinking green tea helps also. (If you have a port and are going to be on a blood-thinner, check with the doc before drinking a lot of tea, as teas prolong clotting times.) I had a hysterectomy for endometrial cancer in Mar 02. In late April, I discovered a very large lump in my breast. I had lumpectomy (partial mastectomy) in May 02.  The margins of tissue removed in that surgery showed cancer cells, and in June 02 I had revision of the partial mastectomy and removal of about half of my lymph nodes. I was not able to start chemo until July 02, and started radiation Nov 02.  I developed lymph edema and stopped the radiation mid-way thru Dec. Was a very long year for me.  Because I had had so much anesthesia plus chemo and radiation, I did not start feeling like I had any energy until Mar or April 03.  I did not supplement with vitamins, etc, and I did not push myself. for detoxification. In retrospect I think I would have done much better had I researched complementary and alternative therapies/supplementations and been much more pro-active in my recovery. I feel I might have been better able to prevent metastasis diagnosed 5 years later if I had gotten into and maintained an herbal regimen in 2002/2003, instead of waiting until the cancer had come back. If you are interested in learning about natural things you can start doing to aid in treatment and recovery, you are welcome to look at my blog.  My cancer story is there, plus my herbal/supplemental regimen  that has put my metastasis into remission. (Not a prescription for any other person, but I have tried to emphasize those things that might well help others fight their cancer.)

      "Content": "Glad you got thru your surgery ok.  Write down any question as it pops into your mind - those are the questions you should be asking. Things you need to know: what stage and grade is the cancer?  Did they find it in lymph nodes?  How many lymph nodes if any did they remove?  Was there any muscle removed, or just breast tissue?  How long do you need to heal before further therapy?  What does the dr recommend in the way of exercises and nutrition for healing?  How fast should you be increasing your activity?  Does he expect any problems with lymphedema, and what should you be doing now to prevent it? Don't worry too much about addiction to the pain meds - you shouldn't need to be on them that long.  Especially if you get yourself up and about and moving around, and gently but persistently do your exercises to get your chest and shoulder back into normal functional shape. Gently using those muscles and keeping those tissues moving is really important toward preventing scarring that can bind up movement and cause a lot of restrictive pain later. Very gentle self-massage can also help with circulation and prevent scarring and lymphedema - but you need to know how long the dr wants you to wait before doing anything like that. Also, make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, and eating some good roughage.  It's ok to take the pain meds if you need them, but constipation from pain pills (especially in light of just having had anesthesia) can be a problem.   Make yourself start walking outside every day, work up to at least 20 minutes a day - it's great for the bowels, the sunshine will help you produce vitamin D3 which will help with energy levels as well as fighting off stray cancer cells.  The endorphins from walking will help decrease pain and will contribute to a general sense of well-being.  Plus you need the oxygenation to help metabolize away the anesthesia. (Plenty of water is important for detoxification of anesthesia also.) Take care, and if you don't mind, let us know what you find out. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "2 things you can do that would be a great help: 1. Help her with physical therapy exercises to regain use of that arm and those chest muscles.  Many women get discouraged because at first those exercises are hard and tedious.  But they are very important.  She should have been given pictures of exercises to do - encourage her to do them, and sit or stand and do them with her (e.g. if she is to be walking her hand up the wall - stand beside her and walk your hand up the wall, too. make it a very gentle competition - only she is competing against herself - not against you.  Put a mark on the wall at the highest point she can reach each day - so she can physically see her progress.) A very good exercise that she may not have been given, is to have someone face her and put their hands out against hers.  Very gently push her hands forward  one at a time, and then  both together.  Have her resist your pushing. This needs to be done VERY gently at first, then strength of your pushing can increase as she tolerates it.  Also, the two of you can put your hands together and raise both arms to the ceiling, pushing gently against each other as you go.  Let her decide when to stop, but encourage her to go as high as she can each time without too much pain.) 2.  Help her have things to laugh and chuckle about.  keeping a sense of humor and laughing (good belly laughs, little chuckles, even tiny little giggles or smiles - ALL will help.)  Laughter releases body chemicals that are wonderful for healing, fighting off infection, and that cancer just plain doesn't like!  Plus laughter helps ease internal tensions and promotes the positive attitudes that are so necessary to beat this disease. It also releases endorphins that will minimize pain. Oh - I would add one other thing - DON'T be afraid to take her good nutritious food - especially stuff that can be refrigerated and heated up later.  Cooking is a major chore after a mastectomy.  As are cleaning house, doing dishes and laundry.  Help with those things if she will let you. Buy her some paper plates and good sturdy paper bowls, some plastic glasses and some plastic silverware, so  she doesn't have to do dishes when no one's there to help. I wish you and her the best! Take good care of yourself, too! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Rose, I'm sorry to hear that the cancer had gotten into the peritoneal cavity.  I'm sure you've had much frustration trying to get diagnosed and treated. You can try using natural estrogen blockers and aromatase inhibitors - foods, herbs/botanicals, and over-the-counter supplements to treat your cancer.  They do the same things as the Tamoxifen and Arimidex, but are much gentler on the body, and have the benefit of providing other cancer-fighting components as well (antioxidants, proanthocyanidins, etc.)  I was able to lower my estradiol level from above 30 to below 5 with such a regimen, a combination of things such as grape seed extract, green tea, an aspirin a day, garlic, etc. You are welcome to take a look at what I did - I have posted my regimen on my blog.  The article is not intended as a prescription for others - everyone's body chemistry is different, and what works very well for one person may not be as effective for another.  But I am happy to provide information on the kinds of things women can use to block and inhibit estrogen from feeding cancer while providing nutrients that will work to attack and destroy cancer. I've also posted my story on my blog - why I took this route instead of aromasin, etc - if you want to take a look at that also my story http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor my regimen http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers There are six supplements that a lot of leading advocates of natural therapy recommend.  All six in combination are a powerful cancer-fighting too.  For someone who might choose to take only one or two of these, selenium is the most important: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  Drinking plenty of pure, fresh water is also of vital importance.  We need really good hydration to carry cancer-fighting compounds to the cells, and we need that same hydration to carry toxins and by-products of cancer cell death away.  Green tea is also an excellent detoxifier, as is bentonite clay. Essiac tea is also an excellent detox and anti-cancer choice.  Not as simple as using green tea.  You won't find it in my regimen, but if you do a search on CC for essiac tea, and look at the messages Shemay has posted, you will find the recipe and some great web links for essiac tea.

Lots of women have shadows show up on mammogram and ultrasound that are not cancer. The fact that they sent her for an MRI rather than an immediate biopsy indicates they are still unsure what this shadow represents, which overall is a good thing.  It very well could  be something benign. Some women have fatty tumors or other conditions in their breasts that are not cancer and may or may not cause concern.  Sometimes there can be calcifications in the breast that may mimic shadows on mammogram. Sometimes it is just dense breast tissue that isn't well visualized by mammogram or ultrasound - positioning can affect the pictures from year to year, as could certain medical conditions.   Some women have suspicious spots in their breasts that the doctors will watch for another 6 months or year or longer - if they show big changes, the docs recommend biopsy, whereas if they don't change, they may just be considered a benign abnormality.  sometimes these shadows are determined to represent \"fibrocystic breast disease,\"  (the theory/research/treatment of this is finally changing for the better!!!) And yes, sometimes women do have cancer diagnosed through MRI. But for right now, from what you are saying, that very well might  not be the case for your mom.  waiting for test results is hard, so step back, take a deep breath, and focus on what is rather than what could be.  Personally I think Today always has enough troubles of its own without borrowing from tomorrow.

Also, especially with mets to the bone, care needs to be taken as to how often she is exposed to the scans.  While CT, PET, MRI do not produce the same amounts of radiation, they still should be minimized for the safety of the patient. In the meantime, there are other tests that can be done to determine the effectiveness of treatment.  If the doctor drew cancer markers (bloodwork that indicates the presence of cancer) on your mother before treatment, he/she could draw them again - a decrease in the value of the markers would indicate effective treatment, although it will not give as much information as a scan. Tell your mom's dr your concerns, ask how soon he will do the next scan, and ask if there are other things that he can do in the meantime to help alleviate your concerns. Sincerely, Tre",

I did a web search and was able to find lots of pictures of corset bras, and sellers online.  I know some of the lingerie stores still sell them - I'm not sure if you can find them at places like JC Penneys or Kaufmans, etc. Good luck!

I have a Midwife who handles my OB-GYN care.  Lost trust in the doctors where I live and it took my way too long regain trust in the medical field.  Per her request due to a .25 cm lump and some not so good family history I have been through mammogram (both regular and bi-lateral) and ultra sound.  Both showed to be normal, also note I am only 43 years old and have never had children and only weigh in now 102 lbs.  I have lost 6 lbs over the last 2 1/2 months and it wasn't on purpose. She, my doc wanted a biopsy done sends me to a Dr to find out what this mass is.  Dr views my data and checks me and says I want you to come back in 4 months any changes you call me asap.  There is abnormal tissue per him and I'm like okay I guess I wait. Help explain why I am waiting, I am a bundle of nerves, my dentist and hygenist had a stern talking with me about every reason not to wait.  I made an appt with my midwife so we can talk about this.  I was not expecting to walk out of the surgens office with out the biospy being done. Is this normal?  My Aunt was just diagnosed 3 months ago with Ductal Carsamona In Situ stage 0 because of imaging tech.  We live in different cities. Hi Michele. More and more I am hearing women say that their drs want to wait a few months, and then take another look.  Lots of these women aren't happy with that, as neither was I a little less than a year ago when my doc said that to me.  So, you are not alone in being nervous about this.  I want to address several things.  Sounds like you are concerned that this is cancer perhaps because you are losing weight?  I would not think that a lump as small as 0.25cm, even if it is cancer, would be enough to cause 6 pounds weight loss in 2 1/2 months. Might be something else going on there.  Would you be comfortable going to a different type of doc, like and osteopath, or naturopath - if you have availability where you live? They might be able to help you investigate the weight loss seperate of this breast problem.  OK, about the lump.  Yes, there are things other than cancer that this could be.  Sometimes women have lumps that are cyst like in nature - called fibrocystic condition. Most of the time they are benign, but there have been cases where they became cancerous.  Perhaps the surgeon feels that is the case with you - that this is perhaps just fibrocystic but is not sure, and therefore wants to see you again to see if there are changes. I would think, however, that if that were the case, he would have told you that, other than saying this is \"abnormal tissue.\" So, since you know there is a lump, and since the doc says it's abnormal tissue, maybe you should consider getting another opinion.  I certainly would ask the midwife about that, if there is someone else to whom she could give you a referral. If you live anywhere near a teaching hospital/university hospital, you might consider going there, or check around and find out who is the best breast cancer doc in the area, and go to them.  (Yes, I know you are shy of the profession right now, but not ALL physicians are bad guys, and you need an answer about this, if at least for your own peace of mind.) The other thing you might ask about is the possibility of a CT scan or PET scan. Ultrasound imaging can be pretty good, but it's like any other diagnostic tool - can miss things.  The other thing you could do is start now on a preventative, anti-cancer diet and perhaps some supplements. That way if the determination IS to wait, you can be doing something proactive in the meantime, and possibly gain some of your weight back.  Your midwife might well be able to get you started on that track, and there are plenty of resources on the internet. (Most of the links I could give you are for people already diagnosed with cancer. I would have to do some looking to find appropriate resources for prevention - please send me a private reply if you would want some help with diet and supplements.)  You could also take a look at the prevention message board, and at some of the articles on Cancer Compasses homepage.  Even do a search on the site - I know I've seen good articles and messages on it, I just don't have the links to give you right now.  Whatever you do, when your nerves start getting cranked up, if you're getting overwhelmed, just step back from it, take some slow deep breaths, and refocus on whatever your task is at hand.  This is a small lump.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't find out what it is, but it DOES mean that the sky is not going to fall in if it takes you some time to get this issue resolved. Prevention is the absolute best cure, so getting started on a more cancer-preventive pro-active diet, etc, will be a very positive step. If we can't prevent cancer, then early detection is the very next best cure - as I'm sure you've heard over and over, the earlier cancer is found, the easier it is to treat.  That is true - but remember, this is a quite small lump - not going to be a disaster if it takes a few weeks or even a month to get a definitive answer. Use the time wisely to learn about foods and exercise and detoxification - stuff that keeps the body healthy and fights off cancer cells. And regardless of what happens, start drinking plenty of pure fresh water. Is one of the very healthiest things you can do for yourself.  I hope this helps, and I wish you the very best, including speedy answers to your situation. Sincerely, Tre  ",

I just looked at the label and it said high fructose level. Now I am scared.  Also, should people who have gone through cancer stay away from sugar altogther?  No cake or ice cream,  even once in a while?  Lastly, my nutritionist said to stay away from soybeans and flaxseed.  On this site I am reading that it is GOOD. Is there an expert out there that can advise me on these questions?    Yes, these ARE confusing issues. I've done a LOT of research on natural treatment for cancer, so I think I can answer a few of your questions.  Most simple sugars are NOT a good choice for cancer.  Cancer cells require a LOT of energy, and they like to get it from sugar. Glucose, sucrose, lactose, dextrose - not good choices.  However, fructose is actually a GOOD sugar choice, in that fructose inhibits glycolysis (fermentation of sugar), which is the means by which cancer cells  get their energy. Doesn't mean you can go overboard on fructose, but raw fruits and veggies that contain fructose are ok, as is small amounts of crystallized fructose.  As for fruit juice - don't add any sugar.  Now, about the green tea.  Buy either green tea bags, or loose leaf green tea, and brew your own. Use the purest water you can get - either steam-distilled or filtered thru reverse osmosis is best.  Then if you need a sweetener, either use small amounts of crystallized fructose or 100% pure organic honey. (100% pure maple syrup is also OK as a sweetener , but I don't think it would taste very good with green tea.) Don't depend on the sweeteners in store-bought green tea - if it says high fructose level, chances are that it has been made with high fructose corn syrup, which is an absolute no-no.  (One among many reasons why soda pop is also a no-no.) (Fructose, and high fructose corn syrup are NOT the same thing. If you're going to buy a sweetener, get 100% pure organic crystallized fructose - available at health food stores and online.  AVOID high fructose corn syrup.) As for deserts, unless you know that they are made of just the natural fruit, and only fructose as sweetener, stay away from them. A small bit of cake or ice cream for a special occaision is ok - everybody needs to celebrate, and enjoy a holiday etc, but this really needs to be limited to a small portion only on that special day.  STEVIA is an herb that is an excellent sweetener, and offers no risk as concerns cancer.  just be careful - it is much more sweet than sugar - a tiny little bit goes a very long way. About soybean and flaxseed: both contain phytochemicals called phytoestrogen. (plant estrogen)  For those who have an estrogen receptor positive (or progestin receptor positive) cancer, there is some concern that they can feed the cancer instead of fighting it.  Many researchers are coming to the conclusion that natural foods and herbs that contain very strong phytoestrogens will feed cancer, while those containing weak phytoestrogens will act as estrogen blockers (the same mechanism as tamoxifen.)  Some researchers say that soy inhibits breast cancer. some say that it promotes breast cancer, and some say that it has no effect either way. So the jury's still out on this.  Soy contains genistein and isoflavones; there are attempts to differentiate between the effect of genistein and that of isoflavones - those results just aren't in yet, either.  So, as to whether soy is beneficial or harmful - you're probably going to continue to hear all kinds of different things, because there just isn't overall conclusive evidence that the medical and natural communities are both willing to accept. Personally, I take a practical approach to the question of soy.  For years, soy - especially soy milk, tofu, soybeans - have been recommended as a natural hormone replacement treatment for menopause, and many thousands of women have had success in relieving hot flashes, etc, caused by menopause.  If soy it this effective as a hormone replacer - I question the advisability of depending on it as a hormone blocker, so I recommend that women avoid soy and choose less questionable naturals for this purpose.  Flaxseed is a little different.  Yes, it contains phytoestrogens, too, and it very definitely is a cancer fighter due to some other phytochemicals it contains. Very small amounts of ground flaxseed may possibly act as estrogen blockers. Howeverm, large amounts of flaxseed or concentrated flax oil can actually serve as hormone replacers (a friend of mine who is several years post-menopausal and who is very slender and muscular - doesn't have much fat to produce estrogen - started taking flax oil in yogurt to alleviate some of the sypmptoms of low estrogen levels. This was so successful that she actually started having periods again - when she stopped the flax oil - the periods went away.)  SO - a tsp or less of ground flaxseed/day might be ok, but I wouldn't recommend even that much flaxoil per day, as the phytoestrogens in it are much more concentrated.  And if you do use flax to fight cancer, the lignins in the hulls of the seed are one of the primary cancer fighters, so using ground flax seed is a better choice in  that respect, also. Many women with breast cancer use the Budwig diet - flax oil and cottage cheese - and say it has helped fight the breast cancer. Johanna Budwig theorized that when flaxoil binds to cottage cheese it actually forms a new compound with new properties that you don't get from either alone. She may very well have been right - but personally, I am not willing to take the chance that the strong phytoestrogens in the flax oil are going to feed rather than fight my cancer, so I use only 1/4 tsp ground flax seed in 1/4 - 1/2 cup cottage cheese every day, and otherwise avoid flax in any form for ingestion.) (I do, however, use very tiny amounts of flax oil mixed with vaseline to locally treat vaginal dryness/atrophy caused by the estrogen depletion after hysterectomy and removal of ovaries combined with the anti-estrogen natural therapy I use to keep cancer in remission. Just that tiny amount replenishes those tissues very well - proof enough for me that flax oil contains powerful enough phytoestrogens to act as a hormone replacer rather than blocker.) If your nutritionist is advising you avoid flax and soy, I would say to follow her recommendations. There are plenty of other things you can do naturally to fight or prevent cancer.  Take a look at my blog for some examples: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers FOr more information on fructose and other natural cancer fighters, take a look at this page from the AP John Cancer Institute - scroll down to the Integrative Therapy section, phase 2 and 3.  I am not recommending the total diet, but rather the specific foods that are explained as cancer fighters. http://www.apjohncancerinstitute.org/cancer/breast-c.htm Sincerely, Tre    ",

      "Content": "Hi Jacqueline, You can take some extra-strength tylenol about 30 minutes before the biopsy - that will help.  You might also ask if the Dr will give you a prescription for several valium - you could take a dose the night before, and then one at the same time as the tylenol right before the biopsy. Also, ask if they will be using local anesthesia - that will help too. Practice imaging something pleasant in your mind, such as a warm and peaceful place (like a tropical beach with soothing waves splashing on shore) - then when you have your biopsy, send your mind to that place rather than focusing on what they are doing to your body.

      "Content": "Hi KellyAnn, I recommend that you support your immune system during treatment with as nutrient rich a diet as you can,  plus some very specific supplements.  Eat as much fresh raw fruits and vegetables as possible (organic, if you can get it - if not, wash them thoroughly with  soap and warm water, and rinse, rinse, rinse.)  You need to be very careful about sugar intake - do not add cane sugar to anything.  It's ok to use crystallized fructose (a cancer fighter, and you can get it at health food stores,) a little bit of pure honey or pure maple syrup, or stevia  (get powdered stevia, NOT stevia extract as it has a lot of alcohol in it.) A lot of people say you can't eat fruit because of the sugar - but actually the fructose in the fruit really does work to fight cancer by inhibiting fermentation,which is how cancer cells get their energy.  Apples are a good cancer fighter - but limit to one a day.  Bananas are a no-no - they are very high in sugar that feeds cancer. (There are lots of other fruits and veggies that are potassium rich - so bananas aren't needed for that.) Any kind of citrus fruit except grapefruit is ok.  Any kind of berry is a good choice - they have many phytochemicals that fight cancer. I recommend people with breast cancer stay away from pomegranate, but cranberries are a really good choice. Grapes - red, black or purple grapes - with the seeds if you can get them, are an excellent cancer fighter.   Cruciferous veggies are key in diet - spinach, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, brussel sprouts, asparagus, beets, cabbage. Limit carrots - they have a very high sugar content that is easily utilized by cancer. (The exception is if you go on a carrot diet - in which case you use the carrot sugar to carry phytochemicals to the cancer cells - but for regular diet choices, limit the carrots.)  Legumes and whole grains will provide not only roughage but also energy and many cancer-fighting phytochemicals.  Corn has a bad rep among a lot of advocates of alternatives, but even corn can be added to the diet for energy and to help keep the bowel regular if constipation becomes a problem during chemo.  Olives and olive oil provide essential fatty acids, plus a lot of OPC's that fight cancer. Eat vinegary foods - the acetic acid in the vinegar fights cancer.  Add a dribble of apple cider vinegar over vegetables once a day, or swallow a tsp of apple cider vinegar in 4 - 5 ounces of warm water, or take an apple cider vinegar supplement.  Flax seed is also an excellent source of essential fatty acids and cancer-fighting phytochemicals.  A lot of people use flax seed oil - but with breast cancer you've got to be careful how much you get, so I recommend 1 - 2 tsp ground brown flax seed a day, maximum - you can mix it in with 1/2 - 3/4 cup cottage cheese or in yogurt, or apple sauce (that would be your apple for the day.)  I add black currants or raisins and roasted pumpkin seeds, plus salt and pepper to taste - makes a good breakfast when combined with a handful of red or black or purple grapes (with the seeds if you can get them) and a big cup of green and/or black tea.  You really need to emphasize B vitamins, both for the lyme disease and the FMS.  I recommend taking a B complex supplement, in addition to trying to eat as vitamin B rich foods as possible. Try to get a supplement with the most variety of the B's and as high a dose as you can.  This is a good example - you can look at this product label for comparison:  http://www.swansonvitamins.com/SWC036/ItemDetail?n=429496718 THere are also 5 minerals that many of the leading experts on alternative treatment for cancer recommend that EVERYONE take, whether they are fighting active cancer or trying to prevent recurrence: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  You probably would benefit from a good vitamin C supplement, also. That, plus vitamins A and E. Get these supplements seperately - you need above and beyond what you will get in a multiple vitamin preparation. Check with your oncologist - ask if there are specific foods you shouldn't be eating, or supplements you shouldn't be taking, if they will interfere with the chemo.  Also, ask about how much tea it's ok for you to drink - I'm assuming you will be on a blood thinner for your port - drinking large quantities of tea can prolong bleeding time.  Some docs think it's a potential problem, some docs say drink as much as you want.  I would recommend that if you can find a practicing naturopath in your area, go for a consult - get some professional advise specific to YOUR needs as to diet, herbs, and supplementation.  Get online and read about using nutrition to fight cancer. (Don't just get educated about how bad CANCER is - also get educated about how GOOD food and mother nature is.) You are also welcome to take a look at my blog for examples of things you can do to supplement the chemo and fight the cancer naturally:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers -anti-cancer-and-health.html  Regardless of what you do, you will need to try to drink plenty of pure fresh water, every day ( a minimum of 64 ounces.)  Detoxification of chemo is absolutely essential to keeping yourself as healthy as possible, and you can't do that without good hydration.  Steam distilled or reverse osmosis filtered water are best, as they eliminate micro-toxins that can be found in even the priciest of bottled waters.  I got one of these distillers - my partner and I use it for all our drinking and cooking water:  http://www.a1-water-distiller.com/ Other foods that are especially good in dealing with both FMS and cancer are garlic and onions. Use as much of them as you can tolerate - either fresh or powdered or minced or whatever form you want.  Other spices that will help are ginger, turmeric, cumin and red pepper (cayenne pepper.)  A lot of people getting chemo can't tolerate spicy food - that may be a problem for you. Some people find that while they can't stand spices, they can eat bitter or sour.  Purple grape juice, dill pickle juice, and very small amounts of pickled ginger root can be  life-savers for the person who has little appetite due to chemo. These are excellent web sites for ideas on diet and supplementation to serve as adjuncts to chemo:  http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org http://alkalizeforhealth.net http://alternativecancer.us I wish you the best.  Hang in there - it seems really scary right now, but you will get through it the same as everyone else, one day at a time, or even when you have to, one moment at at time.  If you get overwhelmed, make yourself take a step back, take some long slow deep breaths, and re-focus on whatever it is you need to be doing at that moment, right then. We can only ever definitely affect the moment we are in right now - so concentrate on doing that, and in that way the future will take care of itself. Please let us know how you are doing from time to time.  Lots of good people here who care about your well-being. Sincerely, Tre",

Things are tough - particularly explaining things to the kids - but we are handling it as best we can. I have a question - the biopsy from surgery showed a grade III cancer on the left and a grade I on the right. The CT scan and the lymph results came back all clear (first bit of good news Lucy has had since this began). Does the fact that the cancer occured in both breasts mean that it is in fact metastatic, despite the CT and lymph results, or is the occurunce of cancer in both breasts considered a 'localised' event? The oncologist did try to explain this but it sometimes hard to take it all in at the time. Hi Partner, Yes, understanding all this medical talk can be very difficult, especially when you're first hearing it all. I think that perhaps you are not understanding the difference between stage of cancer and grade of cancer - many people use those terms interchangeably, but they are not at all the same thing.  Stage of cancer indicates location and involvement of tissues. Metastasis is indicated by stage rather than grade. With the CT and lymph results coming back clear, that means there is no metastasis. I am guessing that these 2 tumors are both classified as Stage I, but you should ask the dr to make sure. This is a good reference article on staging: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/staging.jsp Grade of cancer means how aggressive the cancer is (how fast it grows, and how likely it is to invade other tissues.) The lower the grade number, the less aggressive and invasive it is.   If one was a spread of the other, they would both share the same characteristics and therefore both be the same grade. The fact that the cancer on the left is Grade III and the cancer on the right is Grade I indicates that this is 2 seperate cancers that have occurred at the same time.  (Sounds kind of hard to believe, but this actually does happen to women more than once every blue moon.) Unfortunately, I was not able to find a really good article that talks about grade in laymen's terms, but you might take a look at this reference: http://www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Cancertype/Breast/Causesdiagn So if I am understanding the information you gave correctly, then yes, your wife's cancer would be classified as localised. But it is not just one incident of localised cancer - it is  2 incidents of localised cancer, because it is indeed 2 different occurences of cancer. When you talk to the dr again, he/she may well tell you they are not only 2 different instances of cancer, but that they are two different types of breast cancer. Having 2 different types of cancer at the same time could complicate things somewhat.  One may require one type of chemo, while the other requires a different type of chemo.  Hopefully that will NOT be the case, and that both can be treated well with the same drugs - will make it a little easier for your wife.  As for your kids, don't try to get too technical with them.  Lots of times they require answers that are much simpler than we  imagine, and lots of times these wonderful little people are capable of understanding much more than we expect!  And your daughters are at just the age when it's fun to learn how to cook and do things like mommy (as long as they are still given plenty of time to play), so things like encouraging them to all  chip in and help you get supper put on the table because mommy's medicine makes her really tired could very well turn out to be a great adventure for them!  I hope my explanation helps - at least maybe it will give you more questions to ask the dr!  I recommend your wife take a little notebook and a pen with her to treatments and appts, so she can write stuff down to keep track - chemo can sometimes be very immediately tiring. Always good to have notes for reference later! Wishing you, Lucy and the girls the best, Tre  ",

And it's worse when it's stuff you don't know anything about.  I worked as an RN for many years so was quite familiar with the terminology, but I still found I had a LOT of questions and things I didn't understand after my dr's visits.  I learned to take a small notebook and pen with me anywhere I went.  I would write down my questions and concerns beforehand, and would make sure I had covered every one of them , and gotten satisfactory answers before I left whomever I was seeing. (The docs got so they expected that from me, and it worked well.)  I also made sure to write down their answers - the docs got so they automatically printed out reports for me also - that worked very well, meant I didn't have to copy down all the technical stuff, yet I had it available for reference when I got home and had time to sit and absorb information and formulate new questions or a plan of action.  Plus there's the fact that not every dr or medical person does a good job of explaining stuff.  My surgeon for my breast cancer is one of the best in the nation - he's a brilliant man and truly expert at what he does, but his bedside manner leaves a little to be desired.  I really had to stop him and tell him that even tho I had been a nurse, I still wasn't understanding what he was saying, and I needed him to talk to me in everyday language. I think he was a little perturbed at that, but once he realized that I really wanted to know and that I intended to be a very active participant in my own care, he came around and communication got much better.  And sometimes that's what ya gotta do, say \"hey look Doc, I don't understand what you're saying, but I want to understand it, so help me out.\" And then persist until whomever starts giving you the answers you need. Please feel free to send me a private message if you think I could be of further assistance as you and your wife and family move through this process.   And please make sure to take good care of yourself, too.

      "Content": "Hey Noahgail, I hope you've read my response to your other message. Unless the drs think that your cancer is just so invasive and threatening that you have to start chemo immediately, I would imagine that you will have at least a few weeks time to recover from surgery before starting chemo. Many docs want their patients to be about a month post-op before they start chemo, so that incisions and underlying tissue have a chance to heal quite a bit before being put to the onslaught of chemo.  Much less risk of complications that way. Plus it gives a woman time to start to recover from anesthesia, and to start to get her head around an altered body image - those things are all important.  So, if you have a chance to talk to the doc before your surgery Tuesday, I certainly would ask just how soon they are anticipating you will be starting the chemo.  You may have more time to prepare than it seems like right now.  And if the doc says the chemo will be started immediately or within a few days or a week or two after the surgery, I think I'd be asking for just flat out answers about how aggressive and advanced they think this cancer is.  Might not be questions you want to ask, but right now you are your own best advocate - women do themselves a great favor to adopt that approach.  As for waking up from anesthesia and moving on, it is just that.  Everybody reacts a little bit differently to the drugs, but most anesthesiologists these days are giving drugs that have an amnesiac effect, so that people don't remember a lot of what happened when they went back into the OR and when they were in the recovery room.  That's a pretty good thing.  I was given one of those type of drugs when I had surgery on my hand a number of years ago - every surgery since then I've made sure to remind the anesthesiologist to give me that type of drug, and they're happy to oblige. If you have an overnight hospital stay (or several days) - make sure to be getting up and moving around just as soon as you're allowed.  The more you walk, the more you deep breath and cough to get you lungs working again, the better you will be.  Once you get home, you've got to start doing gentle exercises to get your arm and shoulder loosened up and moving and to get those muscles limber and reduce swelling.  The dr or the staff at the hospital should be giving you a pamphlet that shows the type exercises you should do - if not, you can find them online ( do a web search for postoperative mastectomy exercises.)  You might even practice a few of them this weekend - things like walking your fingers up a wall, or holding your hand in front of your breast and very gently pushing forward as if there was slight resistance. And try to find some time to do SOMETHING fun in the next day or two.  Laughter is very important for the next few days and the weeks to come. Gather as much of it as you can! Keeping you in my thoughts, Tre",

Throughout my entire cancer journey, my rib cage has been tender, but more so lately.  Is this possible still a year later?  My bra hurts it, and every once in awhile I will get those throbbing pain under the rib cage but most of the time it just aches. It even looks like it sticks out more on that side. Of course I am terrified of bone mets or even liver mets and will ask my onco when I go next month, but my husband keeps reminding me that this has bothered me the whole time--I just think it is worse now.  Some people have said rib cage pain is common--just wondering if it would continue even a year later?  Ache is not bad enough to take anything...maybe an Ibuprofen or something. Also, it does not seem to hurt as much when i get up. Any advice to help my sanity would be great. By the way, I did not have chemo or radiation, nor do i take any pills. Cancer was a wierd one, with a 6 cm tumor. Surgeon told me she was very aggressive in getting all the tissue out. your help is appreciated!   Molly   Hi Molly, Yes, rib cage pain is common - but it doesn't have to be permanent. It's possible they nicked your rib when they did your mastectomy. That could cause pain for quite a while, but should eventually subside. I think it's more likely that you have a problem with lymphedema in your chest wall and/or scarring.   This is a pretty good picture of a normal breast: http://www.drsusanloveresearchfoundation.org /breast_diagram.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.drsusanloveresearchfoundation.org /breast_diagram. You can see that connective tissue surrounds all of the actual mammary glands and all the connective tissue is surrounded by fat. This area is also rich with lymphatics (not shown.)  When the breast is removed, especially if there is going to be an inplant, the surgeon tries to take out all the tissue affected by the tumor while leaving as much of the connective tissue and fat as possible, because it is these tissues that will help hold the implant in place.  That means that these tissues become much more susceptible to fluid retention and scarring than they were before the surgery. I've got some links and references that I sent to another lady who was also having this type pain.  I think she found some things there that helped her. You might look particularly at the material about bras interfering with circulation and lymph drainage, and at the article about using a rebounder (mini-trampoline) for exercise to promote drainage and break up scarring. A really good way to tell if your bra is contributing to the problem is to try going without it for a week.  (This is what a female oncologist suggested to me when I was having problems with drainage and scarring - I've now been without the bra for 5 1/2 months!)  If the pain goes away, or decreases significantly, you have at least part of your answer. The \"Dr Susan Love Breast Book, 4th ed\"  is excellent.  I got it for $22 - well worth every penny to get the most up-to-date  info from this lady.  Also, I think at least one of these links talks about \"Phantom\" pain - I don't include it to make light of your pain, but rather to contrast with the articles that  illuminate a real cause for pain.  Post mastectomy pain is real, and it is treatable,  but not a whole lot of docs have caught onto the fact that it does exist, it DOES have a cause, and shouldn't be ignored. I hope this helps.  Please feel free to send me a message if you have more questions. Tre \"Dr Susan Love's Breast Book\" by Susan M.

      "Content": "The weight gain is probably not technically a side effect of the drugs, but the treatment may be responsible.  Hormone receptor drugs cause an estrogen-depleted state.  Our bodies need estrogen to survive - not just for reproductive purposes, but for healthy skin, bones, and other processes.  When our endocrine system perceives that there is not enough estrogen, it tries to find a work-around.  One of the ways our bodies make estrogen is through fat cells - the more fat we have, the more estradiol we will produce. Therefore, if your system was trying to produce more estradiol to make up for estrogen loss otherwise, your metabolism may have been slowed and other processes changed so as to cause weight gain. Many women find that they gain a lot of weight after a hysterectomy.  For many years drs have poo-pooed this as just an emotional reaction and dysfunctional coping after surgery.  Thank goodness there are now medical professionals who are beginning to realize and accept that there is a very real physiologic reason for this weight gain, and are attempting to help women cope with estrogen depletion through natural therapies.  15 pounds over 4 months is distressing;  the average over a period of several years seems to be about 50 pounds. So, in one way, your weight gain could be seen as an encouraging thing - if your body is perceiving itself to be in an estrogen depleted state, then the hormone receptor therapy is very effective at depriving any cancer cells in your body of estrogen.  As for reining in the weight gain, the thing that would help most - supplementing with natural phytoestrogens - is the one thing you shouldn't do, because it negates the hormone receptor therapy.  If the weight gain is the major thing that is bothering you, and you are otherwise doing well on treatment, then I recommend you step up some other things to keep your weight where it is now and not gain anymore.  Drink lots and lots of pure, fresh water (steam-distilled or reverse-osmosis-filtered are best.)  This will help regulate your metabolism.  Add exercise to your routine - at least 20 minutes 3 - 4 times a week of an aerobic exercise.  Walking or swimming are fine choices. Use detoxifiers, like green or black tea - they help eliminate toxins in the blood stream that can contribute to a sluggish metabolism. Increase your intake of antioxidants - a supplement called SOD (superoxide dismutase) is an excellent choice for that.  Make sure you are getting plenty of B vitamins, especially vitamin B12. Watch your dietary intake of processed foods.  A diet based on raw, fresh produce (organic when possible) is best.  Animal foods slow down the digestive tract, and contribute to weight gain.  Unless you are already vegetarian or vegan, best to limit to 3 -4 ounces of meat, poultry or fish 3 -4 times a week.  Raw milk is best; if you can't get it or don't like it, try to get milk from grass-fed dairy cows that aren't given any growth hormones.  The same with butter and cheese.  Eggs should be from free range chickens that aren't given hormones or antibiotics.   For sweetener use stevia, crystallized fructose, or small amounts of 100%pure honey or 100% maple syrup.   Make sure to get a good intake of essential fatty acids - they play a very important role in both metabolism, the immune system, the endocrine system, and fighting cancer.  (A handful of roasted pumpkin seeds will give you all the omegas you need for one day, plus lots of good vegetable protein. recipe: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/roasted )  Last, but by no means least, cut out all partially-hydrogenated or fully-hydrogenated fats from your diet. Our bodies cannot digest/metabolise these, but rather than eliminating them, they are stored as fat, because the body has hope that maybe some other day they can be accessed for energy and digested/metabolised then. Just doesn't ever happen - everything we eat in the way of hydrogenized fats follows the old rule: \"once across the lips, always on the hips.\"  The best oils to use are cold-pressed or expeller pressed organic olive oil, or expeller pressed 100% pure coconut oil from fresh coconuts as opposed to dried chopra.  Both olive oil and coconut oil promote metabolism while providing wonderful cancer-fighting nutrients to the body. I wish you great success in your treatment, and a wonderful holiday! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "If you don't want to go with a prescription vaginal estrogen supplement, you can make your own ointment that will work just as well and will cost much less. Get some food grade organic flax seed oil (with lignins, if you can find it) and some good quality petroleum jelly (vaseline).  Mix 1/2 tsp flax oil with 1 TBSP vaseline in a container with a tight sealing lid. No applicator needed,  Just use clean hands, put a small amount on your fingertips, and apply this ointment around the urethra and in the vagina. Do this at least once daily for the first 7 - 10 days, then thereafter as needed. My dr approves of this self-treatment, and my research has revealed no contra-indications.  Not nearly enough phytoestrogen in this little bit of flax oil to cause problems with cancer, and many naturopathic specialists are recommending flax oil even in the treatment of estrogen-positive breast cancer.   And the best part - it really works well, and is very inexpensive. I use Barleans flax oil -  organic and high quality - I get it at the local health food store.  It needs to be refrigerated or it will go rancid - don't buy it from a seller who doesn't refrigerate it.  Make sure to shake it up well before measuring your 1/2 tsp out.  You DO NOT need to refrigerate the ointment after you make it, as long as you keep it in a clean, tightly sealed container away from heat and light.  (I recommend you don't refrigerate - I tried that - it just got very runny and didn't work as well.)  Make sure to always use clean hands when mixing and applying, so that you don't contaminate the remaining ointment. If you still have any of your batch left after 10 - 12 days,  discard it, clean the container with hot soapy water and rinse well, and make a new batch.(Always clean the container well before making a new batch.) I recommend that you still use a lubricant for intimacy - menopausal tissue (chemically induced or not) - just doesn't lubricate as well as it used to, regardless of how well replenished it is. Also, if you are using prophylactics for birth control , probably best to allow time for the ointment to fully absorb before intimacy, because vaseline can weaken latex.  If you are interested in complementary therapy to lessen the other side effects of the femara, let me know, and I'll send you some references.

      "Content": "The anti-estrogen drugs (and I do mean ALL of them, from tamoxifen to arimidex to aromasin to faslodex to femara, etc) are an especially nasty thing the pharmaceutical industry has inflicted on women.  I am sure that had these drugs been targeted at men, once the side effects became known, they never would have made it through research and development. Whether they be estrogen-receptor blockers, or an aromatase inhibitors, these drugs for some women induce an extremely severe chemical menopause. Unfortunately, the one thing that would best help overcome the drastic side effects - administration of estrogen - is the one thing that these women can't have, if they don't want to risk recurring cancer. The drastic side effects CAN be reversed, over time, and women can naturally maintain low estrogen levels - it takes time, patience, and perseverance to get and stay there.  Be especially careful to avoid supplements/herbs/botanicals that are recommended for treatment of menopause, as they contain very strong phytoestrogens that will act as estrogen replacers, and while rapidly easing off joint and bone pain, will also raise risk of recurring cancer. Diet has to be the main component in regaining the ground lost after months or years of treatment with these drugs. Fortunately, the things that women most need to eat to recover are also the very things that will work against allowing recurrence of cancer. Push as much raw fruits and vegetables, organic whole foods as you absolutely can (except bananas, grapefruit, pomegranates, carrots and soy.)  Limit red meat - indeed limit all meat - two or three 3 or 4 ounce servings of meat a week is plenty.  The by-products of meat breakdown and metabolism for many women will only complicate detoxification of these drugs from the body and the rebuilding of connective and nerve tissue and bone. Eat a lot of garlic and onions - they are extremely detoxifying and healing. Use cayenne pepper to improve circulation. Eat vinegary (pickled) foods - they provide a lot of micronutrients. Olives and olive oil are important foods, along with spinach and kale, beets, cranberries and other berries, cruciferous veggies.  Potatoes are a good choice - but not sweet potatoes or yams - they are very high in phytoestrogens.  Supplementation is a great idea. All of the B vitamins plus choline are absolutely essential for recovery.  A good vitamin C.  Calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, manganese and vitamin D3.  Vitamins A and E.  More than you will get in a one-a-day multiple vitamin.   Drink as much fresh pure water as possible - you need it for detoxification, and for building new healthy and strong tissues.  Steam distilled or reverse osmosis purified water are the best.  Drink plenty of green and/or black teas - they are powerful detoxifiers and contain lots of anti-oxidants/cancer-fighters. A simple regular strength (325 mg) generic aspirin a day will help relieve inflammation, and will also inhibit prostaglandins necessary to produce estrogen.  Grape seed extract and essential fatty acids (the omega's - gamma linolenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) are vitally important for recovery.  You can get the fatty acids through several different types of oil or through roasted pumpkin or squash seeds - just be careful with flax seed oil - it contains very strong phytoestrogens that might act as estrogen replacers instead of blockers.   Much better to use a maxiumum of a tsp or two of ground flax seeds in cottage cheese or yogurt or applesauce a day. (A tiny bit of food grade flax oil applied periodically on the nether area to offset dryness of very delicate tissues will not pose a problem as far as too much estrogen.) Avoid evening primrose oil (unless you are HER2 positive - studies have shown definite benefit there), black and blue cohosh, red clover flowers and any kind of soy.  To get an idea of the kinds of things that women can do to start their bodies healing while also continuing to work to either fight or prevent cancer, take a look at the regimen I used:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers It's not intended as a prescription for all people - but certainly can give women good ideas of a place to start.  There are lots of other good articles on my blog - about the different types of vitamin B, about vitamin C, some recipes, etc.  Feel free to look at whatever interests you. My best recommendation for any woman trying to recover from a prescritption anti-estrogen therapy is to find a naturopathic practitioner, and get them to work with you on the foods, supplements, herbs that you each need to best fuel your body for recovery while working to keep estrogen levels down gently and naturally.  Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Taxol is a relatively mild chemotherapeutic drug, but for some people it can really cause some nasty chest pain.  I had 4 doses - one a month - with my third dose my chest over my heart hurt bad enough they put me in the hospital on oxygen and for diagnostic testing and observation over night. (Arterial blood gases at intervals throughout the night was NOT fun!)  My tests showed everything was normal - heart and lungs were in great shape.  They theorized that the Taxol was  irritating the tissues in my chest wall and causing the pain.  Treatment? - Tylenol and rest. I did also have some shortness of breath during the time I was on chemo (and for another month or so thereafter), but as my they monitored my oxygen levels during treatments and on follow up visits and it was always ok, I attributed the shortness of breath to poor quality of sleep and the stress on my body/blood cells from the chemo in general. PLus the bodily stresses of recovering from surgeries, trying to metabolize anesthesia from my system. (Metabolic by-products of anesthesia can take 6 - 8 months or longer to totally clear the body.)  I tried to make sure to eat foods that boosted the immune system and provide building blocks for new blood cells, and if I was tired, I rested - even if that meant I couldn't get other things done. Having a window open and a fan blowing for a fresh source of air helped, plus sleeping with my head and chest elevated. (Yes, it's winter now - but if you can crack a window even a little, the cold air may help, as it actually contains more oxygen than warm or hot air.) Has she reported these symptoms to the oncologist, and what was his response?  At the least I would think her bloodwork should be checked - make sure she isn't getting anemic. Pulse oximetry can be done right there in the dr's office if they have the equipment - that would show if her oxygen saturation is ok. They might want to do an EKG - see if there is a heart abnormality, as chemotherapy does have the potential to do harm. The other thing that can be a problem with chemo, causing shortness of breath, is lack of proper nutrition. The chemo gave me pervasive nausea low-grade nausea/queasiness.  I didn't vomit, but boy, my stomach just couldn't settle, food didn't taste good,  and I sure didn't feel like eating. Really hard to get the nutrient basics that way.  I found myself taking the antiemetic round the clock for at least 5 or 6 days after each chemo - just to minimize the nausea.  If the dr doesn't have any objection, your wife might consider taking some vitamin supplements, especially the B vitamins, vitamin C and vitamin D3, if she is able to tolerate them with food. I have some articles about vitamin C and the B vitamins on my blog - you are welcome to look at them.  They list good food sources for these - she should eat as much of them as she can tolerate unless the doc says otherwise.   Unsweetened concord grape juice - very cold - is a good addition to meals and snacks, as it's very nutritious, and it masks the \"bad\" flavor of foods caused by the chemo.   Really helped me be able to eat the stuff I knew I needed.  I also found that I did better with sour or bitter foods, rather than sweet or spicy, or even bland.  I ate more saurkraut and Klaussen dill pickles, and drank more grape juice when I was on chemo than I had previously eaten  in the whole rest of my life combined - but that was ok because they are all nutritious and contain cancer-fighting nutrients! Here's the web address for the first of my articles on vitamin B (there are 10  posts on vitamin b, plus the one on vitamin c - you can use the search box to find the rest): http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/buzz-on I wish you both the best in getting through this.  Keep your chins up - it may seem unending now, but take it one day at a time until you get to brighter days ahead.

( I personally don't think it's been so easy ).  My doctor has said that some people who went smoothly through the AC's have a tough time with Taxol.   I have since been reading about Taxol and the pain, pre-treatment drugs and other rumors have scared me a bit.  Has anyone else out there had any experiences with taking the same drugs as me that can offer some advice for getting through the Taxol treatments. Thanks.   Andi Hi Andi, I did 4 rounds of Adriamycin with Taxol in 2002.  I had worked as a nurse for many years, taking care of many oncology patients.  I felt that my experience with the AT was not as bad as some of the problems I had seen many patients have with chemo. I lost my hair - when it started falling out I had my head shaved and wore soft caps and bandanas, reverting to no head covering once I had about 1/2 inch of hair.  I was nauseated a lot, but only ever threw up once. One of the prescription antiemetics did a good job of alleviating the nausea some, as long as I took it early and consistently. I also used concord grape juice and ginger ale (sometimes mixed) to alleviate nausea.  Bitter foods helped, also.   I always seemed to be more nauseated after I took my Neupogen - so my last round of chemo I didn't take the neupogen at all, and I actually had very little problem with nausea those last few weeks. I was very fatigued, but I also had had 3 major surgeries withing 4 months, so I expected to be fatigued.  THe worst problem I had was with the steroids - started on Prednisone - had major hallucinations, to the point that I felt very unsafe to be alone at home during the daytime.  Very disconcerting.  The next month we tried decadron - the hallucinations were about the same.  I did the last two treatments without any steroids at all - quite frankly I felt better without the steroids than I did with them.  While everybody's body chemistry is different, and it is possible the AT may affect you more harshly than the AC, it's also possible that the AT treatment won't be as bad.  Many posters to the board who have taken Taxol and are able to compare it to other chemo treatments they've had, say that the Taxol was much gentler than some of the other stuff. Also something to consider:  it's only 4 rounds.  You're already halfway there - that is practically home free when you consider all the stuff you've been through in the past year. Perhaps instead of letting yourself be overwhelmed by the idea of this change in chemo, concentrate on just getting through one day at a time - that's the best that any of us can do.  Also, concentrate on providing yourself the best physical, emotional and spiritual nourishment that you can.  Make sure to drink plenty of pure, fresh water, and eat lost of raw, fresh fruits and veggies (organic is best.) Consider taking the following combination of supplements - they are absolutely essential for anyone fighting cancer, and I cannot see that your oncologist would object to your taking them in combination with chemo. selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium.

Breast cancer does frequently recur in the opposite breast, and yes MRI of that breast is a good idea if there is some indication of recurrence.  But the cancer doesn't always recur in the breast.  Mine skipped straight to my lungs - mammogram was showing me to be cancer free, and MRI of breast would have shown the same thing, cause it just wasn't there in the breast any more.  There are no reliable predictors of where or when it might recur - at least none that I know of, or none that were made available to me. I'm not sure if this answers your question or not.  At any rate, my heart goes out to you that you are fighting this all over again. Sincerely, Tre",

She has been to oncologists and they recommended Chemo and Radio therapy. Now, they have discovered 2 lumps in her breasts and another cancer in her colon. I have had mixed messages from people some saying that she should still continue and start the treatments next week and other who say, it's too aggressive and with the age and dimentia as well we should just let nature take it's course. I am really after some words of wisdom from anyone who may have had to make this choice before and anyone who may know life expectancy rates in this situation. I would rather have a month or 2 of her here, with pain medication and her happy than however long it may be going through the pain of chemo (which i witnessed my mother go through when she had breast cancer 10 years ago). I am just so confused. Can anyone help? Hi EmmaAus, As a cancer survivor (endometrial cancer 2002 - cured) , a person living with cancer (breast cancer 2002, diagnosed with metastasis to lungs 2008), , and one who has lost both my best friend and my mother to cancer, if I were in your grandmother's shoes, I would say \"No chemo, no radiation. Treatment using naturals  if they will help me to not have pain and to otherwise keep me as healthy as possible. Prescription drugs only for management of pain, and to keep me from having infections.  Let me enjoy the rest of my life, and when it's my time, help me to pass on with dignity.\" Speaking as a former RN and one who has done a lot of research on using alternatives to treat breast cancer: I'm not sure there is any major advantage to chemo/radiation at this point. Leading authorities on breast cancer are increasingly coming to believe that by the time they reach their early 80's, MOST women will have at least early breast cancer. Therefore there have already been some studies on breast cancer in the aged; most of what I've seen published indicates that for these women, there is no increase in life-span gained through chemo or radiation therapy. In fact, there is a lot of evidence that at this age, women who choose NOT to have treatment outlive those who get chemo or radiation. So in terms of \"quantity\" of life - maybe no advantage to treating the cancer. Thus \"quality\" of life becomes the main issue. With dementia, especially if it gets worse, your grandmother is already at risk for decreased quality of life.  She may have skin care problems - chemo/radiation might make that worse.  She might have nutrition problems. Chemo/radiation will DEFINITELY make those worse.  Treatment - especially if she is given steroids - is likely to interfere with her mental functioning: increasing forgetfulness, disorientation, possible \"brain fog\" from chemo.  As for pain, that can be treated without chemo/radiation, especially if you use natural alternatives in combination with  prescription drugs.  That leaves the question of kidney and bowel function.  Yes, eventually the metastasis is likely to cause kidney failure, but that may take a very long time. And the dementia could take her first. I would ask the dr how likely it is that she will have problems with blockages of urine and/or the bowels in comparison to how long before she might start having life-threatening problems from the dimentia, and if pain from the cancer is likely to become a major problem before the dimentia becomes life-threatening. If a short period of chemo  or radiation could significantly lessen the risk of these two factors, then perhaps I would consider going ahead with them. The other thing to consider is how bad is your grandmother's dementia.  If she is still at all capable of making decisions, I would certainly find out what she wants to do about all of this. In the end, you and your mum (and whoever else is part of the decision making process) need to go with whatever gives you the most peace in YOUR hearts, regardless of what any outsiders might say. This will enable you to continue caring for your grandmother with love and kindness, and those are the most important gifts she could receive.  Sincerely, Tre",

After a mastectomy, lymph nodes around the surgical site can get congested with crystallized drainage/secretions.  Many women report  stringy bumpy areas at about 10 months post-op - this is crystallization due to inadequate drainage.  These crystals can be broken up through gentle massage of the affected area.  Pain from post-surgical scarring can also be eased by gentle but persistent massage of the affected area.  Doesn't have to be anything fancy - doesn't even have to be prescribed by a dr or therapist.  To the extent that you can stand, gently but firmly massage the area at least several times a day - gentle pressure may at first be somewhat uncomfortable, but within a short period of time SHOULD help the area to feel better.  If gentle massage causes onset of moderate to severe pain, stop and get another exam. Unless you have another physical condition which affects your balance or mobility, You might also consider using a rebounder (mini-trampoline.)  They can be purchased fairly inexpensively, and gently bouncing for just 3 minutes twice a day can greatly improve lymph drainage, decrease lymphedema, help to break up scar tissue, improve muscle tone and circulation, plus it's a lot of fun. ",

I'm not sure if by saying \"pill-free\" you mean just prescription drugs, or both conventional medicines AND supplements. If you want to reduce your risk of recurrence while living absolutely pill-free - no supplements, you would have to do so with diet and exercise alone.  It's possible, but it's a rough road and it takes tremendous commitment and determination.  However, if you are willing to take natural supplements, there is actually a lot you can do in addition to diet and exercise to minimize your risk of recurrence, while regaining your physical health. You can see an example of a natural anti-estrogen regimen on my blog:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Please feel free to use the email link provided on the blog if you have questions.  I highly recommend that you seek the advice of a naturopathic or other holistic practitioner to determine the regimen that might be best for you.  Sincerely, Tre  ",

My Radiation/Oncologist stated that this is fluid build up and I may need an aspiration.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I'm wondering why this would cause such pain.  Is it because I was sewed to tight, etc.  I'm curious on how many of us need an aspiration post surgery.  Is this on the rise or is this a rare problem... Hi JaeAnn, Doubtful that you were sewed too tight - if that was the case, your incision probably wouldn't have healed properly and you would have had pain, and a lot of restriction of motion,  much sooner than this.  The answer to your question may depend upon the answer to another question: did you have a lumpectomy (partial mastectomy)  - simple removal of the tumor with immediate reconstructive surgery, or did you have a more complete mastectomy and are in the process of getting an implant? With lumpectomly and immediate reconstructive surgery, surgeons will deliberately leave the area open to inflow of lymph fluids to fill up the hole left by removal of the tumor.  This not only makes for less of a gap in the tissues, but speeds healing because it bathes the area in nutrients.  With time this inflow will naturally seal itself off and the fluid will be reabsorbed as the area heals.  If you had a greater inflow of lymph than the surgeon expected, or if this inflow hasn't sealed off when it should, this could cause stretching of still-delicate tissues resulting in pain. The aspiration probably will be uncomfortable, but they should use a local anesthetic so it shouldn't actually be painful.  If after you've had the aspiration the situation recurs, you need to ask your surgeon about getting an ultrasound or some other type of better look to make sure there isn't a more serious problem. If you had a more complete mastectomy and are in process of getting implants, the answer is not so simple. It could be that fluid injected to expand the skin to allow for placement of an implant has shifted to somewhere it shouldn't be.  In that case aspiration is still the way to relieve the problem, but maybe the surgeon should also be looking for a reason the fluid shifted.  As in the first case scenario, if this recurs after one aspiration, ask the surgeon about getting an ultrasound or other diagnostic workup to find out why this is happening. There are many fine surgeons out there doing a good job at removing breast cancer, but I've discovered that even the best doctors may not have a true appreciation of how debilitating breast pain can be.  So if this problem it not resolved right away, keep at your doctor until they get it solved, even if you have to bug them repeatedly to do something about it. If you have chemo and/or radiation coming up, or some further kind of treatment, you really don't need to be dealing with a pain problem, too, so please be sure to push for satisfactory resolution of the problem. Good luck, and take care, Tre  ",

This is an excellent page to look at as regards Protocel (Cantron):   http://www.cancertutor.com/Cancer/Protocel.html  Make sure to take a look at the links he provides.  You do not need to buy the  \"Outsmart Your Cancer\" book unless you are interested in looking at the other alternative therapies the book addresses as well as Protocel, but I do recommend you purchase Protocel eBooklet, called Protocel and Cancer ($10.00) - the link is given to purchase the book.  PLEASE  read the CancerTutor page very carefully - there is a lot of information there that at first glance may not seem vital, but this particular treatment can be negated by some very simple vitamins and minerals, so it is important to go over these references VERY carefully.  The CancerTutor page also gives references to Paul Winter's website.  Paul Winter is an expert on Protocel, and his information is very accurate and reliable, based on verification with other sites.  Paul's main protocel page is here:   http://alternativecancer.us/protocel.htm   In my last message to you I mentioned the Budwig Diet in combination with Protocel. I know that some people are combining the two, but Paul Winter's site says that the jury is still out on whether or not flaxseed/flaxoil reduces the effect of the Protocel - he recommends not using it.  Certainly the Budwig diet would be an excellent follow up once the Protocel treatment is complete.  (Even though Protocel may eradicate all tumors, still is best to follow up with a stage III treatment for at least a few months to make sure that any remaining stray cells are taken care of.  Many people choose to stay on a modified cancer diet and/or supplements for the rest of their lives as prevention of recurrance.  Paul Winter talks about a man who does this with Protocel - it IS an extremely powerful antioxidant.) I hope this information helps. Take care, Tre",

Make sure to get a good source of essential fatty acids - omega's 3, 6, and 9's.  (A handful of roasted pumpkin seeds every day is an excellent way to meet ALL of your omega needs.)  Stay away from artificial sweeteners and partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated foods. Drink plenty of fresh pure water.  make sure to get at least 20 minutes of even gentle exercise everyday - walking is great for that.  Also try to get 15 - 20 minutes of sunshine every day.  make sure to find something to laugh at everyday - 10 minutes of good belly laughter per day per person should be a minumum requirement for healthy living! You might want to consider starting a regimen of supplements:  I recommend these to begin: selenium:  200 mcg/day (can start with 400mcg/day but only for a few weeks) magnesium:  200 - 250 mg/day (350 mg/day max), take with food zinc:  50 mg/day (can start with 100mg/day but only for a few weeks), take with food manganese: 10 - 15 mg/day, take with food calcium: 1200 mg/day We need Vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize calcium. Our bodies manufacture D-3 if we get adequate sunlight (15 - 20 minutes exposure/day) - but I do not believe in leaving this to chance, so also recommend a Vitamin D-3 supplement, 1000 - 2000 iu/day (10,000 iu/day max)  Find a naturopathic practitioner in your area, and get a consult on nutrition, supplementation and herbal/botanical remedies.  A naturopathic physician or nutritionist would be best, but you can get wonderful guidance from other holistic people - herbalists, homeopaths, osteopaths, people who practice ayurvedic or traditional chinese medicine, accupunturists, etc.  Best to find someone locally who can help you tailor a plan to best suit your needs. When the immune system breaks down, it's often because we just aren't getting enough of the basic nutritional building blocks we need to hold it together.  The 6 I listed are key elements to good health.  As I said, that would be a good start - if you only try one thing, get started taking some selenium and some zinc.  Sincerely, Tre",

It is hard now to spend 20 miles on a bike let alone 75.  So I tried to take up running.  That is going pretty good but amazingly, I find that even by just running 10 miles, my vaginal skin gets aggravated.  I haven't had a mate for years  but am sure that when I am lucky enough to be blessed with one, sex will be painful.  A lttle rubbing in that area puts holes and tears in the skin that hurt for a week or two.  Yadda, yadda, you get the idea.  My gyn is aware of the problem and a few years ago she cut the skin where the clitoris is because it was fusing over.  The skin just fused together again.  I am not even sure what I am supposed to lok like down there anymore but I am sure it is all out of whack.  I now see ads for labia surgery.  Most of it is meant to be cosmetic but I am hoping there will be some available to me that will give me comfort.  Does anyone know if this condition will improve when I stop taking the Femara?  Right now, my gyn says there is nothing she can give me to treat it while I am on the drug.  So what can happen surgically and medication-wise when I am done with the Femara.  I can't wait. Woozz Hi Woozz, and others responding to Woozz, Obviously there is a huge controversy over whether or not to use some small amount of estrogen to relieve vaginal atrophy caused by breast cancer treatment chemically-induced menopause.  That's unfortunate, because the pain is very real and women who suffer from it need a remedy that works. I have suffered from vaginal atrophy caused first by natural menopause, and then a hysterectomy for cancer, and THEN herbal aromatase-inhibitor and estrogen-blocker treatment for metastatic estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.  (The prescription anti-estrogen drugs make me very ill, so I am taking a well-researched, self-designed anti-estrogen herbal regimen, It's not prescription, but it still causes estrogen depletion severe enough to result in vaginal dryness and a lot of pain.) I have done extensive research on phytoestrogens  and their effect on breast cancer.  Many clinicians are coming to the the conclusion that very strong phytoestrogens, like soy, can be used by cancer cells for growth, whereas very weak phytoestrogens - like quercetin, and flax lignan - can act as estrogen-blockers, thus depriving cancer cells of their estrogens.  Once I realized that my pelvic pain might be in large part due to drying of delicate vaginal tissues, I asked my family doctor if she thought a non-prescription low-strength phytoestrogen salve might be effective to replenish moisture and restore elasticity without feeding my cancer.  She said give it a try, that the phytoestrogen would work locally but doubtful such a small amount would make a difference systemically, and getting relief of this pain is very important. so I did more research and came up with my own remedy for vaginal dryness.  Flax seed is very often recommended as a phytoestrogen supplement to alleviate menopause symptoms, so I took a close look at flax oil.   The lignans from flax seed hulls contain low-strenth phytoestrogens that have actually been shown in clinical trials to work against breast cancer.  I found a flax oil that contains the lignans - Barlean's Organic Flaxseed Oil (there are others on the market, but Barleans is what I can buy here.)  I mix no more than 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of Barleans with at most a tablespoon of vaseline, and I apply enough of it to cover my fingertip vaginally as needed. This mixture has worked so well, that while at first I was using it several times a day, within 2 months I was using it at most once or twice a week. Flax oil should be kept away from light, and it needs to be refrigerated or it will turn rancid.  I refrigerated my flax/vaseline mixture at first, but discovered it got very watery and then didn't work as well.  Now I mix only as much as I will need for 7 - 10 days and keep it in an air-tight container in the medicine cabinet, away from light.  I make sure to use clean hands when applying it, and I've had not problems with infection or irritation.  If I have any suspicion that the oil is going bad, or that the mixture may have been contaminated, I simply throw it away, clean my container vigorously with soap and hot water, and mix some more.  Very simple, very easy, and very cheap. In seeking herbal treatment for fibromyalgia, I found something mostly used in traditional chinese medicine that I think has also contributed to restoring my  delicate pelvic tissue health: white mulberry leaf extract, or just plain mulberry leaf.  So much of women's diets today make our bodies very acid, and that is really not good for our urinary tracts and reproductive tissues.  Urinary tract irritation and drying can contribute to vaginal irritation, so it makes sense to take good care of our bladders.  White mulberry is very alkaline, acts as an agent to leach out toxic crystals that irritate the bladder, and makes the urine more alkaline.  I have not been able to find any indication of side effects to mulberry leaf, although I would recommend not taking it if you KNOW you are allergic to mulberry, or if you get a rash or have problems breathing after starting to take the supplement. I take standardized white mulberry leaf extract when I can afford it - 500mg of mulberry leaf, plus iminosol and quercetin/isoquercetin which both help my FMS , twice a day.  If I need to save a little money, I just get the mulberry leaf and take one cap twice a day.  It still provides 500 mg mulberry per capsule, but the iminosol and quercetin are not listed on the label.  Two caps a day is the  recommended dose per the product label - it seems to work pretty well for me. I could only find mulberry leaf extract online, and only 3 or 4 places that carry it, I'll give the name of my supplier, but if it is deleted when I post, if you will message me privately with your email address, I will send the url to you.  I get my mulberry and most of my other herbs and supplements from swansonvitamins.com.  They offer great discount prices and excellent service. As for my cancer, my PET scan a few weeks ago looked promising, so I really have no worries that my use of a tiny little bit of flax oil very infrequently is counter-productive to my herbal regimen against cancer.  and it's great to be able to sit for a while, or to pee, etc, without hurting! I hope this information will help some, or all of you.  If you have questions or comments, please feel free to private message me. Sincerely,  Tre  ",

      "Content": "This article does a pretty good job of explaining what a seroma is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroma Seromas ususally consist of the plasma part of blood, whereas lymphedema is actually lymph fluid - not part of the blood at all. While a seroma actually forms a pocket of fluid that will push tissues aside, lymphedema is spread throughout skin, muscle and fat cells of a certain region.  Lymph is  a different kind of fluid, often containing bacteria, cellular debris and toxins that the lymph system is trying to filter out of the body.  That's why lymphedema can be such a serious problem - it's very easy to get infected through an open wound in an extremity or body part that is affected by lymphedema.  The fluid in a seroma will usually reabsorb into tissues over time - and yes, sometimes it takes quite a while for this to happen.  Lymph fluid does not reabsorb into tissues.  It is meant to drain into lymph nodes, and the wastes it carries are then taken to the kidneys and bowel and excreted from the body. When the lymph nodes are gone, lymph fluid can only be drained naturally by gravity or the massaging action of muscles. That's kind of a catch-22, as too much muscle activity can increase flow of lymph fluid TO an area that is already bogged down by lymph fluid it can't get rid of. Some drs will recommend low-level heat to help a seroma reabsorb.  Heat is actually contraindicated for lymphedema, unless it is accompanied by gravity drainage or active massage, and even then caution must be used because tissue that is overwhelmed with lymphedema can actually be damaged by too much heat. Coping with a seroma definitely is not fun, but in terms of bodily risk, seromas are temporary situations that in most cases resolve without problems.  Lymphedema is a lifelong condition that if left untreated can have some very serious sequellae. I hope things start going better for you now that the drain is out. Be patient, but remember to keep a close eye on any drainage that you may still be having. If you notice a change in color or a worsening of odor, start to have severe pain or start to run a fever, be sure to let your dr know.  Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "You should not be using estrace cream or any type of estrogen preparation while you are taking aromasin or any other breast cancer drug (estrogen-blocker or aromatase inhibitor.)  The drugs work by either stopping estrogen from getting into the cells or by stopping the body from making estrogen.  Either way, estrogen products are contra-indicated because the counter the effects of the cancer drugs and can also cause untoward reactions (as you had with the estrace cream.) Many, many other women - including myself - have serious problems with these breast cancer drugs, and many - again including myself - have decided to stop taking them  and to treat ourselves with natural alternatives. Regardless of whether you choose to continue the aromasin, or choose not to take any more of the anti-estrogen drugs, there ARE herbs and other natural remedies that can ease the problems caused by the drugs and fight breast cancer.  I need to do some research, see what might be the best recommendation for your yeast problem.  Normally I would suggest eating quite a bit of yogurt, but in the face of the anti-estrogen drug I don't think that's a sufficient answer.  I'll try to get back to you within a few days and give you some information on both problems.  In the meantime you may well get some good answers from other posters on the board.  There are many messages with some variation of \"side effects of aromasin' in the title - you might get more responses if you post another message titled something like \"need help - yeast infection from aromacin\" - that will more attract the attention of the people most likely to be able to help you.

      "Content": "Sounds like this could be lymphedema and/or adhesions from scarring. There is an excellent treatment for both: rebounding. Exercise on a mini-trampoline, otherwise known as rebounding is very  effective for getting lymph fluids moving, and for loosening up soft tissue that has stuck to surgical scars. Gently bouncing on a rebounder for 3 minutes twice a day will work wonders - should be able to start feeling better within 2 -3 days, and it's fun. Mini-trampolines can be purchased from department stores for as little as $30 - that's how I got mine, and it's holding up just as well as if I'd bought an expensive model.  Excellent article on rebounding: http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm I know that this sounds like an answer too good to be true, but it really does work. Since I started rebounding, I no longer need to use my compression sleeve for lymphedema, and I have considerable lessening of pain from scar tissue in my chest. It also has put an end to a long-term problem with fluid retention in my legs. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Sorry you're having problems - I'm sure you really do want to be getting on with your life about now. The problems with so much draining is not that the breast might swell, but rather that having those tissues be so wet might reopen your incision line. While surgical incisions need moisture to heal, they can't be waterlogged or they won't heal. It's been long enough now that your incision should be healed completely, but the fact that it's still draining so much makes me wonder if there isn't something other than infection that has kept it from healing. Has the dr cultured the drainage to see if there really is infection there?  If not, he should.  Has your dr done any scans of the site to find out what might be going on other than possible infection?  If not, he probably should do that too.  You might consider getting a second opinion - find another doc who is willing to investigate why this is still draining. It can be really difficult to find someone to look at it - drs don't like to interfere with other drs surgical patients, but I would really push to find someone who is at least willing to take a look at it.  You might also push your insurance company to get you in to see another doc - tell them that the situation right now is doing nothing but cost them more money in the long run, especially if you have to end up having more surgery, when a little bit more attention to this now might prevent it. I hope you can get some answers soon.  Just be real careful about insisting that they just close it up - you really don't want to be dealing with an open incision. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "If there is no infection, then you certainly don't need any more antibiotics - that might just make things worse. It sounds reasonable that this could be a lymph node that isn't closing off.  That in itself would not be worrisome - with breast conservation and reconstruction they do expect lymph drainage to fill in the surgical area, except this seems to be a long time that it hasn't been able to heal itself. Possibly  may need to be PET or CT or ultrasound scanned to make sure the tissue is viable, and then stitched up.  Yes, there are women who don't do well at all with the expanders - some people's bodies just don't like foreign objects. It may also be that the expander is putting too much pressure on a delicate part of the remaining lymph system that was already stressed by surgery and treatment. Some docs are content to let something like this run its course - even if it takes many, many months.  I have some problems with that idea - the longer a person has an artificial opening into their body, the greater the chance of both acute and chronic infection, so I am glad you are considering a second opinion.  I also hope it won't take you too long to see another surgeon. Hang in there, and keep pushing to get this resolved. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "If your sister wants to survive, then yes, she should get much more aggressive.  If it were me, I would do everything I could, and that would include adding complementary and alternative treatments. There are many foods, herbs and supplements that can be combined with conventional treatment and also many that can be used instead of conventional treatment - adding these could be the change that would turn this course of events around.  It would be best if your sister could find a naturopathic oncologist - lacking that, she should get consultation from a licensed or certified naturopathic, homeopathic, osteopathic dr or clinician.  Someone experienced in traditional chinese medicine or ayurvedic medicine could help her, or an experienced herbalist.   You can find excellent information at these web sites: http://www.cancertutor.com    (you need to look at the stage IV cancer treatments AND diets) http://www.lefcancer.org I also recommend she get a copy of Dr Susan Love's Breast Book, 4th edition, and read about treatments for stage IV disease.  Susan Love is an excellent clinician and researcher who is herself a survivor of breast cancer,dedicated to eradicating this horrible disease within her lifetime. Regardless of what treatment they get, there are 5 minerals that EVERYONE needs to successfully fight cancer, and very few people get suficient quantity by diet alone, so I recommend your sister supplement them: selenium 200mcg/day ( up to 400mcg/day for short periods of time)  - selenium is the single most important nutrient to fight cancer as ALL cells of the body must have it to aid the process of killing cancer cells calcium 1200 mg/day magnesium 200 - 250mg/day (390 mg /day max) manganese 10 - 15 mg /day zinc 50 mg/day (up to 100 mg/day for short periods) we also need vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize the calcium. While our bodies use sunshine to manufacture d-3 (15 - 20 minutes a day),instead of taking the risk of not making enough, I think it's better to go ahead and supplement D-3 as well:  1000iu - 2000iu/day, 10,000iu max I cannot stress enough the importance of getting professional help with an alternative protocol. If your sister is unable to find that help in Texas, perhaps she should contact the Cancer Treatment Centers of America - they might either be able to assist her to find an alternative practitioner, and they also give alternative and conventional treatments themselves.  I believe the nearest CTCA to her would be Tulsa OK.  THere are many simple and inexpensive things your sister can do to help boost her immune system and overall health as well as fight cancer while she is making up her mind on further treatment.  I use a natural regimen of my own design that has been keeping my mets in remission.  While I would never offer my regimen as prescription of anyone else, I have published it on my blog with notations about the things I do that should be safe for a majority of people and hopefully benefit them as well. Feel free to look at this article in my blog and anything else that interests you as well: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers I wish your sister the best.  Please take good care of yourself as well.

      "Content": "Aromasin chemically induces severe menopause, the symptoms of which often go beyond what women experience normally.  Memory loss, bone and joint pain, plus the other symptoms mentioned in the other posters' replies, can all be attributed to menopause, regardless of whether the menopause occurs naturally, due to surgery (hysterectomy and/or removal of ovaries), or due to chemicals such as aromasin.  (Yes, drugs are just chemicals, and these chemicals DO cause a very severe menopause.  Many women who have already experienced natural or surgical menopause report symptoms MUCH greater once they start on aromasin and some of these other drugs.) There have been insufficient studies done on aromasin and the other aromatase inhibitors for drs to across-the-board truthfully state that these symptoms are not due to the aromasin,  Indeed, many well-meaning oncologist are just repeating the assertions of the drug companies when they say that the bone and joint side effects are the only ones that have relevance to the meds. There are ways to naturally decrease the body's production of estrogen and therefore deprive cancer cells of the hormone they need to grow, but those natural means do not require a dr's supervision nor are they things that will bring the drug companies any money.  And that's what promotion of prescription drugs like the estrogen receptor blockers(Tamoxifen) and the aromatase inhibitors (Arimidex, Aromasin, Femara, etc) is all about :  the acquisition of wealth and maintaining job security in the cancer industry. Reputable and definitive studies have shown that Tamoxifen loses its effectiveness after 3 1/2 to 4 years, and there is some evidence that after that time period the drug may actually become contributory to other health problems.   Yet dr's are still prescribing it for a minimum of 5 years, and some are wanting their patients to stay on it even longer than that.  Aromasin and other similar drugs haven't been on the market long enough for studies on their long-term effectiveness to have been completed, but already some researchers are releasing preliminary results indicating that the body acclimates to and becomes resistant to these drugs over several years, just as has been proven to happen with the Tamoxifen.  There is a whole wealth of foods, herbs, supplements, botanicals that can help women prevent and defeat breast cancer. They are tremendously cheaper to acquire than the prescription drugs, and they offer wonderful health benefits other than just fighting cancer, with very few side effects in comparison to the anti-estrogen drugs. I researched this subject and designed my own natural anti-estrogen regimen, and in less than 6 months was able to put my metastatic breast cancer into remission.  Every person's body chemistry is different, and what was a good combination for me may not be the exact combination that another woman needs, therefore I recommend that people seek consultation with a naturopath to determine their own needs, but the natural means that I used very well could be at least a good start for other women seeking a weapon against hormone-positive breast cancer. (even something as simple as an aspirin a day can reduce the amount of estrogen produced by the body.) I've published my regimen on my blog.  Readers are welcome to look at anything else on my blog that interests them. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers It is my sincere hope that many more women will stop the insanity of suffering the debilitating side effects of prescription drugs, and will seek a safe, natural way to live longer, healthier and more pain free lives.

      "Content": "P.S.  Every anesthesiologist, dr, dentist, etc,  who performs procedures has their own way of doing things.  Some will tell their patients exactly what they are going to do and which drugs they are going to use, but many speak in general terms rather than specifics. Some will just give drugs without talking to a patient about it - but that is no longer the norm (at least not in the U.S.)   If you are having a surgical procedure, or other procedure that requires sedation, you have a right to know what the drs are going to do and what drugs you are going to be given, or have been given.  It's ok to ask the dr when he/she comes to talk to you what they are going to give you, and if you don't understand what they're talking about, it's ok to ask them to explain it so you can understand it.  Altho a few drs get upset at having to do this - they are jerks - it is becoming accepted in the medical world that patients have a right to know what is being done to them, and that it is a dr's responsibility to help a patient understand. If the anesthesiologist has NOT come to see a patient before surgery, the patient has the right to demand a visit from the anesthesiologist before they are given any medications that will affect their perceptions and judgement. If you've had surgery or a medical procedure in the past that was either a good experience, or an awful experience, it's ok to seek information about what you were given, and to ask that you either be given the same drugs for future procedures, or NOT be given those same drugs.  Best to seek this information well in advance of an upcoming procedure if possible. I've had a number of surgeries and procedures in the past 7 years - I just tell them right upfront which drugs I do NOT do well with, and that I've done well with Versed in the past, and that I prefer they use Versed for the upcoming procedure. Most anesthesiologists are glad to get that kind of information from a patient.    ",

      "Content": "Hi Cherie, In addition to seeking out treatment recommendations from the drs you've already seen, I hope that you will consider complementary and/or alternative therapies.  There are many natural substances, including herbs, foods, and supplements that can combat cancer, either in combination with chemo, radiation and surgery, or by themselves. Things like IV vitamin C, curcumin, and paw paw, to mention a few. If you can get access to a naturopathic oncologist that would be wonderful. If not, seek a consult with a holistic practitioner - a naturopath, osteopath, homeopath, or someone who practices ayurvedic or traditional chinese medicine.  The home page on Cancer Compass includes contact information for Cancer Treatment Centers of America, the organization that sponsors  this board. You could contact them and ask for information on holistic practitioners in your area that might have knowledge of treating this cancer.  You might also ask if CTCA has anyone who has treated it and could at least give you advise. Regardless of what treatment you choose, I hope you will seriously consider starting on a formal cancer diet. Excellent references for these can be found at www.cancertutor.com, as well as a wealth of information on alternative therapies. Another good site for information on complementary and alternative therapies is www.lefcancer.org Also, regardless of what therapy(s) you choose, there is something you can do right now to start fighting the cancer.  There are five supplements that major proponents of alternative therapies agree are absolutely essential to fighting cancer.  These are common inexpensive supplements easily found at health food stores, herb shops, and online: selenium 200 mcg/day (can take up to 400mcg.day for several weeks to get yourself jump started) magnesium 200 - 250 mg/day (max 350 mg/day) zinc 50 mg/day (could take up to 100 mg/day for the first several weeks) manganese 10 - 15 mg/day calcium 1200 mg/day you also need adequate vitamin D-3 to be able to absorb and utilize the calcium - 1000 iu - 2000iu /day is usually adequate for most people - 10,000 iu is max (our bodies manufacture vitamin d-3 if we get adequate sunlight - 15 - 20 minutes/day, but I do not believe in leaving this to chance) Since you are disabled and do not have family living in the immediate vicinity, I recommend you seek the assistance of a cancer support group.  From what I understand support groups specifically for rare types of cancer are few and far in between, but groups that offer support for breast cancer can be found, and certainly groups that offer support for all cancer patients are easily located.  Your dr may be able to give you good contact information, or call the patient advocate's office at the local hospital and ask if they can direct you to someone.  The American Cancer Society also may have information on local support groups.  Getting plugged into a support group can make a lot of difference. Many times there are volunteers who are willing to help people get to and from chemo, to provide food and other services, and they are great people willing to lend an ear and advice when things are rough. If you would like to get a quick idea about some other simple things you can do to start beating this cancer while you wait, you are welcome to look at my blog.  I designed my own herbal regimen for estrogen-receptor positive metastatic breast cancer - it has kept me in remission. I do not recommend it as prescription for anyone, but rather have published it as an example for others of the common foods, herbs and supplements that can be effective in fighting this dread disease, as well as boosting the immune system and improving over-all wellness.  I have tried to emphasize those things that should be safe and hopefully effective for most people.  You are also welcome to look at anything else on my blog that interests you: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Please feel free to contact me through the link on my blog if you have questions or need someone with whom to talk.

I found this article at Dr Susan Love's Research site - she is one of the foremost researchers on breast cancer in the country (a breast cancer survivor herself, she is dedicated to eradicating breast cancer within her lifetime.)  I am going to copy in the article so you can easily read it, but I want to point out that it mentions that invasive metaplastic breast cancer is treated in the same way as other invasive breast cancers, and many times in the same way as non-invasive breast cancers.  If your drs are having such a hard time deciding what to do, it sounds to me like you should find a way to get to a major cancer treatment center - perhaps like a university hospital? Also, before I copy in the article, I want to mention a few groups that perhaps aren't routinely considered as references for support, but you might check with that might know more about this rare type of cancer, or who can maybe point you to a support group in your area.  Unfortunately I do not have contact information for most of these groups, but I am sure you can find it online: Reach for Recovery (they deal with mastectomy patients post-operatively, but my Reach for Recovery representative was able to point me to several good support groups in my local area) Y-ME - a volunteer group consisting of breast cancer survivors Susan G Komen Foundation (I see there is at least one article about your rare type of cancer on their site - I will try to look at it soon) National Breast Cancer Coalition:   www.stopbreastcancer.org Ok, here is the article I found on Susan Love's site, plus the URL for it:   http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?CATID=68&L Metaplastic Breast Cancer I was just diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer. What does this mean? Metaplastic breast cancer was officially recognized in 2000 as a distinct type of breast cancer. It is a rare type of cancer, representing less than one percent of all invasive breast cancers. Breast cancer cells typically look like either the ductal or lobular cells from which breast cancers arise. In contrast, metaplastic breast cancers contain several different types of cells not usually seen in breast tumors. Metaplastic breast cancer is staged the same and treated the same as other forms of invasive ductal breast cancer, and the prognosis is the same as well. As with other tumor types, metaplastic tumors are tested to see whether they are hormone sensitive (ER or PR positive) or HER2-positive. Those that are hormone sensitive can be treated with hormone therapies like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, while those that are HER2-positive can be treated with Herceptin. A recent analysis of close to 900 cases of metaplastic breast cancer reported to the National Cancer Database between 2001 and 2003 found that women with metaplastic breast cancer tended to have larger tumors than women with typical invasive cancers. However, they were less likely to have had the tumors spread to the lymph nodes. Metaplastic tumors also tended to have a higher grade and to be ER/PR-negative. As a result, women with metaplastic breast cancer appeared to be more likely than women with typical invasive breast cancer to have a mastectomy and chemotherapy.

      "Content": "Hi Cherie, I found some more stuff online for you, included below.  In looking thru articles I have seen that women are being treated with the same drugs as for other invasive carcinomas, but because this is a more aggressive cancer, the treatment needs to also be more aggressive.  Expect that your doctors will be recommending maximum doses, as well as maximum radiation.  If they DO NOT seem to be approaching this cancer aggressively, I would recommend you get a 2nd opinion, from a major cancer treatment center if possible. I wish you well - please let us know how things go. Sincerely, Tre http://metaplasticbreastcancer.org/  (This site has stories from survivors - Marcia's story has a lot of good info on getting thru chemo, finding help, etc:  http://metaplasticbreastcancer.org/?p=21#more-21 ) talks about metaplastic breast cancer and gives phone #'s for Y-ME: http://www.y-me.org/information/types_of_breast_cancer/metap discussion page on this type BC, lots of links and some names of docs http://community.breastcancer.org/topic/72/conversation/6986 Susan G. Komen Foundation site about getting support http://cms.komen.org/Komen/AboutBreastCancer/Support/3-7-4-1 (has recommendations and a phone # for Komen breast care helpline which works to help women find support locally) The following is an excerpt from a Cancer Compass message thread about metaplastic breast cancer in 2004.  The thread is 7 pages long - I skimmed through for info that might help you, and found this - might be worth asking about: \"If the tumor can been removed surgically from the breast and has not metastasized, all the literature we have found says that conventional chemotherapy (such as adriamycin-cytoxin then taxotere), plus radiation, has a good chance to prevent recurrence. If it does reappear in the lungs, consider early surgery, which is risky but may be completely curative if done early enough. There is new evidence the p-63 gene is active in metaplastic cancers. This gene is also active in non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\") and certain other cancers. NSCLC is the most common form of lung cancer from smoking. The latest thinking seems to be that drugs for NSCLC, such as Iressa is hoped to be, may also work for metaplastic breast cancer that has metastasized. One promising new treatment combination is Avastin with Tarceva. Another promising combination seems to be Avastin plus Abraxane. This is pretty technical, but here is a web site with references on what is known about p-63 to date: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene&cm \"",

      "Content": "  On 11/14/2008 lyrjunky wrote: Hello all, I'm new to this message board and hopefully I can get some help from all of you.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 9/18, had lumpectomy and lympnodes removed on 9/24.  The area around the lump was negative and so was the lympnodes.  I'm a stage IIa, IDC, grade III.  I'm on six rounds of chemo every 21 days.  I'm on Taxotere and Cytoxin.  I had my second round two days ago and while I was there the nurse told me I would progressively get worse probably after treatment 4 or 5.  To be honest, I'm quite terrified I will get worse after the second treatment, the first one I thought was bad as I could barley get out of bed on Sat and Sun.  How can it get much worse than that?  I was also weak for the next four days after that.  Can anyone shed some light on how bad these chemo's get after each treatment.  You'll help will be much appreciated.  Thanks you,  Laurie Hi Laurie, I was on Taxol (which is very mild) and Adriamycin (which can be quite nasty) - not quite what you are on, but maybe I can give you some encouragement.  I slept a LOT when I was getting chemo.  I tried to continue working as much as possible - but had  a few days where I went to work and had to go home after 2 - 3 hours, and then I went to bed and there I stayed the rest of the day. Thus I learned that I could count on 2 days when I was useless, and the next 2 or 3 weren't great. Fortunately I have a great partner, and she was there for me every step of the way, cooking, cleaning, making sure I had what I needed. I started on prednisone with my first treatment, but had SEVERE hallucinations, so said no more.  The next round we tried dexamethasone - same result, so I did my last two treatments without any steroids at all.  I just made sure to take some tylenol before treatment, and keep it up afterward - that really helped.  I had a lot of nausea - found that purple grape juice helps, ginger ale helps, but the best is cola syrup - there are still some old time drug stores and grocery stores that sell that. I realized after the third treatment that the Neupogen was contributing heavily to the nausea, so I stopped taking it - fortunately I only had one more treatment so wasn't that much at risk white cell wise.  Food also tasted really bad, and I didn't have much appetite.  Again, the purple grape juice helped, and I learned to avoid spices, as they just made the food taste worse. I started losing my hair right after the second treatment.  I had known this would happen, and had a plan.  Soon as the hair started coming out, we had an after hours party at my hair stylists salon - I had her give me mohawk before she totally buzzed my head, and we did goofy things with the mohawk, took pictures, ate some pizza, and then bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz - my bald head was just as soft and smooth as a baby's bottom.  Stayed that way for another 4 months! I only went through 4 months of chemo, but I know that I could have done another 2 months, or even another 6 months, if that was what they thought was needed.  Yes, being sick was hard (and having worked for 16 years as a nurse, sometimes taking care of patients getting chemo - I know that you probably WILL be sicker than I was) - but in my book, the alternative - metastatic cancer, and possible loss of life - is even harder.  My cancer was a little more involved than yours - I had about half my lymph nodes removed in a 2nd surgery because there were cells in the margins of the lumpectomy. I had whopping big doses of both drugs - the max they could give me, but my oncologist is conservative, and he chose to only give me 4 treatments, followed by radiation.  I completed slightly more than half of the radiation, then quit because I was developing lymphedema and I knew if it got worse it would interfere with my ability to work, and I couldn't afford that.  I remained \"cancer free\" for almost the magic 5 years - 2 months shy of 5 years we discovered nodules in my lungs, and it took another 3 months and surgical biopsy of my lung to get a definitive diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. I have used alternative treatment and am now in remission, but realistically I know that I can now NEVER stop fighting cancer; while I may have the cell growth stopped, and perhaps even reversing, I must always consider the possibility that there are still cells spread thruout my body, just waiting for my internal enviroment to once again become condusive to growth.  So, I have wondered if it might not have been better to have chemo for longer, and for me to have finished radiation.  I don't dwell on it, as I will never have that answer.  But it does lead me to encourage others to persevere through the difficulties of treatment. It is much more possible to eradicate cancer at stage I, or II, or even III, than it is to treat stage IV.  If a person gets to stage IV, there can be remission, but for the great majority of people, there is no eradication, and there is no going back. So my advice to you is to persevere. You've started the chemo, so stay with it if you can - to quit early would not be to your advantage unless you are willing to immediately step into an alternative treatment.  (Natural treatments do not have the nasty side effects, but they take longer to be effective, and take the same discipline to continue as do conventional treatments.)   Try to find a local cancer support group. They  can give you advise on how to cope with being sick, and might even be able to send people to help with stuff when you are sickest. The other thing to do is mark a calendar with a treatment countdown, including not only your last treatment date, but another 3 weeks for recovery.  At the end of each day, or the next morning, mark the past day off - and do a little happy dance to celebrate one more day that you do not ever have to repeat again, but also to celebrate one day closer to being cancer free!!  If you do decide you can't do this chemo, talk to your dr about the possibility of doing a chemo regimen that won't make you so sick. And if you decide you just can't finish the chemo at all, PLEASE check into alternative therapies. www.cancertutor.com www.lefcancer.org www.alkalizeforhealth.net THere are herbs and supplements that can help you get through chemo by relieving the side effects.  I am not immediately familiar with what helps with taxotere and cytoxin - I am hoping some others will reply with those answers.  If not, try doing an online search for herbs/naturals that counter side effects of chemo.  Just make sure to check with your oncologist before you start taking anything, as some naturals can counteract or interfere with the chemo. Be sure to drink plenty of pure fresh water.  Steam distilled or reverse osmosis filtered is best.  You not only need hydration, but you need to be able to detoxify your body from the chemo. Drinking lots of water is absolutley essential for both. I wish you the very best. Tre  ",

      "Content": "The breast do normally produce some secretions on a routine basis. This keeps our tissues well lubricated and easily movable.  It is such a tiny amount that usually we don't notice it. If something happens to stop up one or more of these glands, it can make the breast feel \"itchy\", and the secretions will build up - they can look kind of yucky when finally expressed.  Using an exfoliating soap about once a week can help prevent this from happening.  However, yes - sometimes this is a symptom of breast cancer, or pre-cancerous breast changes.  I wouldn't go all crazy right now thinking that you have cancer - after all, you don't know that you DO, you don't know that you don't.  Certainly make an appt with a dr for a breast exam, and get a mammogram.  (If you don't have insurance to cover the mammogram, ask your dr if he can point you to a charitable organization that provides for free mammograms in your community.) sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Versed is a great drug, and very commonly used for pre-operative sedation and to start putting someone under anesthesia.  It is chemically a cousin to valium, but much stronger and more effective.  It has ultra short-action, which means it's very easy to control and reduces the chances of over-medication from too many drugs.  It has potent anti-anxiety, hypnotic, anti-seizure, and sedative properties. It acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant (but does not affect the diaphragm, lungs or heart) and also acts as an amnesiac: people given Versed are very unlikely to remember anything from the time the drug takes effect (which is within just a few minutes after it is given), until they are awakened in the recovery room, which makes it a wonderful choice to accompany anesthesia. It also has relatively few side effects and is well-tolerated by most people when used for surgery or procedures like dental extractions, colonoscopy or other scoping procedures, etc,  which makes it a good drug choice.    I have both administered it to patients myself when I was working in nursing, and received it myself for a number of operative procedures - I've found it to make surgery a much more pleasant experience for a patient than one might expect.  Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Hi Partner,  Your wife is grieving - this is pretty normal for women with breast cancer when they realize the statistics on breast cancer, and have to come face to face with the fact that this thing could kill them.  I know - I've been there, and as a nurse took care of many other women who've been there, too. So it's good that you support your wife, and understand that she needs time to grieve.  But don't let her grieve too long - she really needs to embrace the fact that she isn't dead yet, that she doesn't have an expiration date stamped anywhere on her body, and that MANY women successfully beat this thing through acts of will, sheer determination, and taking on a lifestyle that creates an inner body terrain NOT conducive to growth of cancer. The temptation for many husbands would be to say,\"come on, I need you, the children need you.\"  I recommend rather than saying that, that you and the children gently invite her back into the fabric of your lives. Ask to sit down with her and keep her company while you read a book, or have the girls go to her and ask to sit down with her while they do their homework. Gentle reminders like this from her family will help her recognize that she has much to contribute, and that partaking in the life of her family is much more fulfilling than hiding herself away.   Also, let her know that you find her attractive, that you want to hold her in your embrace, and that you are all in this together. Make her feel wanted and loved, in a very gentle way.  Reaffirmation of her place in your heart will help her to regain confidence that she can help meet the needs of the family.  Let her know that when she's tired, you and the kids are there to help.  Fix her some snacks - favorite foods that she likes, and sit and share them with her.  Concentrate on simple non-demanding things that will help her focus on the here and now, rather than what could be.  I hope this helps. Please make sure to take good care of yourself, also. Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Congratulations on your scan results! It's so wonderful to hear others talk about their success against this nasty beast!  The standard treatment period for Arimidex is 5 years, but there have been some long-term studies released that show both Taxifen and Arimidex may only be effective for 3 1/2 to 4 years.  After that, any cancer that may have survived seems to become resistant to the drugs.  Aromatase inhibitors like Aromasin haven't been in use long enough to have long-term study results yet. I cannot take the anti-estrogen drugs - they make me very ill - so when I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer to the lungs in early 2008, I started my own natural/herbal anti-estrogen/anti-cancer regimen.  I was able to put the cancer into remission - my scan just before Thanksgiving of last year really looked good.  I think that the anti-estrogen drugs can be boosted complementarily with foods, herbs and supplements to really sock it to individual spots of cancer that may have been carried throughout the body, thus hopefully eliminating them before they have time to become drug resistant.  At the very least, taking selenium, zinc, magnesium, calcium, manganese and vitamin D-3 can help to provide your body with the immune system and cancer-fighting building blocks needed to stay in remission.  I have listed the dosages for these, plus a whole host of other easy, inexpensive natural cancer-fighters in my blog, plus you can read my story there also. my story http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor my regimen http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers Even doing something as simple as taking one aspirin a day can help to block production of the prostaglandins our bodies need to produce estrogen.  There are a lot of other natural choices that I have not listed on my blog:  e.g. resveratrol in low doses may act as an estrogen-blocker.  (I chose not to use it supplementally due to cost, but have been getting small amounts of resveratrol through eating red, black or purple grapes, and in 3 - 4 ounces of red wine daily.) There is a great book by Susun Weed, a lady with a quite esoteric take on life, but truly an expert on herbs:  Breast Cancer? Breast Health  I think this book is well worth reading through for wonderful suggestions on how to maintain breast health both while someone is taking the anti-estrogen drugs, and once that therapy is complete.

      "Content": "Yes, living in an estrogen depleted state (as happens with the anti-estrogen drugs, or menopause, or the type of natural treatment I've been using) certainly can color our emotions and responses to life situations!!  Many women who go thru menopause will then either deliberately or incidentally find foods, and/or supplements to make them feel better, and life evens out for them and they learn to live with the changed hormonal state.  Unfortunately for those of  maintaining a chemically induced menopause for treatment of/stopping recurrence of breast cancer, we can't resort to those things which make us feel better, either because the drugs prevent it, or we choose to avoid them because of the phytoestrogens they contain. Having worked as an RN for many years and taking care of a wide variety of oncology patients both in hospitals and through home health, I was well aware of the seriousness of breast cancer when I was diagnosed in 2002.  I approached both my surgeon and oncologist very matter of factly - I wanted to know everything - no sugar coating for me. I was surprised, and a little skeptical, when they both told me that the time was soon coming when cancer would be considered a chronic illness rather than a terminal disease, and would be treated with long-term medications just as diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease were already being treated.  I had a little bit of a hard time accepting their idea of \"living with cancer\" - I didn't want to live with cancer - I wanted to be cancer free. With time and perspective, my way of thinking has changed. I guess that started when my first surgery confirmed it was stage II cancer, and I then had to have another surgery to take out more lymph nodes due to the presence of cells in the margins. When a  little over five years after my last radiation treatment I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in my lungs, I realized that my attitude had continued to change tremendously.  While I still wanted to be cancer-free, realistically I knew that might never happen, yet if it could be put in remission, I might have many more happy, healthy years to spend with my partner, and that became my focus. THe idea of \"living\" with cancer, and treating it like a chronic disease was no longer an idea I rejected.  I still decided I would do my very best to try and eradicate it totally, but would be happy to hear scan results of stability and no new growth. (Which is indeed what I heard this past Thanksgiving - WHEW!!!) I have learned over the past year and a half, that every day that I live with cancer - whether it is active, or in remission - is one more day that I am a survivor, that I have the opportunity to enjoy what I have worked hard to create, regardless of what my limitations may be.  Whether I accept each day as a gift and make the most of it, or let circumstances drag me down, is totally up to me. And I choose to survive.  I choose to LIVE, even if it means living with cancer. And regardless of whether I'm around another 5 years, or another 45 years, I hope that every day of it will be about living, rather than about dying. Sincerely, Tre",

Your iron supplement probably isn't doing you much good.  The human body can only really absorb about 18 mg of supplemental iron a day.  Much better to try eating foods that are rich in iron PLUS a lot of other elements, such as antioxidants, the B vitamins, vitamins C, D and E.  Lots of calcium and other trace minerals.  The closer you can get to a vegetarian diet, the more likely you are to be eating foods that will provide the essential nutrients that have been bleached out of your body by all the treatments. Also important to make sure you're drinking plenty of fresh  pure water.  Hydration is key to rebuilding the blood stream and immune system, as well as detoxification of all the by-products of chemo and cancer cell death. Unless you are on a blood thinner, green and black tea are excellent choices for detoxification - get decaf, so that you aren't peeing out all the fluids when you drink. Eat plenty of fruit - an apple a day, any kind of berries (avoid pomegranate if you had hormone positive cancer,) citrus fruits and tomatoes.  Avoid bananas - they have way too much sugar in them.  Green leafy veggies, cruciferous veggies, and legumes (whole grains and beans) are vital.  Eat as much organic raw fresh foods as you can. Also make sure you are getting enough essential fatty acids.  Many people recommend flax seed oil or fish oil, but I think those need to be used with caution.  Flax seed oil is very high in phytoestrogens - if you had a hormone positive cancer, this might not be a good choice.  I'm also concerned about fish oil because of the extreme pollution in all of earth's bodies of water.  Roasted pumpking seeds are a delicious, nutritious alternative - a handful a day will provide ALL the omega fatty acids an adult needs per day, plus 14 gm plant protein.  I have a recipe for roasting green pumpkin seeds on my blog:  http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/search?q=pumpkin+seeds There are also articles on the B vitamins, vitamin c, supplements, etc, etc, etc.  Please feel to read anything that interests you.  Take a look at the recipe for lemon volcano drink (enter that in the blog search box to get that article.)  It is really nutricious and an EXCELLENT detoxifier.

      "Content": " although PET scans are supposed to be the most definitive diagnostic tool for cancer, scan results can include multiple false negatives AND positives.  I was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in 2002.  Lumpectomy, revision of lumpectomy, 4 mos of chemo, and completed half of radiation treatments before developed lymphedema and subsequently stopped the radiation.  Started Tamoxifen - made me very sick after just a few doses so I stopped taking it; tried Arimidex with same result.  Went 5 years with negative mammograms and breast exams.  Last fall found multiple very small nodules in my lungs on CAT scan for an entirely different problem.  Oncologist felt they were most likely benign, something other than cancer, but we did the PET scan anyway.  Based on inconclusive results of PET scan my doc said he was positive that it was not metastatsis, I should not worry, we would rescan in 4 months just to make sure, and I could get a 2nd opinion if I wanted. Got that 2nd opinion, many more tests, and surgical biopsy/removal of one of the pulmonary nodules.  Guess what - metastatic breast cancer, stage IV.  The PET scan was wrong - had I not sought 2nd opinion would have been at least another 4 months allowing the cancer to grow unchecked.  PET scans can also have false positives - areas of infection and inflammation can produce the same lighting up effect that the dye gets from tumors.  Many people have had biopsies based on PET scan results just to find that they have an infection or inflammatory process instead of cancer or even a benign tumor.  Good news to get, but expensive and painful and SCARY process.  The moral of my story:  at the very least I would ask the dr to explain the metabolically active nodes, and why he didn't tell  you about them.  You have a right to know ALL that is revealed by tests, regardless of whether the dr thinks it is important or not.  If you do not get a satisfactory answer from your dr, seek a 2nd opinion.  Even if you do get a decent answer but still have concerns, seek a 2nd opinion.  Your life is too valuable to risk just because some guy or gal chooses to make light of your concerns, and as was the case with my oncologist (whom I really like and actually is a heck of a nice guy) is caring enough but wrong:  doctors can and do make mistakes.  The good news is that even though treatment with Herceptin takes longer and may be scary, statistical results are showing that it is a much more effective treatment than any other chemotherapeutic or anti-estrogen or estrogen-blocking drug currently on the market.  You might want to take a look at Ty Bollinger's book Cancer: Step Outside the Box.  Available on the internet, and if you can't afford it, send Ty an email and he will send you a copy of the e-book for free, no strings attached.  The book is A real eye opener about cancer treatment and big  pharmaceutical companies.   Also has many helpful suggestions and references for natural cancer treatments,  ALL of which have much higher success rates than traditional  surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Be pro-active for yourself - if you aren't, no one else will be either! .On 6/1/2008 kah49 wrote: Hi, I am new to this, but I was wondering if I could find answers here. I was diagnosed with invasive lobular breast cancer in Nov, 07, and it had spread to my lymph nodes. I had a mastectomy, had full body PET scan and was told that everything was normal. I have just completed chemo and about to start radiation. I was also diagnosed as HER2+ and have started the Herceptin. My question is, I got copies of some of my test results, and the report on my PET scan says that it is abnormal. There are 3 \"metabolically active nodes\" in and around the area of my mastectomy. My dr has not mentioned them and I was wondering if this means cancer or can it be something else? It will be 2 more weeks before I see the dr again and it's got me a little worried.

      "Content": "  On 7/11/2008 cookieT wrote: I had bi-lat mastectomy 5 months ago. I had drain in for 6 weeks on left side. Since the surgery, I've had a large swelling just under where my left breast had been. The surgeon didn't really make much comment after I asked him what it was and if it would go away. He just said \"Maybe in about 6 months it will be gone.\"  The GP doesn't know what to tell me either. It is very uncomfortable.  I cannot wear my prosthesis  because the mastectomy bra irritates the \"bulge\".  I had not planned to have reconstruction  surgery. The bulge is hard. It doesn't seem to be fluid-filled. It feels like muscle but the doctors are not saying that it is.  If anyone has had a similar problem after mastectomy, could you please let me know if you have found out what this could be. I don't feel comfortable going out in public without my prosthesis, yet, I cannot wear it.   This bulge could be a collection of lymph fluid that was meant to be lodged where your breast was but has shifted.  (Surgeons deliberately leave avenues open for lymph fluid to collect in the spaces where they removed tissue, as this promotes healing and also leaves less of a permanent hole.)  If so, it very well may reabsorb and be gone in 6 months. However, 5 months is a long time for this problem to have not resolved, so you are right to be concerned. The bulge could be several other things, including foreign material accidently left in your body during surgery - if so, it will cause more serious problems as time goes on.  It could also be a sterile abcess, with a hard core of inflamed tissue surrounding it.  It could even be a growth, altho that is highly unlikely as they should have seen it when they were operating. Did your surgeon or GP order a CT scan of this bulge?  If not, ask them to do so.  If they say that is unnecessary or won't reveal anything, get a 2nd opinion.  (YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT, and your insurance should pay for it.)  At the very least, a CT scan should show if this is tissue or fluid, or a foreign object.  If it is tissue, they will need to determine if it its scarring or an undesirable process - that may involve a needle biopsy or further scanning.  If it is fluid, they probably need to get a needle sample and find out if it is lymph or infection. If it is something left in there during surgery, it needs to be removed ASAP, and you need to ask them why this was allowed to happen. It could also be is a hematoma - a collection of blood that didn't drain thru the drain, and hasn't yet been re-absorbed by your body.   Actually, this is quite likely the case, especially if it is right where the drain was.  Again, someone needs to find out exactly what this is, and scanning, or perhaps even xray, should reveal a hematoma.  If it is a collection of old blood, leaving it alone may be ok, as long as they try to determine if you are still bleeding, or if this indeed just old blood.  If it is a hematoma, they need to also monitor your blood work for infection.  Many hematomas will re-absorb over time, but if they are pressing on other tissues they can cause problems other than pain - infection is a possibility. Last but not least, the bulge could in fact be muscle that has pulled away from where it was tacked during surgery.  I imagine you would have felt at least some pain had this happened, but with a drain in and everything else going on, you might not have noticed.  Again, a CT scan should reveal if this is muscle. So .....  if your docs are just shaking their heads and saying wait and see, don't let them get away with that.  If you've had scans, etc, and they still don't know what it is, ask them about doing a needle biopsy.  This sounds painful, and probably will be, but still better to know what's going on than risk a worse problem.  And if you do all this and it turns out to be something benign and very temporary, then at least you will have the peace of mind of knowing it will go away. Ok, now about self image and getting out of the house.  Yeah, I imagine this bulge is very disconcerting. You've had a major change in the way your body looks, and you want to do everything you can to look normal and resume your life. If your drs are men, they really may not understand how devastating it can be to lose a breast, and not be able to compensate for it, so to them, especially if the bulge is not painful in and of itself, finding out what this bulge is does not take on the urgency it does for you. If your docs are men, you might consider consulting with a woman surgeon or gp.  That's not meant to be a sexist comment - as a woman having had breast cancer and other problems specific to women, I have often found that I get better treatment from female docs because by virtue of their own physiology and experience they have a better understanding of the female patient's problems. If you are sufficiently healed and don't have any other medical problems that would prohibit this, try exercising with a rebounder (mini-trampoline,)  See this web page for explaination:  http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm If you want to try it, see if you can find a health spa or physical therapist who has one and will let you come in and try it for a few minutes, or a few times, before you actually buy one.  (You can get an inexpensive yet sturdy model for about $40 at some of the bargain department stores.) GENTLE bouncing may help this bulge reabsorb.  Start slowly, and work your way up to longer times and doing it more often.  Again, bounce gently - without making your feet leave the mat.  Your calves will hurt the first couple of times you do it, but that should go away as your leg muscles get used to it and begin to tone up. Exercising with a rebounder should also be good for your healing in general. And, it is FUN!!!  And the best benefit is that it not only promotes good circulation and lymph drainage, but it will actually help to break up scar tissue - if this bulge is from scarring, rebounding and manual massage will be your best friends!!!! If you want to go out in public, wear a loose baggy  t-shirt. and  a large funny or silly hat.  That will emphasize less that you've had a mastectomy, and the hat will draw attention away from the rest of your body. And don't worry about being bra-less:  lots of clinical data indicates that constricting garments such as bras may actually contribute to breast cancer and lymphedema, so by not wearing a bra you may actually be helping yourself to be healthy!!  Be proud of what you still got!, and if people stare and make you very uncomfortable, turn the table on them.  Ask em \"whats the matter, haven't you ever seen anyone with only one boob before?\" or maybe \"hey, don't you like my hat?\" ( or if you want a really good laugh,  don't say anything - just imagine telling them \"and I eat little children, too!\"  They'll think you're laughing at them, and they'll leave you alone.) There is no reason we should have to submit quietly to other people's thoughtlessness, and that's all their staring is  - unwillingness to consider someone else's feelings. (A friend of mine  had a large 3rd degree burn on her leg and had to wear shorts and a huge gauze wrapping on her leg in the middle of the winter.  Lots of people gawked at her, so she started to use these tactics, and it worked.  She actually did say the \"little children\" thing out loud to  a woman who knew her children were staring and making extremely rude comments but wouldn't stop them!  The woman couldn't rush her children away fast enough, and my friend chuckled about it for weeks, which helped her get through the trauma of dealing with the burn!!!  I still chuckle about it more than 10 years later!  Laughter is indeed good for the soul!) I hope my thoughts have helped, and that I at least may have made you laugh.  But seriously, don't stop with your dr's comments that they don't know and wait and see.  Make them truly diagnose it, or see another doc.

      "Content": "Hi Bonnie, Hard to answer your questions, not knowing more about your situation.   If you had the biopsy done at a very small medical center, they may actually send a lot of biopsy samples to another facility for evaluation.  If you had it done at a larger center that deals with cancer a lot, then I would say probably not so often that they send samples out. However, it is good that they are checking with someone else if they have the least concern as to what this is.  Better to have to wait a little longer for test results that are reliable, than to be given a hasty result that might not be accurate. As to lumpectomy or mastectomy, that will depend a lot on your biopsy result.  If this is a slow growing, high grade cancer, depending upon where it its in your breast, how big it is, and at an early stage, most likely lumpectomy is sufficient.  If it's a faster growing and/or more invasive cancer, or a low grade cancer, they may want you to have a mastectomy regardless. (I know many people are confused about the difference between grade of cancer and stage of cancer - most people think they are the same thing, but they're not.  Grade of cancer means how highly differentiated the cells are - the more differentiated, the easier the cancer is to treat, and the higher it will be graded.  So a grade 4 cancer is much better to have than a grade 0 cancer.  Differentiated means how well-formed the cells are and how specific the cells are in development.   Stage of cancer indicates how advanced it is - whether it is  just in one spot, or has begun to move/spread to other parts of the body.  The lower the stage number, the better the situation - you want to hear stage 1, 1a, or 1b, as opposed to stage 2 or higher.) I personally lean toward breast conservation for women.  I think taking more tissue than you have to begs for trouble in terms of recovery and function thereafter, not to mention self - image. But I also think (to borrow the comments of several other posters to the board!):  it's just boobs.  You can replace the girls, but you can't replace your life.  For women who have a very fast growing, agressive cancer - perhaps best to try to clean it all out with a mastectomy right then and there, rather than waiting to see if they got clear margins around tissue removed with a lumpectomy.  There also is the matter of genetics - women who are diagnosed with oncogene for breast cancer might do well to have the entire breast removed.  (I am assuming that is NOT you, or you would have mentioned it??) Please let us know when you get your results back.  If it's really good news, we will all be glad to do the happy dance with you.  If it's not so good news, there are plenty of really good people who participate on the site and can give you great support as you move on through treatment.

      "Content": "Hi Kathy, I'm happy to explain \"hypermetabolic nodes,\" but before I forget, I want to say that since this PET was done BEFORE chemo and radiation, the previous state of these nodes quite possibly has changed, and therefore should be considered in comparison to a current PET. PET scan measures metabolism, the process by which cells use sugar to produce energy. Hypermetabolic means those cells are metabolising more sugar than is normal for that type of cell. This is important in terms of cancer diagnostic because cancer cells have a much higher metabolic rate than healthy cells, thus they \"light up\" the PET scan.   Understanding uptake will help, also. The very slight amount of radioactive sugar they give with a PET scan is very quickly and highly absorbed by cancer cells, and certain other cells with a high metabolism,  whereas normal cells pretty much leave it alone. Physiologic uptake would mean that the cyst cells absorbed the sugar, but were not exhibiting a high metabolism. This can happen with inflammation - places where the body is fighting an infection or disease process other than cancer will quite often show increased uptake of the sugar because those cells are more active and do have a higher need for energy, but not the WAAAAAY high metabolism of cancer. (Is why PET scans can show both false positive and false negative results.) Would be reasonable for the doc to say the cyst does not represent cancer. As for the 2 nodes were labelled as \"hypermetabolic\" in a region with known cancer, their small size might make it difficult to really determine what was going on with them. Lymph nodes often just are too small to take up enough of the sugar to really light up the PET scan.  Sounds like the radiologist was trying to say that these nodes possibly have something going on because they have higher metabolic activity, but the scan results were not enough to say they had cancer in them. (Remember, the lymph system is the garbage disposal of the body - the increased metabolic activity could have come from cancer cells in the nodes, or it could have come from the nodes attempt to carry away infection or inflammation, or even the byproducts of muscular activity.) So, since you've had chemo and radiation  - those two nodes may now present a significantly different picture.  You didn't say how long ago you had your treatment - most doctors wait 4 - 6 months after treatment before doing another PET, to allow time for all the after effects to diminish and not be picked up by the scan. (Some docs say 3 months is sufficient - this would probably be dependant on the type of chemo and amount of radiation.) You might want to ask about having another PET scan to see what those nodes are doing now.   This would give you an opportunity to see if the cyst is still taking up the sugar. If it is, and the dr still doesn't think it's cancer, ask him if you need treatment for an inflammatory process in that ovary  - antibiotics, etc.  Sometimes ovarian cysts resolve by themselves, sometimes they need some help. If you are having pain in that ovary, I certainly would insist that something be done about it.  No sense hurting if you don't have to.  I hope I've been able to make this a little clearer than mud!  And I wish you the best with these issues.

Here's the problem.  After a PET scan, I had swelling on my right side.  I could feel the swelling under my arm as well as in my right breast (implant).  It gradually went down by itself after about 3 weeks.  Well, a couple of months later, after my last chemo treatment, I have the swelling again as well as pain off and on. Has anyone else experienced this? Sounds to me like you have lymphedema.  How long ago did you have the lymph nodes removed?  You could be having problems with connective tissue as well, especially if your bra is interfering with tissue movement and circulation. Take a look at these sites: lymphedema http://www.lymphnet.org bras and breast cancer http://www.007b.com/bras_breast_cancer.php rebounding http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm If it is lymphedema or a connective tissue problem, exercising with a rebounder (36\" mini trampoline) can help.  If you use a health club, see if they have one you could try, or you can purchase one (department stores sell them for $30 - $60 - you wouldn't need one of the more expensive ones.)  By simulating weightlessness, rebounding promotes circulation and loosens scar tissue, restores connective tissue health.  The exercise frequencies recommended on the alkalizeforhealth site are perhaps a little excessive. Gentle bouncing (your feet don't even need to leave the mat)  for 3 minutes 2 - 3 times a day is often and long enough for all but the most severe conditions, although a longer duration or more frequent use should not be a problem as long as you have no other health conditions that would restrict or prohibit bouncing. Your calves will hurt at first until you get used to it - a good way to get around that is to alternate bouncing with just walking-in-place on the mat. ALSO, Have you talked to your surgeon and oncologist about this?  If not, you should.  If it is any one of the possible problems I mentioned, they can be treated with exercise, physical therapy, natural healing medicines, etc.  However, my  biggest concern is that this might be a complication related to the implant, and that's why you need to get the docs to check it out.  The public is told that implants are now much safer than they were 10 years ago, but there are still women who are having serious complications - don't take the risk of becoming one of them. This could also be cellulitis (an infection of the tissues that can sometimes come and go, but still is very serious.) Talk to your doctor(s) - if they say it is nothing, don't settle for that. Insist that they do at least an ultrasound or CT scan to check it out, take a look at your blood work,  and/or send you to physical therapy for treatment. If they still say it is nothing, that you should just ignore it, insist on a referral for a 2nd opinion.  This is too important to ignore. I wish you a speedy answer and a speedy recovery.

I don't know if you looked into using a rebounder.  If you haven't, i really highly recommend trying it.  It really does work ro mobilize the lymphedema so it will go to your kidneys and be processed the way it should. Plus the fact that you're going thru treatment again.  You're probably not going to feel like exercising, but you will need to if you want to minimize toxins from the treatment and maximize circulation.  Using a mini trampoline can do those things for you without taking a lot of energy and time.  Just set a timer for 3 - 4 minutes and gently bounce - I watch tv while I do my rebounding.  Doesn't always make sense to the highly analytical part of my brain that this type exercies could be a good answer, but by sticking to it I am proving to myself that it is.

      "Content": "skin care certainly can be a problem for those who are keeping themselves estrogen depleted to treat or prevent recurrence of cancer.  I would imagine that you are looking for both cleansing and moisturizing products. I think your best choice might be a moisturizing soap produced locally using herbs, olive oil, and/or goat's milk. I would talk to someone at your local health food store or herb shop - they are most likely to have information on local soap makers. Also, check at any craft fairs/booths in the area or at the mall that might be  selling stuff for Christmas - you might even be able to get some small samples there.  These products may be more expensive than the bar soap and lotions you buy at the store, but they may also last somewhat longer, thus offsetting the price.  My local health food store sells a generic olive oil soap - that's all it is.  I haven't tried it, but the owner highly recommends it.  Emu oil is a wonderful moisturizer, and a totally natural product. (Not for use if you have objection to using animal products.)  Initially expensive, but a few tiny drops are sufficient to cover large areas of skin, and a tsp put into warm bath water will moisturize the entire body.   An emu/goat's milk soap and/or creme would be a wonderful choice.  You might also check out products intended for those who suffer from eczema, seborrhea or psoriasis.  Some of the national brands may be paraben free.  I do know that there are quite a few folks who make soaps/lotions/cremes for use by those with skin problems - you might find that an online search for those keywords reveals a wealth of choices. Also, some people use herbal teas on the skin for cleansing and moisturizing. A good herbalist should be able to tell you which herbs would be good for that - you may have to do some checking online about the phytosterol content of those herbs. Just off the top of my head, I believe that some people use lemon balm for this purpose, and I know that lavendar has long been used topically for skin care as well as soothing headaches and body aches. There are also people who use organic lemon juice for skin care and to keep hair healthy and shiny - that might be an avenue to check out online.   I wish you luck in your search.  Please feel free to send me a reply if you find something you think would work well - I am always interested in expanding my knowledge in this area.

And a lot of drs don't mention this possibility before hand because they just don't think it's that big of a deal. Of course, most of these drs haven't had it happen to them! I believe there are some good message threads about expanders on the board - you might do a search within the site and see what you can find.  (Ignore the horror stories you might find,  and take note of the positive ones that offer constructive assistance!) I hope you are able to get this fixed with much less disruption of your life than you are currently anticipating!",

When I signed up for this site, there wasn't an option other than \"I have cancer\" or \"My parent has cancer.\"  But that's what we're facing here.  Two women with breast cancer at the same time, back to back generations.  I am 40, my Mom is 67. I can't get my head around this, other than to realize that my mother's life span is now encapsulated into a much more limited amount of time than we thought a week ago. I'm looking for help.  Any help.  Good doctors,  Homeopathic choices.  Anything.  Anything to help lift my loved ones out of the deep deep despair we are all feeling.         Dear Maui, I'm so sorry that both you and your mother are going through this. I know how you feel facing a primary cancer, and I know how your mom feels learning about metastasis not quite 5 years later (I was just a few months shy of 5 years from my last treatment when we found my metastasis.) BOth instances are heartbreaking. You will be in my thoughts. I'm going to address the possibility of complementary and/or alternative treatments for both of you, but first I want to speak to a specific statement you made, that  \"my mother's life span is now encapsulated into a much more limited amount of time than we thought a week ago.\" Please bear with me - I may at first sound like doom and gloom - just please keep reading! That breast cancer is still the #3 killer of women in the U.S. is an unfortunate fact. There are many who feel that no matter what they do, the breast cancer is eventually going to get them, and for some ladies, that certainly proves true.  But that doesn't mean that it is going to get EVERY WOMAN who has it - in fact, many women are surviving much longer than ever before, and there are a number of women who are outliving their cancer!!!!  And if you read their accounts, a large percentage of those women who are outliving the cancer attribute their success to either a combination of conventional and complementary/alternative therapies, or alternative therapies alone. SO ......  while I encourage people to look at disease realistically, I would discourage you from accepting a shortening of your mom's lifespan as a foregone conclusion! Perhaps I am a little perverse in saying this - don't mean to be - but there may be an unseen blessing in the fact that you are both embroiled in this battle at the same time:  you most likely will be of greater support to each other now than if either of you was facing this alone!  What becomes cheer for one should become cheer for the other, what becomes challenge for the one, will become a cause for support from the other. I think this will be especially true if you both embrace natural therapy in addition to whatever conventional therapy you  receive.  Many foods contain natural cancer fighters that are very effective against breast cancer. Sometimes moving toward a lifestyle that emphasizes more fruits and vegetables, supplements, herbs, can be difficult - if the two of you do it together, you have an automatic support system already in place! You have a rare form of cancer that is pretty challenging, so perhaps best if you  attack it with all the weapons at your disposal: natural therapies including diet and supplementation, plus humor (at least one good belly laugh every day will do wonders,) positive attitude, detoxification and hydration, exercise (as tolerated), whatever spiritual route you deem appropriate.  Your mother is fighting metastasis to vital organs, so I think the same approach is very necessary for her also.  There are some excellent protocols for natural therapy that can be used at the same time as chemo.  Which one(s) you might choose depends upon the characteristics of your particular cancer. (I am not as familiar with ILC as with ductal carcinoma, but I do see that it tends to be more responsive to hormonal therapies than IDC - that certainly can be taken into consideration re: diet and supplementation. )  Some of the protocols you might choose would possibly also be very effective for your mom, again depending upon the characteristics of her cancer.  So, you could be of support to each other in very specific ways that right now you don't see. The best recommendation I can give you is that you should each seek the advise/treatment by a licensed or certified naturopathic, homeopathic, osteopathic or otherwise holistic practitioner. Every person's body chemistry is different - what works for one person does not necessarily work for another. If you would seek to find complements/alternatives that you could both use, you are most likely to get that answer from a professional.  In the meantime, there are 2 very excellent sites I recommend to anyone wishing to learn more about natural therapy: http://www.cancertutor.com http://www.lefcancer.org There are also many excellent posts on both the breast cancer message board and the alternatives message board - you might spend some time looking at those. I myself use a completely natural regimen to keep metastasis in remission, as I cannot tolerate the conventional drugs which are the treatment of choice for my type of cancer. I have posted both my cancer story and my regimen on my blog - you are welcome to take a look if you would like to see how someone else has handled encountering metastasis five years out.  I talk about diet as well as supplementation, and there are some particular elements of my regimen that I have highlighted as potentially valuable to anyone with cancer. I will give you both links - you and/or you mom are also welcome to look at anything else on the blog that interests you. Please feel free to private message me if you have questions, or you can find my email address in the \"About me\"  and \"navigating\" sections of my blog. http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/08/my-stor http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/2008/09/my-pers I wish you both well,  Sincerely, Tre    ",

      "Content": "Hi Silvieann, That was an excellent reply you posted - thank you. I am not as well versed on treatment of cancers that are Her2/neu positive as I am the estrogen/progesterone positive cancers, so there certainly is a lot I can and should learn! It seems with alternative therapies options aren't always as clearly outlined in black and white as with conventional treatment. Mother nature is just so diverse, and offers us such a wonderful plenitude - it's sometimes very hard to choose. And sometimes it very definitely is a matter of listing out the good points vs the bad points, and choosing the thing that looks like it will do the most benefit for the least harm. I still personally question that very strong plant estrogens such as evening primrose oil, red clover flowers, and black cohosh, that are strong enough to relieve symptoms of menopause/restore the hormone balance to a manageable level are weak enough to act as estrogen blockers instead of replacers, but I know that many herbalists subscribe to the theory you mentioned in your post.  And I know that there is ongoing research as to whether phytoestrogens that do act as hormone replacers provide the same estrogen nourishment to cancer cells. Who knows - maybe it's a matter of quantity. (e.g. very small amounts of ground flax seed are reported in lab results to act as estrogen blockers, but some researchers question the advisability of using larger amounts of flax seed oil. a friend of mine who was eating flax seed oil in yogurt everyday to ease hot flashes was actually getting enough estrogen thru the flax oil that she started cycling again.  When she stopped eating the flax oil, she stopped cycling again. ) But obviously you are considering much more here than just phytoestrogens, and that can make all the difference in the world.  When  GLA in the evening primrose oil directly inhibits the her2 oncogene, I would think that certainly makes  it worth risking the stronger phytoestrogens in the oil. I had read some time ago that GLA was being researched in the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer - just as a neutraceutical supplement rather than in herbal preparation, and I had forgotten that evening primrose oil is so rich in that fatty acid.  And if it is able to work to such a high synergistic level with Herceptin, that is fantastic!  Sounds like whoever turned you onto the primrose oil knew what they were about in terms of prevailing against Her2 cancer. There is an added advantage for those who would choose borage oil or black currant seed oil:  they are both very rich in vitamin b-17, which works in its own way to destroy cancer.  If a person taking them wouldn't mind also boosting with papain and bromelaine (digestive enzymes found in papaya and pineapple, readily available in supplement form,) it would really help the intrinsic factors in the borage and currant get transported into the cancer cells. 2 - 3 papaya tablets chewed before meals, and 500 mg of bromelaine twice a day with meals would be plenty to help utilize the b 17. (I have not been able to find any reports on the vitamin b-17 content of primrose oil.) Based on some excellent research results in treatment of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, I used CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) in my natural regimen, in concert with grape seed extract and a daily small helping of red wine.  The two fatty acids are not the same, but they are both necessary for complete vitamin F, and I suspect that they play very similar roles in the fight against cancer.  And they certainly are nutrients that more and more people in our world are NOT getting through food, which maybe plays a part in increasing incidences of breast cancer? If you want a delicious addition to your GLA supplementation, try roasted pumpkin and/or squash seeds.  Pumpkin seeds are one of the most complete sources of essential fatty acids you can find.  About 1/4 cup of seeds contains all the omega 3's. 6's. and 9's that an adult human needs per day, in the proportions we need them, plus fiber and 14gm vegetable protein.  They are easy to prepare and keep quite well if stored in a dry airtight and dark container.  (Foods that are rich in essential fatty acids should be protected from light, as exposure to light over time will greatly decrease the nutritional value of any fat soluble nutrient.) Thanks so much for posting your info.  I wish you and Jodie well! Sincerely, Tre",

      "Content": "Current research is suggesting that Tamoxifen is only effective for 3 - 4 years, so the 5th year might be moot, anyway. also, there is some research in the works with early results that breast cancer may be adapting to tamoxifen, as is happening with other types of cancers and other drugs.  (One might question that cancer can adapt to a drug - bacteria has adapted to antibiotics and we no longer have just MRSA, but other  types of antibiotic-resistant strains starting to appear.  Cancer is a living organism just like bacteria - it does what it must to survive, so it might not be that far of a stretch that in the future we will have at least one strain of anti-estrogen resistant breast cancer)  I don't know how long Tamoxifen will continue to be one of the big anti-estrogen guns with the development of so many new drugs, but these reports suggest that quite possibly the standard recommendation for Tamoxifen will become 3, maybe 4, years instead of 5. Perhaps this kind of research finding sounds kind of grim, but it doesn't have to.  I think one of the greatest shortcomings of the medical community in dealing with cancer is that they don't emphasize building up the immune system again once someone has successfully dealt with primary cancer.  many researchers in both the traditional treatment and alternative therapy communities alike believe that all people have at least some cancer cells in their bodies on and off throughout their lifetimes. Those who have healthy immune systems are able to fight these cancer cells off and thus do not get disease.  When something happens within an individual  to weaken the immune system, cancer cells are then able to get a foothold and start growing rapidly to produce tumors, etc, and move into the lymph, blood stream, and other tissues. So, even though you are coming off the Tamoxifen, that does not necessarily mean you should just sit back and not do anything else to assure your continued health. It makes sense that anyone who has had cancer in the past should devote continued special care to their immune system to prevent recurrence.  The easiest way to do that is through nutrition - anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals, herbs, supplements and natural foods that act as natural cancer fighters. Exercise is also important, as is on-going detoxification with lots and lots of pure water, for both drinking and cooking. If you are already involved in a good self-care regimen that includes cancer-fighting nutrition, exercise and detoxification, chances are you're in pretty good shape for a Tamoxifen-free life - congratulations! If you AREN'T involved in these things, I recommend you start - staying cancer free needs to be a life-style rather than a prescription.  And it's an exciting life-style, because the things that help us to continue to fight any future cancer cells also help us to feel incredibly well! (My motto is \"kick cancer in-the-butt, every day, all the way!\") Let me know if you need help getting started in your own staying-cancer-free regimen.  I'll be glad to give you some ideas and excellent references, as I am sure other posters to this board will be also. Good luck, and congratulations on making it 4 years cancer free!!!! Sincerely, Tre  ",

For a woman who is not estrogen or progesterone receptor positive - are just needing herceptin alone, this would not matter, but for women who have to watch out for the estrogens also, I think it's certainly worth thinking about.

You can get a 36\" mini-trampoline for around $30 - 40 at discount stores like Target and Walmart, and online. Don't spend a lot of money on it - the inexpensive ones are just as good. Just make sure if you are a heavy woman that it is rated for your weight.  (Mine can handle up to 250# - is a good incentive for me to keep exercising, as I am just below that.) Lymph fluids and intercellular fluid travels by gravity - which means it all wants to go downward, and sometimes tissues don't get the drainage and lubrication they need, causing fluid retention or scarring/adhesions.  Bouncing on a rebounder induces weightlessness which will promote better circulation of fluids between cells and better circulatory removal of wastes. This can have a MAJOR impact on scar tissue.  Seems too silly to work, but it really does. And it's fun.  Gentle bouncing for 3 minutes at least twice a day is a good start - can increase as tolerated. http://www.healingdaily.com/exercise/rebounding-for-detoxifi http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/rebounder.htm Sincerely, Tre",

Better to start late than never.  I also think that massage can help a lot for cases of tough tissue - either self-massage (easily done in the shower) or by a professional massage therapist, especially one experienced in myofascial release. Take a look at this article in my blog: http://motherearthtreasurechest.blogspot.com/search?q=jiggle+the+fat The second half of the article talks about the process of scarring in our bodies and how physical manipulation can counter it.  (One of the great things about \"jiggling\" the fatter parts of one's body is that the leaner, more muscular parts are affected also, increasing circulation, lubrication, and amazingly enough, detoxification!  So even muscular areas that are affected by scarring  - such as the chest wall - can be benefitted by this type of self-treatment.) The lemon drink I mention in the first half of the article is an excellent detoxifier for any by-products of jiggling, massage, and rebounding! Best if success to you! Sincerely, Tre",

Masks the bitterness a little bit better, and not as much risk of inhaling the medication into the lungs. If that doesn't work, then yes, it should be ok to crush medicines that aren't a sustained release formula. Using a dropper is fine, or a long plastic tipped syringe.  Just be careful to not give it faster than the swallow reflex can keep up.  Also, crushed meds usually are easier to swallow if they've been mixed with a little bit of fruit juice.  Even with sugar water, most medications are still pretty bitter - the esters in the fruit will help neutralize that bitterness a little so that it will be  more pleasant to swallow. Again, if you could send me the link to previous message thread about your sister - just so I can refresh my memory on her condition, I might be able to tell you more about the implications of the liquid medications.  Sincerely, Tre",

I have recently started weight lifting as part of my 'fitter me' lifestyle but am worried that it might cause my arm to swell. I have not had any problems with my arm so far - but should I wear a compression sleeve 'just in case' or is this unnecessary?  If you haven't had any indication of lymphedema in general, or with other activities, you may not have a problem with exercise.  Compression sleeves are expensive, especially if you don't have insurance, so I wouldn't purchase one unless you notice your shoulder, arm, and/or hand swelling after the exercise. The other thing to watch for is undue fatigue in that arm.  That kind of muscle use generates a lot of lactic acid, which is what makes muscles feel tired.  while your lymph system in that arm may still be quite adequate to handle normal lymph circulation, you might have some problems with drainage of lactic acid from tissues.  Most people will experience only very transient muscle fatigue after sensible weight lifting.  If your arm has not recovered within 10 - 15 minutes, I would recommend you talk to your doctor, get the doctor to actually measure your arm and compare to the other arm to make sure you aren't developing lymph edema.

      "Content": " I forgot one thing:  You might want to consider doing MLD - manual lymph drainage (self-massage) of that arm after exercise and before rebounding.  You can probably find instructions online, or else ask your dr to give you a one-time referral to whomever in your area is skilled in MLD and can teach you how to do it.  (I learned at the rehab place where I got my compression sleeve, I don't know if insurance will cover such a visit without an official diagnosis of lymphedema, but if you can afford it, it certainly would be well-worth the cost to learn from a professional.) There might also be people at your oncology clinic who could show you how. MLD is a little time consuming, but it's easy to do and an excellent way to prevent or manage lymph edema.  Just always remember to massage from the fingertips toward the shoulder, up over the back of the shoulder to the middle of the chest, and down the front of the shoulder to the middle of the chest.  Massaging toward the fingertips or away from the middle of the chest can really increase lymph congestion, and cause undue strain on blood vessels.

I have recently started weight lifting as part of my 'fitter me' lifestyle but am worried that it might cause my arm to swell. I have not had any problems with my arm so far - but should I wear a compression sleeve 'just in case' or is this unnecessary?  If you haven't had any indication of lymphedema in general, or with other activities, you may not have a problem with exercise.  Compression sleeves are expensive, especially if you don't have insurance, so I wouldn't purchase one unless you notice your shoulder, arm, and/or hand swelling after the exercise. The other thing to watch for is undue fatigue in that arm.  That kind of muscle use generates a lot of lactic acid, which is what makes muscles feel tired.  while your lymph system in that arm may still be quite adequate to handle normal lymph circulation, you might have some problems with drainage of lactic acid from tissues.  Most people will experience only very transient muscle fatigue after sensible weight lifting.  If your arm has not recovered within 10 - 15 minutes, I would recommend you talk to your doctor, get the doctor to actually measure your arm and compare to the other arm to make sure you aren't developing lymph edema.

      "Content": "Hi Bluefootedbooby, Lumpectomy does not guarantee for anybody that the surgeon will get all the cancer, but truthfully, neither does mastectomy.   That's why they do the radiation - to catch any seeds of cancer that have broken away from the primary site into the surrounding tissues or the lymph system. While with mastectomy you might be able to avoid radiation, there are considerations other than that and reconstruction.  With mastectomy they remove a lot more tissue, and that means a lot more damage to the lymph system with the possibility of resultant problems.  Also a lot more initial challenge to the body - longer time under anesthesia, a greater chance of infection, and more demands on the body for greater tissue healing.  With lumpectomy they try not only to save breast tissue, but to keep as much of the lymph system intact as possible - the lymph system is the major cleansing network for the body - our chests need that protection. With mastectomy, that protection will be removed.  Surgeons take all that into account when they recommend breast-conservation (lumpectomy) and radiation, but I think patients have a right to be informed of those risks as well. I had a large tumor located very high in the tail of my left breast (almost totally up under the arm.  I had a lumpectomy - left quite a large divot on the outside border of my breast, but I am fortunate in that I did not need reconstruction.  We already knew I had some lymph node involvement going into surgery; unfortunately, there were cancer cells in the margins of the tissue the surgeon took out, so I had to have another surgery and have more lymph nodes removed.  After both surgeries, I made an effort to take good care of my arm, and had no signs of lymph edema going into radiation several months later. With radiation, I began to get lymphedema  - more lymph nodes were being damaged by the radiation and I just didn't have enough left to provide adequate drainage.  I chose to stop the radiation about half-way through, preferring to take my chances that the cancer might recur rather than moving forward with the pretty definite knowledge that the few remaining functioning lymph nodes I had left might also be irreversibly damaged and that I might have to live with a constant severe lymphedema.  (My livelihood depended upon use of my hands and arms - for me the choice was one of quality of life rather than quantity.) So obviously  lumpectomy is not a guaranteed easier ride for everyone, but at the outset, surgically it does present fewer risks.  And there always is the option of having more breast tissue removed in future.  However, radiation presents immediate risks other than just burning of the skin, and radiation makes future surgery possibly not go as well - that's a consideration, also. In late 2007 we found nodules in my lungs, in Feb 2008 I had a surgical biopsy with definite diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. 6 1/2 years after my breast surgeries, I am now a survivor in remission due to alternative treatment, and planning to stay that way!  My future is not guaranteed ( no one's is!), but if I had to choose again with the possibility of a different outcome, I believe I would make the exact same choices, because they were the choices that brought me the most peace then, and I am at peace with them now. Quite possibly you have a \"gut feeling\" about what you want to do, but are trying to make the most logical and well-informed choice.  But listen to your gut feeling, too; seriously take into consideration the way you \"feel\" about your choices -  sometimes our inner being has some pretty good wisdom of its own.  I wish you well with however you decide to go.  Please keep us informed of your progress.  We will offer you support, and do the happy dance with you as you get through each step!

      "Content": "Hi Lollypop. In the past I have always advised going straight to biopsy to make certain - and actually went that route myself. But in more recent days as I've continued to research diagnosis and treatment, I've come to question that \"wisdom.\" Certainly, biopsy is the only  \"sure\" way to know if cells are cancer (and even then it's not fool-proof), but biopsy in itself may present a risk that scientists and drs have been loath to consider:  specifically the possibility of taking a well-contained cancer and seeding it to other tissues. So, maybe consider taking the middle ground.  If you have the insurance coverage, get the MRI done first. That will show you if there is a really compelling reason for biopsy  - if not, then you've saved yourself some pain. If biopsy is  indicated from the MRI, you would only have a matter of several weeks delay at the most. Go with your gut feelings - do what you need to do to take prudent action while at the same time trying to minimize risk. Sincerely, Tre  ",

When I had my lumpectomy, I would have been content to just do chemo - I had already had half my lymph nodes removed and was worried about lymphedema.  But the drs really insisted that I HAD to have radiation, and I relented.  And now I DO have lymphedema, as a result of the radiation. There are plenty of ways to keep the cancer from coming back (immediately getting rid of any pockets of cells that might remain and as of yet be undetectable really is one of the keys to success.)  I think a round of treatment at the Hoxsey clinic is a good idea.  After that, a commitment to diet, supplements, exercise, and a lifestyle that promotes immune system health in my book is an excellent prescription for follow-up of your surgery.

      "Content": "Hi Paddy, It sounds like you had a message out there for me that I didn't see - I think I may have forgotten to mark that message thread for tracking. I'm sorry that you were left waiting for an answer that didn't come.  I know that can be very frustrating. I'm glad that the thing you needed to know worked out ok. Generally, people are started on the morphine elixir because either they are not well able to swallow other pain pills, or whatever  they have been getting for pain just isn't sufficient to relieve their pain. I would expect that she should be getting better pain relief with the liquid morphine, as it gets into the bloodstream faster. It will also wear off faster, so it's important that if it's time for more pain medicine and she needs it, that she not try to hold off TOO long before taking it.  It's important to try to keep her as well hydrated as possible, so that she can metabolize and excrete the drug better, thus being less likely to get snowed from it.  Also, morphine can suppress respiration, so make sure she's somewhere there is plenty of fresh air moving through, and where she can sit or lie without having her diaphragm, rib cage and lung movements restricted.  Frequent changes of position are really important when trying to offset the effects heavier sedation. I'd love to be able to tell  you something more,  but right now I just am not able to pull the details of your sister's situation to mind, and getting into my message center to look at past messages is an exercise in futility.  If you could quickly refresh my memory, and also tell me what the mg dosage is on the pain medicine (how many mg/ml), I will try to give you a better answer to your question.

My 51 sister has battled  breast cancer since 03.  In 05 it became metastasized in bones and brain.   Onto yesterday,  her Dr. put her on 2 ml of morphine every 1-2 hrs anf 2 xanax (.25 mg) every 2 hrs.  All of this has been prn.  Kelly ( my sis) is aware that this will take care of the pain, also it will make her sleep.  My \"other\" 3 sisters are aware of it also.  We are forunate to have Hospice. Our nurse will be here tomorrow.  They are on call on the weekends.  That is how we were able to start the morphine.  We were told last Tuesday that it could be anytime... are we closer than we think.  Kelly has stated that she is probably more ready for this than we are. With everything I have told you, do you have any advice?  I noticed the other night that you had been a RN. God bless for the work that you did and the work that you're doing. Hi Paddy, I don't remember if I sent you this link or not - you may have seen it from where I posted it for someone else.  If not, please take a look at it.  Sounds like much of what is in the link you already know, but sometimes it helps just to see things in writing. http://www.virtualtrials.com/btlinks/death.cfm If Kelly was just started on the liquid morphine, she probably isn't on too high a dosage, yet. So she might not have respiratory suppression, but I still imagine the morphine is going to make her very sleepy.  Which is probably a good thing, if she is hurting. As for how long she has, that's really difficult to say, especially since I'm not there to assess her condition myself.   She's been fighting mets to the bone and brain for what? 3 - 4 years? And that's just since it was diagnosed - possible that the metastasis had been there quite a while before you all found out about it. So I guess the real determinants at this stage are overall health - if Kelly's nutrition has been good, if she doesn't have any overlying problems - heart condition, kidney or liver problems,etc - if may be a matter of whether or not the metastasis in the brain is bad enough that it shuts down her heart and lungs. If not, then it might be a matter of how well she tolerates the morphine, xanax, etc. Many people that are dependant upon the high-powered narcotics succumb to the respiratory depression caused by the drugs before they succumb to the physical cancer.  Pneumonia can become a serious concern when someone is highly immobile, as can the possibility of just building up fluid in the lungs from the immobility. And it's really hard to say how long that might take, or if it will happen at all. If Kelly is at peace with this process, has given herself permission to go, and feels that she has permission from the family to go, she may go fairly quickly - but that isn't always the case.  I think the best thing to do in a situation like this is to count everyday that you have with her as a blessing. Tell Kelly you love her.  Talk with her - about anything or everything, or just nothing.  It's not the content of talking that matters, but rather the companionship.  Or encourage people to just sit with her while she sleeps.  It can be a tremendous comfort to her - even though she may be asleep, she most likely at some level will be aware that someone is there with her, and it really helps when that someone is a close loved one. Of course family can't sit with her 100% of the time, and that's what Hospice is for.  This is hard - I'm sure Kelly would like to have an end to this pain.  Just reassure her that when her body says it's time to go, then it's ok to go.  We can't know why a body doesn't quit when the mind and spirit have agreed that it's ok to go.  My grandmother will be 100 years old in one month.  She's fought Parkinson's disease for many years.  She lived by herself with aides coming in to help her with bathing and cooking up until about 2 months ago when she had a mini-stroke.  She's in a nursing home now - she doesn't like having lost her independence.  Her sister, who was her best friend, has just recently passed away.  My grandmother says that she thinks she could pass at any time now, and she is ok with that, yet her stubborn old body just keeps working!  We don't know why that is - we just know that is IS, and that's what we have to work with.  When the time is right, she will move on. It's not the same situation physically with your sister, but I think it's really the same metaphysical question:  we don't know how long it will take, or why it takes so long when they are ready to go. I wish I had a better answer for you, but all I can say is that yes, in terms of comparison to how long your sister has been fighting this cancer from first diagnosis, yes, the end is very near.  IN the matter of hours or days or weeks, I would guess that it might be a week at least, or perhaps several weeks or even longer, unless something very specific happens first to weaken her further.  And I could be very wrong .... Hang in there - this is not easy, but there will come a day that you know your sister has found release from her pain and struggle, and while that will be heart-breaking, it will also be comforting. Try to take good care of yourself, and encourage your \"other\" sisters to do the same. Sincerely, Tre  ",
