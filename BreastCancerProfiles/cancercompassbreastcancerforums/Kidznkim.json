      "Content": "I'm glad I could make you feel better. Im going to sneak my email in here and maybe you can email me before they catch it. You can find me at kidznkim on hotmail and yahoo I also have messanger. The taxatere gave me neruopathy... the numbness in your legs and the pain. I was on neurotin but it didnt help. I have learned to deal with it. Feels like little ant crawling from my calf down 24/7. I do take tylenol 3 as needed. I have two disabled children. one is 17 and in a wheelchair. So I do alot of lifting. Thats how we found the bone cancer. I thought I had pulled something in my tailbone. after a couple of months it was still there. Not a bad pain... just felt like a bruise. But because of my history and my amazing family doc he ordered me to have a bone scan. Thats when it showed up on one rib and pelvic. I had just had my 2 year check up and all my blood work was fine. Shows how much thats shows you. then a pet scan was ordered. From what I understand it will show cancer anywhere. After 3 months of hormonal treatment the oet scan showed it had shrunk in the tailbone and the spot on the rib was gone. Then this last scan had nothing on it. I still feel pain. But still like a bruise. But im like you with all the joint pain I would swear it had spread all over me. So now I have a scan in 6 months. Its so hard living like this. You just never know. My son that has autism said mon its like a volcano just dont know when it will erupt. He said it might stay dormant for a 100 years....hahaha I pray alot, I stay positive as much as I can. But I also have my nights when I just want to cry when nobody is around. My babie's need me and i will fight as long as I can. When this stops working i will have chemo again. That is something im not looking forward to. I have had all the chemo's you mentioned and cytoxin was the easiest. the other two are so hard. I havent had the xeloda. I dont know anything about that med. But as long as this is working and I pray for a long time. Im not making any changes. My oncologist, sister has been in remission 9 years from breast cancer after it had spread to her bone and liver. So I hold onto that. I would love to talk to someone that has had simular situation as mine that has been in remission a long time. Hopefully you catch my email on here... Like I said its kidznkim at either hotmail or yahoo.... same name on both. Look forward to talking to you. God bless Kim",

I had a full head of hair when I started this med. But it is thining out. Not enough for anyone to notice but still. But I have to tell you no matter the die effects I think femera is my miracle drug. That along with zometa and a lupron shot. I have done the chemo in the past so they are trying a differant treatment. After 8 months i am now in remission. SO keep taking femera. Being a woman losing our hair and breast is so hard. esp when you are young. I am 41 and going on 10 years of fighting this. But i will fight it 20 more years breastless and hairless if the medication works. get a short hair cut.. Do a cute sassy look. Thats what I did and it looks thicker. But ask your hairdresser and see what they say. But dont get down about the hair. If that goes along with the cancer....Its worth it. God bless you and hang in there Kim",

      "Content": "I did the same thing. I only took my tamoxifen for 3 years. I was gaining weight from it. Going through a divorce and I just knew I was cured cause the cancer was found so early. Although I did have my breast removed. The cancer came back 5 years later in the primary area. So it was more chemo and radiation and back on tamoxifen. Now it has spread to my bone. This all started 10 years ago when I was 31 with stage 1 cancer. I am in remission now and I make sure I take my meds everyday I dont care what the side effects are. I can only wonder if I would be still fighting this 10 years later if only I had stayed on the tamoxifen that I hated so much. I can tell you it was much easier then chemo and bone cancer. So put alot of thought into it before you decide to just not take meds. Find a doctor you trust and can beleive in. Good luck and god bless you Kim",

I got breast cancer at 31, It came back at age 36. Still in the primary area. Well last year at age 41 it has spread to my bone and one rib. I was also put on Femera and zometa (stregthens the bone) and a lupron shot every 4 months. The femera stops the cancer from feeding on the estrogen. After 3 months the spot on the rib was gone and the one on pelvic had shrunk. At 6 months I was in remssion. I am still in remission that I know of. I got back next month for a pet scan to see how everything is going. I feel about the same. Of course mentally im going nuts. Femera did make my joints hurt, thinned my hair and im tired alot. But if it keeps me in remission thats a small price to pay. I think they go for the aggressive treatment when you first have cancer. When it comes back the docs try whats working best in general. That way when that stops working you go to the big stuff. Im not sure once you have chemo now you could go back to the femera. So give it a chance. If I stay in remission for a few years on this and its working great. Alot easier then chemo. My oncologist, sister has had mets from breast cancer 9 years and in remission still. I hope this helps you some. I think the worst thing about mets is mentally. Just knowing it can come back at anytime. All we can do is pray and trust our doctors. I heard this week another med came out for advanced breast cancer, It looks very promising. We may never have a cure. But maybe we can live with it a long time. Good luck to you and god bless. But femera is working on me.",

Sorry not sure of the whole name.I was diagnosed in feb of 06. By april of 06 I was in remission and still am. I was told this was the best course of action as of now. If the cancer comes back and not aggresive there are more hormonal treatments. If it is aggressive the off to chemo I go. I have taken tamoxien in the past but it stopped working. I swear by the femera. It does have side effects, I have alot of pain in my joints. But not all have this.  I have been told that the average time femera works is 18-24 months. I will be hitting the 24 months in Feb 08. I have doc appt every 3 months. Blood woork and exam on one then pet scan on the next. Just a little encouraging news. My doc has a sister that has been in remission for 10 years now and still doing great. Hers had spread to bone and lungs. So dont give up!!  Im hearing more and more how woman can live with cancer. I would love to hear from someone that is a long time survivor of stage 4. Please post and give us hope. Good luck . But it sounds to me like you are getting great care.",

      "Content": "First thing I would suggest is a new doctor. She shouldnt have came out of that appointment with so many questions. I now have bone cancer. I have been fighting breast cancer for 10 years. Bone metts since febuary. I had two spots. one on a rib and another on my pelvis (butt). he put me on femera, zometa and a lupron shot. I am premenapausel. 3 months on these meds, the spot on my rib is gone and the one on my bottom is now a spec. Dont feel like your mom isnt going to be around. I have told this story on this site before but it gives me hope. My oncologist told me his sister had breast cancer 14 years ago, after 5 years it went to her bones. She has been in remission now for 9 years. Its not a death sentance. I dont take vitamins or do anything other then my doctor tells me to do. My biggest thing I do for myself is pray, stay positive and less stress the better. I wish there was a way I could talk to your mom. Call the american cancer society. They will hook her up with someone with the same situation that is a survivor. She will be able to talk to this person and maybe it will give her hope. But dont give into the cancer. Im going to put my email on here in case you get this and want to talk. Please feel free to email...--- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.
