First of all Kittycath let me say congratulations on being able to end taking tamoxifen. Excellent news and deserving of a great celebration. What better way to celebrate than to have a party with the the friends and family that have been such a good support system for you. I like the idea of the pill on a silver platter and washing it down with pink champagne. Sounds like your strong sense of humor has been good medicine to help you through this too. On to the soy question. I personally use almond milk which comes in natural, vanilla and chocolate. All delicious in my opinion. Because I stay away from sugar as much as I possibly can I prefer the natural and then I sweeten it with Stevia. For extra protein it was recommended I use a protein powder based on brown rice. Here's some info on the almond milk. If it should be removed because of the mention of the brand please send me a private message and I'll send the info that way. http://www.bluediamond.com/almonds/nutrition/index.cfm?l_tab Have fun at the PINK PARTY!!!!!",

My med. oncologist says that I do not need any medication because he explained that the medication may do more harm than good. My mammogram was fine. Should I worry about not taking medication? Hello Hobson.......Personally, I wouldn't worry about taking no medication. I would be thankful that your oncologist is more up to date than many. I'm sure he is aware that chemo can do more harm than it does good at times. I would advise you though to take a really close look at your diet and lifestyle and do lots of research regarding alternative medicine. It is possible that cancer comes and goes in the human body many times in a lifetime and if our immune systems are healthy and strong our \"soldiers\" are able to destroy the invader. If you do a google search on BTA testing ( Biological Terrain) and then can find a qualified naturopath or homeopathic doctor near you who does this testing, along with dark field microscopy, and follow their recommendations re diet etc., you could feel confident that you are on a better path. It is unfortunate that this forum does not allow members to contact each other by E mail. I do have a wealth of information, gleaned over the last almost three years since my diagnosis, regarding natural cancer treatments that I would love to share because I have found them successful.

In the current study, András Telekes, MD, Ph.D., head physician at the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology, and colleagues, implanted estrogen receptor-positive  (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast tumors from humans and mouse cell lines into female mice and monitored tumor growth. They compared tumor growth in mice treated with Avemar alone, or treated with three of the most widely used and studied breast cancer drugs: Tamoxifen, Aromasin, or Arimidex, alone, and combinations of those drugs with Avemar. Against the mouse ER+ cell line, MXT, Avemar inhibited growth by 50%, Aromasin by 46.7%, Tamoxifen by 34% and Arimidex by 29.3%.  Against the human ER+ cell line, T47T, Avemar inhibited growth by 49%, Tamoxifen 42%, Aromasin 25% and Arimidex 25%.  Each agent was enhanced by 5 to 10% when combined with Avemar. Most effective was a combination of Aromasin and Avemar, inhibiting both the mouse and human derived ER+ breast tumors by 60%. Effects against estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer were measured with the human derived, MDA-MB-231 cell line.  Estrogen-blocking drugs are not effective against ER- breast cancers, so they were not tested in this tumor model.  However, Avemar did inhibit the growth of the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast tumors significantly (52%), suggesting to researchers that the mechanism by which the extract works is different from that of the anti-estrogen drugs, and is independent of a breast tumor's estrogen receptor status.    Avemar's efficacy against both ER+ and ER- tumor types suggests the compound's mechanisms of action against breast cancer may be those that inhibited tumor growth in other cancers, including lung, pancreatic, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and other breast cancer lines, among others, against which the compound has also been tested. Chief among these mechanisms is its ability to interfere with the excess use of glucose by cancer cells (the Warburg effect), which interferes with the synthesis of DNA needed for cell proliferation. Avemar is produced by Biromedicina, RT of Budapest, Hungary through a patented process (US no. 6,355,474) and standardized for content of methoxy-substituted benzoquinones. The Hungarian Ministry of Health has approved Avemar as a \u201cmedical food,\u201d with an on-label indication in the treatment of colorectal and other cancers. Avemar, distributed by Blauvelt, NY American BioSciences in the US as the dietary supplement Avé, is available nationwide through vitamin retailers, doctors, pharmacies. Avemar research is available via the National Library of Medicine website, www.pubmed.gov using the search term Avemar.  http://www.npicenter.com/article/Research/Wheat-Germ-Extract    ",

I have tried various methods of pain control without success, and at present am on a high dose of slow release Tramadol, but it makes little difference.

My quality of life has never been better. I feel strong and healthy. I am not \"cured\" at this point but I have absolutely no symptoms nor do I have any fear because I have seen many long term survivors and cures of different types of cancers brought about from following the regimen that I do.

I just need a dr, anyone, who can tell me if they think this is meds.. and given my case, would it be safe to go off now...   someone told me if i've gone over 4 yrs, the meds have done what they are supposed to, but yet 5 yrs is the norm... pls can someone help me. this has ruined my life, i'm seeing a therapist monthly, on anti depressants, etc....  i truly believe going off meds would give me some relief to see if it will improve.. PLS PLS PLS HELP ME.. I have even considered a transplant and I dont know what to do... PLS help me. someone... It would probably be worth your while to do some research on Alternative treatments for cancer. Try to find a qualified naturopath or homeopathic doctor in your area who could work with you on restoring your health through natural means. It IS possible to beat cancer without chemo.

I had simple mastectomy with no radiation or chemo. I have had very mild effects with the tomoxifen, some hot flashes but no other side effects I have noticed. Tamoxifen is kind of old fashioned  but it has been thoroughly tested and is even available in generic form.I remember sone studies showed it was better than some of the new aromatase inhibitors. A scan will not show anything yet, you have to wait til the tumor is big enough to show up on the scan.  Or you take an estrogen receptor in hopes that it will keep any cancer cells left in your body from growing into a tumor big enough to either cause symptoms or show up in a scan. /I am a hospice RN as well as being a breast cancer survivor, and I deal with so many women dying of metastatic breast cancer. It is a horrible way to die especially because they can do so much for breast cancer nowadays. I will take my tamoxifen  for the next five years, thanking the Lord that I did not need radiation or chemo. If the cancer comes back I will deal with it, but I would take anything my MD advised me to take to keep my cancer from coning back.  Kay RN  My doctor is recommending Avemar for many of his cancer patients.

      "Content": "http://www.npicenter.com/article/Research/Wheat-Germ-Extract A fermented wheat germ extract inhibits estrogen positive and estrogen negative breast cancer tumors better than the world\u2019s best selling cancer drug, Tamoxifen, according to research published this past weekend at the 2007 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO.  The compound, Avemar, has been extensively studied in many cell lines, animal tumor models, and several human clinical trials. In the current study, András Telekes, MD, Ph.D., head physician at the Hungarian National Institute of Oncology, and colleagues, implanted estrogen receptor-positive  (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast tumors from humans and mouse cell lines into female mice and monitored tumor growth. They compared tumor growth in mice treated with Avemar alone, or treated with three of the most widely used and studied breast cancer drugs: Tamoxifen, Aromasin, or Arimidex, alone, and combinations of those drugs with Avemar. Against the mouse ER+ cell line, MXT, Avemar inhibited growth by 50%, Aromasin by 46.7%, Tamoxifen by 34% and Arimidex by 29.3%.  Against the human ER+ cell line, T47T, Avemar inhibited growth by 49%, Tamoxifen 42%, Aromasin 25% and Arimidex 25%.  Each agent was enhanced by 5 to 10% when combined with Avemar. Most effective was a combination of Aromasin and Avemar, inhibiting both the mouse and human derived ER+ breast tumors by 60%. Effects against estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer were measured with the human derived, MDA-MB-231 cell line.  Estrogen-blocking drugs are not effective against ER- breast cancers, so they were not tested in this tumor model.  However, Avemar did inhibit the growth of the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast tumors significantly (52%), suggesting to researchers that the mechanism by which the extract works is different from that of the anti-estrogen drugs, and is independent of a breast tumor's estrogen receptor status.    Avemar's efficacy against both ER+ and ER- tumor types suggests the compound's mechanisms of action against breast cancer may be those that inhibited tumor growth in other cancers, including lung, pancreatic, colon, melanoma, leukemia, and other breast cancer lines, among others, against which the compound has also been tested. Chief among these mechanisms is its ability to interfere with the excess use of glucose by cancer cells (the Warburg effect), which interferes with the synthesis of DNA needed for cell proliferation. Avemar is produced by Biromedicina, RT of Budapest, Hungary through a patented process (US no. 6,355,474) and standardized for content of methoxy-substituted benzoquinones. The Hungarian Ministry of Health has approved Avemar as a \u201cmedical food,\u201d with an on-label indication in the treatment of colorectal and other cancers. Avemar, distributed by Blauvelt, NY American BioSciences in the US as the dietary supplement Avé, is available nationwide through vitamin retailers, doctors, pharmacies. Avemar research is available via the National Library of Medicine website, www.pubmed.gov using the search term Avemar. Additional product information is available from American BioSciences, 888-884-7770, www.americanbiosciences.com If one reads carefully the scientific papers, it soon becomes clear that Avemar's anti-tumor and anti-metastasis capabilities do not depend, to any degree, on being supported by chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Quite the opposite. It can be strongly argued that such toxic treatments will neutralize the beneficial effects of Avemar. Of course, the new product had to play a submissive role to the official toxic protocols in order to be accepted by the medical establishment. http://www.holisticcancersolutions.com/avemar_report.htm",

      "Content": "DANGERS OF SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY Mammography poses a wide range of risks of which women worldwide still remain uninformed. Radiation Risks Radiation from routine mammography poses significant cumulative risks of initiating and promoting breast cancer (1- 3). Contrary to conventional assurances that radiation exposure from mammography is trivial- and similar to that from a chest X-ray or spending one week in Denver, about 1/ 1,000 of a rad (radiation-absorbed dose)- the routine practice of taking four films for each breast results in some 1,000-fold greater exposure, 1 rad, focused on each breast rather than the entire chest (2). Thus, premenopausal women undergoing annual screening over a ten-year period are exposed to a total of about 10 rads for each breast. As emphasized some three decades ago, the premenopausal breast is highly sensitive to radiation, each rad of exposure increasing breast cancer risk by 1 percent, resulting in a cumulative 10 percent increased risk over ten years of premenopausal screening, usually from ages 40 to 50 (4); risks are even greater for \"baseline\" screening at younger ages, for which there is no evidence of any future relevance. Furthermore, breast cancer risks from mammography are up to fourfold higher for the 1 to 2 percent of women who are silent carriers of the A-T (ataxia-telangiectasia) gene and thus highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation (5); by some estimates this accounts for up to 20 percent of all breast cancers annually in the United States (6). Cancer Risks from Breast Compression As early as 1928, physicians were warned to handle \"cancerous breasts with care- for fear of accidentally disseminating cells\" and spreading cancer (7). Nevertheless, mammography entails tight and often painful compression of the breast, particularly in premenopausal women. This may lead to distant and lethal spread of malignant cells by rupturing small blood vessels in or around small, as yet undetected breast cancers (8).

Avemar is the new wonder-alternative cancer treatment / adjuvant therapy for boosting the immune system and fighting cancer. \"Research at UCLA has demonstrated that Avemar reduces glucose flow into the cancer cells.  Cancer cells can evade NK [natural killer] cells by masking their outer membrane with a special substance that the NK cells recognize as 'normal.'  Avemar suppresses the release of this masking substance -- allowing NK cells to better target and kill the cancer cells.\"  Avemar's immune-stimulating ability appears to be so powerful that it can be useful in helping to restore even the most severely compromised immune systems.

So far no signs of a recurrence of breast cancer and no signs of any other cancers.",

A malignant lymph node on my heart, a huge tumor in my chest cavity and smaller tumours in both lungs were all inoperable.  R/CHOP was recommended but I chose instead to work with a reputable Naturopath and Medical Doctor who specializes in treating cancers alternatively.   Through diet, supplements and treatments such as intravenous vitamin c, low dose naltrexone/alpha lipoic acid, Avemar etc I recovered quickly and remain symptom free six years later.     I've posted the story on the prostate cancer board of a friend of mine who was declared terminal with less than a month to live in December 2006. He had mets to every organ and bone in his body from his groin to his head.  PSA was over 4,000.  After just three months of weekly intravenous vitamin c treatments and one 20 day course of daily injections of 714X he recovered fully and there was still no evidence of disease when I talked with him earlier this year.   I still take maintenance intravenous C treatments every six weeks or so and continue to see and hear many success stories from other patients many who were declared terminal after undergoing all that traditional medicine had to offer them.   Nothing that we take or do is harmful in any way and so it is beyond my comprehension why some  are so against trying something that is not only gentle with no negative side effects but also can be low cost and most importantly has been proven effective in actual verified cases.   As you can see in the following information  apricot  pits contain BENZALDEHYDE which was found to be very effective in the trial described in the PubMed link.   APRICOT PITS  The almond is closely related to the peach, apricot, and cherry (all classified as drupes). Unlike the others, however, the outer layer of the almond is not edible. The edible portion of the almond is the seed. A compound called amygdalin differentiates the bitter almond from the sweet almond. In the presence of water (hydrolysis), amygdalin yields glucose and the chemicals benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid (HCN). HCN, the salts of which are known as cyanide, is poisonous. To be used in food or as a flavoring agent, the HCN must be removed from the bitter almond oil. Once it is removed, the oil is called volatile almond oil and is considered to be almost pure BENZALDEHYDE. Volatile almond oil can still be toxic in large amounts. Antitumor activity of benzaldehyde. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6929727?dopt=Abstract   Ninety patients with inoperable carcinoma in the terminal stages and 12 patients in serious condition with other tumor types were given benzaldehyde in the form of beta-cyclodextrin benzaldehyde inclusion compound (CDBA) orally or rectally at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg divided in four doses. Toxic effects, including hematologic or biochemical disturbances, were not seen during long-term successive administration of CDBA. Fifty-seven of the patients treated were evaluable; 19 patients responded completely and ten patients responded partially (greater than 50% regression). For all responding patients longer response durations were associated with longer CDBA treatment periods. Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma induced the cancer cells to change into a conglomeration of pearls (the well-known product of differentiation) which consisted of keratinized normal squamous cells.\" PMID: 6929727 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]   We all need to do our own indepth  research and not just listen to the Pharma backed Quackbusters.  ",

Once my health improved, the strangeness was gone. You can be sure I'll be aware of any change should it happen again. This past week there was a documentary on TV about this very subject.

The discovery turns standard medical practice on its head. Surgeons have been removing lymph nodes from under the arms of breast cancer patients for 100 years, believing it would prolong women\u2019s lives by keeping the cancer from spreading or coming back.

      "Content": "Hi ookie I personally think you are very wise to have done some serious research before just blindly going ahead with the traditional treatments that will be offered to you. There is no doubt that the success rates of chemo and radiation are dismal to say the least and the quality of life while undergoing these treatments is very often intolerable.......... I am attaching some links to information about one particular natural product that has been proven over the years to be highly effective for a variety of cancers (especially breast and colon) and has no negative side effects. It is just one part of an alternative protocol that I have followed since my diagnosis of non Hodgkin's lymphoma in early 2004 at which time I was advised I would need the strongest chemo in order to \"perhaps\" save myself. I opted not to go that route and continue to feel strong and healthy now more than five years later. Of course there is no ONE magic bullet in dealing naturally with cancer. It's necessary to take into account what caused one's immune system to allow the cancer to get a foot hold in the first place.......I and many others that I personally know owe our successful outcomes to following a Regimen, which includes special diet, supplementation based on our own particular deficiencies and certain natural treatments such as intravenous vitamin C, low dose naltrexone, avemar, lypo-spheric vitamin c etc. etc..........If you're interested in learning more about the special regimen for detoxification and regeneration let me know and I'll gladly send along a copy. I also have lots of information on the other supplements and immune boosting products which my doctor so highly recomments and I'll gladly give you some links to information about them as well if you are interested.......For now, here is the information re Avemar which I think you will find helpful and hopeful for your situation.....................Following is a quote from ....... http://www.holisticcancersolutions.com/avemar_report.htm ............\" If one reads carefully the scientific papers, it soon becomes clear that Avemar's anti-tumor and anti-metastasis capabilities do not depend, to any degree, on being supported by chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Quite the opposite. It can be strongly argued that such toxic treatments will neutralize the beneficial effects of Avemar. Of course, the new product had to play a submissive role to the official toxic protocols in order to be accepted by the medical establishment.\" ................. More information here: ........... http://www.avemarresearch.com/pdf/C-AvemarFAQ.pdf ............. http://www.npicenter.com/anm/templates/newsATemp.aspx?articl .................

One person I know about, has been following a diet and has been in remission (without any pills/or pain) for 9 years now.        Has anyone out there done diet alone?   If so, please let me know, I would appreciate any feed back.   ookie  --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.

Robbing your body of estrogen has its own set of side effects. It is time women took some responsibility for their own health without acting like little robots.  Conventional doctors are bound to pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies and what they prescribe.  Doctors are not even allowed to tell you if there is alternative treatment.  They can only provide surgery, radiation/chemotherapy and drugs.  These drugs will need other drugs to counteract the side effects of the first drug.  The older you get the worse the cycle. I love my doctor, but I do my homework.  He thinks I am going to try one of the other drugs when I am totally post menopausel, but he is wrong. I was 49 when diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma with a micromet in one lymph node.  I had a lumpectomy and then a mastectomy with reconstruction.  He said chemo would only have added 1-2% toward my nonrecurrance rate and said it wasn't worth the horror.  I am currently looking for some way to prevent the night time hot flashes that wake me up every 1-2 hours all night long.  I am currently using the progesterone cream and taking an Estroven.  Sleeping pills don't help much and they have lousy side effects.  Anybody got a natural suggestion that has worked for them?",
