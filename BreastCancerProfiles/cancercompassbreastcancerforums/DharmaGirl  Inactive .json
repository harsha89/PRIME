      "Content": "Hey, welcome to CC . Sorry your family is going through this nightmare. A good thing to do is just take things as they come. Having cancer in your life is like being on a rollercoaster . One day things are ok and the next day things are not . You will find the strength , tho it may not seem like it now . You will learn to live to  the \"new normal \" .  I can remember how afraid I was when my mom was dx with cancer , I am also amazed at the things that I did to help her through the journey , you will be challenged every day . One day at a time , one foot in front of the other.  Namaste DharmaGirl ",

I've found a couple of good apps to put on my ipad to re rood all the information on meds as well as a diary for the aches and pains. This is the first group I've joined and I value you all the information. When I choose the app pot if anyone else has an app they use let me know. Thanks again to everyone. You might want to post on the caregiver boards as well . lots of people there going through the same thing you are . Please stay in touch .",
