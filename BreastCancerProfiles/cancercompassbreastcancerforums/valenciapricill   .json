      "Content": "hi, I had my core biopsy yesterday and I really didn't have a hard time with it at all.  Actually didn't mind it much at all.  My sister is still sore from hers and it was 2 weeks ago.  We are still waiting for her results, and I don't expect mine for at least 2 weeks.  I don't know why, but I am not so worried now.  What is, is.  I will deal with it, and will fight with all my being.  I am praying for you all and wishing you all wonderful health.  Thanks for helping me get through this.",

      "Content": "hi, I am in the same boat as you basically.  I had my very 1st mammogram in April.  Got a call back 3 days later because of an abnormality, had a ultrasound and new mammogram 5 days ago, and now have to go in for a core biopsy in 2 days.  I am scared to death.  The wicked part, is my sister is going through the exact same thing except is 2 weeks ahead of me, and we are still waiting for her results which should be anyday now.  Only thing I can suggest is anything that takes your mind of it.  Not really working for me, but hey.  The waiting is the hard part, and it may be absolutely nothing and I will laugh at how scared I was?  I will say a prayer for you and all of you here in this group.",
