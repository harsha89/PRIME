      "Content": "Yes, thanks for posting this, I've just been diagnosed with exactly this. Early breast cancer (DCIS on one side, stage 1 tumor on the other) but already metasticised to my proximal femur, triple positive. I've been all over the Internet looking at survival rates for breast cancer metastisis to the bone and found all the scary alarming info (studies showing mean survival rates of 6 months or 1 year or 2 years, awful), but I also found other studies reporting that life spans for this situation are dramatically increasing with Hepterin and other drugs. Also, it matters a lot how metasticised the cancer is ... how many other sites are involved, and where. May I ask your situation?",

Pipperpain, I'm so greatly shocked and sorry to hear that your husband died on the night of your first chemo. That must be the worst cancer story I've ever heard. I can't imagine what it was like for you to lose him that way, and then have to go through the rest of your chemo in that phase of grief. I am amazed that you can write so positively in this message. It is indeed a blessing that you're in remission but more that you're still soldiering on. I will hope for the same good outcome from the Herceptin. I'm starting my third cycle on Tuesday and it's going okay so far -- most rib mets no longer hurt, femur is healing slowly. I too wish I had a spouse to help me; being alone is sometimes the hardest part. But thank heavens Melbourne is full of wonderful support networks, so I've had a lot of support on all sides.",
