      "Content": "Dear Chris,   I am the one that posted newby at this cancer thing and I decided to have the breast biopsy that they said 80% was a lesion as well.  I'm not sure why they are having you go all over the place because they immediately scheduled me for the ultrasound guided biopsy.  My sister works as a RN on the cancer floor and Kaiser and she didn't want me to get the biopsy because of a theory of \"seeding\"  .  I will be doing a double masectomy, if it is cancer.  They are suppose to call by tomorrow on the results.  I'm scared too.  You are way younger than me.  Did you do the genetic testing?  That would probably help on what treatment you take as well.  Unfortunately, my teaching friend had the \"cancer gene\"  and removed all of her girl parts, did chemo and radiation, just in case , and a year later had it all over her body.  She is stage 4 and working for her family to have money.    I would wait for both tests to make sure they aren't related.  They ultrasound biopsy was easy.  I am just bruised.  I definately can see that, if seeding is true, whatever the contents of the spot is definately leaks out.  You can see everything the radiologist is doing and my spot totally was a different shape afterwards.  I don't know if this helps at all, but keep posting.  Laura",

      "Content": "I am 41 and just found a lump through a mammogram and ultrasound. The radiologist says it is most likely a cyst and I'm scheduled for a biopsy Thursday . My question is, my sister said that benign tumors can turn into malignant tumors and there is a concept of biopsy causing seeding into other systems like the blood system? Do I go through with the biopsy or just get it removed?",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the info. I had the biopsy today. I really hope it isn't cancerous because there's no way the cells didn't spread as I looked at the ultrasound the lump was changing shape as the sample was getting taken out. If it is cancer,I will be having a double mastectomy to try to get all tissue. Good luck with your situation and keep me updated.",

      "Content": "Well, got the biopsy done, but still bruised and sore for some reason.  The results say benign, but they recommend it getting taken out.  If feels like is totally is a different shape now, so it will be interesting what the surgeon says.  My friends who have had breast issues said that I need to go to a plastic surgeon as well, so they will look as normal as possible.  I will have a lot of questions, but may just get the lumpectomy. ",
