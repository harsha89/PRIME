      "Content": "Hi... I recently found a small nodule (pea size) in my left breast just under the nipple area.  I keep putting off seeing a doctor due to the small size of the nodule.  It's not hard nor is it painful.  I do have a strong family history of breast cancer however.  My mother was around my age when she discovered a nodule in her left breast.  I'm not sure of the size.  She didn't see a doctor for at least five more years concerning this lump.  When she finally did go to her doctor, she had to have a mastectomy and chemo.  She did really well for about 4 years but the cancer came back and she then passed away at age 53.  Since then she's had a sister to also die with breast cancer and another sister has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer.  I'm not really dumb enough to think that this nodule in my breast couldn't be cancer, I know it could.  But it's so tiny, I almost feel ridiculous seeing a doctor over this.  And I know that ultimately I'll go in and get checked out.  But I keep putting it off and chances are (knowing me) I'll let months or even years (like my mother) go by without having it checked.  VERY DUMB, I know...  And maybe a little of it is denial or fear.  But I just can't seem to make myself go get checked... (please don't anyone jump on me here, I just need some support and prompting maybe, I don't know...)  Thanks...Megan",

      "Content": "And boy was it PAINFUL!  I am pre-menstrual and my breasts are very (VERY!) tender.  My doc advised me to go ahead and have the mammo, due to my strong family history.  I should know something when I go back to see him next week.  I did have a dark green discharge come from my right breast.  The left one is where the nodule is however.  Anyway, I just wanted y'all to know that I went, and if you hadn't encouraged me to go, then I'd probably not have.  I'll keep you posted!...  Ronna",
