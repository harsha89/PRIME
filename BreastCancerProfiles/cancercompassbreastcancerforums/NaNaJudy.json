    "Content": "I am also on Aromasin (stage 4 cancer) and sweat like a pig the first month.  Then I found the book via Suzanne Sommers, her Wellness book..8 ways to wellness.  I am working on improving my immune system and taking many vitamins that have given me back my energy and just plain feeling good  (in less than a month)....wow, never knew that vitamins could make me feel so good.  Try reading her book (she has had cancer) and  hope you feel better soon while taking Aromasin.",
