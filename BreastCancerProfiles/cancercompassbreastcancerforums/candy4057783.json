The wk I went on Arimidex I started radiation, so when my arms began having shooting pins and needles, like electricity running from the hands up I questioned it but both oncol and radiol drs said it couldn't be either of their therapies. Long story short, hands got worse and I had carpel tunnel surgery on the right hand.  Switching to Aromosin i thought there was slight improvement but eventually (6M0s later) realized it was worsening again. Oncol Doc switched me to Tamoxefin and I have almost recovered. The hand that had surgery is still painful in the AM but only upon wakening.  I would be careful about taking an aromatase inhibitor. My Doc will never give it to me again.  Wishing you luck,  Carole I think I would be a little careful about choosing sides.  Aromasin is about the best most comprehensive medications there is anticancer  long term.  I for one  would rather get on my knees and thank God there is medication so I do not have cancer and bear a little discomfort.   Women become resistent to Tamoxifen and indeed begin being estrogen positive on it, read the literature.....not so on Aromasin.  Do your research for yourself IN DEPTH.......The effects from Aromasin are permanent, not so for Tamoxifin.  Good luck. If I could GET on my knees without moaning and groaning and asking for help to get up I WOULD thank God for the drug. I understand what you are saying but for some of us the struggle to deal with the pain e v e r y  single day sometimes gets overwhelming.  ",
