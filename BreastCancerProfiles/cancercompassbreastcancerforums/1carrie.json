    "Content": "I'm not sure I'm in the right place.  I am 53 and had a lumpectomy Feb of 08.  I am taking Tamoxifen 20mg. once a day.  My problem is that it isn't working like its supposed to.  I was on state medical insurance, but now they say I make too much, so I am without coverage,  Anyway, the oncoligist told me about a booster shot that will help the tamoxifen work better.  Problem is that the shots are between 500 and 600 dollars apiece.  What I am looking for is maybe something herbal or natural that I can take with the tamoxifen to help it work better.  If anyone can help me please write.",
