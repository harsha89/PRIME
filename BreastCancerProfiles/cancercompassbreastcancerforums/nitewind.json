      "Content": "Hi K,  I just happened across this board and saw your post. I was diagnosed stage 2  er/pr- and Her2+++  I was diagnosed in May of 06, had about 1/2 of my breast removed. Luckily, I had no positive nodes. In Sept of '06 I started adriamycin and cytoxin chemo. I did four treatments of that then 4 treatment of taxotere, followed my weekly infusions of herceptin for one year, I finished that in December of '07. I also had 32 sessions of radiation. From my experience, I can tell you that Herceptin was the easiest to handle. My onc did Mugas on my heart and I never had a problem. I thank God everyday for Herceptin! I am now a little over 2years out from surgery and I'm doing great! I feel the herceptin is what saved my life. Being Her2+++ used to be a very scary diagnosis but with this magic bullet, we now have a great chance of recovery. Hope I helped some Susan",
