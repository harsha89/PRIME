    "Content": "Hey Angel Bear,  I had both chemo and radiation.  While this effects people differently, both treatments are totally do-able.  You can do this.  After chemo I had daily radiation which was a breeze and the techs I had were nothing short of fabulous.  I am going in for a double mastectomy myself December 3rd.  I tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene.  Sending prayers your way.   Regina ",
