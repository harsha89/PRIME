I am 73 years young, living with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) and on oxygen 24/7.   Seven years ago I had a double mastectomy.  The cancer was only in the right breast but it opted to have both removed.  All the lymph nodes under the right arm were removed and all free of cancer.   Fortunately I did not suffer with lymphedema of that arm but do have a problem under the arm in the area of the surgery.   It is tender all the time to the extent that seams in clothing irritate me.   Also when I try to exervise that arm it feels as if something is pulling when I extend the arm up.    I have checked and despite the fact that it feels \"raw\", there is not a mark to be seen.     I also have arthritis in both shoulders and between the arthritis and this \"whatever\" under the right arm, I am not able to do much.     I am interested in finding out if anyone else has had this problem. I  appreciate any help that might be offered.   Thank you so much and everyone have a blessed day :-). Joan",

Joan Hi Joan  I am not sure I am the the most experienced person to be responding to your concern.  I have never experienced this for myself but, my mother who had a mastectomy 10 years ago also had her lymph nodes removed.  I remember her speaking of the \"numb sensation\" she felt in the location under her arm area.  It never went away I don't think. If nothing else, I hope I at least let you know that your symptom does exist with another survivor. Take care my friend.   Thank you Honey, any and all information is very much appreciated.  I have had that same numbness and your answer has helped me realize that it may be something I just have to learn to live with along with the arthritis (old age is not for sissies) :-).    God Bless Joan  ",
