    "Content": "I had a mastectomy 10 months ago followed by radiation. Did my PT and the tightness got a bit better. Then I stopped and the tightness came back. Researched how to detox your muscles and found some things that worked amazingly. I have full range of motion and don't have that iron chest feeling anymore. Here it is...1 teaspoon vitamin C powder, one teaspoon glutamine powder, tablespoon psyllium fiber, mixed in a glass of juiced greens. It worked for me but I'm no doctor. Hope it can do wonders for someone else too.",
