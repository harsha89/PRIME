I started a blog (www.CincoVidas.com) because I found little information about radiation and chemo therapy side effects. A 10-20 minute walk alone can help you boost energy. You may want to start with Pilates or Yoga. Here's a post on a pilates progam that helps cancer survivors regain strength http://blog.cincovidas.com/starr-power-pilates-program-helps Also take a look at a post on the benefits of yoga during and after treatment http://blog.cincovidas.com/yoga-restoring-minds-and-bodies-d You may also want to, in order to regain your energy, stay away from sugar, starch carbs and focus on eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins like fish and cereals like oatmeal. I hope this helps. Love, strength and survival, Britta",

Have ferritin iron issues (too high along with calcium).  Hair has become thin on top - noticebly so.  Was put on Arimidex until last week.  I walked with a cane all winter.  Extreme joint pain and stiffness with bone scans showing agressive arthritis.  Very little problems prior to Arimidex.  Just been changed to Aromasin.  I hope this is better.  My 81 year old mother got around better than me(54).  I hope someone can help.   Thanks Hi Kygrandma, I'm a survivor and went through cancer a second time when my father was diagnosed in 1999. I started a blog because I couldn't find much information on all of the different side effects. I did a post on joint pain and I shared some natural tips on this post http://blog.cincovidas.com/side-effect-joint-pain%e2%80%94tr For your hair loss issues scarves are not only a perfect fashion trend but they are also a great way to compete against thinning hair. I did a post on scarves and hairloss http://blog.cincovidas.com/the-beauty-in-scarves-getting-you Also you can visit websites like TurbanPlus.com, ChemoSavvy.com, and Adaptations4u.com. I hope that this helps.  Love, strength and survival -Britta Aragon",

Hi Philip1961, I'm a survivor and my father went through cancer as well. Although your sister-in-law just started radiation and chemo there may be different side effects that may come up. I started a blog (www.CincoVidas.com) because I found very little information about radiation and chemo side effects. I did a post on what you can expect from radiation treatments http://blog.cincovidas.com/what-you-can-expect-from-radiatio I also have a list of all the side effects and the drugs that cause them that may be of help to you http://blog.cincovidas.com/side-effects. As for your wife getting tested it does run in families and I would take extra precautions. I would continue to get mammograms and do self-breast exams. I know it can be overwhelming, just remember to take it one day at a time. Love, strength and survival -Britta Aragon",
