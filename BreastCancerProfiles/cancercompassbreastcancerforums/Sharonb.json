One thing I liked about it was that instead of being so tired that I didn't CARE about anything, I still felt enthusiastic about my interests inlife, but sometimes I just had to have a nap. I had a bit of hand/foot---sometimes I felt like I was walking on sticks, and my hands got really dry---buy yourself some handcream and be thankful they can treat this disease with so many new comparitively mild drugs compared to 20 years ago when chemo was wretched.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with mets in to the spine about three years ago, was treated with femara, radiation and the pain went away. I am doing well, getting doxil monthly, with just some minor side effects. the bone stuff is almost cleared up according to the last scans. I have people in my advanced cancer support group who are completely free of any signs of cancer, who were DYING a few years ago. I know people who have been living with bone mets for almost 20 years. SO--don't be negative. You also have to use complementary medicine --supplements -- LOTS of Vegetables, try to eat organic, try stuff like Tai Chi or acupuncture for eneregy, and keep yourself spiritually fit. You can't believe anything written more than two years ago. There are wonderful new drugs that are working miracles. You need to be positive and have HOPE.",

I am supposed to be talking with a surgeon sometime and have some kind of treatment -- Does anybody know how they treat this -- I have heard of somekind of anterior approach surgery where they build a cage for my spinal cord, and it sounds HAIRY, or to stabalize the weak bone with rods through the adjacent ones. ANy experience with either of these treatments?? Thanks.",

YES you need a mammogram and maybe a biopsy--two things which are really no big deal. talk to the resource nurse at the cancer center in your area, or contact the AMerican Cancer SOciety for contact people to help you fell stronger and more confident about what lies ahead. I know about a zillion people with cancer, since I am stage IV, in partial remission. I wish I had gone to the drs. as soon as I found problems. That's for sure.Many cancers can be completely cured if found early enough.",

And you need to have hope. i had a mets to liver (and bone) but the chemo took care of it, and I am in remission(although partial) there are women in my support group who have had stage 4 for as long as 22 years, so they don't know. One woman was so sick at first she was in hospice, and that was nine years ago. She has been in remission for awhile. You can always shop around and find new doctors who might be more hopeful and positive. Also, there are books which help you beef up your nutrition and can help YOU help yourself and get some of your power back, (only check all your supplements out with the doctor0 Thankfully my doctor is cool about vitamins and minerals, and although he really believes in chemotherapy, which I take, he doesn'think vitamins can hurt.",

      "Content": "Hi, I too have breast cancer mets to the bone, and have had femara, which worked really well for close to a year, then I was on faslodex and then aromasin, which I didn't have such great success with. Now getting chemo--an antitumor antibiotic called Doxil, which has brought the markers down from 130 to 64. Everyone is pleased. I am tolerating it well. I have bone mets in spine, and about four or five other places. The last bone scan showed quite a bit of clearing of that cancer, but a few small tumors in the liver. I feel good, take care of myself, work every day and am not bedridden or in any pain, nor do I have any disability in terms of walking. I fell incredibly blessed with this extra time, and pray that my ``chronic`` disease will allow me more years. I know other stage four women who have danced with cancer for 20 years or more. SHaron--You have a right to know about your condition and your prognosis. The doctors work for you.",
