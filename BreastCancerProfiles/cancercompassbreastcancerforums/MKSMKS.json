Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! My surgeon told me after getting the lab report from my lumpectomy that my cancer was very slow growing, and that I probably had \u0014it anywhere from 3-5+ years. FYI - I had a mammography every year. I have dense breasts, so that always included a disclaimer in the report that mammography is not as sensitive in identifying problems in dense breasts. Because my older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer the year before, I insisted on a script for a sonogram. The sonogram picked up the breast cancer as it is more sensitive to lobular cancer than the mammography. They finally did see something on the mammography that was done on the same day but not as clearly identifiable as it was on the sonogram.",
