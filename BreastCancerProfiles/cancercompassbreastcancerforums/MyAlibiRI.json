    "Content": "Post mastectomy I started chemo [ACT] then about a month after my last treatment I started developing severe bone/joint pain.  This pain has become pretty debilitating.  I am 45 years old and am to start radiation next week, then 5 years of Tamoxofen which that in itself I hear may contribute to joint pain.  Before I start seeking treatment for this, I would like to know how common this pain is.  Also, if it is truly a side effect from the chemo, does it go away on its own?
