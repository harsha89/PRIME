      "Content": "Hi Rossy, I was on Arimidex for about a year & was experiencing those symptoms. I'm so sorry. It's miserable feeling. Do you not tolerate theTamoxifen? I'm on Falsodex now. They are monthly shots. Seems to be working ok. Will find out more in a month. My breast cancer metastatisized to my brain & lymph nodes. Currently, I'm stage 4....chronic & terminal. Orginally diagnosed in May 2007. Metastatic was found in my brain in November last year. Had one brain surgery then and the second one this past April. It has left me with severe neuropathy and I'm having a hard time finding anywhere for support. What have you found to get support besides healthcare professionals and family? Stay strong in your fight! Yours truly, DB",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer Invasive ductal carcinoma in situ in 2007. I had a mastectomy. Metastatisized in 2011 to my brain & lymph nodes. 2 brain surgeries later, I now have severe neuropathy on the right side and left side weakness. Have had sterotatic radio surgery to my brain before 2nd surgery. Very frustrated because I'm usually an \"on the go all the time\" type of person & now am limited with everything. I can't drive, I'm tired all the time and Im mad as hell! On here looking for support & well, people to talk to, vent to (hate upsetting my family when I do) and get info. Stay well, live well!",
