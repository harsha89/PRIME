    "Content": "Angela, Hi!  I was sorry to hear that you are about to embark on a journey that most of us on here have been on in one way or another.  It's not fun, but it can have a very positive outcome.  My father is a 2+ year survivor of stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer.  I felt that I had to write to give the opposing opinion of those who stated that you should not use herbal remedies during treatment.  My father went through his first round of chemo, after having one full lung removed, and it was horrible - the side effects were causing him to not be able to sleep and not eat (or just lose what he did quickly), he was losing weight, and looking really ill.  A friend of mine had told me about Essiac tea.  Now, I'll tell you the same thing she told me - don't buy the ready made stuff - 9 times out of 10 it won't be the original formula.  Buy the herbs (there are only 4) and make the tea yourself.  I spoke to my father's oncologist about it, and he said that he used to tell people not to use it, but so many people told him that it helped, that now he just says that it's fine, it can't hurt.  It can't hurt - it's natural.  Unfortunately, in our part of the world, our doctors are told to be afraid of anything natural, which is really scary to me.  They are more than willing to fill our bodies with poisons and chemicals that do more harm, but because they can't charge for anything natural (thus the drug companies aren't making any money), you'll never see any of them recommend it.  Sorry - off the soap box now - I have more than a bit of passion for this topic after seeing how things work - first hand for my father, and then for me.  As for my father, after the awful first chemo experience, he agreed to try the tea.  He felt so much better, was able to sleep, and to eat, and his doctors (that didn't know about the tea) were absolutely amazed that he actually gained weight during the remainder of his chemo treatments.  Apparently, the chemo combo he was on was one of the worst, and they didn't see that happen very often - usually the opposite.  Now, I will say that if you look up Essiac tea, there are many claims out there on what it does, but I just know how it worked for him.  As for me, just a quick recap of how I've seen herbal remedies work firsthand... I had Graves Disease, and by the time it was diagnosed, I was in what they call toxic storm.  My whole body was shaking, and I had a resting pulse rate of about 150 on a good day.  I went to see an endocrinologist, who basically said either we have to do surgery and remove your thyroid, or radiate it.  I had done my research, and knew there was a drug that they could try, so I asked about it.  He didn't think it would be worthwhile.  I asked why he wouldn't want to try something that was the least invasive, and argued until he relented.  He told me I'd end up in the hospital in the next couple of weeks, with all my organs shutting down and in the ICU for months, but fine, gave me a script, and told me to see him in 10 weeks.  Well, there was so much wrong with that, as you can see, that after taking the meds for 2 weeks, with no results, other than weight gain, I figured if I had recommended the herbal route for my father, I should try it myself.  So, I went to see a naturopath.  He said that I might be too far gone for him to help, but he would give me 5 herbal remedies to hit all of the 5 main systems in the body, and we would see if it would work.  Literally 24 hours after I started taking them, I was almost completely back to normal.  I went from wanting to crawl out of my skin (or shake out of it), to feeling better after taking 3 doses.  It was one of the most amazing things I've experienced.  I understand people's skepticism, I had quite a bit of my own, but after having had this experience, I was completely blown away, and all of my doubts were gone.  Okay, so this ended up being a bit longer than I planned, but I really do hope that you find some of this information helpful, and I wish you and your mother the best for the journey ahead of you!  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to help.
