      "Content": "I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in the right breast almost 2 years ago.  First I would tell you to get brca tested. I came back positive so I did a bilateral mastectomy and a hysterectomy. Easy decision, easy surgeries. I have done all alternative medicine so far...My last scan showed a lymphnode still active in my axillary. Have you had a pet scan to see if there is lymphnode involvement??  My advice to you is take a deep breath and research everything!!!  You didn't get this overnight and you have time. Do not run on fear. Oh, reconstruction was easy too.  Not the most comfortable, but it passed quickly and I am happy I did it. I would be happy to talk anytime.    Kellie",
