      "Content": "My mom has been battling breast cancer for about 13 years now. We\u2019re finally beyond the point of surgery or chemo etc. I\u2019ve been dealing with her death long enough that I feel I\u2019ll be able to withstand the emotional pain that is sure to come. However, I do not want to look at my mother\u2019s sweet face with shock or disgust when faced with gruesome side-effects or consequences to this battle. I understand how hard it must be to talk of such things, but I\u2019m humbly begging for help. I would like to hear every terrible symptom or \u201cside-effect\u201d that anyone has ever had to face so that, the off chance I may also encounter even just one, I\u2019ll be able to look at her with only love on my face. She is already dying in such a painful and humiliating way, I will not cause her any more pain or shame of any kind. I need help to accomplish this. Please. As I said she has breast cancer that has spread to her liver and a new primary occurrence in her lung. I also suspect it may be in her brain by now but that hasn\u2019t been confirmed. If anyone could bear to recount their experiences with loved ones suffering from any form of cancer I would be forever grateful!! Please help me!",

      "Content": "Perhaps a private message would be more beneficial for everyone. I don\u2019t want to expose unpleasant details to people struggling with this. And I\u2019m sure these types of things are overwhelming to many people. I don\u2019t want to expose anyone to that. Though I\u2019m well aware of my own restrictions and for those of you who are also\u2026 please message me. I know that we\u2019re all different, but as I mentioned, there\u2019s a chance that my mom may experience these things and I would like to be prepared! Thanks again. And thank you janr888 and Hussy for your thoughts! I really appreciate it!",
