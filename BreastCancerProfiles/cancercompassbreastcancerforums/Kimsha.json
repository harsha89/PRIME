    "Content": "I had a double mastectomy with expanders but because of previous radiation from Hodgkins my skin could not heal. After a surgery for necrosis and half dozen minor surgeries to remove dead and infected skin we opted for Lat Flap. Because of my failing skin I had to have the whole lat muscle and 9x5 inch skin flaps over each breast. I would like to know if anyone else out there has had large flaps like this and 11 inch incisions on each side of back. When I look at pictures on line everyone has very small flaps usually covered with nipple tattoos. Because my surgeries were so large my recovery took a long time, I had expanders in almost a year to the date of last surgery to exchange expanders for implants. I would love to hear from anyone else who sports these large flaps as well.",
