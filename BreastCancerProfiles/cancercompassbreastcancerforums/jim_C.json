    "Content": "My wife has just been diagonosed with Malignant Menigitis. This is not her primary cancer. She was diagonosed with Breast Cancer Stage 3 with axillary involvement in December 02.She had 3 monthe chemotherapy followed by mastectomy followed a further 3 months chemotherapy. She was due to undergo radiotherapy when the Malignant Menigitis was discovered. We have been informed by the doctors that there is no cure for this and that she has at most only 6 months left to live. Does anybody know of any similar cases where there has been success in overcoming this. We are dessperate to try and beat this disease and need help right now. Please contact me as soon as possible if you have any info regarding this matter. Yours, Jimmy C.",
