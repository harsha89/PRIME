      "Content": "I took Tamoxifen all of last year, had the expected hot flushes, and hip joint pain. This year I switched to Arimidex, and had so many side effects I wanted to kill myself, so I have switched back to Tamoxifen. While taking the Arimidex I found a website where someone else had suggested taking Schiff Move Free for her Arimidex related joint pain. It's a supplement containing Glucosamin, condroitin, Hyaluronic Acid, MSN and joint fluid all well known for joint support. As I live in Australia I had to source it elsewhere so I get mine on eBay. It took about a week to notice a difference. It is amazing stuff. On Arimidex my pain lessened by more than half, and now back on Tamoxifen  I am  joint pain free. I've put friends onto it for their joint pain and it's worked for them too. So for any of you who are having joint pain from your anti estrogen therapy I'd suggest trying it.",

      "Content": "I took Tamoxifen for about a year, had hot flushes, hip pain, fatigue. Switched to Arimidex and spent 4 1/2 months on it before I had to go off it. Side effects included, wanting to kill myself, joint and bone pain all over, foot pain, carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands, debilitating fatigue, severe fluid retention in the lower limbs, weakness, and not hot flushes but a feeling that every day was 43 Degrees Celcius (over 100 degrees farenheit). I had more than 20 different side effects and have now gone back on to Tamoxifen. At least the se's on that are manageable. I found out about a joint formula available in the US (I live in Australia and buy it on eBay) called Shiff Move Free, it is excellent for the joint pain. I started taking it while still on Arimidex - pain reduced by about 60%. On Tamoxifen I get no joint pain at all now. My naturopath has me taking Indole 3 Carbinole, which is good for estrogen balance. I will continue to take this when my 5 years is up. Studies have shown it could be just as effective as Tamoxifen, for ER+ breast cancers. Magnesium is very important too, helps with cramps, and helps to keep bones strong.",

Will try to keep this a short as possible. Quick history.. had breast removed rads ok for 18months.. returned in lymp back of my neck..chemo rads on both neck and ovaries. Now on letrozole after working my way through all the others with various side effects. (That was over 5 years ago last treatment) Have had increasing pains in joints... not all the time so hips ( when rolling over in bed pain waking me up) pins and needles in one hand along with awful pain spasms ( this is on the side i had my breast removed/left side), get pins and needles in feet on and off, knees ache on and off, tired sometime washed out ( thing that is due to not getting a good nights sleep.) Now have muscle aching/arms feel heavy and my right arms hurts to lift but not at the shoulder at the top part of my arm. Stiff in the morning when i get up or after sitting for any length of time. Have this morning i think popped a rib for the second time in a year..( hubby lent on me... a pop sound from my chest with extreme pain-again on the left side). The doctor has been really good.. had scans and bloods done to check the cancer has not sneaked back and everything is clear. It might be that i am just getting old but i am only 53yrs young...... look forward to hearing if anyone else is having these problems and what they do... All the symptoms you have described are common side effects of letrozole. Only you can decide if it's worth continuing, but if you do, make sure you mention SE's to your doctor. Blood clots are pretty scary, and can sneak up on you if you are not sure what to look for. Some supplements which can help joint/bone pain are Schiff Move Free Advanced (or 21st Century equivalent which is about half the price), it made a huge difference to me. I have heard good things about Krill Oil for arthritic pain, but have not tried it myself. Another thread on this site suggests acupuncture, she had good results. Again, it's not something I have tried personally I am almost 52, diagnosed in 2008, (mastectomy, axillary clearance, chemo, radio) finished Dec 2008. Initially on Tamoxifen, then switched to Arimidex. I suffered horrendous SE's from Arimidex, and went back onto Tamoxifen, which I tolerate pretty well. Don't let anyone tell you this joint pain is to be expected at your age. It IS from the letrozole, and you might be able to stay on it, but relieve the side effects with supplements. Good luck",
