      "Content": "This is a crappy drug,and the ONC MD's know it.  Take aspirin! My hands, feet, joints were so painful, I have seen 90 year old women were more sprightly than I was on the drug. The Docs know the compliance rate is about 50%, I stopped them.  My quality of life crashed. Stage 4 at diagnosis, HER2,E+,P+, yes mammos every year.",

      "Content": "I would use denosomab instead of Zometa. Femara has huge side effects, I could/wouldn't take it. I also took fulvestrant, tamoxifen. Ick to all of them! Quality of life is important to me, so that is my driving force behind my treatment choices. Get connected with pallative care,their goal is to help you find quality of life, research says patient live longer with this type of care in your corner. DX at stage 4, yes i had mammos every year since i was 35,no family members, HER2 E+,P+, mets to bone, ribs and pelvis. Lumpectomy, radiation with boost, herceptin, doxetaxel, carboplatin X6, now Herceptin and Perjeta, no more imaging, bone density, colonoscopy, mammos, biospies....treatment has a high cost, experience wise so I choose quality.  Plus all that \"watching\" is painful, biospies the worst. My energy is pretty good, i am a creative sort, so every day I make/work on quilts, jewelry, sewing, gardening and I work about 10 hrs a week.  ",

      "Content": "Diane, So for you, the believe system- is it afterlife insurance? I am interested in the quality of life, one poster mentioned Satan.....amazing. When the post thread started, a serious question was posted \"how do I help my friend\" A earnest request, and that meant a truthful answer seemed in order,as a women who is in the same boat, fluffy, albeit well meaning- believe in God, falls short. I hope you not a stage 4 terminal patient, but I am. I recommended some legacy options and then being \"present\" for her friend. These are concrete \"how can I help my friend\".....listening, hand holding. This requirement to believe to get benefit, is your approach. Please don't assume it had any value to anyone else. In no other post has the god talk been present and so if you need to spread the good word, please go elsewhere. Please.",

I have stage 4 and I am not deluding myself thinking GOD will provide a \"cure\", If that magical thinking is comforting to you, indulge yourself. I don't find any of that GOD crap useful, helpful or worth a second of my time. This is a real thread about dying, I doubt you have ill intent, but please take it somewhere else.",

Help her make the legacy items for her daughter.  Reassure her you can be there for her daughter.   Her cancer is very grim. The salvage chemo will be terrible. You are clearly suffering, this pre-grief is very real, and I don't have any advice for you that will help.  Learning more about the cancer helps you understand what is happening, but if time is short, she is lucky to have you.

      "Content": "Hi, I have stage 4 breast cancer, it won't be cured.  So how much treatment and when does one decide not to stop? I have declined more chemo therapy, imaging every 16 weeks, biospies, mammogram, bone density, colonoscopy and more.  This includes all of the anti-estrogen drugs.  I want quality of life, and let me tell you I don't want to die bald or with neuropathy so bad I can't walk.....it was not to difficult to start to decline new treatments.  Since I have HER2 P/E++, i do take the anti-her2 drugs, but more to control pain.  Get connected to pallative care, they can help with pain and distress, they want you to enjoy the time left. In fact pallative care, can extend life in patients whose distress can make life unbearable. For me not taking all the treatment makes sense.",

      "Content": "Hi, As a type A,with stage 4 breast cancer, i felt the cancer was annoying and inconvenient.  It was very hard to be dependent on my husband for all the shuttling to treatment and MD appts. I think the lesson I am supposed to learn is to let go, and i is probably the hardest lesson yet. I felt as though my husband got the shitty end of the deal, he could only watch, drive, and hope.  So please take care of yourself. My surgeon on the first visit asked if we were talking to a therapist, yes, and with the huge intrusion of CANCER, we needed a place to talk. I felt at times I was being treated as a child, and it can be a vivicous cycle.  If your wife won't go then see about care giver groups available in your area. Both of you are going through this, both of you.  As a mom, you worry about dying, as a father you wonder how can I can i do this by myself.  The cost of care, insurance is also a huge stressor. The treatment is so tough, you don't have much spare energy.  You are an easy target. Your kids understand the level of stress and they too have reactions.  Be honest with the kids, answer their questions (age appropriate). I didn't find the women breast cancer support groups very helpful, I am not chasing treatments so I didn't want to hear the latest chemo side effects stories.  That was me, it is different for everyone.  Oh and that is another thing, \"everyone is different\", I wanted the straight answer, no soft fuzzy answer, it made me madder dealing with the health care folks who said that. Take care, if you want to convo more send me a private message.   I hope it gets better, and intimacy well, I'll leave that alone for the time being. Andrea",
