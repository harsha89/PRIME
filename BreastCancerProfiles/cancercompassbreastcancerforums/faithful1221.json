Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! name is Carol and I was diagnosed with stage 3C breast cancer. I am in the 1% of breast cancer patients that have the tumors show up in the lymph nodes. All my mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI's have come back clean. I found a lump under my right arm pit last October. I had all the tests done a biopsy and it revieled stage 3C breast cancer. I will be having a bilateral mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection done June 1st.     Never be to safe.......good luck and God blessMy",

I did have to take shots for the blood the day after each chemo - neulasta- and that also causes joint pain. The mind does go but it does come back. I am triple negative, stage 4. I even tried herceptin even though I am her2  negative. Had no bad side effects from the herceptin other than it did not work. As far as feeling old ......well that does seem to happen. I am 58 going on 110.........BUT I still look 80 something. Carol you sound like a very strong person (working long hours) you will do well. God Bless Sue thank you for your reply. I wish I could not work at all but I have not been at this job for long and I have NO disability. When  I go out for my surgery I will have No long or short disability. That really sucks. The people at work are trying to raise money for me. When I go out I will be able to get social security disability. I have faith that God will carry me thru this. Thanks again for writing. How long ago were you diagnosed? And are you doing well now?...................Caol",

      "Content": "Hi all, I was diagnosed with stage 3C breast cancer last halloween. I fall in the 1 % that does not show up in the breasts but goes right to the lymph nodes. I completed 12 weeks of adrianmycin/cytoxin at every 3 weeks. I now just received my 7th dose of taxol/herceptan today. I have 5 more weekly doses, then surgery. I thought the A/C was bad but I have so many more symptoms on T/H. Most bothersom anre low blood counts. 2 weeks go had to have a blood transfusion. pain in my bone and joints. The pain has gotten worse the more treatments I receive. I have been tweaking my pain meds with my onc. I am a surgical nurse and have cut my hours down to 3 8hour days instead of 4-10 hour days. Another really annoying symptom is theat the chemo is effecting my brain and thought process. I just hope I get my brain back after treatment. I really feel like an old lady. I am only 46 years old. I would appreciate any feedback on the T/H regime. I would love to hear from you. Take care and God bless.........Carol",
