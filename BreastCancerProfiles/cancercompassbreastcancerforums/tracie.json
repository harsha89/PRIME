      "Content": "My mom was diagnosied about a year and half about with stage 4 breast cancer.  It had also spread into both of her lungs and a spot on her spine.  She isn't on chemo or radiation, the dr has her on areida to treat the other cancer since her breast was removed.  My question is, she is complaining of terrible back pain to the point she can barely walk.  It is on one side and on her hip area too.  She just went for tests.  She said the pain feels like bones rubbing into each other.  Could this be the cancer spreading?  Trying to find what bone cancer feels like on the web isn't that easy.  Just wondering if anyone knows or has experienced anything like that.  I am scared to death.  Thank you Tracie",

      "Content": "Tre, He told her that her bones look better, she only had like two little spots when this was diagnosed before.  He doesn't really know why she is in this pain either except maybe that lttle bit of cancer is what is bothering her.  The meds are not working, and just making her dizzy so she is probably going to have to do radiation.  She could barely get through the bone scan so when I suggested getting an MRI she said that there is no way she can do that.  She does remember lifting something heavy, maybe she just pulled a muscle, but I think that if the dr is suggesting radiation, maybe she didn't hear everything he said.  Thanks for all your advice, you are very helpful.

      "Content": "Hi, well my mom was told that everything is fine, her bones look better then before.  He is giving her some pain killer and if that doesn't work, then she can go for radiation.  I don't really understand that.  If there isn't cancer that is causing the problem, then why would she go for radiation?  Anyone know the answer to this?

      "Content": "Thank you for writing back, it is so hard when you have no control over a situation and there is very little you can do.  I did get a better description from her regarding the pain, it radiates, comes and goes and is on a scale of 1-10 a 8.  She couldn't even lay for then entire bone scan, they had to do it in sections.  We will find out hopefully Friday, but that seems like a long time from now.  I am just trying to find out what the bone cancer pain feels like to others.  I know that it is painful, the worst actually.  Just trying to make heads or tails out of this.
