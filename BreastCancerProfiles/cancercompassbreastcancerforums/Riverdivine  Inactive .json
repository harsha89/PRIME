      "Content": "Good for you, for being smart and aware!  :)  I, too, am trying to beat this the non-traditional way. I have had 4  surgeries, however (including mastectomy, and many lymph nodes removed).  I live in the Boston area, and have been searching desperately for more open-minded treatment providers.  I usually feel totally alone in this...like I am my own Dr.    Can I ask you where/WHO offers laser surgery in the Boston area? ( I have been looking for such a thing for yrs...)  Thank you for any help!  :)",

      "Content": "Thanks so much, SpringFlowers, for the good Dr's name in NY- as well as your encouraging attitude!  :)   I always love hearing when others listen to their body's own wisdom, over the \"standard of care\" of the medical industry. It is extremely challenging to do this  (I have refused chemo, radiation, etc consistently), and it takes a full time commitment to learn about alternate options for healing. But, they definitely do exist.  I.V Vitamin C therapy is another treatment that has promising potential. www.doctoryourself.com  A book that I read recently sums up alot of what I discovered over the past several yrs, regarding supplements and diets: \"Waking the Warrior Goddess\", by Dr. Christine Horner.  She used to be the President of the AMA, but became convinced that holistic ways of treatment offered clear benefits, for both prevention and treatment.  I'd totally recommend this book for anyone dealing with breast cancer, no matter what stage, or if you want to prevent it in the first place. Thanks again, SpringFlowers, and best of luck to you, too! :)",
