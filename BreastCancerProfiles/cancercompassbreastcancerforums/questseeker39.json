      "Content": " I was told in 2012 I had stage 3 b Her2 Post IBC .. would start chemo treatments in 2 weeks after body scans and MRI , Mugga, Ct scans , Bone scans.. I started taking vitamins astrgulas in tincture form along with Fo- Ti ( wo sho fu), & any vitmin that helped cancer, but my oncologist took me off all those vitmins , i stayed on the first two because i didnt tell her about those, these help get me through my chemo, i had 4 rounds of 4 different kinds flourcil, taxol, admriycin & some other.. my side effects was very small compared to what i hear on here.. my taste did go side ways a bit, pain from no hair, heat to my face when ever i would bend over, but no nausea, no getting sick.. I worked 9 hoursa day after treatments... I atribute less sy,ptoms to  starting early and having this in my system when chemo started.. i am 52 years old and never again will i subject myself to chemo, ITS NOT A CURE.. it just prolongs your life for a few years!! No i was not cured after 4 treatments i stopped ALL,,, yes i put my life on the line to prove cancer can be cured, i had 2 CM left no Metstatias to bones or nodes when i walked out of oncologist office.. had my port removed.. My oncologist told me it would be back and i was killing myself.. I killed the left over 2 cm, 3 years later she was right it came back where they did my BIOPSY one cell got in there and got loose.. so now it is aggressive.. and under no circumanstances will i step back into chemo..  I have spent last 3 years everyday researching natural cures and weeding out the fake , I talked with women and men who have cured their own cancers, but its not all about diet, its all about how you persieve life in general..  you can not cure cancer if your body is poisened, if your mind is poisoned, if your under stress, if your broken down taking on the world..IF you want to live you have to make difficult choices in life, I watched my brother die of cancer less then 3 months ago but he never told NO one he had cancer, he even saw me go threw it.. At the end when it was too late to turn his body around he wanted to live but it was to far advanced and he didnt want to do what it would take to turn it around.. he was depressed, he family was dragging him down no help.. he just lost his willto live.. Then the most importnant person in all this is GOD..with out him nothing is possible, even if i die tomorrow of cancer i would not place the blame on the man because he knows what my future holds, who is to stay something horrible was going to happen to my famil or daughter and he knew i couldnt handle it, then its his will how i should go.. I stopped smoking , drinking 3 years ago, did the 190 degree turn needed to stop my cancer, and i did..but now due to chemo it has started my nightmare over agin, but im going to fight this one on my terms with my new found knowledge.. and yes to you NAY sayers out there, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!!  cancer WAS CURED in 1929's but there is more money in labatories founding your doctors then a cure... MDA anderson just recieved a grant for 5,2 million dollars for cancer.. if cancer was cured do you think they would ve able to build all these fancy cancer center or hospitals, oh cancer instuite is in onit too!!.. but you go ahead and be blind because thats what keeps them going your fear of death... My family finally stopped pushing me, Do what you want! do not let yourself be pushed into doing what they want, Its your life.. My brother wanted us to follow his wishs also.. You want to know why people do not brag about being cured, its because you will be killed ( yes killed) or harressed by IRS or your govenment, your family threatened, .. I read so many different post in 3 years and i am seeing more and more people turning to natural cures, they are getting the word out.. essiac tea can bring all your cancer cells to one spot, so yes if it gets loose take essica tea, gravolia tea, mornigua tea, milk thistle tea,.. all these are working for me, now i am taking carrot juice and its working also.. I have filters on all my water supplies. i do not wear deaodarant my body does not smell once you clean your system out good things will be gain to happen..  each body is different you have to try different therphy to find which one work for you,.. castor oil packs also help along with clay packs, enemas are the best they get rid of all that junk in your stomach and it helps with weight ..  I get carried away, all i can say is goverment doc are available to view if you know where to look.. do your home work dont take internet word, talk to real people who have cured their cancer..",

      "Content": "Like the sermon given, only you know what you want out of life, i can not begin to imagine going thru what you have done for so long.. personally i would say no more and just clean my body up the best wa i know how..but then im not you.. im 52 with a new grandbaby on the wy and i have exceppted that i am going to die one day , but as long as i am here i am going to go down fighting, and not with chemo since i believe that is what has made your cancer return time after time, as long as we have air in our lungs and we wake up every morning we always have choices.. try researching al natural cures, and natural therphy, i believe you can beneifit from essica tea, whic cleanses the blood, gravila tea or mornigua tea, does same thing, cleanses the body.. but we must stop polluting it .. filters on water, clean veggies organic is possible, get off hormone milk & cheese, throw away the microwave type..   I noticed when the microwave was invented more cancer started surffacing...so there you are some good ideal and No i do not get anything from mentioning these teas, i have secondary cancer also.. ",
