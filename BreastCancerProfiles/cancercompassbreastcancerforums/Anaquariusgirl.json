    "Content": "Dear Friends. Family and Everyone, As you may know, I have accepted the challenge and am participating in the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer Sept. 16 and 17. I am walking for all women and men who have breast cancer and for those who will be diagnosed. Let's try and eliminate this terrible disease. I know for a fact with the shocking numbers of 1 in 7 women are diagnosed with breast cancer. You are bound to know some that knows someone that has been affected. Or you may be like me and you have been directly affected. My mother was diagnosed May 2005, and I am excited to say she is a survivor. I also have friends from work that are survivors. And since I started this journey have met other women that are survivors. I need your support I only have 70 more days and I am at 44%! I have pledged to raise $1800.00 (which is the minimum to walk) for the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer as part of my participation in the walk. I would love to surpass this amount and raise as much as we can. Your contribution will help to support medical research into the possible causes of and cure for breast cancer, education and early detection programs, and clinical care and support services for women with breast cancer in communities across the country. There is a special focus on helping medically underserved women, the poor, minorities, the elderly, or those with inadequate health insurance. And much of the money granted by the Foundation goes back to the communities where it was raised, supporting everything from local grassroots programs to national organizations. It is faster and easier than ever to support this great cause - you can make a donation online by simply clicking on the link at the bottom of this message. Whatever you can give will help! I truly appreciate your support and will keep you posted on my progress. Thank you for your support; you really do make a difference. The money that you donate today, will help someone you know in the future. Breasts will Rejoice, Nikkol Gomez You can visit the web address: http://info.avonfoundation.org/site/TR?px=2421952&pg=personal&fr_id=1220&et=kvuvc5CQbZ0wQm2vpsam8w..&s_tafId=68417",
