      "Content": "Thank you Ray for you quick and kind response. My husband does have heart problems also. So I may be calling on you to get more info about that natural path. He just hates to take any kind of medications, and is dreading \"more pills\".  My mother has a friend with prostrate cancer. I believe he went the natural route also and has been cancer free for quite sometime now. Thanks again, I am sure I will talk to you again!",

      "Content": "My husband just turned 65 and was just diagnosed with male breast cancer. It is believed to be caused by Agent Orange exposure in Viet Nam. He has Post traumatic stress syndrome and diabetes. Plus, I recently lost my step-mother to ovarian cancer, and my step-dad, the man who raised me, just had a cancerous kidney removed.  I am just tired, really tired. I wonder everyday when \"I\" am going to have a nervous breakdown.  You will not notice on the outside...everyone thinks I'm so strong, but I feel like I am on the edge. We don't know much about hubby's cancer. All we have is the diagnosis. They say we caught it early. We go this week to talk to oncology surgeon. He insists on having the VA hospital take care of it all. It is the DeBakey center in Houston, TX, that is a teaching hospital, so I don't think I am too worried about their care.  I am just very anxious about this week, because it all becomes very real.  And then I start reading some of these posts about side effects from different meds.  He is already depressed...we fight his PTSD everyday. He has diabetes...what about the loss of appetite.....and what about me??? I feel so guilty about even asking that question. I feel like I don't have anyone. I can talk to my mom, but she is dealing with my dad and their fear that his cancer may have spread. Every little pain scares them, or him...he told me this. But I know it scares her too, because I know what she is going through now.  I can't talk to my best friend, she just tries to tell me what to do, how to feel. I just need her to be there. I feel like I am burdening people when I talk to them. I've gotten a little help from some special online friends, but it seems like they have heard enough and don't really want to hear about it anymore. I don't sleep, my mind just won't shut down.  I am dealing with some medical issues of my own that are causing me to be depressed, and now this.  Do I ever get a break? I am always the strong one, I am always the happy one, I am always the positive one.  I just feel to guilty to worry about me...he is the one with Cancer. I started a blog, that didn't help. I am on anti-depressants, well cymbalta, for bone disease in my neck and back. But all that has done for me in this instance is make me feel soul less. I haven't cried, I can't cry, but I don't want to cry...I need to be strong. I want to sleep, but I can't sleep. My doc gave me sleeping pills, but I don't want to take anymore drugs. Oh, I did cry once. My dog hurt her leg last week and I totally lost it. But then I felt guilty about crying about that and not being able to cry about the fact that my husband has cancer. I am a mess. I am truly at loose ends. I feel like I may just explode one day. .....what about me (see, there goes that guilt again for asking that)    ",
