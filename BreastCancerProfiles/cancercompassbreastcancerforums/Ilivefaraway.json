    "Content": "My mom has stage 4 metastasized breast cancer.  Her recent tests showed the tumors in her neck and arm (lymph node) are growing; the chemo isn't working.  Her blood count was too low for chemo so they're starting radiation as quickly as possible (takes at least 8 days).  I live 13 hours away (by car).  I can take time off to be with her but how do you know when it's time?  I have 2 small children so I have to plan trips to be with her carefully and save my time off in case she \"needs\" me later.  Any advice?",
