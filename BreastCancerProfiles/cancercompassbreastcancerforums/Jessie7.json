      "Content": "Thanks. We are at risk every day of our lives just being alive, but we never really think about it until someone says, by the way, there are risks. Then you start thinking, maybe too much. I think after giving it a lot of thought and reading all I could over the weekend, I think treatment may be the way to go.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ contained to 1.5 mm, very small area, and had surgery on August 15. It was found as calcification on a mammogram done in March. Since it is contained only to the duct, the treatment suggested is radiation and then tamoxifen. The radiation doesn't concern me as much as the tamoxifen. I don't like the potential side affects, ie: blood clots, other cancers. Is there any other treatment. If I do the radiation only and use natural progestrone cream, balanced nutrition and exercise as a means of trying to stay cancer free, is that just wishful thinking? I would rather take my chances of a reoccurance and deal with that when and if it comes. Does having dcis mean that I will get it or a possibly a more progressive type of cancer? I'm confused.",

Their office is on University and Priest, in the same complex as Cookies From Home. The company I work for has them out every year, that is who found my dcis. I don't know if they can help, but it might be a place to start.",
