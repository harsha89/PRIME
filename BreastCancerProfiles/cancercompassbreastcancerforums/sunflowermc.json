      "Content": "So sorry to hearÂ  about your mom. You may benefit from making yourself go to her house and hang out with her. Tell her you want to be with her, I pormise you she wants that too. I have cancer, it is very scary. But I also know I get sad when I think about my adult sons not being able or wanting to spend time with me. Take advantage of what you know and the time you have with your mom. Love her, make her laugh, tell her what you remember that makes you feel good, you know the good old days, stuff like that. Hold her and let her hold you. Silence is OK. Pray to God for grace.",
