For about 3months now I have been having nipple discharge and reallly saw and itchy nipples.I have a rash on my thighs and my back and randomly all over my body. Even on my face, it's red and blotchy looking and is very saw.   Nipples.... The doctor gave me some antibiotics to take and I did take them but problem has come back again. It dd go for a bit. Skin... I have had exzema prior to this, could this be a link? I am 18 years old and fear that maybe I have breast cancer... the discharge comes from both nipples and today it is a light yellow colour. But it vareis from yellow t dark green to brown and sometimes even blood.  Please help me I am very scared. Dear Scared: You need to see your doctor immediately to rule out any chance of there being something very wrong.  It could be nothing but you need to let your doctor rule that out.  There are instances of nipple discharge that are benign but again let a doctor be your advisor.  I would choose a good breast specialist.  Since breast cancer is so common now a days, you can never be too sure.  I am a breast cancer survivor and timing makes ALL the difference.  Hope you have already been to the doctor and you are at peace with what they have told you.  Take care and God Bless Susan",
