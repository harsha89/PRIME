      "Content": "I am new to this site and have been reading about different medical subjects.I had a masectomy 2 years and 3 mo.s ago. I had chemo and radiation.I contracted shingles after three mo.s and still have them over a year later.They are very painful and there is nothing that I have found to treat them.I take lyrica for the pain but it has a lot of side effects.Does anyone know of anything that will give relief from this.I am thinking of trying acupunture.

      "Content": "Thanks, Tre for the info. I will certainly give the supplements and the olive tea a try.At this point I am willing to try most anything since nothing else has worked for my shingles so far.I am also taking arimidex for the hormones since my masectomy and have lots of side effects from this medication.Ihave been on this for two years and will ask my oncologist about terminating it when I go to my 3mo. check up next mo.  Addiebelle",

That is one of the first things I tried but I was allergic to the patches.I also tried the capsasin cream and couldn't use that either.I appreciate your suggestion and I really appreciate your prayers even more.                            Addiebelle",
