    "Content": "I've takin Armidex for 7 months do have some joint pain and painful sex but if things stay the same I really think I can handle this for 4 more years .My doctor said I can  switch to tomoxifen if I want but when I look at reviews for Tomoxifen  they are not any better so I'm gonna take my vitimins, exercise and eat healthy and hope my side effects don't get worse .But I'm gonna stay on Armidex  and hope for the best.
