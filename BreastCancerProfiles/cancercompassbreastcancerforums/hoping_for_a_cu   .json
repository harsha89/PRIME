    "Content": "Hello, please help me. My mom finally lost her battle with breast cancer.  I keep going over in my mind about what we could have done differently. A different doctor, different treaments. I was with her every step of the way. It is hard to accept that the battle is over, we fought for 3 years.  Is there any one who is feeling this way. I am so overwhelmed with these feelings.  I loved and miss her so much. Please respond back. Thank you.",
