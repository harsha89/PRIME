      "Content": "I had a breast ultrasound done recently and said that there is a cyst at the 1 o'clock position measuring 1.1 x .6 cm in diameter.  I have a circumscribe solid hypoechoic nodule measuring 5 x 4 x 5 mm.  The right retroareolar  cyst measures 6 mm.  Can someone explain what does this really means?  What do you suggest?  I haven't gone back to the doctor.  ",
