      "Content": "My oldest sister just found out yesterday she has Stage 1 breast cancer. She met with a dr. today for a consult and he is recommending surgery in two weeks. He said while he's in there they will inject dye to see if it's spread to her lymph nodes. Does anyone know if this is standard procedure? Thanks, Terri ",
