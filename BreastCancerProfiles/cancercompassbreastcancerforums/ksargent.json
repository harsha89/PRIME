It had gotten to the point when I would have a doctor appointment, my husband would give me 50 questions, why, how come, etc. and going to the doctor he/she would say nothing to answer my question. I did have melanoma and basil cell carcinoma. I almost felt vindicated. I'm 55 been married 35 years, my sons are grown. I am not worried so much about the cancer coming back or any other sickness. I would like to feel well. No one believes me either, it is embarrassing. Please do not feel you are losing your mind...your not..I have chronic depression, I feel like it is all in my mind but then when I feel really bad...well I bet you know that feeling. Now I say nothing. If you do have panic, maybe talk to the doctor about that. Maybe it will get his attention. I feel bad for you..I guess I didn't think anyone would relate. Sorry you do. I will go to doctor if something happens that really knocks me off my feet. Please don't be on pins and needles. Hope you have a pal to talk to. If not, I don't just write me back. Thank you for easing my mind tonight. Theresa I have a friend that I can talk to but she doesn't truly understand.  I agree with you, I would like to feel well.  I have spent the most part of the last 10 years sick, for the first 7 years they couldn't figure out why thats when they discovered a tumor in my ovary that was causing it all.  I just see the look that my family gives me sometimes of oh god not this again.  Most of the time I try not to say anything when something is in my head, like right now, I have had pain bad enough to wake me up at night for at least 6 months - I finally told my Dr a couple weeks ago. Fortunately she did take me seriously and is trying to help me - I have tumor in my bone but the radiologist doesn't think it is cancer but isn't sure so my Dr is sending me to Ortho.  At least she is listening.  My husband is the most loving and supportive person ever but I still think some times it is just to much for him.  I don't think I have chronic depression but I definitely have some bad days, really bad days - all I do is cry and make myself sick.  I feel bad for you because I feel some of the same things you do.",
