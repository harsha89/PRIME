    "Content": "I am in the middle of radiation treatments (tomotherapy) and up until Friday of last week my side-effects were minimal...just fatigue and some muscle soreness in my neck and arm.  I attributed the muscle soreness to the \"position\" I am in 5 days a week during treatments.  Not a big deal.  But now I have an itchy, bumpy rash on my chest which seems to be spreading to other parts of my body!  It started on the breast being treated with radiation on Friday, spread all over my chest and even my wrist/arm by Monday morning.  I didn't have any treatments over the weekend.  My radiation tech didn't seem concerned yesterday but told me to use hydrocortizone cream for the itching.  I used it twice - once after I got home from the cancer center and once before bed.  The itching is worse today and it continues to spread down my arm...I'm scared to continue treatments!  Anyone experience a rash that spreads to untreated areas of the body??",
