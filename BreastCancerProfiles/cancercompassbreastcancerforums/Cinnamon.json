      "Content": "CAN ANYONE RELATE?                 I AM THE DAUGHTER OF CANCER PATIENT. MY MOM IS SUFFERING SO BAD, ABOUT 2 YRS AGO MY MOM WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 2 BREAST CANCER. AFTER CHEMO AND RADIATION SHE BEAT IT. WE WERE ALL VERY HAPPY. I PRAYED TO GOD FOR HIM TO KEEP HER WITH US AND HE DID. I REALIZED HOW MUCH MY MOM HAD MEANT TO ME. IN 2007 OF THIS MONTH, MY MOM WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING SO SHE WENT TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT SHE HAD TUMORS IN HER LUNG. OF COURSE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF AN ERROR BUT AFTER MANY TEST, BLOOD WRK, AND CT SCANS FROM HER ONCOLOGIST, WE FOUND OUT THAT MY MOM WAS IN STAGE 4 BREAST CANCER. FROM JAN 07 TO MARCH THREE TUMORS HAD GROWN IN MY MOMS LUNG. HER DOCTOR IS JUST SAYING SORRY. I'M REALLY SCARED AND DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO OR HOW TO THINK. I HEAR HER COUGHIN ALL THE TIME AND SHE CANT STOP BECAUSE SOMEHOW SHE DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA. I'VE TRIED ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOSPITALS FOR DIFFERENT OPINIONS BECAUSE MANY DOCTORS ARE SAYING THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A CANCER THAT IS SO AGGRESSIVE. I TRY TO STAY POSITIVE BUT THE FACTS KEEP REMINDING ME THAT THEY ARE FACTS AND I'M SCARED. IF SOMEONE OUT THERE CAN HELP MY MOM, PLEASE HELP US. GOD BLESS EVERYONE OUT THERE, ESPECIALLY WITH CANCER. GOD HELP US ALL!!!",

      "Content": "hi lisa, my mom is going throuh something similar, she was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 yrs ago and she beat it, and just this mnth she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. in a 2 mnth period 3 tumors have grown in her lungs. her doctors are saying they have never seen a cancer that is so aggressive. we dont know what to do. she keeps coughing all night, its like she cant stop. i see her in pain almost most of the day. i can count on one hand how many times i saw my mom cry and now i hear her weeping in her room. the other day i heard her crying and i went in her room and she just cried uncontrollably and asked me to hold her very tight and told me she was afraid. it felt as if someone has ripped my heart out and was dancing to the beat. my stomach was turning upside down to see my mom like that. i know she would rather someone else see her in such pain than one of her children so i know she was really scared and in pain. ive been searching everywhere desperate to find answers but i haven't found them. i want to leave everything in gods hands but i would feel helpless just waiting. lisa if there is anything that you could tell me my ears are just waiting. please try to help me! god bless you and everyone else, i'll keep u all in my prayers. amen ",
