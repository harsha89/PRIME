    "Content": "I had my mastectomy in 2009 and began taking Tamoxifen.  I was switched to Arimidex because onocologist I spoke with said that it is better for post menopausal women.  I also feel tiredness but I equated it to the radiation treatments.  As for the bone aches, I experienced that during chemo and I was told by my Naturiopathic Physician to take fish oil and I found that to help with the bone and joint aches.  As for the other symptoms, I have not yet experienced and do not really look forward to them.",
