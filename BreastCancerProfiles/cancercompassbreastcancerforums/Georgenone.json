That is fine but doing absolutely nothing to help is not. There are too many doctors who do nothing, make no attempt to help with such problems. Leg problems are not all that uncommon. During infusions I sometimes had the worst possible case of restless leg syndrome. After chemo stopped there were horribly painful leg cramps every night for slightly more than a year. It is not really fair or accurate to blame it all on chemo since radiation can also cause problems. Radiation often affects nerves in the spinal column. I've never heard of any problems being permanent. It's just another annoying little problem to make the cancer treatment experience more memorable.       George",
