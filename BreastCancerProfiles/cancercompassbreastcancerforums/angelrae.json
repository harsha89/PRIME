Those two terms describe a different kind of breast cancer. My first bout was in 2003. I was ok until 4 years later. Almost exactly to the day, I was diagnosed with cancer in the lung. Metaplastic almost always goes to the lung first. I did have a nagging cough before my diagnosis. I had most of my left lung removed in August of '07. The cancer was found in my bones in December, and what is left of my left lung in April. I went on Xeloda and Avastin in April, and had amazing results in June. The nodule in my lung was completely off the scan, and the uptake in my bones was diminished. Unfortunately, my scan in August was not as good, even though I continued my chemo regiman. The cancer was small in my lung, but growing more rapidly in my bones. About three weeks ago, the scan showed that the cancer is now systemic. Ribs, hips, femur, spleen, liver, lung......I have so few choices, and it's maddening, but out of my control. I don't mean to frighten anyone. I just know that finding the metastatic cancer earlier is better than later. I hope this is beneficial to someone. Hello, Im very sorry for what you are going though.....I was wandering what stage are you at.If you were to describe how it feels,what would you say.I already had cervicle cancer and but got it taken care of.Im 51 and am feeling funny in my chest area,and have a very dry cough that nothing really calms it down until it does on its own.Sometimes when I drink water helps it sometimes,but almost always seems to want to stay dy,and make me coiugh,which hurts sometimes worst. Not sure if I have cancer or not ut I know I dont feel right.I also have sores that never want to go away,but start to then I end up having more.that keep scabbing over but wont didappear.completely.Im very tired noty wanting to do much of anything.I have no insurance,and but work part time.I even get lot of gas,and upset stomok.Sometime a strong sence of a headack,and feel like I have a cold worn out and very sleepy all the time,not wanting to do much if there needs to be alot of energy effort put forth. angelrae anyone have the same experience or similur.  Hello,I",
