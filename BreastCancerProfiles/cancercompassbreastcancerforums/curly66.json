Hello LuvLife....just read your message here and want to ask you where your cancer had matasticized to 14yrs ago and what all did you take and for how long of treatments before you were certainly blessed with life once again.  5yrs down the road and three remissions I am still dealing with ovarian cancer but have gotten thru everything quite well but need more answers and if another surgery is needed to get at those microscopic cells if that's possible.   Waiting to hear from you.   Curly66  ",

      "Content": "I got nerve damage in my feet from carbo/taxol and still deal with it months later altho it is not as bad as it was and I am on a different kind of chemo now that probably doesnt help matters but it hasnt kept me down altho it can be real bothersome.   Some people get it bad, I would say mine was average or a little above that and I did 8 taxol/carbo treatments.   There are meds the Dr. can give you to help you thru this but be sure to ask all the side effects as some can be worse than the neuropathy so I understand.   My friend has been off chemo for a year and a half and she still has mild neuropathy...I personally lost my big toe nail twice because of it and get ingrown toenails more than I ever used to.....lots of luck and unfortunately chemo gives us so many BAD side effects but we are caught between a rock and a hard spot...do chemo or not!    Hang in there is all I can say...somehow we get thru it.",
