      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the board and am hoping for some advice and guidance. I'm 33 years old and my mother and maternal grandmother are both breast cancer survivors. My mom was 42 when she got diagnosed so I started mammograms last year at 32. My first appointment was done at W&I Hospital so everything was done at one time (so wonderful). I had a regular mammo done, additional views were requested, and then a 3D ultrasound. The ultrasound found \"2 well-cicumscribed rounded masses\", \"these most likely represent intramammary lymph nodes\". It was recommended a do a 6 month follow up but we moved from RI/MA to South FL and my husband and I were doing consulting and didn't have insurance. In March I went to my primary and asked for a new Rx for the mammo and went to a local facility. They mailed a report to me saying my mammo \"requires additinal imaging studies\" but mailed one to my Dr stating my mammo was \"normal\". I was really upset so my Dr called me in for a physical exam. She found a 2 cm lump at 8 o'clock and a .5 cm nodule at 5 o'clock on my right breast, she also found a 1 cm nodule at 5 o'clock on my left breast and ordered an ultrasound. I went to a Women's Health Center instead of the previous facility and brought all of my discs and reports. I just read the report off their patient portal site and they didn't even see the lumps on the ultrasound. I should mention I have scattered fibroglandular densities so I know these things can be missed on mammo and u/s. The final notes state: \"no sonographic correlate of questioned palpable abnormalities in both breasts. Decision regarding biopsy of a pupable abnormality should be based on clinical grounds\". I'm waiting for my Dr to call with her recommendations but all of this doesn't sit well with me and I feel like I should push for a MRI. Thoughts?",
