    "Content": "I have just completed Chemo and Radiation Treatments for stage two breast cancer with 3 Positive Lymph Nodes. Glad to have that behind me. I am still experiencing sensitive feet and tiredness. My Dr. says I will benefit from taking arimidex and tamoxifen now for a total of 5 years. I have heard that these treatments also have side affects. I am wondering how beneficial they are for estrogen positive patients and would like to hear from anyone who is taking these therepies and to know what side effects you are experiencing. Also I hear conflicting ideas about eating Tofu since it has natural estrogens. Any studies on the subject would be of interest to me.",
