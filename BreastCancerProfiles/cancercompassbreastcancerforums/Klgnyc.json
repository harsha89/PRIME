    "Content": "Eight months after receiving my permanent implants, I continue to have the same symptoms you all are describing and which I've had since my double mastectomy March 2015. I'm seriously considering having them removed as no amount of PT, myofascial massage, exercise or stretching has helped. I'm seeing a physical rehab doc who has suggested Botox, but I can't imagine maintaining that regimen forever. No meds ever helped and I'm not interested in making myself a zombie anyway. Does anyone have any other suggestions?",
