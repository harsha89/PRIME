I like many others are learning to take one day at a time.. we are not in control of our lives.. our Divine Lord is , we have to wait on him and do his will. Easier said than done... Whatever, you did before the big C came along, try to keep it going... finding a counsellor may help to keep you on track... for the first time I asked myself . so much emphasis is put on cancer, yet there are people walking around with diabetes, obesity, heart issues and on and on.. they must be on a roller coaster ride too... For now, make life simple and we can all try to smell the roses... The Glass is only half full- keep a smile on and the will to choose... Take Care and God Bless PS I have gained 10 pounds since Dec. 2011, I am doing skating twice a  week and walking and sometimes the gym.. it is from the stress...",

You say you have been on Herceptin for 2 years.. what have your docs told you about taking this drug.. is there a limit to how long you can take it... do you take Xeloda as well. Do you have any research info on the outcomes when taking this drug... what are the stories with the women you know who are living for more than 10 years... I think it is wonderful that science has led to crossover use for Herceptin, ie the drug was first used on breast ca patients, but now is being used for EC patients.... Thanks,",

Wishing everyone a speedy recovery and hoping vanity has not become part of your life. My husband was diagnosed with stage iv EC and also had to take chemo and his hair went wonky, didn't lose it, but it grows in slightly curly, he complains as well.. and I have to just sigh.. trying to tell him to put it all in perspective. He's in training paints.... LOL Heads up to all....",
