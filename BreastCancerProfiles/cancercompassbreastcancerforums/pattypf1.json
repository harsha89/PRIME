    "Content": "I had the same high stage 3 breast cancer and 12 lymphnodes removed, chemo an radiation. I also chose a bilateral because of the high risk cancer I had. I was 57 and now 59.  I was first on Femara and gained so much weight I wanted to die. I came off it and started to lose weight but I had to go on Aromasin. I did a little better lost some of the weight but my stomach is a man belly. I am very embarresed at the way I look. I did Weight Watcher struggled lost five lbs -I think just water, nothing else. I have bone pain everywhere and sever muscle cramps at night. Does anyone else get muscle cramps?  I hate getting dressed to go anywhere fancy, I am depressed.  ",
