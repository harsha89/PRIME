      "Content": "I have now been off the Arimidex for just over a month.  I have to say that the depression is gone for the most part.  There are still says that I feel that way though. Fatigue is not as bad, it's not Zombie Syndrome condition anyway.  Dizziness has gone away as has the nausea. So, I may be onto something with this self-diagnosis.  I will continue without the medication until my next doctor visit so I can tell him the outcome. As for the previous comment about hypothyroidism possibly being the culprit.  I have been on thyroid meds for so many years I have lost count.  My primary care doctor keeps tabs on that.",

      "Content": "Not sure if I'm replying in the right place but I, too, have been taking arimidex for 2 1/2 years.  I had lumpectomy for stage I breast cancer, 12 weeks of chemo, and 35 radiation treatments prior to starting arimidex.  Have had joint pain and stiffness from the get go.  I did find some improvement with a gluten free diet. Now I am battling serious fatigue and depression and deciding the arimidex may be the culprit.  I took it upon myself to stop the medication for a trial period to see if things improve.  Today is just day 2 of not taking this medication so I've not seen any improvements yet.  But it is encouraging to know that I'm not imagining my symptoms.  I am a very active 57 year old and this fatigue is so out of charactor for me.  I can barely function at this point but have to muscle through.",

      "Content": "My onco sent me to a rheumatologist who prescribed Celebrex and Gabapentin.  That helped some but I found a lot of improvement by going on gluten free diet which I originally started to try and drop a few pounds.  I still have some pain but not enough to stay on heavy duty meds like Celebrex.  Some days I do resort to over the counter meds for the pain. My biggest issue at this point is the zombie fatigue syndrome (as I call it) and the depression that set in along with nausea, dizzyness, and unability to concentrate. However, it is discouraging to think my options were to either die of cancer or live with these gradually increasing side effects of the Arimidex that turn me into a depressed, decrepit old woman that the age of 57.  When prior to my diagnosis I was a very energetic, happy, active person with no indication of impending life altering disease creeping in.  Then I found that &*$%# lump.",

      "Content": "I was trying to figure out what the big risk would be of not taking the Arimidex since I had a complete hysterectomy almost 20 years ago.  I know other organs produce some estrogen but the ovaries being the main source.  If I have no ovaries I'd think estrogen production would be almost nil at age 57.  Before my BC diagnosis I was on HRT and I think that was possibly the culprit in the cancer growth.  Of course, the HRT was stopped immediately upon diagnosis. Any opinions?",

I have not seen my onco doctor since stopping the drug but I do intend to have a discussion with him about this at my next appointment in December.",
