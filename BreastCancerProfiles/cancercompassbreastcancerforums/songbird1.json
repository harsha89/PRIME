      "Content": "After my initial mammogram and ultrasound it was determined that I a nodular desity in the medial aspect of the right breast.  There were no suspicious microcalciifications seen on the compression spot magnifications views.  There was a small solid-appearing nodule in the 2;30 position approximately 3 cm from the nipple.  It is approximately 5 x 2 x 5 mm in size.  It is well-circumscribed and contains internal echoes but no shadowing.  With this a biospy was suggested.  Today I went in for my biospy, after completing a second ultrasound at the immaging office, the technician felt and told me she thought it was a lymph node.  The doctor came in and looked at the most current pictures and previous pics and agreed it was a lymph node, explaining lymph nodes are everywhere in our body but typically in the breast area they are located near the underarm area.  She said it was my decision to go forward with the biospy and I elected not to since I felt convinced it was not something I needed to worry about for now.  I will have a six month checkup and if anythng changes or if I change my mind I can then elect to have one.  What are you thought as to my decision.  Thank you",

      "Content": "I recently had a mammogram and was called back for a second x-ray on by right breast.  I was told and did see a small white cell-like under and close to my nipple.  After a second set of x-ray were completed a sonogram was performed.  I received a letter from the medical foundation saying the radiologist is recommending further evaluation in order to obtain a more definite diagnosis than is being provided by the imaging alone.  I will contacting my Doctor soon, but wondered what is the next type of evaluation and has this ever happen to anyone else.  I really feel like I need to talk to someone and hope someone will respond.  Thank you.",
