      "Content": "Hi, Sorry to hear about your Metaplastic Breast Cancer-I too am a patient for the same kind of cancer.. Completed my Chemo treatments 1 year ago and am going in for my checkk up-this is my 1st check up in 6 months so I am really nervous. I would love to keep in touch with you and see how you are doing.  I f I might ask, what kind of treatment did you receive after your surgery?  I took TAXOL and some other chemo-the  Taxol is supposed to be the best treatment for this type of cancer,  However the side effects are not so hot.  Good luck and keep in touch.... ~carol",

      "Content": "My name is Carol I am 71 years old and very active and, other than the July Dx of Metaplastic breast cancer, considered in good health. I had a double masteotomy July 27th. Tumor was about 4.0 cm range. I am now waiting for my 1st chemo treatment. It will be At Penrose Hospital, in CO Springs, CO. My Oncologist is Dr. Burke. My chemo will be CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (cytoxan, neosar) AND DOXORUBICIN (Adriamycin, Rubex). The whole expierience has been a nightmare, mostly due to insurance problems, which included wanting to have the surgery done on a OUT PATIENT basis, to being denied a 2nd opinion, to denying medicine to help nausea with the chemo. I managed to win some and lose some. In any case I found it deplorable when it becomes incumbant on the patient to solve these miserable problems, as if I did not have enough to worry about. Enough of that and thank you for reading it. I would like to hear from anyone out there who has had this type of chemo treatment. Also, anyone out there who has metaplastic cancer who would like to correspond with me regarding feelings and treatment I would deeply appreciate hearing from you. Carol",

      "Content": "Hi, Sorry to hear about your Mom. After completion of my first round of Chemo my Dr. strongly suggested that I do a second round of Chemo - this time using TAXOL.sp? I did it and it was a lot more toxic than the first chemo but it was certainly bearable....According to my Dr. it is supposed to increase my changes by an additional 10% (only time will tell). So far other than left over side effects I am doing just fine-even getting some hair back-abeit unlike any hair I have ever had. LOL. I wish I could tell you more. I hope I make it long enough to be able to tell you that it was all a great success...For now I live 3 months at a time. Every three months I go for my tests and hold my breath till I get the results and then God willing the results are good I get out and live and do all I can till the next time. I wish you and your Mom the best-If I can be of any assistance please do not hesitate to E me. Live life to the fullest and try to laugh often. Laughter is healing.... Carol",
