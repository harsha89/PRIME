      "Content": "When I had surgery on my breast, I received a camisole/tanktop that was pretty and practical.  It had little pockets for the drains that were required to be in for a few days after surgery.  It also came with pads.  It made the perfect thing to wear under zip up sweatshirts or other comfortable, easy to get on shirts. The hospital I had surgery at had them in a breast cancer library and store area. If you can find one, it might make a nice gift for your mom, along with some of the other great ideas you got here from others.  I like the pajamas and lotions ideas too. Best regards to you, your mom and family.  ",
