      "Content": "How old are you? Ever been told you had uterine fibroids? Ovarian cysts? Maybe you're just perimenopausal. If they suggest pulling all your reproductive organs, and you either have enough kids or you're not clinging to the notion of having any, consider it. If you belong to SHARE or any of those groups, ask the other ladies if it's common for breast cancer to metastasize to the reproductive organs -- I never heard that, myself. I had the TAH-BSO and it was pretty easy, you can't even see the scar. I tried to get them to do a tummy tuck while they were at it, but it was a VA hospital, so I suppose I was lucky they could do a female operation at all!",
