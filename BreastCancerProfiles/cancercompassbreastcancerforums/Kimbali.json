    "Content": "HI everyone, I'm hoping someone can share some real experience on the following with me.  My mother was recently diagnosed with Breast cancer stage 2. She started her fist chemo infusion a month ago. She has been taking CBD drops along side as well as a cbd creame that she applys tooically on the spot, and a few days ago a friend managed to send us some Rick Simpson oil from a dispensary in Canada (we are in germany). She started taking it yesterday. My question is tho, will it do anything taking it along side with the chemo therapy or you think she should wait until the chemo therapy is done, or stop the chemo therapy? It's so overwheöming, there is so much information everywhere. Here in Germany it is also hard to have support for alternative therapy. As she is not working, insurance has covered a percentage of her salary but that is only possible if she follows the therapy that is presented to her. So doing it alternatively is simply a bit difficult for us to finance.  Tomorrow she will have the first check up since chemo and taking the CBD drops, I am super curious and will post updates here.  If anyone has any experience or inflation to share with me I would highly appreciate it. Thank you in advance! ",
