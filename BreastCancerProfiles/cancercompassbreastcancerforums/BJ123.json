All imagery tests including PET and CT did not detect it. The only way it was detected was with a lapascopy. Pathology indicated ER+PR- Her2+3 The biopsy is most important to which way to go. Heavy chemo didnt do much. Femara worked for about 5 months and Armidex for about 3 months. She is now on Aromasin. Onc said it was as good as Fasoldex without the injection. We are hoping it will work. How was you spread detected?",

I was given 3 sessions of Taxitere, had a scan last week & it's not working. My onc has switched me to Taxol & Gemzar, started that last Friday-had a very rough week last week after all this news. I had cancer 3 years ago & thought I was doing great. My husband left 2 years ago cuz he couldn't handle it & sometimes I feel very alone although I have great friends & family. I stumbled upon this site & hope it will help with suggestions & coping. I can't take any hormones, as I am er-hr-. I am going to try some alternative medicines & am radically trying to change my diet-NO SUGAR! anyway-love to hear from anyone who can perk me up! Thanks Linda    My wife has been Dx with this rare metastis to the peritoneal about a year and a half ago. She has been through multiple aromatase inhibitor drugs but none are currently working. This is her second recurrence since her first bout in 1990. The onc is trying to get her started on Tykerb. Could you let us know what treatments you have had and how you are currently doing? Thanks",
