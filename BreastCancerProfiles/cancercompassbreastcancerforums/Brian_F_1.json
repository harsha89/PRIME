      "Content": "I too had to have a repeat mammo a year ago. They also did an ultrasound of the breast. I ended up being ok. They said mine was a cyst. I know you're scared, I was too. All I could think of was what will happen to my kids. We have a 19 year old multi-handicapped daughter, a daughter 16 and 2 sons 12 and 20 years old. The personnel at the mammography told me not to worry, a lot of women have to come back for repeat mammo's, and they are fine. They say that lots of the repeats turn out to be OK. I'll pray for you that you get good news like I did!",
