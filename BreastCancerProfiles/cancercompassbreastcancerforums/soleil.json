      "Content": "I was also told I have Fibrocystic breast disease many years ago.  I am 42 and started getting mammograms about three years ago.  On my third mammogram, I was asked to return for a follow-up because they saw something they weren't sure of.  From there, they sent me for an ultrasound where they decided what they thought they had seen was not a problem.  However, on ultrasound, they spotted a small 5 mm density which had not been detected on the mammogram.  From there, I was sent fora biopsy which came back positive.  I don't know the cost of ultrasounds, but it might be worth inquiring if they could check you out with that instead of an expensive MRI. ",

      "Content": "I was told last week that I have Stage 1 IDC.  I have pretty much decided I am getting amastectomy, but cannot decide between implant or flap reconstruction.  I would love to hear from other woman who had to make the same decision and to know if you are happy with your decisoin.   Would you make the same choice if you had to do it again?  And has anyone with silicone implants had problems with leaks?  The plastic surgeon I spoke with said it's a myth that silicone leaks makes women sick.  I know have heard contrary.  Any comments???",

      "Content": "I just got on this site today and was going to write an article and what you wrote is probably almost identical to my situation.  I have just been diagnosed with Stage 1 invasive ductral carcinoma of the breast.  I have been given the same options as you:  Lumpectomy with 30 radiation treatments; or, mastectomy.  No one has talked to me about estrogen postive or anything either.  I am in the process of doing some research to try and make an informed decision.  I have an appointment with a plastic surgeon on Monday.  At this point I am leaning towards the mastectomy with flap reconstruction.  I am 42 with four children. That is my questoin also to other woman who have been given these two alternatives.l  Those of you who have chosen mastectomy, are you happy with your decision?  And those of you who chose lumpectomy, are you happy with your decision?  And to both groups, if you would do it differently, why?  And to anyone out there who went through this, would anyone recommend getting a second opinion?    ",
