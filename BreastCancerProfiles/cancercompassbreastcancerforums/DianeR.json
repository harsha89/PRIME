I found this site tonight and there were discussions of women who have or have had the same. Her prognosis is not good and I see from the conversations that lots of women who are doing well have had Chemo and radition. I am trying to find out where some of you who are having success with this cancer are being treated. I have contacted one well known cancer center and they said they would look at her records and see if there was anything they could do to help but her oncologist said there was nothing that could be done. I am grasping at straws but I want to help her. I believe another set of eyes may help. She believes in her dr. but I see conversations where people are living and recovering from this and I want her to have a chance at help if something else can be done. If anyone will give me the name of  where they were treated for metaplastic breast cancer with good results I would be forever grateful. Hi.  I am 51 years old. I was diagnosed with metaplastic breast cancer with 3 lymphnodes involved in October of 2008. When the MRI was done, I found out that I also had a different type of cancer in the other breast, and therefore opted for a double mastectomy.  I am being treated at Danbury Hospital, Praxair Cancer Center in Danbury CT.  I am going to complete my chemotherapy tomorrow and then begin radiation therapy. My oncologist will schedule me for CT scans every 3 months for 2 years just to be sure there is nothing else growing that shouldn't be there.  My dad passed of pancreatic cancer and my mom, still living, had a \"garden variety\" breast cancer as did her sister (my aunt).  They did not require chemo nor radiation.  I am scared of a recurrence, but I have to trust that all will be well.  Where do you live?
