      "Content": "I would like to know what other women who have breast cancer are doing for their check-ups and how often? I have been taking Tamoxifen for three years. I see my oncology doctor every six months and have a mammogram once a year. Do I wait for the next ache or pain or should I be getting an annual checkup once a year. Every little ache or pain I get scares me and hate to bother the doctor. Someone please advise me if I should insist on more check-ups. Yvonne",

      "Content": "I am in remission from breast and uterine cancer taking the drug Tamoxifen for three years now. I sincerely try to follow a good nutritional cancer diet and am taking the recommended supplements. Also try to get an adequate amount of walking. Every ache and pain scares me. Is cancer coming back somewhere else in my body? Wish there was a test to tell if there is cancer starting somewhere. I have resumed my life style as before except for the never-ending concern of a new cancer popping up. What more do I need to do to keep this awful dread away? Yvonne",
