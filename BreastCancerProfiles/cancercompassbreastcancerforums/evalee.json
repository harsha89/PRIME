      "Content": "Hi Bonnie, Just want to let you know that I finished my chemo back in August of this year and luckily no bad side effects.  Maybe it'll turn out that way for you too.  And then I went onfor radiation and lo and behold that ended too.  Luckily, no severe side effects.  I did get some foot swelling and tiredness but no big deal.  I got medicine to take for nausea but luckily never needed it.  Things are normal now, more or less.  I just am hesitant to go take another mammogram but I guess I have to. Anyway, good lluck to you! Eva",

I know I'm new here and I hope i'm not being intrusive, but I heard about this movie, Living Proof, that will be on lifetime tv tomorrow night (the 18th) at 9pm. It\u2019s a real touching true story based on the book Her-2, which if you don\u2019t know is about the oncologist and researcher Dr. Dennis Slamon, and his struggle behind developing the drug Herceptin and getting it approved. As a result of his efforts thousands of lives have been saved. I think it will be a touching movie and I wanted to share it with everyone here. There is more information right here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0F__IfeUXg God Bless I watched and related.  I had a mixture of emotions--happy, sad, association etc.  It was great seeing women who benefited and yet sad hearing of women who didn't.  It was definitely worth watching for me.",

I'm now taking arimidex, only been on it for a few months, and so far so good.  No nausea or pains and hopefully not coming.  Maybe taking a pain reliever would help out in some way .  Have you spoken to your doctor?  He might also have something to help side effects.   Good luck!
