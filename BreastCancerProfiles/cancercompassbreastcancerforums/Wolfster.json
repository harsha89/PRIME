    "Content": "There is a lot of good information in these posts, and enough contradiction to illustrate how confusing it all can be.  I've done a lot of study since my own diagnosis of ovarian cancer 2 years ago, and for the most part agree with the first reply posted.  I'd like to add that there is a known link between gluten intolerance (Celiac disease) and some cancers, and I personally feel patients with particular cancers - and I include ovarian cancer in that list - should be checked using a blood test and if that comes up negative, an endoscopy. Also, people are so different that while a high-protein diet may be just right for one person, it may leave another feeling absolutely awful and in ill health.  Everyone is different and it's important to assess your own bodily needs and metabolism.  I agree that refined sugar is an enemy, and high-fructose corn syrup is its even-more-evil twin.  Medical records talk of sugar addiction since it has been widely available, a good 200 years ago, and I don't trust anything that can get you hooked by its inherent nature.  Even setting aside the argument of whether cancer feeds on it, the room refined sugar takes in your body could be filled instead with actual nutrients that could be doing you some good. One thing to take into account though, is that diet is not the only thing that can affect cancer.  Someone who eats a healthy diet can be exposed to a dizzying array of problems that can impact the immune system and the body in harmful ways.  I hope you've already looked into that side of it, but in case you haven't, some things beside diet to consider: Are you sleeping enough, not too much, and is that good-quality sleep? How much stress do you have daily, and can you find ways to reduce it? Are you getting the right amount of exercise? Not too little but not too much? Do you do things that studies are showing maybe harmful or that the jury is still out on like: using an electric blanket; microwaving to much of your food, esp in plastic; drinking hot beverages out of plastic (such as a commuter mug); using a cell-phone too much, and not using a hands-free headset with it (some studies are linking that in particular to tumors of the head and face, particularly salivary glands); living in a city or environment that is polluted by particulates, pesticides and fertilizer dust, etc. Do you avoid the sun totally (bad idea) and have your vitamin D levels been tested? Do you use dark hair color? Do you use body products, including soap and shampoo, and/or makeup with carcinogenic ingredients? Body product companies VERY often take advantage of loopholes in the law that allow them to use chemicals that are untested and potentially quite dangerous, and that allow them to label their products as natural or organic when they are most certainly anything BUT. And there are plenty of other things I have not even gotten into here, that could have an effect.  Each individual has to take stock of their own lifestyle and decide where the danger levels are, and what they can and what they are willing to change to make it healthier all around.",
