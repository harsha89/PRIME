    "Content": "Hi Liz- I also read that RAI for thyroid cancer can slightly increase the risk for breast cancer. My onc who treated my breast cancer agreed but said in my case, the pros outweighed the cons. Too young for a mammo? Tell your gyno that my breast cancer was diagnosed at 30. The mammo was not an effective tool for me though...it's not that they can't do them for young gals but the dense breast tissue can render them useless. However, they should not dismiss your need for an evaluation just because of your age. While a mammo may not be useful, it may not hurt and may give good baseline info that they can use in the ultrasound and also an MRI if needed to evaluate breast health. And for sure, fire the doc that does not take you seriously. Good luck!",
