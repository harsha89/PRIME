    "Content": "You guys seem to be quite knowledgeable about this stuff. Here's my quandary. I had a rare facial angiosarcoma about 2 years ago, had it cut out, then radiation. A month ago, a lump showed up in my salivary gland, turned out to be same thing metastatic, they did a 6 hour parotidectomy two weeks ago, now more rads coming up. I have eaten like a monk and exercised for 30 years. Fish, chicken, fruits and veggies. And some wine. LOL Didn't apparently help...so I'm considering a \"ketosis\" diet a friend gave me, who's been in remission for a couple years and believes this is the answer. I ain't real sure, but since what I was doing didn't keep this from coming back, I am more than ready to try ANYTHING else to keep it at bay. This surgery/radiation thing is getting kinda old. And I've got way too many good things to do with my life to knuckle under to this. Anyone have any experience with this diet? It's a zero carb (which seems to be about 90% of most foods!) high fat diet but using decent foods, not the crap that Atkins wanted you to eat. Would be interested in any data or thoughts anyone had. Thanks. Rik",
