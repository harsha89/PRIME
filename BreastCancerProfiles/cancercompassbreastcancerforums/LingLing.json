      "Content": "I used to have nice long thick hair b4 chemo. I was done with radiation Aug 06 till now my hair is only 3 inches long center top straight. 10 inches in the back very curly and 15 inches on both side with a little curl. my hair now is so thin that I don't know what to do. I look so weird with this new hair I wish I can have my previous hair back. is anyone know anything about the eye lash? I still don't have any right now.",
