      "Content": "I have been reading about paxil and it's relationship to breast cancer.  Are there any breast cancer fighters out there who used Paxil for anxiety &/or depression before being dx with breast cancer?  I stopped taking paxil 6 months ago after I did some research on this study, and I don't feel well.  I would like to resume taking it, but don't want to increase my risk.  Thanks for any new information you've heard. :)",

      "Content": "I have one quick question.  Is the Paxil/breast cancer risk saying it increases the risk of 'getting' breast cancer or is it saying it increases the risk of dying from it if you take it during treatment for breast cancer?  I know there are so many of us who have relied on this tablet for years, and my doctor told me it was absolutely safe. (10 years ago)    I asked my doctor during my physical, and she hadn't even heard of this study done by City of Hope and 443 women.  Anyone out there with information about this?  God bless!",
