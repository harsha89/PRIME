    "Content": "Greetings all, I was referred to this site by a very close friend, whose mother just recently passed of ailments related to pancreatic cancer. The past two weeks have been very difficult for me. On July 15th, my mother, the joy and strenghth of my life informed me that she had found a lump in her breast. The past weeks have been so crazy....however, on yesterday I learned that my mother has breast cancer. Her pet scan is scheduled for next week and I will have more information. It is so hard for me because I reside 1400 miles from her. Of course, I will plan to go home to be with her during this process, but in the mean time...it's really tough. I will use this site for support, education and just as a sounding board to help us through the journey. On last year, I began an advocacy role in the fight against breast cancer for others....not knowing that this too would be apart of my personal life. I am strong and so is she. Together with the grace and mercy of God we will make it! Thanks for having this site Angela",
