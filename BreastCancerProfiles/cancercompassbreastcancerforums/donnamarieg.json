      "Content": "I have no clue to your mom's cancer, but I want you to know that people do care.   You may not get the answer you want, but your message was read. I wish I could give you an intelligent answer, but I am clueless sometimes.  I am just going through \"probable\" cancer of the breast.  This after having both parents die from cancer/alzheimer's.  Life sucks sometimes, then I just hug my hubby, it makes life worthwhile. My dad died 3 years ago.  And before my beloved mom died last April, I had to abide by her wishes made when she was pre-alzheimer's.  I did what I could.  Maybe your Mom is not giving up, but giving in.  Help her along the way, we will all go there at some time.    I helped my mom die last April, I was afraid, every day, and I still miss her EVERY day.  I just tried to make every last day a happly day.  It is hard, and it is scary, but you can do it.    Maybe she would like to go out for breakfast, or to a park: whatever makes her happy.  It could be just sitting in the sunshine, that is what we did in my Mom's last days. Don't be afraid, do something every day with her that you can, something that makes her last days enjoyable.  It doesn't need to be much, just something normal.      You are not alone.  When I read your message, it reminds me of myself and what I too felt.     ",

      "Content": "i appreciate your answer.  You were right to say don't panic, but it was hard to not do so.  I know that most breast cancers are highly treatable, however the physician's assistant I go to said \"breast cancer\" about 8 times.  Every time I saw her, she said that she thought I had breast cancer, and her reasons were totally scarry....Thinking I should be pro-active, I looked this up on the internet and... thought I am doomed.   From her description, I thought this was inflamatorry breast cancer, and that is very deadly.  I thought I may not make it to the end of the year.    Anyhow, after 2 mammograms, 2 ultrasounds,  and 1 MRI (done by a breast cancer specialist), I find that I ONLY have an infection.  God, I am so relieved.  And now the \"lump\" that was the size of a tennis ball is now the size of a quarter, 4 more days of the 2nd anti-biotic.  I am still not happy with the first doctor who led me to believe that this was the end...and it is just an infection after all.  Thank you God!",
