I feel a very painful lump about the size of a half of a Ping pong ball and another smaller lump near it. The techs said they could feel it but not see anything. If we can all feel something, then I'm not crazy and there's something there that doesn't belong! 2 years ago I went through the same thing. I went in with a surgeon for a third opinion and he said it was normal breast tissue. Am I crazy in thinking normal breast tissue should not feel like a large and now a small lump and hurt? I feel like I'm a hypochondriac, but it hurts and it's not normal whatever it is. My doctor should be calling me on Monday with the results after the images are read by a radiologist. I'm not sure what to do if the come back negative, knowing that there's something there. :( This reply isn't totally on-topic with the thread here but just want to let you know, alabamagirl, that you aren't alone. I also have a tender, painful lump area in one breast along with a small, roundish spot near the midline (same breast).  My mamm reports always come back stating I have dense breast tissue.  My gyn has never suggested a sonogram and this week I called her office, complained to the nurse, got an appointment (Fri, 9/19), she checked me, and then made an appointment for me (Wed, 9/24) for a unilateral diagnostic mammogram and a sonogram.  It's my understanding that a diagnostitician can only rule out cancer completely with a biopsy.  Visual interpretation from mamm/sono-grams and MRI's can strongly suggest cysts, density, calcifications, etc but a core needle biopsy may be between 97-100% accurate in giving a diagnosis.  I hope you get answers soon.  Keep us posted.",

Don't wait for the scheduler to set up the biopsy appointment, Jenny...you go ahead, call the office, and state your case, and tell them when you're available.  The 2nd round of mammograms took more views than the January visit so consider it helpful, more conclusive and not a time waste. :) I went through the same kind of experience (2 sets of mamms, no ultrasound) and finally saw a breast specialist who helped me understand more about breast density that makes imaging a challenge to 'read'.  Good luck and let us know how it goes!",

      "Content": "The idea is that a cancer diagnosis is not an automatic death sentence within a given timeline anymore. With early-mid late diagnosis and treatment options available today the treatment kicks cancer ass or keeps it contained to a minimum which, with regular appointments and scans almost makes it like a chronic condition. Emphasis is on longevity.  That's my understanding at least.   Good news?  Yes, to see cancer as a pesky chronic condition to stay on top of and defeat.  My husband views it that way!",

The aches/pains maybe tied to hormonal shifts...and last but not least, do you consume alot of caffeine? Most of all have a sit-down discussion with your pcp or gynecologist and go over your mammogram results along with family history specifics. I'd go for the 3-d mamm.Health insurance currently won't cover....I'm planning on one next year and will pay for it myself if necessary. Good luck.",
