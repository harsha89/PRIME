    "Content": "My mother had breast cancer in 1975. She underwent a radical mastectomy w/o reconstruction. Followed by 6 weeks of cobalt radiation at UVA. She has lived a relatively normal lifestyle with her Faith being at the forefront. My question is about the side effects of the radiation treatment. I've been trying to read things online & become more informed. The information seems to be limited. Does anyone have first hand knowledge or maybe another resource for information about the side effects of radiation used to treat breast cancer in the mid 1970's?",
