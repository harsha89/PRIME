    "Content": "I finished up TAC and rads last Nov 05 only to be diagnosed with mets to my liver, lungs and lymph nodes this last July 07.  Been taking Gemzar & Taxol since then. Had a CAT scan last week and am patiently waiting outcome.  Like you I worry, a lot, I also hurt, but I do what it is my doc says for me to do at this point. Hope I make it to my 40th birthday next year, but you never know.  Never been married and no kids or significant other, makes it easier for me, I do not have to worry about others.",
