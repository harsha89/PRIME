She started her fist chemo infusion a month ago. She has been taking CBD drops along side as well as a cbd creame that she applys tooically on the spot, and a few days ago a friend managed to send us some Rick Simpson oil from a dispensary in Canada (we are in germany). She started taking it yesterday. My question is tho, will it do anything taking it along side with the chemo therapy or you think she should wait until the chemo therapy is done, or stop the chemo therapy? It's so overwheöming, there is so much information everywhere. Here in Germany it is also hard to have support for alternative therapy. As she is not working, insurance has covered a percentage of her salary but that is only possible if she follows the therapy that is presented to her. So doing it alternatively is simply a bit difficult for us to finance.  Tomorrow she will have the first check up since chemo and taking the CBD drops, I am super curious and will post updates here.  If anyone has any experience or inflation to share with me I would highly appreciate it. Thank you in advance!  Hi there, I have been reseraching this for my sister.  I have read that depending on the type of breast cancer (ER+/PR+ or HER2+) the ratio of THC to CBD is important.  THC apparently can cause ER+ breast cancers to grow.  I believe RSO is high in THC and low in CBD.  Whereas the ratio needs to be probably 1:1 for ER+ and can be as high as 4:1 for other types but 1:1 seems to cover many ailments.  So CBD oil and RSO oil are not necessarily the same thing, as the former is usually majority CBD with a small amount of THC.  From what I have read, CBD oil can help with nausea and other side effects of chemo and probably not contra-indicative.  I am not a doctor or specialist, so it is best to research depending on what type of cancer your mum has and know the source of anything you use.",
