      "Content": "Hi, sound like we have the same story. I had breast cancer recurrance after 9 years as well. I was told I had a problem with my discs when all along it was cancer in the spine. I took six months of pain before they figured it out. So, here I am with metastatic breast cancer to bones and lungs, stage 4. However, I have been surviving stage 4 since 2004. Yes, it is a nightmare to begin the journey again. I had chemo the first time. I am not doing it this time. I have been managing with femera and zometa. Now I am taking aromasin.",

      "Content": "First, I want to say that I am very happy for you. It seems that the media and society looks at a person with stage 4 cancer as being at death's door. I am happy to hear that more and more people are living longer. I have had stage 4 breast cancer since 2004. However, I rely very heavy on Alternative medicine. I had 5 weeks of radiation, but no chemo. I also try to stay positive, live healthy, take supplements and use holistic healing to strenghten my immune system and detoxify my body.",

      "Content": "Hi Ann, I am taking both. I had a cancerous lump in my breast in 2004. It was about 2 cm in diameter. I started taking large doses of Ellagic and drank Essiac tea every day. It took about 2 weeks and I felt the lump feeling softer, and the pain in my chest go away. After 2 months the lump was gone entirely. I chose not to do radiation or chemo. The lump never returned, but I did have a recurrence of cancer last year in my spine. I am now back on ellagic and essiac and will have Pet scan to see results in July.",
