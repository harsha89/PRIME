    "Content": "I stopped taking aromatase inhibitors almost 3 months ago and still have knee pain and jt. stiffness. Doc says I dont have arthritis. I have been taking them for 3 years. I'm unable to hold out for the 5years as I now have stomach problems from a combo of the AI's and NSAIDs for the pain. Has anyone gotten all better after having pain whileÂ taking these meds? I trust the answers I get here more than I would my docs! Thanks for your time and help.",
