The short documentary will feature a famous U.K, artist. We are looking for patients and patient advocates to join us in the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday, January 19th. Your voice and experience will contribute to a call to action to help ensure that no woman is denied a second opinion when faced with a breast cancer diagnosis; is overtreated; or is not provided the appropriate care according to her risk of recurrence. It is our collective responsibility to change the future of breast cancer!  This event will not only be impactful, it will be memorable for all who participate. To learn more or confirm your spot, please private reply to this post by January 4th.  Details: Saturday, January 19, 2019 Time Commitment: 2-4 hours Location: SF Bay Area, CA Food, Beverages, and Transportation stipend will be provided",
