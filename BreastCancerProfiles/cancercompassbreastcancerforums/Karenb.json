      "Content": "I don't have breast cancer, but my Mom and two of my sisters do, so I am very proactive with my doctors. I would not cancel your appointment with the surgeon. Diagnosis of breast cancer is made through a process called triple assessment, which includes clinical examination, imaging procedures (e.g., mammogram, breast ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI scan]), and biopsy (surgical removal of tissue for microscopic examination) of a mass detected by physical examination or mammogram (x-ray of the breast). I would not listen to the technician. Let the surgeon review your imaging and then go from there. Karen",

      "Content": "I had neuropathy in my feet and hands as a result of Oxaliplatin for my colon cancer chemotherapy. I took L-glutamine, 500 mg daily. I noticed a difference in about a week and after a month it was virtually gone. I finished the bottle and haven't had any problems since. I had problems also with cold - I keep my feet covered, used gloves when handling cold/frozen items. Drinking cold beverages was a problem also. The cold sensitivity has also subsided. Good luck",

      "Content": "I have almost completely reversed my nerve damage (from 5-FU). I took 500 mg of the vitamin L-Glutamine daily for about 2 months. I am back to typing 80 words a minute and I can grip slip on shoes and flip flops again. My hands were so bad that I had no grip strength and I was dropping things. I could only wear tie on shoes. The \"pins and needles\" feeling was uncomfortable. It felt like my feet were asleep. I asked my doctor before beginning and he said it was okay. He said there aren't any studies on L-Glutamine, just ancedotal reports like mine. Good luck. Karen",
