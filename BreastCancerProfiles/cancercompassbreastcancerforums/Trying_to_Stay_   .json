    "Content": "Hello, I know your story well, my mother has also had cancer 3 times which most recently has developed into leptomeningeal disease (carcinoma meningitis). She has been very dizzy, nauseated, vomitting and has difficulty walking. We will be meeting with new doctors April 20, 2005 to discuss Intrathecreal Chemotherapy. Can anyone share their stories of how this treatment worked for them..... Or stories of how this disease progresses in the person suffering from it.... I`d like to have more information so that our family knows what to expect and what it is we are dealing with. Thank you.",
