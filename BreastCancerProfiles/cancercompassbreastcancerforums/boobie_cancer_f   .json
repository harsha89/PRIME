    "Content": "Hello all! I just wanted to introduce myself as I am new to this site. My name is Melissa or as I like to refer to myself \"boobie cancer fighting princess\". I was diagnosed with Stage IIA breast cancer- Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Carcinoma In Situ- on March 15, 2007 at the age of 31. I am a BRCA2 carrier so I underwent a bi-lateral mastectomy on May 3rd (my dad's bday) immediately followed by reconstruction. I just underwent my second surgery for the reconstruction on July 16 (day before my 32nd bday). I start radiation in August and am currently taking Tamoxifen. I do not have to do Chemo, as I was randomly selected to not have that treatment as part of a clinical trial that I am participating in. I start my ovarian cancer screenings in August as well. Anyway...that is my BC story. One of the hardest parts for me is that I do not have a \"caregiver\" being that I am not married or in a relationship, do not have any children, and my closest family members are 42 miles from where I live. So I do everything myself and that is only compounded by the fact that I'm back at work and am an insomniac. Good day all!",
