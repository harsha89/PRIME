    "Content": "Someone very close to me is currently suffering from breast cancer and is going through chemotherapy. She is considering Cold Cap therapy. I was wondering if anyone out there had gone through this process and what they thought of it. She is considering either using Penguin Cold Caps or Dignicaps. Is it painful? Is it expensive? Are there side effects? Any pros and cons or advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thankyou very much",
