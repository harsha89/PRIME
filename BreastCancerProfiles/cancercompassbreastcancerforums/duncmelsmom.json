    "Content": "Today I learned I have breast cancer.  I have so many questions. Here's my situation: I found a lump in my armpit that turned out to be breast cancer.  Cancer is in my lymph node, but I need an MRI done to find the source.  No cancer is appearing on the mammograms or ultrasounds.  After the MRI I'll meet with an oncologist to talk about treatment. My doctor said that this happens about 2x a year in his first time patients.  I hope that because I acted on this lump, it's very minor.   Have you had cancer in your lymph node but not in your breast?  Please share you story! How long will I have treatment?  Is this going to be expensive?  Could I have cancer in other places?",
