    "Content": "my flap needs a little tweeking, unfortunately due to health insurance change my plastic surgeon is no longer part of the network :( So I consulted a new one who suggested the lipo and and fat injections. Former surgeon was  VERY opposed to this method, he says likely the fat will be absorbed into system and has little faith that a positive change will be the outcome. So I am going to wait until I can see my original surgeon. to come up with a better solution, even though it means waiting until new insurance time rolls around. If I were you I would get another opinion or two. Best of luck",
