      "Content": "Hey, Judy I was plagued with implant problems for years - one implant finally eroded through the skin and had to be removed. On June 13th of this year, I had the DIEP procedure performed by Dr. Frank DellaCroce in New Orleans. It was a complete success. You will definitely be sore for several more weeks - don't get discouraged - each day gets easier and easier. Take care of yourself and get as much rest as possible and try to walk each day - it really helps. Let me know how you are doing.",

      "Content": "Dear the Suz, I have been plagued with reconstruction problems - eight operations trying to get implants to work - one implant finally eroded through the skin and had to be removed. I, too, had life threatening infections due to the implants. On June 13th of this year, I had DIEP surgery in New Orleans performed by Frank DellaCroce - it has been a Godsend. The surgery did take some recovery time but was well worthwhile. I have had absolutely no complications from this surgery and my chest looks amazing after only the first phase of the DIEP reconstruction process. Look into this procedure - visit the website www.breastcenter.com - you will be amazed. I do have osteoporosis but no chlosterol or heart problems. Good luck - let me know how you are doing.

      "Content": "Dear the Suz, I have been taking BioResponse DIM for about 6 years. I too am estrogen receptor positive. I had a bi-lateral mastectomy in 1999 (11 positve lymph nodes). I refused the conventional treatment of toxic chemotherapy, radiation and at the time bone marrow transplant (this was stopped when it was found out that the only clinical trial that supported the use of a marrow transplant was falsified). I have blood work done every 3 months (cancer markers are normal) and CT & PET scans yearly(all negative (so far) for cancer. Good Luck.",
