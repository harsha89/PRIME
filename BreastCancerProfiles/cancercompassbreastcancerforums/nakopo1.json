      "Content": "Hi I just had a MRI and the doctor is doing a biopsy that he says looks suspiscious.  He said if it is cancer than I will have to have a bilateral mastectomy.  I am all game for that.  But if its benign he said he was not sure.  I have 3 masses on the left breast & 4 lumps and 2 masses on the right.  He also said he could not biopsy the 2 smaller ones.  I feel so I don't have to go through this all over in 3 months that I should have a bilateral mastectomy.  Does a patient have a right to ask for one? and will insurance cover it. Thanks",
