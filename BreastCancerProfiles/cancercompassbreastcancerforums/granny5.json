      "Content": "I wonder if anyone has experience with this medication.  My doctor is concerned about me getting osteoporosis since my numbers indicate I''m close to having it.  Taking calcium pills in addition to Boniva doesn't seem to be helping very much.  I recently started taking Arimedex to hopefully prevent any more problems.  1.5 years ago I had DCIS and had two lumpectomies.  My doctor, as well as two other doctors, encouraged me to take the Arimedex.  After having a bone density test she now recomends for me to take Zomeda intraveneously twice a year.  The main problematic side effect is the possibility of getting jaw necrosis.  After reading about it, I know I don't want to get it.  Anyone have any experience with this drug.  Thank you, Linda",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed in August of 2013 with insitu Stage 0 breast cancer or precancer.  I can't remember the exact name.  Anyway I had two lumpectomies and my surgeon strongly urged me to see a medical oncologist who recommended taking Tamoxifen and a radiation oncologist who recommended radiation.  After the surgery the borders were clean and since it was stage 0, I'm leaning toward doing no further treatment but having another mammogram in 6 months.  I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on my situation.  Linda",
