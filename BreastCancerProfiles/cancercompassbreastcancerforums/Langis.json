    "Content": "I am taking Aromasin and the musculoscelettal pain is overwhelming. It has completely taken my quality of life away. I am 47 but feel like 90. There is a drug called Celebrex which seems to ease the pain. I haven't tried it but I have communicated with others who have. bcaction.org is conducting an easy to do online survey of experiences with Aromatase inhibitors. They want to use info to inform FDA, docs and pharma companies about the range and extent of side effects. Many women are tired of having their experiences minimized or dismissed. Go to bcaction.org, click on what's new, survey is towards bottom of the page. Hugs from France",
