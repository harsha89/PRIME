      "Content": "My wife, 27, was diagnosed with LC from stage 4 stomach cancer on 2/4/16, coming from no risk factor or prior health problem. After 16 days in the ICU to treat hydrocephalus from the LC she showed remarkable recovery after some intrathecal Methotrexate and then installation of VP shunt and (which meant no more intrathecal), with KPS going from 30 to 90. She's been doing well at home for over a month now without outward symptoms or obvious side effect from chemo. Plan is to continue the MTX and systemic chemo via IV. We know what LC means. Life has to go on, even if just a day at a time.",
