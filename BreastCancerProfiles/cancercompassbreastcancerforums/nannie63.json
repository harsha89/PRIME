      "Content": "Hi Bonnie, I too have breast cancer that has spread to my bones, every bone in my body except for one side of clavicle.  I had breast cancer in '95, did the mammograms and thought I was cancer free til a few months ago when I was finally offerred an MRI after experiencing extreme pain.  I am now on Femara and monthly infusions of Zometa.  Zometa is WONDERFUL.  I don't have the pain anymore and now feel that life is worth living.  It is a disease without a cure at this time but we can manage it and live longer and who knows, maybe they will find something else to help us soon.  Please get ur Mother to a doctor who will help manage this and not dwell on the incurable part.  God Bless u both!",
