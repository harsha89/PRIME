    "Content": "Twenty-one years ago this summer is the one and only time I ever played golf. You might then wonder, as my husband did, why I bought a brand new set of ladies golf clubs last week. Well, for one thing they were on sale but most importantly they were blazoned with the breast cancer hope pink ribbon, and the shafts of the clubs are pink. I bought the Wilson Hope ladies set of golf clubs. I am reaching my five year breast cancer survivorship since my diagnosis. I have decided that my life needs to be filled with more fun things so I am taking up golf since Tiger Woods makes it look fun and lucrative. My family has even planned a trip to Lake Tahoe for Christmas! I don\u2019t ski, but I foresee a set of pink skis in my future to stand beside my new golf set. These past several years have been filled with stress and worry for me and my family. There is a passage in the Bible that basically says \u201cwho can add even one hour to their life by worrying?\u201d I really do embrace that adage and try to live my faith, but circumstance after circumstance has challenged it. I know that is true for many of you. It is also uncharacteristic of me to spend money on things like golf sets, skis and vacations. With medical co-pays and travel for reconstructive surgery, like many cancer survivors, money in my house is tight. I intend to try to continue to be wise with money, I also intend to have more fun and create more memories. I may have to give up a few pair of new shoes, but I think it will be worth it.
