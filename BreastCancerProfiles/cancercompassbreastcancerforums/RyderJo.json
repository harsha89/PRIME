      "Content": "Thanks for the great advice...this is something I never even realized I should be asking. I meet with the oncologist this Friday and will throw all these questions at him. Update- had mastectomy on June 30..removed the right breast and lymph nodes..i learned today the surgeon said she removed 16 LN and only two had cancer cells.  She did not feel lymphadema would be a issue as all 16 were below ?? not sure actually what she said.  I was really upset because she told me that only two lymph nodes had cancer, then suggested I likely might not need Chemo..I reminded her that the cancer was also found in my bone and she looked embarrassed and removed the drain and left the room.  I felt like a number, how could she not even know my file. keep you posted after i speak with Oncologist on friday.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am newly diagosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and found out three days ago that it has spread to my sacrum bone.  I was scheduled for surgery for a mastectomy and lymph node removal...however, they have cancelled this.  I am scared, panicking and can't stop seeking information online. is there other women who have experienced this in Canada...is there better treatment than others...i am only 44 years old and a single parent...im scared for my daughter...leaving her behind with no one.  i cry myself to sleep and can't believe this is happening.  I just want to get on my motorcycle and ride away.  This is too scary.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your message.   The Cancer program nurse called today saying one doctor believes starting chemo right away is the best way to proceed and the surgeon believes doing the mastectomy and removal of the lymph nodes then waiting for weeks and starting Chemo is the best option.  I am worried with this being stage 4, one spot on my bone...which is the  best option...how do i decide?  I wish the laser surgery was an option...i need to do some quick research and talk to the surgeon about it.  thanks for all your thoughts and ideas..it is very helpful!",
