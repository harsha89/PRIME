I had the jont pain in fingers. tried taking the Tumeric capsules . Well my blood pressure went sky high. I knew it was the Tumeric combination with Letrozole. SO easy to guess which one I stopped taking. Tumeric! Back to sore fingers again. Yes radiation is scarry stuff. I too ,like you had 4 grueling weeks of it. As I laid there I wondered what damage was being done to my body . I finnished rads. this last December. So I guess I will find out soon enough if I incured any lung or heart damage . The effected breast was right side. I am adding you to my prayers. Please stay strong. We only do what we think is best for us with the given medice we have today. Now my radiation doctor wants me to have amaogram in March! I think its too soon. I want to wait atleast a year after treatments ended. I woud like your opinion on this please. Wish you the best ,CarolI am looking for other ex Arimidex. I know of several people people that had to have joint replacement surgery. Anyone else?",
