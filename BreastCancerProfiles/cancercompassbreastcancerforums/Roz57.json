      "Content": "Hi Lois Although this is not much help to you as I am not on tamoxophin, I thought I would write back as I know what you are going through. I was on Arimidex for almost 2 years and the oncologist has just taken me off it as the side effects have now got so bad that I just can't sleep at night for excrutiating pains in my knee joints and hips as well as down the leg bones. He has now put me on Aromasin, which I read all about on the internet. He said it is also a good drug, as well as Femara and Tamoxophin. They are all aromatase inhibitors and all work much the same but some give certain people side effects. He said that I may or may not get side effects with Aromasin. I am willing to give it a try, I have nothing to lose. My advice to you is try Tamoxophin, you might have less side effects, I am giving it a try anyway. I would like to keep in touch with you to see how you are doing in a month or so. I will also post a message to let you know how I am getting on. Good luck with what you intend doing. Regards Ros.",

      "Content": "Hi Denise Thanks for the advice on side effects of bone and joint pain. I read all the messages of May and June and found interesting info. My pains are definitely getting worse as each month goes by. I wake up feeling 30 years older than I am with pains pretty much all over the bones and joints from the hips down! I am not sure whether to stay on this drug as I fear I will be a gnarled old woman before the year is out - but on the other hand I do not want to get reoccuring cancer! I do manage to get out of bed and go on the health walker every morning and once I have done 10 minutes I feel more human. I get depression too, very bad at times. Not sure if this because I lack sleep due to painful nights, feeling sorry for myself or the effects of Arimidex - gosh I do sound a state! I just HAVE to hang on to my sense of humour, otherwise I think I will lose it completely! Anyway I am going to my oncologist for my next check up on Monday and will be asking him about Zometa treatment, although I did look up on the internet and it seems that it is for bone cancer. I hope things go well for you in the future. Take care Ros.",

      "Content": "Hi Mary, thanks for replying regarding the side effects of Arimidex. It seems as if mine and your side effects are very similar but I am not giving in to the drug, I am going to persevere with it even though I get some really bad nights of aching and days of tiredness. My daughter's best friend has just lost her battle against breast cancer, she preferred not to take any drugs, deciding on the herbal route with meditation etc., she was just 39 years old. I have decided to do whatever the oncologist recommends is the best thing for me, which is Arimidex. I have my 6 month check up in a couple of weeks time and that will be 2 years after my mastectomy. I didn't have to have any chemotherapy or radiation as they caught my cancer before it went farther than the lymph nodes so I know that all the side effects are caused by the drug. There is also no back problems in my family, but nor where there any cases of breast cancer! I am going to stick out the drug as long as I can manage to take it, fear of breast cancer coming back outweighs the bone and joint aching! Good luck to you in the future.",

I have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years and am getting very bad aches and pains in the lower hips, back region, the bones of the legs, fingers, hands, knees. I wake up so stiff and can hardly get out of bed in the morning - feel like I have aged 30 years over the last 2 years! I do go on the health walker for 10 minutes which really helps me first thing in the morning. My worry is that it is going to get worse and as you have been on it longer than me I wonder if you are getting more pains as the time goes on. When I first started with Arimidex I hardly had any side effects for about 6 months and now gradually, each month, the pains seem to worsen. I am going to see the oncologist on Monday as it is my 6 month check and everyone on this site seems to say that I must ask to go on Aromosin or Femara. Have you changed from Arimidex at all? I also want to come off the drug but I am scared in case the breast cancer comes back. I hope you see this and reply to it and hope you are making good progress.",

      "Content": "I'm new to this website, but came across your question. I have been taking Arimidex for almost 2 years. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2003, and had a mastectomy in November 2003. I knew nothing of breast cancer, so went on the Internet to find out all about treatments etc. I saw that there was a new drug on the market called Arimidex that had just been passed in USA as a much better drug that Tamoxifen. Research did a survey with around 500 ladies on Tamoxifen and the same amount of ladies on the Arimidex. The reoccuring cancer was far higher in the Tamoxifen takers, therefore they had to stop the research as all the ladies on Tamoxifen wanted to go onto the Arimidex. I approached my oncologist in Johannesburg and he said it had only just gone on the market here and didn't think the medical aid would put me on it as it was such a new drug, also the fact that it is about 3 times more expensive than Tamoxifen so medical aids aren't too keen to pay for it. Anyway, they did put me on it and I had hardly any side effects from it to begin with. Now after 2 years I am getting pains in my joints and down my bones in my legs, mainly while I am trying to sleep. I do get very tired easily now and have nowhere near the energy I used to have before I had cancer. I find that my pains down my chest, shoulder and arm are more severe at times too. I am sure it is all brought on from the drug as I did not have to have chemotherapy or radiation as they caught my cancer in the early stages. I did however have around 20 lymph nodes removed which has caused no end of discomfort and does not seem to get better as the months go by. I must admit though, with all the side effects I will still carry on taking the drug as I feel as if it is a sure defence of getting the cancer back. I hope I have been of some help to you. I know what it is like when you want so much to get advice from someone who has been through it. I am in the process of becoming a breast cancer conselor in Johannesburg as there are so many people who do not know which way to turn once they are told they have breast cancer. Go well.",

I start taking Aromasin as from October as I just cannot take the pains in the joints any more with Arimidex, I started off alright and only started getting pains after about 6 months of being on the drug but 20 months later I have been in excrutiating pain and could hardly get out of bed. I can't bear the thought of having the same pains with Aromasin. I will, nevertheless, take it for a while to see how I get on. I will write a message in a few months time letting everyone know how I am getting on. I think all these oncologists/physicians etc., do not realise how painful the side effects are on this medication - perhaps the trials have not been for long enough. Go well and good luck. Ros.",

I had a mastectomy in November 2003, I had no choice, I had a 2nd opinion just in case but both surgeons agreed, I also had 15 lymph nodes removed, non of them cancerous. I must admit I got more pain from the armpit than having the actual breast taken off. I went for a reconstruction this year and am coming along very well. I am glad I had the mastectomy as they said the cancer was positioned in such a way they had to take away most of the tissue etc. A friend of mine had a lumpectomy around the time I had the mastectomy, she is also coming along nicely, so either way I think it is a decision your Mum must make. I don't think either way is the BEST option, it is the preference of the individual. I joined a cancer group in Johannesburg called Bosom Buddies and every lady has a different story to tell. Some opted for a double mastectomy for their own reasons, some opted for lumpectomies and others mastectomies. What shines through all of the meetings is though, that everyone was very much alive and seemed to have come through the ordeals with optimism, strength and a sense of humour. Good luck to your Mother and I hope she recovers quickly. Regards Ros.",

      "Content": "Hi Mary You have lasted longer than I have on Arimidex so I take my hat off to you! I have been on Arimidex for about 20 months and didn't really experience any side effects until a few months ago, although did have a bad back but then I have always been prone to aches in the lower back. Then a few months ago I found I was getting severe pains in the hips, moreso in the right hip, also in the knees and down the bones of the upper leg. I got these pains mostly at night and started finding it difficult to sleep long before being woken up with the pain. Not every night though, some nights were far worse than others, some nights the knees would be painful and sometimes the hips, or both. It started to wear me down as I began to be tired all the time - and depressed. But the tiredness and depression could be because I lacked proper sleep. I had read all about Arimidex on the internet and know that it has come out best with all the clinical trials so I know I am on a good aromatase inhibitor for lowering the estrogen levels, but if I am getting steadily worse and am losing my quality of life then I am prepared to try something else. I have been an avid reader of these messages on this notice board and see that a few ladies have changed to Aromasin and I wanted to know if they were experiencing side effects. I inquired with the oncologist about changing. He was all for it, he said I mustn't carry on in such pain so I am going to start taking it as from October. He said I may have as many side effects as I am getting with Arimidex but I am prepared to take my chances. There is also another aromatase inhibitor called Femara that a lot of people are on and I mentioned this also to my oncologist but he seemed keen for me to try Aromasin. He also said that perhaps it was the aging process creeping up on me....I told him I was prepared for it but not this quickly! I am only 57 - a spring chicken as far as I am concerned! Every day I seem to get worse and notice a change so goodness knows how I will be after 5 years on Arimidex! I know aging does not creep on you THIS FAST! I am staying positive though and will try anything and do not want to stop taking something as I feel it is keeping the cancer away. I hope this has been of some help for you Mary and I would be grateful if you will let me know the outcome of your visit to the oncologist in October. Keep well Ros.",

I am in Johannesburg SA and know of an organisation called Bosom Buddies so will let them know about this to see if they will push it forward. I also didn't realise that an increase in cholesterol was another side effect - mine was already high before I started taking Arimidex, no one, not even my oncologist took my cholesterol levels to see how high they were. Quite scary really isn't it? But I still take it because I am scared not to take it. Keep well and good luck. Ros.",

I am not suffering from night sweats though, only bad joint pains, but I may need the products' names you say are great for sweats when I start next month on Aromasin! Go well and good luck with AstraZeneca. Regards Roz.",

      "Content": "Hi Jane Thanks for the information which has left me wondering if it is going to do me any good. I don't think I have much to lose though as the pains were so bad on Arimidex - how bad can it get? Sorry to hear that your cancer came back when taking Tamoxifen. My oncologist said he only puts people on aromatase inhibitors when they have gone through menopause (I had a full hysterectomy 10 years ago), so perhaps you are right and that is why they aren't working fully for you. Thank you for taking the time to reply to me. Regards Ros.",

Nice to see you are back anyway, I've missed you. I started taking Aromasin yesterday - after 2 years on Arimidex - maybe I am getting paranoid but could have sworn I felt sick all day! Actually had a better nights sleep without too much joint pain either - I am keeping fingers crossed (or thumbs as they say in this country). Lovely to have you back. Love Roz x",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, Thanks for replying to my message and you have given me hope at least. I didn't know about the chemical make up of the drugs so that was interesting to hear. I actually didn't have any side effects from Arimidex for about 6 months though so maybe I will still get them. But it is worth trying something different in case it really does work for me. I am noticing that a lot of ladies who do not experience pain from the drugs actually say that the cancer has reoccurred so it seems that the more pain we endure then the cancer won't come back! I don't mind putting up with discomfort but to get excrutiating pain so no joke. I also think that your quality of life is very important and watching yourself go 'downhill' so quickly is certainly no joke. I'd be so grateful if you can let me know how you are doing from time to time and when I am on Aromasin as from the beginning of October I will let you know how I am doing too. Go well.
