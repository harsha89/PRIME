I was prescribed with Boniva and I just felt strange and could not take it.  My doctor said take calcium and vit D and get early or late sun everyday by walking. The Bovina bothered my stomach, so everything else I believe was a result of the cancer meds.  I take my Aromasin about 6pm.  That has helped.  The Bovina is extremely expensive, the calcium and Vit D and yogurt along with the sunshine is cheaper! Good luck to all of you brave women, Diane",

I have been on Femara for about 1 1/2 years and I had many problems, especially heavy weight gain and joint pain everywhere.  My breast surgeon has given me 1 1/2 weeks vacation from cancer meds and then I go on Aromasin.  I had tried Arimidex too and I had joint pain and mood swings.

      "Content": "I have had some issues with Aromasin but not near those that I had with Femara.  I think it should be removed from the market.  Some nights my right leg hurts (breast cancer on left) and I have to use a wet/dry heating pad.  That helps me to sleep.  Just last week my left ankle began hurting.  I wear a wrap off and on all day but not at night.  The weight issue seems a little better. How is that baby aspirin working, I had not heard about that?? I know that the FDA does not thoroughly test all of these cancer drugs.  Maybe in 10 years some or all will be bad for us.  I hope that all of you hang in there, we have to beat the big \"C.\"!!!!!!!

She is really young, 28, and I was wondering if this was better in the sense that she can battle against this disease with more chances than older people. I really don´t know what to tell her to make her feel better, I would like survivors to tell me what you hated and got on your nerves and what you really appreciated from the people around you. The strong point in our friendship is humour, and perhaps I can make her laugh despite all this. What are the first days like? How did you feel and what did you want? Please, I need to know.     Belusa, When I found out that I had Breast Cancer, my husband was with me and he was upbeat and encouraging.  My surgeon, a woman, was a great Doctor.  She would not let me feel that I was dying.  I knew that I had to have surgery and radiation and maybe chemo (the chemo did not happen).  I was lucky that my cancer was small and did not affect the nodes.  One thing you do not want to say or talk about is other people who have had cancer at ANY age and have died.  It scares the patient to death.  Offer your help and talk about things that you have always talked about.  Be there for her and that will help.  My first husband had brain cancer and eventually died, I did not cry in front of him and I tried to talk about what we would do in the future.  I knew the future but was not going to say things to him along those lines.  When we have a disease, we need help and encouragement.  I wish your friend the very best in her journey.  I am 58 and still here and all mammograms have been fine SO FAR. Take Care, Diane  ",
