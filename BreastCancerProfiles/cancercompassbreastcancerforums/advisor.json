      "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer one year ago.  I chose to have a lumpectomy and now I wish I had had the masectomy.  Every med has caused me miserable side affects. I was only able to take one IV but from that I had no hair in 3 days and was in pain for over a week.  Then I went through radiation with no problem...things looking up ...enter tamixofen.  From that I had non stop diarrhea until I was taken off and put on aromasin.  Things improved for 7 months, then I began to  have muscle and bone aches, stiff hands and a trigger finger.  Last week I called my clinic and explained my misery  to my onc's nurse.  She advised that I discontinue the aromasin until I heard from them.  One week later...no word.... question..how great is the risk of just doing without further meds?  I am 72 years old and concerned about the quality of what I have left.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply and I can ditto each of the symptoms you named.  Just last week I went to a Dr. about a finger that would not open.  He put a shot into the palm of my hand which stood my hair on end!  However, my finger will now open .   Insomnia is a constant companion preventing me from going on any overnight visits and starting around 7 each night I cannot eat enough to feel full...bloated but not full.  It is good to know that these are real aromasin side affects and not something in my head. Oh and I am going tomorrow for a root canal, my second since taking aromasin. I will continue to finish my years on the mess, but at my age....never again!   Thank you for your great attitude toward our nemesis and you are so right to give God praise for the blessing of life that we have both received.",
