    "Content": "I was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic breast cancer almost six years ago. One of the things I did not do was look at statistics. I was told I had 3 to 4 months to live. I have outlived that prognosis by years and still going. I am a second degree black belt in the martial arts which reminds me of how to use my spiritual faith to the maximum. This faith, the love and support of my family are crucial.I get scared at times too, but I get busy doing something to support cancer survivors. I reach out to my sons to spend time with them. That helps. How do others deal with the ups and downs of dealing with feeling great sometimes and horrible at other times? The thing that hurts the most is a bad marriage. I don't know how to deal with that in dealing with cancer too. Any advice?",
