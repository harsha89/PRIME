      "Content": "Hi--I am a 7 year breast cancer survivor (and happy about it:). It was and estrogen receptive tumor(s) and so of course, they shut me down so to speak. Rather suddenly, I might add. So I had the hot flashes ad nauseum etc. Also, I have had quite a bit of weight gain which had never been much of an issue until all this Adventure. I have not been able to find much literature on this aspect (nor much that has been helpful in terms of losing it) as their whole focus is to save your life. Has anyone else had this issue? And has anyone found any better reasons or specific help other than the usual 'just eat right and exercise?' thanks~ JS ",
