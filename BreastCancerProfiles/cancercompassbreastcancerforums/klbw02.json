    "Content": "I'm 56 was barely post menopausal when I was diagnosed with BC last November. Initially I was diagnosed with DCIS but a very conscientious oncologist reviewed my pathology reports and slides and found there was some microinvasion. Following lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy and 33 radiation treatments I was placed on Femara. The joint pain and stiffness was so bad I was switched to Aromasin. I took a short break from meds before starting the Aromasin and felt great while off of it. Two weeks after starting the Aromasin the joint pain and stiffness began returning and the hot flashes and sweating are even worse on this. The fact that I am on a statin for high cholesterol (Crestor), which also causes joint and muscle stiffness certainly doesn't help matters. I wake up so stiff and hobble till my joints loosen up but even the shortest breaks when I sit or ride in the car and I stiffen up again. I'm counting down, 4 years and 10 months more of this. I'm hoping we'll loosen up after we stop taking this stuff and hoping even more that someone invents a better medication with fewer side effects. Maybe one good side effect like weight loss, cause I don't know about you but this stuff makes me want to eat all the time. Katie",
