    "Content": "Hi, Doris: I was diagonsed 2 1/2 years ago with stage 4 grade 2 breast cancer.  I don't know what my Her status is.  I also have metastases to the bone. The morning my oncologist told me I was stage 4, she also told me she had seen a lady that morning who had been like me for 15 years.  So, it isn't an immediate death sentence. I hope your Mum lives for many more years.  I will be sending positive thoughts and prayers for both of you. Laura",
