      "Content": "I started Tykerb in December 07 and will take it for a year. At first had severe bowel probs but my body got used to the med quickly. You do not want to eat food within an hour of taking this med! I also have a rash that started about two months into taking drug. Other than that, it is the easiest of all of my treatment so far. Good luck to you. Keep looking up!",

My chemo nurses tell me that Herc is the wonder drug for her2 cancer. I hope and pray you will do well. Please write anytime you want to talk. You will be in my prayers! Dee",

My love and support go out to you and your family. Have you spoken with your doctor yet? I am thinking of you and praying. Please don't put off asking for more information/explanations of your doctor. I understand the fear and stress of all of this, but you have to step up and become your own advocate. Knowledge is power in this cancer war. I have four children at home and understand every emotion you must be feeling right now. God Bless you..and remember to keep looking up!!! Please stay in touch if you want. Dee",
