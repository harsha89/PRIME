    "Content": "My husband and I are both undergoing treatment for cancer. The treatments consist of chemotherapy and other IV's of various medications to be followed by radiation therapy and then oral medication. We have both worked hard all of our lives and this is extremely hard for me to write, but I don't know where else to turn. Can anyone give me advice on how to receive some type of financial assistance? We have applied for Social Security in an effort to get some financial relief, but that is a long and lengthy process, and we haven't received any money from them so far. I plan on returning to work in July, but I don't know if my husband will ever be able to return to work. Even when I go back to work, I will not be able to support our family. We are in jeopardy of losing our house and all that we have. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, jeanst2",
