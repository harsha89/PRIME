    "Content": "Hi I have an area on right breast that is about three inches x three inches with peau d orange flakey skin in centre with red 1/2 inch border of red all the way around area just below nipple. This breast is larger than the left. Saw Dr three weeks ago and she ordered an urgent mammogram and ultrasound. It took two weeks to get appt after i called myself which would have been 4 to 6 weeks otherwise. ultrasound took 2 minutes and tech said if there was no lump not much she could do. Dr office called today and said everything was normal on tests and if it was still bothering me to make an appt in three weeks. I am in BC Canada.",
