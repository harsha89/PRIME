She experienced burning in her legs. About a week after the 1st coarse she lost all feeling from the knee down. She is in a wheel chair and can't walk at all unaided. There is no feelings at all. No pain no nothing. We have been to 2 nerve specialists who both say the same this that its neuropathy from the chemo. They have no cancelled future treatments and are doing a mastectomy to remove cancer. However they are refusing to do reconstruction while she has the numbness. Can anyone advice if they have came across this severe totally numbness and if it will return?? I have a very upset mother. Thank you in advance for any help",
