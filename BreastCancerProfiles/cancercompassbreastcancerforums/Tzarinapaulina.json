    "Content": "Sherry Ann, Please, Please DO NOT reconsider surgery because of your bfriend.!!! Have you thought about the possibility he is scared to make love to you? Maybe some way he thinks it will hurt you or put pressure on your breast. He sounds wonderfully supportive in most other ways. I was diagnosed at 43, had lumpectomy, node disecction, chemo, radiation and eventually mastectomy and reconstruction. I am now lucky enough to have the breasts of a 25 year old. HA HA! Don't even need a bra. It was the true silver lining. My husband of only 2 years at dx, was a total boob man. We got thru it and so will you. Keep talking, Keep touching and ask your onco for a referral to a couples therapist. Hopefully you are in a major metro area and can find someone who specializes in life changing events like cancer. It sounds like you have a good strong relationship that will carry you thru. Tell him how you feel and let him know how much the intimacy means to you. Hopefully it is just a momentary speed bump. Healing light to you for your recovery, Sherry. Peace, Paulina",
