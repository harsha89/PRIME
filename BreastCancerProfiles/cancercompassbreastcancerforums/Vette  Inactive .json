    "Content": "I would get a basket and buy some Aveeno products, some herbal teas, the latest book by an author she likes.  Perhaps you could also put a note that says \"lunch is on me\" you pick the place.  Go to some place that may be a little bit of a ride, you may find some new stores to shop in.  Make a day of it.  Also, you could get her a gift certificate to the local movie theater.  There are some great \"girly\" movies out now, and then stop on the way home for a bite to eat.. Good luck, Vette  ",
