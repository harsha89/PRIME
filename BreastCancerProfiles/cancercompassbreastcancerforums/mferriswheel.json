Doctor recommends a followup test in 3 months. Is there cause for concern? thanks, Concern but not a panic at all. there are all sorts of reasons that someone can have a lump that is not cancer. But yes do the followup so you wont worry forever.",

It does grind you down every day so -   Try to take care of yourself while being the caregiver. Even when you think you shouldn't take the time, you have to. Or you won't be around later on. It could be a walk, phone call to supportive friend or a manicure. Ask for help - this is when you need to do that for sure. Do not be embarressed to ask - old friends or almost strangers. they would want to help. Cause if you try to do it all alone, you will not make it. It's ok to show your emotions - just not in front of your Mom every day. give her something to look forward to if you can - small family reunion, mini-vacation.  If you don't trust the medical information -stop and regroup. Doctors dont all agree. I have had 4 oncologists and 3 different drs for Mom. The chemo does get worse each time -the dosage isnt stronger but your body is just weaker. So be prepared. Prayer is my secret weapon - I bleieve it works. And it feels good doing it. Mary  ",

      "Content": "Your hair might fall out or it might not. If it does, it will be about the 20th day after chemo. And it won't grow back til about a month after your last chemo. It might partially fall out and just be really thin. It might grow back differnetly - different color or texture. Nioxin shampoo is great to help it regrow and become thicker. Ulta and lots of beauty supply stores have it. I also recommend baseball caps instead of wigs. or turbans. Wigs are hot and itchy. Baseball caps can be as sporty as you like. I was told that holding ice over your head during chemo will keep the hair from falling out but that is not practical. You cant keep ice over your entire scalp long enough. and patchey hair just looks weird. Remember that you are more important than your hair. And the chemo is killing the cancer. And that you will get through this. Take care of yourself, Kathy. Mary who has been through this",

      "Content": "I am not a fan of Arimidex. My oncoloigst strongly recommended it and did not mention any side effects. I had much worse hot flashes, massive weight gain, nausea and joint pain. Perhaps more moodiness. When I complained about the side effects I was told to grin and bear it. I took it for 4 years. last August I just couldnt stand the side effects anymore and went off of it against the advice of my Oncologist. My joint pain and hot flashes improved immediately. The weight has continued to be a problem. I feel much peppier for sure. I have no way o fknowing if that has given me a more likely chance of gettng cancer back again or not but I will take my chances. I had chemo and surgery 5 years ago. Mary",
