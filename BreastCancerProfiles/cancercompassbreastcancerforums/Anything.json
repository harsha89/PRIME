    "Content": "My daughter has multiple breast cysts like me.  Last month she had drainage from the surface of her breast a little outside the nipple area.  This month it happened again on the other side and it then developed into a large, painful infection within 48 hrs.  She is now on antibiotics for mastitis and doing much better.  The GYN said it's unusual to drain like that and he thought the infection originated from the surface of the skin like a pimple, but there are no blemishes that would indicate that.  She has had a great deal of problems with boils and styes all her life.  Maybe it's just staph out of control in another area. Should I ask the dr. to do an ultrasound and send us to a specialist just to make sure it's nothing more serious? Thanks!",
