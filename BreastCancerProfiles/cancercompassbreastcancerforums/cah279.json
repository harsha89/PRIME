      "Content": "My wife has just finished her first round of Chemo (AC).  She had a primary tumor in her right breast which measured approx. 10 cm, a spot on her lung, a lesion on her tailbone (of all places) and a likelihood of bilateral breast ca.  Of course, we would have preferred not to have this fight to make.  She has the same tumor type as you (triple positive).  There have been tremendous advances in fighting this form of breast cancer in the last 10 years.  You are not a statistics, each person responses differently to chemo and radiation.  We promised each other that we would not research her condition and worry ourselves with all the information contained on the web.  Your not a statistic.  As someone who survived melanoma told my wife, \"You were not born with an expiration date on the bottom of your foot\".  Is it worth fighting?  Definitely, you may just be that person whose cancer responds dramatically to chemo and radiation.  ",
