Hi! I had a bilateral mastectomy with a tram reconstruction (breasts recon with body fat from abdomen) 9 yrs ago.  I also had the nipple reconstruction & I am very pleased with the results.  The nipple is slightly raised and looks as natural as it can be under the circumstances.  I then had the tatooing for the color.  The tatooing will fade over time which mine has but I chose not to have it redone.  It just is not that important to me anymore.  After 9 yrs I still have all the scars from the mastectomy and reconstruction, but they have faded over the yrs.  If I had to do it all over again, I would make the same choices.  I am currently 58 yrs. old.  I hope this has helped.    ",
