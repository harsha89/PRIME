Well yes i am lucky to have got this amount of time. Without much trouble, sweats my real problem, anyway shoulders back chest out and on we go, for another good result. lady-R, You sound like a real trooper...like you have been forged like steel in the fire....you have already fought the good fight...so ignore that big Bully banging pots and pans and strutting up and down the end of your street int eh neighborhood of your mind, just daring you to cross the street-to cross his lawn-threatening to take away all you have gained in your previous fight.... Dismiss that trash talk in your head... You already whooped that weak obnoxious pesty bully named with a small c..... You are the champ-never let the Bully get inside your head for even 5 minutes.....tell him to hit the street-you ain't listening to his taunts-he don't have Game and his act has grown old and tired.....tell Him it is more likely you will be run over by a Mack truck on the way to the check-up than leave with a re-occurrence of cancer..... That Bully...what a loud mouth.....just tell him always to step aside.... You already won that fight so long ago, you forgot how obnoxious that Bully could be.... Replace Doubt with faith.... Replace Anxiety with Eager Anticipation to confirm what you already know deep inside but are to scared to admit-you are cancer free....yes, you are deserving and worthy of kindness and forgiveness, as we all are..... Replace the negative with the Positive... Replace fear with the hope of the future..... Cancer can never take way warriors what we have never freely given... Cancer can never conquer the mind or our spirit or souls.... God, grant me the serenity to Accept the things I cannot change; the courage to change the things that I can; and the Wisdom to know the difference.... And/or My God, grant me the serenity to come to accept and understand and trust that I am exactly at the right place at the right time, according to your loving plan for me....

SHER, heck yes you are scared, who wouldn't be...I sure was and still am sometimes....whatever as my tweener/teenage daughters would say....LOL.... May 10th, too much time to worry so you have to find ways to start your training and do the following: Replace fear with rational thinking, Replace doubt with hope, Replace uncertainty with faith, Replace anxiety with anticipation... Why anticipation...... ...others will answer you better and differently than I, a dude....the Spirit speaks in many languages.....from many different persons.... Anticipation because: 1)  You have analyzed your options, 2)  You have analyzed your treatment and surgical avenues, 3)  You want to defeat this Big bully with a small c... 4)  Deep inside you know the best avenues of treatment but you have faced real fear...a real obstacle that might be bigger than you for the first time; 5)  Each of us here as patients and caregivers knows that fear, that worry; that anxiety that grows louder with the banging of the pots and pans of the neighborhood bully daring you to walk down the block-to cross his house-to walk on his lawn; 6)  But you know what, on May 10th, 2010 you have the opportunity to begin to fight back..to take back everything that is yours and more; to grow in ways and be forged in ways you never thought possible-all in a good way; 7)  Would you and I and the rest of us wish we never had cancer-sure-but the fear of cancer, the initial seemingly impossible obstacle of treatments and the fear of the unknown, will lead you on a journey that you could never pay for....you will learn how to become a better person in ways you would have never believed....wait, and see... 8)  Work backwards-you will win this fight....the only worry and anxiety is how do I get there....well, that won't help anymore than taking a roller coaster to the top and wishing it wouldn't go down......just trust that it will be an excited ride-a different kind of journey with some twists and turns and a few dark tunnels that will be both thrilling and scary...so that is what is happening and that is what you have gotten yourself into-an adventure of a lifetime...and you are the lead role-the star character in this drama....called your life.  Did you really want total boredom and the mundane...can you grow as a person in taht environment...a challenge the marines might initially flinch at....LOL.....(we just made the marines mad at us-try storming a beach head or machine gun nest) 9)  perhaps you find this attitude and mind set  weird, strange or unreasonable....well, maybe I think dying a 1000 deaths and unreasonable and unsupportable worry and anxiety over events we can't control as a strange mindset as well...so which attitude would you rather have-the once in a lifetime journey or a fearful nightmare of unimaginable self-created horrors.....we all start out that way-you are perfectly normal.... 10)  So if you believe in a Higher Power or God, start exercising that faith between now and May 10, 2010; try to use logical reasoning each hour of the day and night to defeat unreasonable fears....know that uncontrolled worry and anxiety will make you weaker and that it will not change one moment of your life...seek immediate medical attention for chronic worry or anxiety-this is NOT a sign of weakness... ...and relax...whether you live 1 more day, 1 week, 1 year, 5 years or 25 or even 50 years how does that compare to the time of eternity-one grain of sand-one drop of salt water into the ocean.. ...it is the quality of your life....truly what you give...not what you receive....those you console, rather than being consoled..and to butcher an old  Beatles line, It isn't the Love you Take but the  love you Gave(Help-Beatles fans).........or the Broadway Rent song...525,600 minutes, how do you measure the year in a life....by love.    The 29th is just suiting up...just putting on your gloves...you will have that Big Bully properly sized up with a bloody nose on the floor for the first time my new fighter by Memorial Day in later May.....think and visualize how good that will feel..... ...you gotta have faith..ya gotta believe...you gotta trust....we have walked your path and may your Gaurdian Angel be by your side every step of the way.... Keep us posted-we care.... Serenity Prayer: Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Or, try: My God,please help me to come to understand that I am exactly at the right place at the right time, according to your loving Plan for me. You have Big plans my friend-have faith and smile....close your eyes and just feel the love for you and the certainty of your recovery my friend.    The Corner man, Dave Oudave83",

I know that this would not appeal to everyone as some may see it as a bad reminder of their experiences but I felt it helped to keep my spirits up. My friends and family have also added charms to it which has made it extra special. Good luck for your treatment.  I'm sure you will find an inner strength that you didn't know you had. Jenny What a beautiful wonderful loving idea for Sher and for all Jenny......Dave oudave83",

The doctor thinks it is the medication that is causing it and also says I do not have a choice as they are all same medications. Someone in the world must have a remedy. Plz help. Ask about Neurotin or Lyrica for the neuropathy...there are also diabetic topical solutions for the feet and hands that should likewise work for a couple hours at a time... Allot of the topical meds with capsacian (from the Jalapeno plant-numbs the skin-complex interaction)...you can also ask for Lidoderm 5% Lidocaine patches...will numb the area They have also FDA approved a Capsacian patch for neuropathic pain....put it on for one hour and it can help 8-12 weeks and it is called Qutenza-google it..... Also, your docs or a neurologist can use a \"compound topical\" from prescribed drugs that will ease the pain..... there are also narcotic meds or opiate meds but they typically don't help much for neuropathic pain.....Lyrica etc may take the edge off enough to make this manageable....need a team approach....see if there are pain docs and what they do for neuropathic pain in the feet for diabetics..... You'll also need to learn how to deal or cope with chronic pain...... May the Holy Spirit and the power of the Cross envelop you and be your guide my friend, Dave",
