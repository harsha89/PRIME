Has anyone had a mastecomy with invasive and not had treatment?  What about the node situation?

Hi Connie You are not alone with the way you feel about your Mom. For many many years I always had the fear of losing my Mom.  I would think to myself \"How am I going to deal with it\"  What am I going to do without her\".  So I always tried to do the best that I could for her, one of the reasons being that if I did not do all I could I figured for sure I would just have guilt added to my fear when she would be gone.  Well my Mom passed away, it will be 10 years this year.  I think of her everyday and I still have some of her things still in her room. I am telling you this because I would like to help you to know that things will work out for you.  Do whatever you can for your Mom now and know that we all must leave someday, but with God's promise we will see our loved ones again.  Also remember your Mom would never want you to feel bad.  That is how my Mom was.  She always worried about me and I am sure your Mom is the same.  I hope I have been able to make you feel better.  If you need I will be glad to share more with you.

Aspiration biopsy in one lymph node was negative, but that may or may not be too indicative. Due to the size of the tumour I will most likely need radiation therapy as well as chemo and hormonal therapy.   I saw the surgeon yesterday and she suggested a unilateral mastectomy. I opted for a bilateral mastectomy. I just could not cope with having one breast!!! I find it easier to have none.   We also talked about reconstruction and she was fairly negative about it. She advised that the chances of success are not that high because of the radiation therapy which may be detrimental to the reconstruction. Also surgery may have to be delayed because plastic surgeons are very busy. Potential complications may also delay chemotherapy. But she said that it is my decision and that it does not matter much if the procedures are delayed by several weeks. I find this hard to believe...   I just don't know what to do. Have you had this dilemma? Have you had reconstruction followed by radiation? Or delayed reconstruction or none at all?   Also I am ER+ and PR+ and I will definitely need hormonal therapy. That really scares me as I heard that there are difficult adverse effects. Have you had ny experience, good or bad, with Tamoxifen or Aromatase Inhibitors? It is still unclear to me after having read a lot on the internet what the benefits of these hormonal drugs are after double mastectomy. Do you know? I would be grateful for any advice/experience, positive or negative. Hi I too have had both breasts removed.  I am ER positive, no lymph node involvement, and clean margins. My oncologist wants me to take Arimidex.  My bone density test shows I have osteopenia and I am very much afraid to take this drug be cause I too have heard terrible things about it and I like you wonder how much of a plus this will be for me to take.  I have the prescription now for a month and have not had it filled yet because of this fear. I mean how much estrogen can I have yet, I am 75 years old. One thing I would advise you to do is to have a oncotype dx test done on your tumor to see if you will need chemo.  It may save you from having to take it. I can tell you I had my first breast surgery 16 years ago.  I took Tamoxifen at that time for 5 years with never a problem. I would like to discuss further with you about the oncotype dx test  ",

HAS ANYONE EVER HAD INVASIVE CANCER EVEN THOUGH VERY SMALL AND NOT HAD SOME TYPE OF TREATMENT IF THIS WAS YOUR SITUATION  WOULD YOU TRUST THE SURGEON AND HIS OPINION/COMMENTS/RECOMMENDATION AND BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH IT OR WOULD YOU GET A SECOND OPINION ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   this surgeon works for a privately owned breast center.    I requested all my hard copy mammogram and ultrasound reports - I had been going to this place for 7 years and having dignostic mammograms and ultrasounds due to dense breast tissue with cysts.   I had been ordered to have both since age 30 I am now age 55.    I obtained hard copy reports for 07, 08, 09 and 10 (the later was when they found the cluster of microcalifications).   It appears in 08 there the ultrasound noted grouped microcalifications in the right breast.   Then in 09  when I went for the screening the ultrasound woman told me there was nothing in my breasts including cysts, etc.  She was short tempered with me and seemed in a hurry.   The day I was there was the first day the breast center had opened at their new location.  I have that report stating no problems.   So apparently in their grand opening first day at new location mode - they over looked what was there and likely in the 'works' the year before.  I have asked them the question - how did I have mammograms and ultrasounds every year and have breast cancer that had became invasive.   They have not answered that  question.  I have ordered both a CD of my last two year mammograms and they are sending me the ultrasound hard copy films. After reading this last section as well, how do you all translate the issues with my situation.  Is it just in my head or is there a problem with the  breast center, the surgeon and his attitude and recommendation for treatment? Any input will be appreciated HI I have just had a mastectomy of the left breast. 16 years ago I had a mastectomy of my right breast.  At that time I had 1 \"bad\" lymph node, tumor 1.2, and I only did Tamoxifen for 5 years, no problems. Now my tumor is 1.4, clear margins, no \"bad\" lymph nodes but I guess it is still considered invasive because it is not DCIS. I am still waiting for a oncotype test to tell me if I should have chemo because the oncologist wants me to do chemo. I do not want to do chemo!! If my cancer 16 years ago had 1 bad lymph node and this time I have no bad lymph nodes, why should I need chemo!!! I am already thinking when the test comes back I will refuse the chemo even if it says I should take it.  I feel perfectly fine and am very sacred of the side effects of chemo.",

So now I reallyw ant to advocate for women who choose this path. www.tradinginthetatas.blogspot.com \"\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.tradinginthetatas.blogspot.com \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tradinginthetatas.blogspot.com Wish you well as you navigate!   Sally sally thanks for your reply.  As much as I read on here I still can't understand a lot of things, for instance, what is the difference between BC and BRCA. My story is Hodgkins probably 30 years ago,(not sure of years, as it was so long ago) but then breast cancer 15 years.  Mastectomy right breast.  Now 3 years ago, breast cancer left breast.  I did not do reconstruction.  Too much of a baby.  Did you have to have chemo?  My worry now is where will the cancer go next.

Only one was told directly by the doctor that the BC was radiation-induced. It's just good to hear from others. Thanks again. Peace. Hi Please read my message to lolite.",

She was caught at a later stage and the drs. said they would not be able to cure it but possibaly put it to \"Sleep\", well they did and it slept for 24 yrs.  She is now 46yrs. old and fighting breast cancer with oral chemo since the drs do not want to give her more chemo.  She had chemo at the age of 18 for a reacurance of hodgkins, and that put it to sleep for 24 yrs.  It awoke at 42 yrs.  She proceeded to have more chemo, and it was good for a year and then popped up again....another round of chemo again...clear for a year and then the breast cancer was diagnosed a being cause by having had the massive radiation treatments done to her at the age of 14 & 16 yrs old.  They did not want to give more chemo via the port, due to the face that she is now also a cardiac patient due to the chemo.  She had a mastectomy on the one breast and the cancer came back in her scar and there was another lump as well, they decided to do oral chemo as a last ditch effort, it is working, the scar has completely healed and the other lump is almost gone.  She is going to be taking updated radiation after the 6 units of the oral treatments in hopes of kicking the cancer out of her.  Your stories sounded so alike I wanted to let you know you were not alone with this.  If I can answer any questions just let me know.  I too am fighting lobular BC, was diagnosed last June and had only a lumpectomy since I was only a stage 1.  All is good, taking tomaxafin for the next 5 yrs.  Have a very blessed day. Hi Yes you are not alone.  I too had Hodgkins around 40 years ago for which I had cobalt radiation treatments.  Over the years I had many non cancerous breast lumbs removed until finally 16 years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy because as the Dr. told me I was not a candidtate for radiation treatments due to the fact I had the radiation for the Hodgkins.  So I had the mastectomy which showed only 1 lymph node involved.  I did not need chemo and took Tamoxifen for 5 years.  Now lo and behold again I have just been diagnosed with breast cancer again in my other breast.  I again had a mastectomy in February with no lymph node involvement.  No chemo due to the oncotype dx test.  My oncologist wants me to take Arimidex which I don't think I want to do after learning what it can do to your bones. I have read that anyone who has had Hodgkins when they were younger and had radiation is very likely to get breast cancer.!!!I mentioned this to my oncologist and he said yes that is true!!",
