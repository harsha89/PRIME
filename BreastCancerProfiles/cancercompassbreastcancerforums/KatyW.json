    "Content": "I'm 24, a mommy to a beautiful little boy, and a military wife. Last week, I found a rather large lump in my right breast (of course it scared me!)...I got in to see my Women's Health doctor within 2 days. I have the BRCA gene 1 & 2 mutations (I've had several ovarian tumors, the first at age 9-and the last one at 16 was said to have malignant cells, but I never required anything other than surgery * I was monitored very closely *)..Along with the mutation, my grandmother as well as 3 out of 5 aunts have had either ovarian or breast cancer, and 1 has actually had both..Also, 2 years ago my cousin died of Breast Cancer at 23 (the type I don't know bc I'm not very close with that side of my family)..My doctor immediately sent me to radiology on our military base for a sonogram and mammogram. They refused to do a mam bc of my age and the potentially dense breasts it was described as trying to see a polar bear in a blizzard..So with urgency they squeezed me in first thing Monday morning (which means I waited for hours lol)...The tech left and got the radiologist. The radiologist then told me he didn't see anything really...<---Did not make me feel ANY better! Especially the \"really\" part...He told me to watch it and if it grows over the next few months to come back for another follow up..How is that going to help? If they can't see it now-who's to say they'll see it next time?? My doctor hasn't called me yet...It just doesn't feel right to me?? It is a good size, about the size of a golf ball maybe even a little larger (I'm not a golfer :-p)...It feels like there is tremendous pressure underneath my nipple? and it does hurt. Not terribly. But enough to warrant me to do the breast exam that I had been slacking on for a bit (last one was a little over a year ago)...I just don't understand waiting...bc as I said-if it's this big now? and it grows-what's to say they will see it next time?? I shouldn't doubt my military doctors (they are great) but I kinda feel like maybe they don't have enough experience in this area?? It is so hard to get a second opinion from my insurance so I guess I'm concerned as to what to say to my doctor if she just takes the radiologist at his word..It's easily felt, and with my family and personal history-I'm worried..Maybe it's just what they saw--nothing?? Then I start thinking if it is something could they be missing it? Can they miss major things like cancer?? I have two wonderful guys to be thinking of--and they need me..I just need some guidance here... Thanks, Kate",
