    "Content": "I am a 7 year survivor of stage 1 breast cancer. I took tamox for 5 years and since then have been on aromasin. I have been complaining about terrible pains in my hands. I thought it was arthritis and never connected the debilitating pain to the medication until a friend on the same medication told me her doctor said the pain was connected to the Aromasin. I decided to google aromisin side effects and was amazed at what I found. I immediately left a message for my oncologist. I hope i can stop the Rx now and the pain will finally stop!!! Thank goodness for sites like this one.",
