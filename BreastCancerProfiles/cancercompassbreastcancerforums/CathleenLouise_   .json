      "Content": "Dear Doris: I was diagnosed in February 2005 with metastasized bc to the bone and marrow. I am being given Zometa once a month and take Femara every day. I'll find out Monday where the tumor markers are and if this is containing the cells. I don't have much pain but I am taking a capsule called Proloftin for stress, Olive Leaf extract, Grape Seed extract and vitamins and minerals. Check out a website, \"knowthecause.com\". Doug Kaufman has some very interesting ideas about cancer and other major illnesses. I try to eat fresh vegys, few carbohydrates and some meat every day. I try not to eat much sugar at all, or white flour. I also was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in 2000 and it seems to be less painful since I have been taking all these things. I can't seem to find out much about this kind of metastasized cancer. Do you know much more about it?, or where to find other information? God be with you, and I hope you are still doing great.

      "Content": "Dear Tricia: From my understanding Femara is for women who have gone through menopause. Tamoxiphen is for women who haven't. An oncologist at CTCA, Tulsa started me on Tamoxiphen in 2003 but after two weeks I was sicker than I had been on chemo. I changed doctors and he wanted me to get off Tamoxaphen, wait a month then begin Femara. I never did. I was clear last August at a check up then in February 2005 I was diagnosed with bc metastasized to the bone and marrow. I am on Zometa now and Femara every day. I don't know yet if it is containing the cells or not. I'll find out next Monday where the tumor markers are. Check out a website, \"knowthecause.com\", Doug Kaufaman has some very interesting ideas on cancer and other major diseases. I do take alternatives, too. God bless you and keep on fighting. It's not over till it's over and as long as there is life it's not over. No one person can tell us when we are going to die anyway. Only God knows that. Louise M.",

      "Content": "Dear Lillian: I read your message and my heart went out to you. I too lost my husband in 1993 to cancer that went to his brain. He had squamous cell carcinoma in his right gum which spread to his neck then his skull and brain. He was only 54 when he passed away. Pneumonia was what actually took him but he had developed a tumor in his lung, too. Knowing what I do now about different cancers and treatments it doesn't seem like much was done for him either but knowledged has progressed so much in the past ten years that I'm sure they didn't have as much then as now. I hope this finds you doing well and over the anger part of your loss. It is part of what they label as the \"grieving\" process. We had a doctor we nicknamed Dr. Doom. He never had anything positive to say and we left him behind as soon as we could. He was a surgeon. I can't even remember his actual name. Email me if you want to, I'm always open to an email now and then. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 then metastasized to the bone and marrow this February. God is in control, I surely can't be, nor do I want to be. I am on a medication to strengthen my bones, and Femara which is supposed to keep me from making too much estrogen. Hot flashes to the max, again. I also take alternative medications. Check out a website, \"knowthecause.com\". It is very informative. Oh, well, I guess it's all worth a little more life. God be with you always, Louise M.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy in 2002 and still have pain from it. I had a lot of training for lymphodema which bothers me off and on, too. I think that is probably what causes most of the pain. All the surgery severs lymph tracks and they are supposed to make new ones but I'm not sure they ever actually do. That lymph fluid gathers and without anywhere to go, I believe, causes swelling which puts pressure on nerves and causes aches and pains. The pain you described sounds very similar to the pain I experience whenever the lymphodema acts up. A shower head with a strong spray, or pulsating spray, seems to help me with the lymphodema. I start with the spray under my arm near the side of my breast, go under my breast toward the center of my chest where the main lymph duct is, then I do the other side. After that I spray from my hand up to my armpit then let the spray hit my neck, shoulders and upper back. It seems to help a lot. Gets the lymph fluid moving again. I wear a \"sleeve\", similar to support hose, on my arm whenever I fly. The pressure will cause a lot of swelling if I don't. Also, in case you don't know, you need to be careful with your arm(arms) on the surgery side(s). Try not to lift heavy objects, keep from getting it(them) too hot or cold. Actually heat can cause the swelling to get worse. Use a light massage from your hand to your shoulder to get the lymph fluid moving, after you have massaged the armpit under the breast and toward the main duct area in the center of your chest. I hope this helps. I know how miserable it is to ache and pain all the time. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2000 and breast cancer in 2002. This February I was diagnosed with metasis to the bone and marrow. I'm not sure now if my pain is from that or the fibromyalgia. I just know I hurt all the time somewhere. God be with you, and keep you. I stand for myself for healing by Jesus' stripes and have communion every day with Him. May you receive His healing, too.",
