      "Content": "Hi.  I've been experiencing the same kind of pain.  It began with numbness and pain in just my feet and hands but now it's throughout my legs and up into my hips.  I've been reading up on fibromyalgia and the symptoms sound like what I'm going through.  My oncologist put me on Lyrica twice a day but that doesn't seem to really help and now it's causing dizziness and drowsiness.  I'm not scheduled to see my oncologist until March but I'm calling this week and trying to get in to see him.   Some days the pain is so intense I can't stand it.   I hope you have had some help since you posted your message.",
