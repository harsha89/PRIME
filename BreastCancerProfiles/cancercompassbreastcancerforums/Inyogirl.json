    "Content": "Just started taking this drug two weeks ago (66 years old, just got off surgery in May, couple of nodes, only 15 radiation treatments, no chemo.  No history of breast cancer in my family).  Already feel terrible, dizziness, really bad hot flashes, wrist pain.  Have an appt with my oncologist at the end of the month.  Will take it 'til then, and talk to them about something else.  My job (I'm still working) won't allow for the way I feel.",
