    "Content": "I hd a double mastectomy 11 days ago. I am 67 years old and while my pain is not horrible, it is there. I cannot take the pain meds they gave me, I was horribly loopy. So I had to stop taking them two days after the surgery. I can't take ibuprofen, because I have sclerosing mesenteritis so all I could take was Tylenol. It must be great to have no pain. My dad died of stomach cancer and he had no pain. Maybe both of you have/had very high pain tolerance levels.",
