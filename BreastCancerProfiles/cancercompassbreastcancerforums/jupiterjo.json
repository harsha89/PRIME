      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear of the very rough time you have had - thank you for the warning - I was on Arimidex for about 13 months, had extreme bone pain that got progressively worse, I'm on Femora now, since Jan 2015. I'm 54 & my family does have a history of heart problems, I'm going to watch for this. I'm praying you will grow strong and healthy (my friend who had leukemia gave me these words when I ended up in the hospital after chemo overdose) thank you again!!!",

      "Content": "Hi there, I'm new to this site, just looked up \"joint pain w/ armimidex\" and found it, I had double mastectomy in 2013 followed by chemo, no radiation; have been on arimidex now about 6 1/2 months, joint pain in my hands and bone pain, my next oncologist appt. is July 10, I'm curious if I could quit this and get on with my life, I'm a very positive/optimistic person (yes there have been rough/down days, as everyone who's had cancer can attest to) but this has really slowed me way down, I thought it was just me, sometimes I fell like I'm 90 (I'm 54) thanks for listening - Jo ",

I have not seen my onco doctor since stopping the drug but I do intend to have a discussion with him about this at my next appointment in December. I am now on Tamoxifin after being full of pain while on Arimidex - joint and bone pain was awful.  Side effects of Tamoxifin so minor for me, compared to Arimidex and one other drug my oncologist tried before this one.  Best of luck to you! So glad you are feeling better!",

I had stage 2 breast cancer (March 2013) I did have the chemo, it almost killed me (I'm 54) and I switched oncologist after the first one over dosed me (even the 2nd oncologist agreed about this, I was just glad it didn't kill me).  I'm sorry you are having such a rough time with your sweet Mom - Jo",
