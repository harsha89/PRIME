    "Content": "If your grandmother has signed a release for her doctor's office to communicate with you, then you might want to consider calling them and asking them your questions directly.  Make a list and speak to the nurse if you can't speak to the doctor.  Also, hospice will be a good resource for your family.  They have been through all of this many times before and could possibly answer some of your questions, or at least help to get them answered.  Bottom line is, your grandmother is paying all of these people (via insurance/medicare) for their services.  She has a basic right to have all questions answered and to fully participate in her treatment and treatment decisions.  Best of luck and many prayers to you and your family.",
