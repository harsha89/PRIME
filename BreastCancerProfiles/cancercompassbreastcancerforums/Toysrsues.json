    "Content": "I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer June 10, 2004 and had a radical masectomy on June 16th. I have faithfully had a mammogram since I was 45 and I am now 54. I didn't understand why my mammogram in October '03 was read as being fine and yet I was a Stage IV in June of '04 when I found a lump under my arm. My mammogram in '96 was misread and all subsequent readings are based on the previous reading. I would suggest an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). It is much more thorough, completely painless and it is less costly than a mammogram. There is currently a battle going on with the government and insurance companies as to why women can't have an MRI which would be less costly to insurance companies!!??? Whatever method you use, make sure that you look at your films. Ask questions if you see ANYTHING on your films. Good Luck! :) cmm",
