    "Content": "In Sept 2009 I had a double mastectomy followed by diep flap reconstruction. In Jan 2010 my surgeon refined the breasts and I was good to go. I seemed to sail through each procedure with flying colors. It is now Jan 2011 and I have had a fairly severe pain that comes and goes in my abdomen close to the incision and to the right of my new navel. The doctor saw me Monday and said to take 1800 mg of advil daily, wait a week or so and call. He said the permanent stiches are still in place. Most of the time the pain comes when I lie down and turn to my side. I woke up at four this morning, took advil, put a heating pad on and the pain went away. But it will return I know. I have another appointment tomorrow and plan on getting a cat scan. Has anyone else experienced abdominal pain a year after diep flap surgery?",
