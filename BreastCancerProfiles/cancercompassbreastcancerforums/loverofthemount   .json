    "Content": "Friends, I too am on armidex and have been for almost one year.  I already did tamoxifin for four years and then the breast cancer came back to my bones.  I am on pain medicine but now I'm dizzy and feeling very unstable.  I too am very tired and most of the time I just don't feel good. Could this be a result of arimidix?  I'm having a CT scan done in two days to see if the cancer has spread to my head. ",
