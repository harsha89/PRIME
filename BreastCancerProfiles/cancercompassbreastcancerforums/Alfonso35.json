      "Content": "I had breast cancer in year 2000.  I had a Lumpectomy, chemo & radiation.  I lost all my hair.  I took Tamoxifen for 5 years, did not have any trouble with any of it.  After the 5 years of Tamoxifen, the Oncologist who had told me during the 5 years I would never need anything after the Tamoxifen, suddenly changed his mind and put me on Aromasin.  I took Aromasin for three months and began to have very severe problems with pain in my left leg.  After going to emergency rooms and several different Doctors, I was being treated for sciata.  It continued to get worse to the point I could hardly walk or function.  I finally went to an Neurologist, who said I had a non-functioning left sciata nerve.  He said this condition was so rare he couldn't begin to explain what happened.  I continued to deal with this condition every day.  I've gone to many Drs. have had many medical tests with no answers.  I got through the breast cancel just fine, but the Aromasin has changed my life forever.  Has this happened to anyone else?",
