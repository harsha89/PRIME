    "Content": "Dear Hardjourney, I don't wanna' really upset you any more, but it REALLY sounds like you are feeling more sorry for yourself than your parents!! -- Not only THAT -- You are blaming GOD???? -- God has NOTHING to do with their getting or not getting Cancer -- You know why?? -- Because God is LOVE and does NOT interfere with life's processes -- We must, as human beings, go through sadness, heartaches, sufferings -- as well as joy and happiness -- not necessarily in that order. -- I have cancer and it was REALLY REALLY a shocker to both me and my family!!! -- God had nothing to do with it -- HOWEVER -- I have FAITH in HIM that all will turn out well and that I will lick this darn thing WITH -- HIM!!! I would hope that you will -- from now on -- pray for the strength to cope with this -- AND -- that both of your parents will be able to be happy and make peacefull transitions into heaven. I know it will be difficult, but with God's help and your faith in Him -- your time will be able to be devided the way it should and -- you MUST continue your regular job and routine in your normal, consistent manner. I'd suggest, as Joseph V. did, that you DO turn to God at this time of need!!!!! All my best to you, Rev. Terry",
