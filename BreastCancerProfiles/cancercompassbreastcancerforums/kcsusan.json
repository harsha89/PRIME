    "Content": "I could not find the subject on the Message Board after joining Cancer Compass, so thought I create a new one. I have had pain at the site of my right side mastectomy, also under the arm. I take heavy pain medications because of a chronic back pain syndrome, yet after taking heavy meds the pain breaks through. I had intense pain right after the mastectomy, they gave me 750 mg of fentanyl, which did absolutely nothing for it, then gave me morphine. I just had to endure relentless pain through the entire surgery recovery. I did not want any reconstruction surgery at all. I am 67 years old, and reconstruction only meant something a person could not bear to look at, and wanted to look better. I felt that surgery was for alot younger women than I. I can't stand wearing a bra, none of them are comfortable. So I bought men's tank tops for summer and they are very light weight, so don't have the rubbing of the bra on my scars. I pray for those who have the unrelenting pain. I am not very positive about a complete recovery, I think the cancer will return within the 5 year period of survival. Mine was HER+ invasive, bordered on one side. It was only the size of a pea, sometimes I wish I had not chose the mastectomy, maybe just had treatment instead. Too late for that.  I would find a doctor for those of you whose doctor is unsympathetic to your pain. seek more opinions, doctors are suppose to relieve pain and suffering. Just plain, say look doctor, aspirin and aleve and tylenol do not help this pain, I need something alot stronger to kill this pain. Don't be afraid to ask for it.  Yes there is chance of addiction with pain killers, it is a better scenario than sitting day in and day out with unrelenting pain, that keeps you down. Good luck in your pursuit of the relief of pain. And it is real.",
