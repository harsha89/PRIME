You're right. When it comes to cancer I don't leave any stones unturned. Given my family history I can't afford to... Re: My grandson; Thank you. Its good to know I'm having a converstaion with someone who works for a dermatologist. I haven't seen the moles myself... well at least not in a very long time they live out of state... my daughter says they are growing and red... his primary referred him to a dermatologist .. I know from experience that having a mole removed is no big deal.. I also know that even if its (god forbid) malignant it can be taken care of.. his appt. is on Halloween.. yes I'll let you know how it turns out.. hugs, anni ",

      "Content": "Hello All nice to meet you. First an apology this msg is kind of long.. but its the only way I can put it all together... er.. explain my circumstances.. please bear with me.  To say I'm a little freaked out right now is an understatement. I am 52 yrs old, my mom had a radical modified masectomy about 10 or so yrs ago and is still alive today(no chemo she refused it). She was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  At the time of my mom's masectomy; I did a great deal of research on the subject and learned that I am high risk for breast cancer ... I started out getting yearly mamograms.. then went to every two years... then had no insurance and didn't have one for about 3 or 4 yrs... I have never had much luck with self exams... I have lumpy boobs... its hard to tell... especially since I had them lifted back in '88... there is scar tissue to contend with too...  I am currently going to a health clinic that offers exams and mamos once a year during breast cancer awareness month...   4 yrs or less ago I noticed that my left boob was kinda tender.. I figured it was mastitis and kind of blew it off.. but not completely...  3 yrs ago the clinic told me about their program  that offers exams and mamos once a year during breast cancer awareness month... at this time my left boob was still bothering me ... I had the mamo and an ultrasound.. the results came back 'fine' ... I insisted on a visit with the boob check nurse anyway.. she checked... called it fine and told me to get another mamo in \"2 yrs\" even though it was right there in my record that I am high risk.. (not just for breast cancer either... both sides of my family are riddled with cancer...ovarian, prostate, colon, pancreatic, lung, and throat.. there may be more but I am too stressed out to think about it right now...) ... I wondered about it but figured she knew what she was talking about and took her word for it...(yes. I knew better. yes. it was very stupid of me.) I made a mental note that I should probably get the next mamo at one year not two.. and moved on with my life..  The folowing year (2 yrs ago) my left boob still hurt seemed a bit swolen, but there were other things on my plate to deal with... I had a colonoscopy.. the doc insisted that the cancer grant people allow him to do a second one exactly two weeks later..(there were \"alot\" of polyps and he couldn't get them all...) he was adamant.. after the second one he showed me pictures of polyps that he  still couldn't get and told me they were the kind that turn into cancer.. he told me he needed me to return in a year and if there were more he would have to remove the right side of my large instestine... for the next year I was scared outa my gord about this... things turned out well.. I kept the right side of my colon.. whew!  However; the last colonoscopy was in march of this year... I screwed up.. I went three years without a mamo...  my boob still hurts.. and now that I look at it.. its much bigger than the right one...close to double...( its been a bit larger than the other due to the breast lift I had in 88... my right boob got staph infection and I had to have a second surgery on it.. they had to take a little bit .. not much at all out of the affected boob in order to close the skin .. but the left one's never been noticable larger.. now it is..) I'm not even sure when it got this big.. I have big boobs as it is.. and I gained and lost weight ... recently lost over 40lbs...  The mamo was last Tuesday Oct. 14, '08 ... saturday I got a letter that says they found something that they \"think\" is benign but I should have a mamo in 6 months to see if it has changed... eeek!   I spoke with the nurse today and she is setting me up an appointment with a general surgeon (sp?) that will accept the grant... for a second opinion ... the story goes deeper too... my original mamo (base line? 10 yrs or so ago.. ) showed some calcification in the left boob... some in the right as well... the doc opted to do a double biopsy of the right boob.. (not the one currently in question).. results were negative..  now.. I'm kinda wondering ...  Maybe I'm just borowing trouble... but this is my life I'm talking about here and I am scared out of my wits...   I'd really appreciate any and all suggestions.. experience stories... emotional support...  how do I deal with this general surgeon? what questions to ask? what points to make with him/her?   am I ok? am I right to be quite concerned? I think I am but...  did I screw up? am I gonna die?  hugs and thanks...  anni",

Thank you so much for your response. I just checked into the mamo films and found out they were only going to send films from 2002 forward.. not good. I rechecked my dates and found out my first mamo was in 1990 approx. The lady at the mamo center was trying to tell me they had nothing before 2002... after a bit of insistance.. she admitted that only the ones on cd were going to be sent.. then she told me I could go get my past films and hand carry them to the doc.. apparently I can hang on to them for up to a month ... no problem.. I only need them for one day.. in the end she insisted I pick them up tomorrow afternoon.. kind of soon considering the appt. for second oppinion isn't until 11/06  but okay... Family history of cancer: my facts weren't quite right.. my mom had uterus cancer not ovarian, as well as, breast cancer(and that was approx.'90), Colon cancer; paternal uncle and throat cancer; another paternal uncle... Lung; maternal grandfather, Pancreatic; maternal grandmother.. I will be sure to include the familial cancer info in my notes/ questions I'll be putting together and printing up, as well as, my colon problems. Thanks for the advice not to leave the office until all my questions are satisfied. I'll do that too... \"we know our bodies better than anyone. Something is telling you to pursue this I would.\"  Thank you. There are times when I think I'm just nuts.. but I can't just let this go... something's wrong. I need to know what it is and take care of it. This acutally is being referred to as a second opinion. The first was the radiologists... \"let's mamo it again in 6 months and see if its changed\" um.. its changed.. I don't feel like waiting 6 months is a very good idea... I've already waited over 3 years.. they didn't point anything out on the last mamo.. they did point something out on this one.. get my drift here? I already know something's changed. ... as if I don't have enough on my plate right now.. I found out yesterday that my 13 yr old grandson has some suspicious moles on his back.. my daughter's hitting the panic button.. I've decided to keep my medical problems to myself.. and now I'm glad I did.. she doesn't need this.. heck I don't need it.. and espcially; my grandson doesn't need this.. I'm keeping positive.. about both of us. We will both be okay. Mom taught me that attitude is everthing.. so.. that's what I'm doing.. keeping my head up and staying positive.  hugs, anni",

I just saw the surgeon for a check-up this week (I'm 2 1/2 yrs. post-mastectomy) and asked about micro-calcifications.  She explained everyone has some calcifications and they look for oddly shaped, small ones and also patterns of groups.  Those are the suspicious ones. Sounds like you are getting everything in order, which is great.   Keep listening to your gut about what you need and keep asking questions.  If you can, bring someone with you (a friend?) to help take notes and write down the dr's answers.  It's hard to remember everything when you're scared. Blessings to you. yep. I've thought about the need to have someone come with me and take notes... problem is my daughter's out of state and those available to go with me are the type to hit the panic button and make things look a lot worse than they are.. I really don't need that... I'm going to take pad and pen, as well as, my little mp3 player that records voice stuff.. I did  go check out Dr. Susan Love's website.. still have the window open actually.. I don't see anything on questions to ask the doc.. but I'm still lookin'.  Thank you so much for showing me this site. hugs, anni  ",
