      "Content": "I had delayed bilat diep in March. Post DIEP I developed a large hardened area on one upper area of foob which they said was Fat Necrosis.  Just had Phase 2 surgery which included lipo/fat grafting to try and cover it.  PS stated that during surgery had a tough time getting to and my chest is extremely inflammed trauma/red, I am only a week out from surgery so It is too early to determine ulitmately the results especially of the one issue area. Everything else looks ok, i guess as good as it gets.  ",
