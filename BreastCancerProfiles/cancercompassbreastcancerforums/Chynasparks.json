      "Content": "I found a breast lump. I guess I just went into denial, just convinced myself it's benign. It hasn't gone away. I made an appointment to get it looked at but that's just made me more nervous about it. I'm 61 never had any breast disease. I haven't told my family. My husband's father died last year and ever since he's had one thing after another happen to create stress. I don't want to add to his worries. Best case scenario I'll have a mammogram and they'll call it benign then I can tell him all is well. Then my brain starts overworking and I imagine the worst. How do I tell my family I might-MIGHThave breast cancer?",

      "Content": "I feel like I can relate to your mom. I have had a lump for months. I was quite satisfied keeping it a secret. I haven't told anyone in my family. I made an appointment which has now made me nervous about it. You see, speaking up makes it real, keeping it quiet is denial. But your momma has told you, now your stuck with the worry. She's not being cruel. I firmly believe she's where I am with this, verbalizing it actually saying it makes it real and it's scary. I agree with the other reply you got, find a good family member and tell them. It's too much for you to deal with alone. All my prayers",
