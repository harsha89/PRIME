    "Content": "Hi  - I was dx with invasive bc and DCIS in 2003, had lumpectomy, total axillary removal (4/18 nodes positive), chemo and rads. Gosh, a whole year gone through treatment!  Last year the same breast suddenly swelled up, was bright red, so I made an urgent appt with my bc surgeon. He did a mammo, u/s and core biopsy as I thought it could be IBC. I categorically asked him if it was IBC and he looked me straight in the eye, and said \"No, it's not\". It turned out to be lymphoedema - I knew you could get this in the arm, after axillary removal, but never heard of it in the breast. I am not sure if the core biopsy was the right kind of biopsy as I posted on the Medhelp Ask The Doctor bc forum, and the nurse said I should have had a skin punch biopsy. Breast is still very swollen, but the redness has gone. I do think though, that an experienced bc surgeon does know what IBC looks like. Good luck. Liz.",
