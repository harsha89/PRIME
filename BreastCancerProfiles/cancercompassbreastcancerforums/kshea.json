      "Content": "I am on Femara and having joint pain.  My oncologist is suggesting switching to Aromasin but reading these posts it sounds like the side effects are the same.  I have three more years on this drug.  My question for everyone is does this pain go away once you go off the drug?  I think I can handle it for three years if I know it will be gone once I can go off them but if it is causing permanent damage that is another story.",

      "Content": "I started on Tamoxifen and hated the hot flashes and the bloating.  I was so uncomfortable in my body.  So I switched to Femara (now Letrozole).  Joint pain was bad and I got baker's cysts behind my knees.  I have now been on Letrozole for almost 2 years and either I have gotten used to it or the pain has just lessened.  I am still very stiff and have a very hard time standing and/or walking when I just get up from sitting.  In the morning I am unable to walk so the first thing i do is 20 pushups against my dresser and stretch my legs for 5 minutes.  It really helps so I recommend it.  Still have the hot flashes and the baker's cysts - very attractive! ",
