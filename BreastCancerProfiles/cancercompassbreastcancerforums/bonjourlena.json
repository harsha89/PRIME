      "Content": "I lost my Mother on December 12th to breast cancer, she was 63. Heartbroken, I still find it so hard to believe she is not with me anymore, still trying to come to terms with the realization that she is gone. She has been fighting very bravely for 6 years and by the end of it she was so tired & exhausted. My heart was aching seeing her give way to the disease. I am glad she is not suffering anymore, but I miss her terribly.  ",

      "Content": "My mother is stage 4 with mets to bones, liver, and lungs. Her first chemo was Taxol + Avastin about 2 years ago which worked for her for about 3-4 months & put her into remission when she decided to take a break. After 2 months or so the cancer started growing again, so her oncologist decided to put her on Xeloda. My Mother did not tolerate Xeloda well & did not finish even the 1st round (she stopped after 10 days). One of the reasons she stopped is due to the hip fracture, so she never gave it a full chance. Seeing that the cancer was spreading the oncologist put her on Abraxane (same family with Taxol that was working for her before). That worked for her for about 6 months. The most recent CAT scan showed the slow progression of mets in the liver. The oncologist told us that the only option she had left was Ixempra - according to him it had 20% chance of working & if it didn't, she would pass away. I brought my Mother for a second opinion to another oncologist who named a few other drugs that she has as her options, 1 of them navelbine.  So, having tried Taxol/Avastin, Xeloda, Abraxane, her only option is Ixempra? I am having trouble grasping the conclusion made by her primary oncologist & am turning to any of you for any advice. As long as the person is alive you can keep trying to keep him/her alive, am I not right??? Thank you so much in advance. Lena  ",

      "Content": "My Mom and I need advice. My Mom has been fighting breast cancer for years. The last treatment that she was put on by her oncologist was the pill Xeloda. She handles previous chemtherapies relatively well, but this one produced terrible side effects. The next day after she started taking the pill she had vomiting, followed by a very strong pain in the left lower stomach area (groin) followed by the strong muscle pain and inability to move the left leg without pain. The groin pain was so strong that she stopped taking Xeloda after 10 days. The oncologist expressed his inability to diagnose the source of the pain. The X-Ray came back fine. The only idea he had was to send her for another scan. She has been taking Ibuprofen when the pain was too strong to tolerate. Has anyone experienced these side effects? If so, how long before they went away? She has been off Xeloda for 10 days now and no visible improvement. Did you do anything in particular to make the symptoms better? I sincerely appreciate the advice. We need to be strong to fight it.",
