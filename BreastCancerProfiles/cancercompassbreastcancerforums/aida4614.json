      "Content": "my mom had breast cancer four years ago.it was recognized at early stage.she had a surgery and 8 periods of chemo.the ancologist confirmed that she is healthy and nothing to worry about during all these years.but my mom started coughing with pain in chest 2 months ago.he even related it to the side effects of Tamoxifen or allergy .finally it was recognized that the breast cancer progressed into lungs and liver.it is HER2+ the ancologist started chemo with paclitaxel stragen 2 weeks ago. it's said while the drugs of chemo are all the same it doesn't make any difference to change the ancologist and it's better to continue with the previous one who is familiar with the patient.well , my mom refuses to get to know other ancologists here in iran.my cousin asked the head of breast cancer in one of the US hospitals and sent him all my mom's documents. he recommended a combination of Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel. I also recommonded our ancologist these new drugs but it seems he didn't care becoz he prescribed the paclitaxel stragen for the second round of chemo.i wonder which drug can perform better for the metastasic breast cancer and if shall we change our ancologist ? ",

      "Content": "my mom is a 52 year old female with history of left breast mass 4 years ago. Biopsy confirmed comedocarcinoma grade 3. She is s/p left mastectomy and lymphadenectomy. Margins were negative but one of the 14 lymph nodes showed metastatic ductal carcinoma. ER was positive in 75% of cells. PR was positive in 80% of the cells. P53 positive in 80%. HER2neu was positive only in 3% on tumoral cells. She started chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil followed by tamoxifen (4 years ago).  She was on tamoxifen and was doing fine until in April 2014 she started to cough and LDH showed 543 and AST was 43. They changed to LDH 869 and AST 78 in three weeks. CEA was 17.8 and CA 15-3 was 68.5  (2 months before CEA was 2.5 and CA 15-3 was 27 which is in the normal range). Following CT scan showed multiple lesions in the lung and liver. Bone scan was negative. She underwent liver biopsy which was consistent with infiltrative carcinoma but this time it was ER and PR negative. HER-2 was 2+. Her2/neu evaluation with CISH method showed \"No amplification\". after 5 rounds of chemothraphy with paclitaxel , the body showed resistence , so the doctor changed the drug into Navelbine. But after finishing 1 round of Navelbine , the liver's function became worse, terribly deadly pain in liver with all the other aymptoms. now the doctor changed the drug into Gemzar and Carbolatine. she has chemo twice a week in two weeks and then one week for rest.at the second round of chemo her constant coughing and extreme pain start again . I wonder how many drugs can she use for her chemo ? her body doesn't respond to any kinda chemo . She is very weak, not much eating and always sleeping ! or which kinda drug should we try for her ? ",
