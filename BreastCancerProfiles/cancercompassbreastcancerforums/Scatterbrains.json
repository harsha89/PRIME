      "Content": "I have finished taken Arimidex for five years. I was given Amitripline for joint pain and I had a bone density test which I had to take Fosamax which is like calcuim. My hair has also thinned but I stuck it out. I developed diabetes II they say it was one of the side effects of chemo. I would certainly ask my oncologist before I would ask a family physician. That is just my experience.",
