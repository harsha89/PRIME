      "Content": "This is going to take a while to explain. Basically, last June I went to my doctor's to complain about chest pains. He said that it was my ribs straight off, that it could have been how I was sleeping. Since then, I started doing research on cancer in general and started feeling an obsessive compulsive disorder that made me have to look things up to find out what was going on in my body. By September, I has convinced myself I had leukemia, and one night I had a severe headache, a \"buzz\" sensation in my head and severe diarrhea and other things. I went through a couple days of worry and nausea, unable to eat, I lost 20 pounds in 3 to 4 days.. started getting panic attacks and convinced myself I was dying of sepsis. So, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. It's true, I'm anxious. I don't want to die. So, I was okay from about late october to about april, where I started reading up on HIV/AIDS... things started retriggering in me, and I started panicking about illnesses again. My stomach started hurting like crazy for a week or two, off and on. Bloody stools, etc.. I thought maybe I got a GI virus or something.. Anyway, long story short, I haven't had a lot of sleep the past two weeks...maybe 10-15 hours in total. I woke up one day last Sunday with chest pains and such, started feeling against my ribs and started freaking out because I felt a lump at the bottom left side of my rib cage, then I started checking my lymph nodes, there's a lump in the left side of my neck if i push in deep that hurts if i push against it. I started feeling my chest muscles, and it felt like thickened lines...lumpy ridges, etc. It's still here and I'm starting to panic like crazy. My doctor felt it and...gave it a big name that ended in \"itis\"...saying my rib muscles or something were swollen. It hurts a little to the touch depending on where I press on it. My chest is not red, unless I scratch against my breast bone or what not...the redness typically goes away. I am getting even more scared. My doctor told me to take aspirin/advil 3 times a day to \"get rid\" of it. My chest pains have died down since then, but I'm still extremely worried that he may have misdiagnosed me. Everyone keeps telling me that if I had breast cancer or any kind of cancer on my chest, that it would not hurt.. but when I press against various areas on my chest, it doesn't hurt unless I press real hard. As far as I can tell, my lymph nodes are not enlarged. Can someone help me with this worry? What should I tell my doctor? Should I wait until next week before I go see him or should I insist on going to the hospital? (My doctor doesn't work on the weekends...) I'm so scared... -Mathew",

      "Content": "Well my family doctor assured me there was nothing wrong with me.. the complete physical he did showed nothing. I felt bad and anxious so i went to another walk-in doctor, they said nothing was wrong with me..i got scared once again, went to the hospital..they said there was nothing wrong with me, either. My family doctor gave me arthritis pills and anti-ulcer pills so the arthritis pills wouldn't eat a hole in my stomach. I pretty much opted not to take either of those pills, he prescribed them anyway.. but anyway, my chest has been feeling a little better. It could be my whole body is extremely stressed and maybe..just maybe, because i fear this so much and i'm \"constantly checking\", my body is becoming swollen because i'm pushing so hard against my internal organs and/or my glands and such, so they're all swelling. That's just one of the things..it's strange because my symptoms always come and go. Sigh. I found myself in a Leukemia bbs last year because I was afraid of having Leukemia and/or Lymphoma. So.. meh. My doctor recommended I get aggresive psychiatric treatment.. I'm hoping maybe I can get some help for my disorders.. There's something wrong with me, everyone agrees.. they just all think it's mental and not physical. Thank you for your concern.. I really hope things will get better for all of us -.-",
