    "Content": "First, I'm sorry for what you are going through.  I was mis-diagnosed at 39 and my breast cancer went undetected for 9 months.  At that time, I had to have my breast removed, 6 months of chemotherapy and radiation.  Had I been diagnosed correctly the first time, and the cancer was not allowed another 9 months to grow, I may have had a better prognosis.  My cancer has now returned and has spread to my bones. I don't tell you this to scare you, just to affirm that you must be your own best advocate.  If you're worried and uncertain and/or have a \"gut\" feeling, please pay attention to it and don't let yourself be dismissed as a \"psychological\" issue. ",
