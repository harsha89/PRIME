    "Content": "I'm wondering if there are other massage therapists out there who have had or have breast cancer and had a lumpectomy and radiation. I'm hoping to find out how you're doing with your work? Are you able to do a full load? What effects from the surgery and radiation are you noticing? I am a massage practitioner and returned to work two weeks after the lumpectomy and am getting ready to start 6 and a half weeks of radiation treatment. I'm hoping to learn and get some tips from others with experience.  Thanks so much   Harmony",
