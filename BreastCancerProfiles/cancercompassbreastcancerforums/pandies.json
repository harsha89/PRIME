    "Content": "Hello.. new here.. i have been taking tomoxifen for almost five years.. am now post menopausal so my doc put me on Arimidex.. ALL my life my blood pressure was a bit low.. now it is high.. so went off Arimidex.. my question to all of you is ... has anyone experienced high blood pressure from this medication.. along with rapid heart beat and palpitations? Now my fam doctor wants to put me on Topral ... have read the sides of this med and am not risking taking it.. because I believe my high blood pressure and palpitations are from Arimidex.. I have been off my arimidex since September 28... any help or answers is appreciated.. PatriciaÂ ",
