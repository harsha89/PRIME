      "Content": "Thanks, MaryLynn, that is very helpful information!  I'll look up the differences between Femara and Aromasin to see if they are in the same family. Interesting you said you thumb and wrist - because I have the same thing.  How did you go about finding a reputable acupunturist?  I would certainly be willing to give that a try!  Thank you so much.

I then had two acupuncture treatments. The pain in my jaw is gone now and my wrist/thumb are much improved. I would definitely recommend acupuncture. (Naturopath said eat no tomatoes, potatos or green pepper because they contribute to the pain.) I think I was developing ONJ and there are dozens of lawsuits around that! My oncologist wants me to try Aromasin now. That's how I found this board. I'm not sure if I'll take it... it sounds a lot like Femara.  ",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for sharing this!  I completely understand what you are saying.  Are you taking the Aromasin after having Ovarian cancer, or was it breast cancer you had?  I sometimes feel that being an ovarian cancer survivor, I am taking the Aromamsin as a \"window dressing,\" because it is primarily for breast cancer patients.  Because a few of my tumors were estrogen-positive, my oncologist says it's still a good thing to take if I can live with the side effects.  How long ago did you have your original surgery/diagnosis?",

A baby aspirin would not have begun to cut the pain from Aromasin. There are two other drugs in the same chemical family as Aromasin. But, they probably have the same side effects. One is Femara (which hurt me as much as Aromasin) and the other was just prescribed to me today. And don't have the name of it. It's being filled at the pharmacy right now. These two other drugs are worth trying, but only for two months each. I take Tylenol with codeine and Advil for pain. Hope this helps! Lori Lori, did you find out the other name of the prescription you were given last?  Has it made a good difference?",

      "Content": "Blessings to you on your Mission trip - hope were are able to go!  I am suffering much of the same joint pain and weakness.  I'm 63, but feel 80 on some days.  I also have peripheal neuropathy from the chemo and take Lyrica for that.  Not sure if anything is helping keep the cancer away, which, of course is the primary goal.  Mine was Ovarian cancer, but because some of the tumors were estrogen positive, it was appropriate for me to take Aromasin.  Wish I could be sure it helping, since it's causing so many side effects.  My thumb and wrist are also tender, joints are sure not what they used to be.  When I do yard work which I love, I take 1/2 of a Percocet to get me through, but I pay the price the next day.  I am grateful to God, however, for each day I have.  Have you ever tried accupuncture?  I am thinking about that.

Apparently it has had great results.  At the same time I started taking the drug, I started walking 3 days a week and going to curves 3 days a week.  I have never been one to exercise but was really sticking to it.  My feet and hands started hurting and my hot flashes were worse and I was extremely tired and felt heavy.  I could stand to lose l5 lbs but I'm not large and had been doing this routine for 6 weeks.  I'm 63.  I thought I should be feeling good.  I had also been eating healthier and taking supplements.  I decided the only way to see if it was the Aromasin causing the problems was to go off of it.  Within two days I felt better. I have been off of it for a little over two weeks.  You can't help but question if you are doing the right thing.  I felt like I was finally taking control of my life with the exercise and diet and I have alot of faith which has really given me strength.  I feel so blessed to have been given 5 years.  But when I look back I really didn't do anything significant or meaningful.  I didn't think there would be a 2nd 5 year pill and in some ways I wish there hadn't been then there wouldn't be this question.  But I feel like all I can do now is take care of myself the best I can and turn it over to God and hopefully make a difference, whether I have  6 months or 6 years.  I look at life so differently now.  The last 5 years were more about me and now I hope to make the next 5 more about others and give back.. I hope to go on a mission trip this summer. I hope the Tamoxifin works for you.  I still haven't talked to my onchologist yet but am waiting for a call from her today.  I tried arimidex before I took the fareston and I couldn't take it either. I wish you the best and would like to hear from you. JoAnn   ",
