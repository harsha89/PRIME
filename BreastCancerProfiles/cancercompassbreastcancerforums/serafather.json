I was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2002 and received a mastectomy and chemotherapy until March 2003. Hi Dionne, From my experience, a friend at my church has a similar case. I believe that she told me she had breast cancer (stage 3). Doctor said during the later stage of cancer, it can metastisized to other parts of the body. She also mentioned that she had to do 6 rounds of chemo. And suffered from the chemo side effects. She felt nausated most of the time, vomitting and loss her appetite. But she told me that she found an alternative treatment called Fucoidan and AHCC.  I believe she bought it from Amazon. You can google Fucoidan with AHCC Also, I did some research myself and found the official website that did research on AHCC http://ahccresearch.com/ and if you go to PubMed.gov , and type in Fucoidan, there are numberous research about the benefits of Fucoidan. I hope this helps.  I'll keep you in my prayers.",
