      "Content": "I had reconstruction that worked, but like most of us the other one was sagging, so my plastic surgeon (a women ) did a breast augmentation on the saggy one, very good, a little smaller than my reconstructed one but with a small pad in my bra it looks great. Made a big difference in how I felt! I can now wear t-shirts. I however have a different problem, I have chest pain on the side of my surgery, it took about a year to start, it is a burning feeling first, then awful pain that is like a knife across my chest, it doesn't last too long and to describe it better it is like an awful Charlie horse then the pain leaves but you can still feel where it has been. This happens very sporadically, some times two days in a row, or once in two weeks, or it has even happened an hour apart. Just about the time I think it is gone it happens again, and a lot of the time it is in the early morning (3AM) and never while I am active, and once when I was driving, had to pull off the road! The Dr.s have tested for almost everything, heart, back, spin, stomach, intestines, you name it! I call them muscle spasms, but they are bad! HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THESE??",

      "Content": "I have been going through every test they have to find out about the pain I have been having. It started about a year after my mastectomy, it isn't all the time and happens mostly at rest, but the Dr's say it isn't related to my cancer, well now that I have found this site I will have to take it to him! I am sure they think I am nuts, so finding out that I am not alone has made my day! My husband has seen it so knows the pain is real and has gone with me to the many Dr's. one does start to wonder if it is in our heads with all the tests coming back negative, which has been good. Reading about everyone else's pain, I consider myself very lucky that it isn't 24/7, like most of the posts. Good luck to you all. Will leave a post after my appointment this week.",
