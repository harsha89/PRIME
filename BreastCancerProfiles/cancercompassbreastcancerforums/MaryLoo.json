      "Content": "Hi,  I don't think cancer ever was an (automatic) death sentence. I know that's what they are saying now, but I don't believe it. Treatment options? Treatment options havn't changed since the 50's. Chemo, radiation, surgery! Don't be fooled by the (number) of cancer drugs available today, The way they work, biologically, hasn't (really) changed, and the fact that most of them don't really work anyways hasn't changed either. Not being negative, just honest. Until people actually understand what cancer is, they're  going to keep believing that poisoning and burning (chemo and rad) is a good idea. And shame on the cancer industry for keeping people in the dark. Cancer cells are damaged cells, and like any other damage the body suffers, damaged cells will repair themselves when we give them what they need to do so (and quit trying to kill them with toxic chemicals that do more harm than good). The truth will set you free (from cancer too!).",
