I've talked to several women, and they all think they know how they got it. I have a feeling too because I have no family history of it. Between the ages of 20 and 30 I went vegetarian and consumed mainly soy products. I thought I was doing good for myself. I ate veggie burgers, meatless chicken, tofu, edamame, soy sausages....etc. I ate them EVERY day! I know they say soy mimics estrogen so am thinking this may be what triggered my cells to go crazy. Some things I read says plant matter can't do that. I just feel in my gut that this is how I got it. After 30 I ate meat again. But as I try and find the source of the meat, most of it is grain fed.....most of that grain being soy! The chickens are fed grains....soy. The eggs from free range chickens are fed grains....soy! My lotions contain soy! Why does every darned thing I try to eat contain soy! I tried to do better and am left confused by food. Other women ER positive tell me they were on hormone replacement therapy and think that caused it. Another believes it was the hormones in her birth control pills. I am just curious if others have that \"feeling\" that they know what caused them to get this? I was 41 (2012) when I had a 3.5 cm tumor in my left breast. I opted for bi lateral mastectomy. My tumor was close to my chest wall but the surgeon got clean margines. I had 9 lymph nodes removed and 3 had cancer. I was stage 2 but borderline 3. I did 4 rounds of chemo and 36 radiation treatments. I was on tamoxifen for almost a year which made me have a hysterectomy and ovaries removed. I also was having problems with my vision. I couldn't focus my eyes. I switched to arimadex a month ago and hate it already. I have had neck pain and pain between my shoulder blades that has floored me and I can't do anything. My right foot also feels like it is broken. I am just wondering what and how others feel about food........ Yes, I felt the same way about estrogen.  I had been on an estrogen/progesterone patch for years and was doing well when I decided to try natural bioidentical hormones.  My doctor switched me to a certain strength and I recall having some kind of problem, maybe spotting, and so he changed the prescription strength.  All told I was probably only on the bioidentical hormones for a short time but then the breast ca dx came along and it was the first thing I thought of.  My oncologist said that the tumor could have been growing in my for 5 years, there was no way to know.  But it was so small, Just into Stage 2 and next to the chest wall, but the surgeon couldn't feel it, nor could I.  By the way I took Arimidex and had no problem with it but opted to stop it after 3 years because I felt negative taking it and wasn't sure the benefit was worth the risk of worsening my osteoporosis.  My medical oncologist said that he thought 3 years could be long enough and the amount of estrogen left in the ovaries or the body would be a very small amount.  I did try eating soy for a short time but I think it was basically soy burgers only.  I did not blame that on the cancer but the hormones. I even wondered if the strength of the progesterone vs estrogen was a factor.",

      "Content": "In reply to the question about Arimidex - I stopped it June 16, 2013.  Doctor said I'd start producing estrogen again in about a week but in such a little amount.  I have had no problem stopping BUT I changed my calcium to a different kind because of the fear of worsening osteoporosis so I take MCHC calcium (from the bones of calves) and other vitamins included all for bones.  I missed my mammogram this year but have so many other problems (arthritis of spine) that I'm just counting on being positive about the breast ca.  I've had too many x-rays and afraid of them causing ca.  I too go to chiropractor for neck issues and it's helping but doubt they stem from Arimidex.

      "Content": "I've read about lymphedema in the breast and the different stories on this site but I haven't seen where anybody has said they have fluid draining out of the breast thru the nipple.  My doctors have not called this problem lymphodema - they don't say what it is other than fluid which has found the easiest way out and it'll be gone in a year. I have a very hard lump the size of 2 eggs the doctor says, along the incision line on the under arm side.  I've been told by women with lymphodema that that is what it sounds like.  I had surgery and prior to radiation had to have the breast drained of 200cc and once again 100cc a few days later.  I finished 7 weeks of radiation and the breast had been getting larger and harder the whole 7 wks.  I've had it drained twice more since then even though it's draining on its own.   Can someone tell me what this is, what to do about it and if it happened to them.  By the way I was told eventually to wear compression bras or athletic bras but I feel it's squashing me and not sure it's the thing to do esp. since I drain even when wearing these bras. I feel like it might be squashing cancer cells and don't want them kept in by compression.  Tabbits",
