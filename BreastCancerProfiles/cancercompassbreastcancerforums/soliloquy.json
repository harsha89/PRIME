    "Content": "HI, Â  I am writing this because my mother was diagnosed with Lobular Breast Cancer on Wednesday. I am not in her area so have no access to the pathology report for better details other than it is a less than 5cm tumor central to her left breast. She had core biopsies performed 10 days ago after an abnormal mammaogram, thus the Dx. She had not had a mammogram for 20 years prior! She is being advised by her surgeon to undergo a lumpectomy with sentinel node removal for biopsy next Thursday. He may have to do a partial masectomy during the procedure if it looks like it should be done. May be radiation treatments to follow the surgey. My question(s): Should she have the surgery Thursday, or push for more tests such as a CT scan to investigate spread to other organs/bone before starting to cut? Assuming she has the surgery, will they likely wait for pathology before beginning any radiation? Assuming pathology comes back positive for cancer in sentinel node, will an axillary removal of lymph nodes be next or scans? Thank you. I appreciate any answers that may help. Brian",
