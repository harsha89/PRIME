      "Content": "It sounds like your wound is healing nicely. I had an abdominal wound which was not as large as yours apparently is. I changed the dressing twice a day and it slowly healed, but it finally did. The wound granulates from down deep and then finally reaches the surface. Sounds like you are doing great. Just be patient and give it the time it takes.",

      "Content": "You are welcome for the reply. I know all about impatience. I am usually a fairly patient person; however, I had a stem cell transplant 4 months ago and have to tell myself to be patient. I improved greatly from not being able to do anything to being able to do a whole lot more. I am not able to go back to work yet and that is my main goal. I have a good day and think, \"Okay, I can do this. I am about ready to go back to work.\" Then the next day I am wiped out and feel sorry for myself. Time and patience, that is what I have to remind myself. We will make it if we just hang in there. God Bless you and take care. Beasley",

      "Content": "I totally agree with the rest of your responders. I have not had breast cancer but I am currently experiencing my second round of Lymphoma. I had to be persistent for the first doctor to find my cancer the first time. The next time I suspected the cancer had returned my first oncologist blew me off. He is the doctor who is seeing me every 6 months for follow up for my first cancer. I then went to my family doctor who got to the bottom of the problem, diagnosed lymphoma, and referred me to another oncologist. My current oncologist listens to me, discusses my options with me, discussed the good, bad, and the ugly. He also discussed the positive. A doctor who does not take your situation seriously is not worth the gas it takes to get to his office!",
