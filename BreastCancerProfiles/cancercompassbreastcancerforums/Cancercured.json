B/c I was a smoker for many years I am afraid the benefits don't outweigh the late term risks to the heart and lungs. I have however started the arimidex so far with no complcations. I am doing careful watching with my RO. I need to have a mammogram soon- and in six months as well as an MRI in a year and am making lifestyle changes as well as looking into CAM.",

I was told that this is first of all a rare type of cancer and very small. It's on the left side and I was worried about late term effects of radiation- so after having a war with one Rad. Onc. I found another- highly recommended- who said careful watching protocol is a reasonable choice for me so I am not doing radiation. He did, as well as the Med. Onc. recoommend arimidex which after reading all the side effects scares the hell out of me. Should I fry my bones and brains (they haven't finished studying the effect on the brain which is also estrogen rich) on the chance it may recur- and then again, may not? Or am I just being stupid?",

I feel very vague joint pain at night sometimes, but not anything significant. But I did become very depressed which is supposed to be another side effect. But I'm not sure that  was caused by the whole cancer situation or the arimidex. This led to insomnia which led to sleeping pills which led to hardly being able to drag myself out of bed in the morning for work. I do drag myself out in just enough time to drive to work but I don't feel much like doing anything other than climbing back in when I get home, although that could also be due to the cold as I'm in the Northeast. But the most bothersome side effect which I can only attribute to the arimidex because it is only since I began taking it is that I have 2 or 3 healthy BMs everyday. I used to go every few days.

NODES AND MARGINS WERE CLEAR AND NO FURTHER CANCER WAS FOUND BY THE SURGERY.  Because I am an x-smoker I was very worried about late term effects from radiation.After going thru hell with one Rad Onc. I found another who agreed that foregoing radiation and doing close follow up was a reasonable option for me. However both he and the Med. Onc. recommended arimidex which I began to take reluctantly almost 3 monthe post surgery. I didn't realize that the sooner I started it the better. I wasn't told the side effects when i was given the prescription; READ ABOUT THEM AND GOT SCARED TO TAKE IT; and then has to wait another couple of months to see the Med. Onc. again. So I hope it will work for me. So far after close to a month, I have had not side effects except for more frequent BMs which I never paid much attention to before. I need to have a  mammmogram soon and then a bilateral mammogram in 6 months and an MRI six months after that. What are you doing for followup? Did you hear about the new type of mammogram in the news on this site today? ",
