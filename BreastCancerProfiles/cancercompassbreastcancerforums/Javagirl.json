    "Content": "I have only been on Arimidex since June 06. Yes I am having pain in the bottom of both feet, my back, and shoulder. I have had hot flashes, headaches, and elevated blood pressure. I have also had diarrhea, muscle and joint pains which I had not attributed to Arimidex until I reread the side effects list five days ago. This is when I blacked out and awakened with missing teeth and a split lip. Has anyone had trouble with blackouts?",
