Oh, yeah, let's go ahead--thinking that some income would be generated.  I almost hate to suggest this because I like to think only the best of the docs that take care of us, but I wonder if they notice something about your insurance limitations and that might be a reason to not respond to your requests.  Just a thought--one that I certainly hope proves incorrect!",

Smiles) You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, \"I lived through this horror.

I went from actonel to forteo. After reading on this site--I am now sure my joint pain is from aromasin. I find it agonizing to get up and walk in the morning. After a couple of hours the pain seems to go away. Just MOVING seems to help! I have always been an avid exerciser and still walk 3 miles or work out everyday in the afternoon. Have you found it to make any difference to take the Aromasin in the MORNING vs. the EVENING? I am seeing my oncologist for my 6-month check-up Nov. 20. I would ceertainly like to go back to tamoxafin if possible. I will take the hot flashes over these body aches and pains. And, yes, I think the pain is getting worse and more annoying. The Aromasin written insert said few experienced joint pain and it often goes away after taking aromasin for a few weeks or months. I think that is baloney! I have been on aromsin since July. I had a very early stage breast cancer in July 2004 and only had direct radiation (mamacite)--10 tratments and no chemo. I do wonder if these side effects of Aromasin are really worth and is it really necessary to switch to it?",

      "Content": "I have read the above entries and they contain EXCELLENT advice.  I want to throw in my 2-cents worth.  I am a breast cancer survivor, age 58 (diag. 2004).  I've raised 2 fabulous children. Not a grandmother yet--but I will be a good one too someday. I am also the director of a wonderful preschool.  I do a LOT of parent counseling...working with today's generation of parents whose lack of parenting skills is often appalling.  I deal with what I call \"helicopter parents\"---they continuously \"hover\" over their children--doing more harm than good.  When parents are SOOOO protective, a negative message is often relayed to the child resulting in the child being insecure.  When well-meaning parents rush to the rescue, the message to the child is: \"I'm not sure I trust you to succeed.\" I do believe your grandson's parents fit into this category.  I highly recommend you tracking down the article, THE PERFECT CHILDHOOD: Why It's Bad for Kids by Judsen Culbreth.  This was printed in Sept. 2005 Readers' Digest.  At my school we give copies of this article to parents of our 3's and 4's.  I also have a suggestion for YOUR coping of this situation of this situation.  Obviously you like to write and are good at expressing your thoughts and feelings.  I LOVE to write.  I suggest you keep a journal (a nice, pretty bound book) and write in it everyday or whenever you feel the need.  Direct your writing TO your grandchild...tell him about YOUR life, your values, your suggestions for living a good life, your feelings of love for him.  Hopefully, this journal will be written over many years...you may even need to go to a second bound book.  By the way--do date your entries.  Can you just imagine what a treasure this \"diary\" would be to your grandson someday???  What a beautiful piece of you he would have forever.  I have letters written to me by my grandmother who has been gone for 30+ years...I love looking at her handwriting; I love touching her loving words on the page.  Words spoken drift in the wind, but words written become a testimony that last forever and can be treasured and give someone strength.  I am imagining your grandson reading your advice, etc. when he is a teenager--a grown man--and a father himself someday.  What a gift!  Hope this helps.",

I think it is VERY important to celebrate milestones in one's journey with breast cancer.  I took my last Tamoxifen on Aug. 23.  With family and friends (about 60 people) we had a PINK party.  Beautiful invitations were sent out.  (And people did not want to miss this--what a crowd). The home was decorated with PINK roses and PINK napkins, cloths, plates, etc.  Everyone was encouraged to wear PINK.  That in particular made the party awesome.  Men went out and bought PINK shirts.  Every shade of PINK was there.  Cute little girls had on their hot PINK. The menu was desserts and PINK champagne--perfect for a beautiful summer evening (8:00 pm). The array of desserts were PINK: PINK cake baked in a breast cancer ribbon pan, ribbon-shaped cookies, PINK candies.  Everyone was wanting to make and bring a PINK dessert to the party.  At the party everyone cheered and toasted me when I had my last pill served on a silver platter and downed it with a glass of PINK champagne.  There was laughter; there were tears; there was an electric emotion that was almost touchable.  I have a special cookie bar that I have made for years called Survivor Bars.  I baked them, put them in little PINK boxes, and they made a terrific party favor.  I cannot tell you what a wonderful time this was!  People are still talking about the PINK party.  Not only was it a great celebration for me, but what a way to spread breast cancer awareness.  I encourage all women to celebrate the events in their journey--whether it is the completion of radiation or chemo or successful surgery--whatever!  Truly--adversity CAN be turned into a positive.  It may look impossible to some, but dig deep, celebrate your life right NOW!",

The menu was desserts and PINK champagne and PINK lemonade--perfect for a beautiful summer evening (8:00 pm). The array of desserts were PINK: PINK cake baked in a breast cancer ribbon pan, ribbon-shaped cookies, PINK candies.  Everyone was wanting to make and bring a PINK dessert to the party.  At the party everyone cheered and toasted me when I had my last pill served on a silver platter and downed it with a glass of PINK champagne.  There was laughter; there were tears; there was an electric emotion that was almost touchable.  I have a special cookie bar that I have made for years called Survivor Bars.  I baked them, put them in little PINK boxes, and they made a terrific party favor.  I cannot tell you what a wonderful time this was!  People are still talking about the PINK party.  Not only was it a great celebration for me, but what a way to spread breast cancer awareness.  I encourage all women to celebrate the events in their journey--whether it is the completion of radiation or chemo or successful surgery--whatever!  Truly--adversity CAN be turned into a positive.  It may look impossible to some, but dig deep, celebrate your life right NOW!",

I was told that I would be on these drugs for a total of five years. Now, my doctor tells me that I can stay on Aromosin for five years. I'm concerned that maybe these drugs might be doing harm that we don't know about - but at the same time I want to do all I can to prevent the big C from returning. I have had joint aches, back pain, sadness (on and off), tiredness and just not feeling \"good\" since going through this cancer experience (chemo, radiation). I'm curious if some of these feelings will go away if I stop taking the aromosin. I don't know what to do -- keep taking it, or stop. Any thoughts? My heart-felt wishes go out to all of you on this message board. Thanks for reading my message and for your thoughs. Hi,  I am 4 yrs out and after taking tamoxifin for 3.5 yrs I was put on Arimidex, bad side effects for me so was changed to Aromasin.  I experienced the same side effects that you are discribing and my Oncologist took me off of that too and back on Tamoxifin (he says for 1 yr).  I feel ten times better than when on Aromasin.  I hope you find the answers you are looking for and hope you are feeling better soon.  ",

The advantage is that you are radiated only in the exact spot!  I think that is safe and also HEALTHY areas of your body are not being radiated.  It was very fascinating to watch the little \"seed\" of radiation travel through the tube and be \"in there\" for an exact, specific abount of time.  Example: sometimes it would be in there for 2 min. and 5 seconds or 6 minutes and 2.5 seconds, etc.  Every time you go for the treatment the breast is x-rayed to see that the balloon has not deflated or shifted.  My little balloon was always just where it should be.  The balloon stays inflated for the whole 5 days and is about the size of a ping pong ball.  Also, at least in 2004, the radiation had to be twice a day with a certain amount of hours between \"zaps,\" and it had to be 5 consecutive days.  So, look for being scheduled for a Monday through Friday. The technician told me I would feel very fatigued.  WOW! did I????  I don't know if it is because the radiation is a \"real whammy\" via the mammosite, but I was exhausted.  I would get back into bed immediately after the morning treatment and sleep until the afternoon treatment.  I would also go to bed about 8 pm. I also felt tired for several week after the treatment was completed...usually going to bed about 8;30.  All in all, I say this is the way to go if you can.  It is so wonderful how all these breast cancer treatments are advancing!  I am now a true survivor.  I took my last tamoxifen on Aug. 23.  I now get a cancer check-up (blood work) every 6 months, and I am getting a mammogram just once a year like any other gal!  Best of luck to you!  Sharing one of my favorite quotes: Courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway.
