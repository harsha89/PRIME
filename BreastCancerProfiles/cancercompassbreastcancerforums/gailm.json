    "Content": "I was on Exemestane for 1 year - Jan 06 to Feb 07.  The side affects got so bad that I stopped.  From the FIRST day I took a pill, my legs ached and had currants going thru them.  The oncologist group just said take benadryl and vicoden. My family doctor gave me Requip for restless leg syntrome, which helped some. I developed pain in all my joints. It hurt to sit, stand and bend. After a few months I stopped for a month, but nothing changed so I thought it was not Exemestane, and went back on it. My oncologist said my body just had to get use to it. Several months later I went to physical therapy for 3 months.  That didn't help. In Feb 07 my feet got numb and my hands started hurting. It hurt to open the refrigerator and drive the car......that's when I said \"that's enough\".  I quit Exemestane. I felt like a 95 year old women.  I couldn't clean house and was walking with a cane.  I just had total hip replacement surgery.  They say it may take a year to get it out of my system.  No one seems to be able to tell me if the bad side affects will go away then, or remain.  My hands go numb during the day and sometimes burn. I wrote a letter telling what happened to me to the trial people and the oncologist.  No one has answered any of my questions.  Has anyone else experienced these side affects?  Has anyone else figured out what to do?",
