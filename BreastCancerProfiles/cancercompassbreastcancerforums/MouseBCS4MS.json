    "Content": "I am diagnosed with Stage IV Breast Cancer Mets to my Spine. I have tumors on C3-C5, T3-T6, My whole lower spine is full of Cancer. After radiation and chemo in lower spine, I am now bed ridden and can not feel from my lower ribs to my feet. So I noticed I had been sweating profusely but did not feel sick. Finally I borrowed a thermometer and had a 106.? Temperature. I ended up in the emergency, then cancer center, then a physical therapy rehabilitation center. I was gone from home nearly 3 months. I came home 11/23/15. Before this sometime in October I was suffering with thrush, I recognized the symptoms, but the facility did not have a regular doctor on duty? I then became very discombobulated after two weeks, I began dropping everything I put my hands on, I was not myself, very confused, seeing things, paranoid, just all around irritable. So , this lady comes in and says \"I think you need to be on hospice\". I was like, \"um ok?\". Now my physical therapy was taken away, and the biggest thing \"I did not know\" is I no longer am under the care of mt much respected and trusted Oncologist. Also, my cancer shots that I receive monthly, that actually (stopped my cancer from growing in my lower spine) has been stopped. I was having Zomeda, Faslodex, And \"darn I completely forget the name of the third) lol. I think it starts with an X. Anyhow, I'm supposed to have a IHSS person yet to find a competent worker, I have my girl from hospice mon-fri one hour a day. Needless to say. I now have some blisters and deep red spots on both sides of my hips and a lump between my spine and left trapezoid area and they don't do xrays, I asked why not. They said,\" well it's probably just your cancer\" we can make sure you are out of pain\". I said but it hurts and I am already taking morphine 60mg two times per day. Nothing else will help, except to find out what the problem is. I really don't know what to do? ESA",
