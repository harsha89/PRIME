      "Content": "My wife was diagnosed with Stage 4 Breast Cancer four days ago.  She is 44 (45 in a couple of week, three kids).  PET Scan reveals it has spread to her pelvic area, spine, lymph node next to her liver and near her thyroid.  If there is a positive side to this, current imaging did not show cancer in major organs.  Estrogin receptors are positive.  The doctor (highly recommended in my town) started her on Tamoxifen once per day with Zomedia once per month.  We will be getting a biopsy of her spine area in a couple of weeks. My knowledge is limited at this point.  My instinct is to use the quickest and strongest means to stop the growth of the disease.  That would lead more to Chemo and possibly surgery.  Yet the doctor has explained that this cancer cannot be cured, but treated and controlled.  Hormonal Therapy, while not as quick as Chemo, is just as effective (per our doctor) and if we used a scorched earth plan and used all types of treatments (surgery to remove breast, Chemo, radiation), my wife would still have cancer in her body.  In her opinion, the better course is to use the Hormonal Therapy (assuming it works) and use the others when necessary.  This was supported by a second oncologist (family member - at age 8 she was the smartest person I knew and, 36 years later, remains that way after stints that include Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering). Yet it is counter-intuitive to me if we don't use the most aggressive treatment to get rid of what we can and limit the spread any further. It is also frustrating feeling that we are not being proactive enough. But two highly respected doctors say this is the best course to take. Am I completely off the mark?",

      "Content": "Dear Mary Pat, I too have cancer but I have to say the only real true tests that show cancer cells or infected tumors is a PetCT or a biopsy.  I had a mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and a CT scan and all showed no sign of cancer.  When I asked my doctor for a biopsy he recommended to wait 2 months.  Thank god I did not.  Going into surgery he gave me a 97% chance that there would be no cancer found.  He was shocked to find out he was wrong.   You know your body more than anyone else.  Do what you think is necessary for your own peace of mind. And best wishes to you  Stacy  ",
