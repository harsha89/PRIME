    "Content": "Hi Aranka, My sister is in a very similar situation as your friend - Stage 4 Breast Cancer with mets to bone.  Because of the pain in her hips and legs, she has had to use a cane to help her walk.  Just today, on her way into treatment, my sister tripped on her cane, fell and broke her hip!  She lives in Virginia and I'm in Florida.  I had just spent the week with her last week and we had such a great time - I truly didn't want to leave and now I know why.  My sister, while clinging to her independence, should not have been going anywhere alone in such a fragile state.  I pray the surgery will be a success and that she will be able to recover and continue the battle against this horrible beast. It sounds like you & your friend are also separated - which makes it very hard to feel like you're helping.  Of course any little card is a great reminder of how much you care, sharing funny emails and if you two have an iPad, iPhone or \"smart phone\" - this game \"Words with Friends\" is a fun interactive you can play together - it's like \"Scrabble\".  Nothing beats face time, though - so if there's any way to visit her... In our case, \"improvement\" just hasn't happened - but the doctors continue with different chemo drugs and my sister just finished a second round of radiation Monday.(Aaarrgh!)  My mission has been to comfort my sister with humor, playing games like Mah Jong, watching \"Dancing w/ Stars\" together or apart...Any sense of normalcy that keeps dark thoughts away. I understand your feeling of wanting to know about \"time\" - it's just not black & white - and I've looked everywhere for answers.  The only answer is to cherish everyday, have some contact daily with your friend and pray to God, the Universe, Higher Power - whatever you believe.  Also, when doing research, no matter where the cancer may spread, the treatment will ALWAYS be based on Breast Cancer.  My point - even when cancer is in my sisters bones - it's still Breast Cancer - not bone cancer.  That is where your research should be focused.  I am so fortunate to have a large, loving and generous family.  We've circled our wagons around our sister and we ain't leaving no time soon.  My sister has been there for me since the day our parents brought me home after delivery.  Now I'll be there for her. Love and Peace to you and your dear Friend. Teresa  ",
