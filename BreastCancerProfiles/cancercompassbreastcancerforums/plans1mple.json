      "Content": "I have stage 4 breast cancer. ER+, PR+, HER2. Had chemo, lumpectomy, radiation and cyber knife on my spine. Finished all that up in Jan 2015. With clean PET scans ever since and the doctor has re-staged me to NED (no evidence of disease). I still get herceptin every three weeks. My problem is letrozole (or any of the other three I have tried).  I am miserable on it. Joint pain, muscle cramps and mentally I have gone negative and mean. I know it is the damn med but with hopes of no more chemo soon I really need a line of defense against reoccurance, maybe. Looking for others with mets that have her2 positive that have gone off of letrozole and how they are doing? or how did they cope being on it? I am not sure it is worth it.",

      "Content": "Thank you. Living with stage 4 can be done, people hear stage 4 and wanna curl up in bed for good. Just a number.  Spoke with my Dr. switched to a different medicine. I have been on them all. Back on exemenstane. What really helped was I went on a med dose pack and a month of mobic. Both steroids and my back and joint pain is almost gone!  So not sure if it was letrozole, or cumlitive of the letrozole or some other inflamation. Hoping it stays away!",
