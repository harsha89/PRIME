Hi there, I am new to this forum having been diagnosed in Feb 07 with metaplastic breast caricinoma. I have had a 2cm tumor removed from my right breast and have had breast reconstruction done to both breasts. I have undertaken not to use conventional chemo or radiation believing and having read that neither is helpful for this triple negative rare cancer, particularly as my health situation is complicated by epilepsy, and a severe allergy to aspirin and natural salicylates found in 90% of fruit, veggies, herbs and spices. (esp all the truly best cancer fighting foods!)  I cant even enjoy most of whats left for me to eat in its raw state as the cabbage family (also good cancer fighting foods!) must be eaten by me in a cooked form as I have an underactive thyroid probelm which is made terribly worse when eating raw juiced cabbage greens! My medication for epilepsy - which I was receiving 100mg per day too much for many many years and is toxic above 10% of the daily dose... prescribed under doctors supervision.... is partially responsible for my allergies and maybe even the cancer.... changing it seems only to bring with it other side effects I am not prepared to suffer with in addition to all the above. My situation is further complicated with a multiple (millions of) lipoma disorder which is responding to detox but not disappearing..... I am also allergic to wheat and gluten... and am on digestive enzymes daily to help my system cope with what food intake I manage. - digestive enzymes play a big role in fighting cancer - please research this for confirmation! A brain scan also revealed I have white spots... probablysome  demyleanating disease which is helped by thinning the blood with aspirin and delivering more oxygen to the brain...(which I cannot take as I am deadly allergic to aspirin). I have cut out most sugars, but eat bananas, apples, pears and papaya, very little dairy - lactose sugar being just another form of sugar, some preferably organic - meat chicken or fish and potatoes( but potatoes only whenever my Vit C intake creates too much diahorrea -I dose up on Vit C daily up to 10grams daily!) I use an ozonator to increase my ozygen intake and take Prooxygen tablets 2 x day.... I am also taking 1 caesium Chloride tablet after my night time meal along with a Selenium and potassium supplement - this is to help the body's pH level become more alkaline. Cancer thrives in a acidic condition, most cooked foods become acidc in the body and along with sugars and lack of oxygen from poor breathing or inactivity, are the perfect environment for cancer to grow. Change all of these, and you might arrest cancer! If one has allergies, get these under contol as well! I no longer use deoderants, only baby shampoo, salt for brushing teeth, no perfumes etc - all in effort to keep body clean of toxins which in my case are mostly the natural aspirins - salicylates - found in everything!Other than than I drink a lot of water.... very seldom any more coffee, no tea (too high in salicylates for me!) My salicylate sensitivity will take up to 3 years to come right... What I am doing has so far helped me feel a lot healthier than I did in February - I have lost over 15kg, my skin has cleared up, many of my lipomas have emptied much of their content - (see the Lipoma forum to understand what a severe problem a  lipoma disorder can actually be - these are not just harmless fatty tumors as doctors and women's magazines might say.... and do they become cancerous? Who knows? I have had a rare breast tumor in amongst millions of lipomas... who can say?  Even the very large ones on  my kidneys seem to respond to the above detox routine...) You will note that I omit many supplements that are helpful for fighting cancer...Sutherlandia, green tea, aloe vera juice, glyconutrients and many many others Vit B17 etc., - Why\" My own personal experience with the Canadian cancer fighting herbal Essiac tea, where I nearly went in to anaphylactic shock - herbs - are extremely high in natural salicylates (aspirin) in Feb has seen me take a much more cautious approach to evrything - not everything works for everyone... Zinc for instance helps fight cancer and repairs the body, but it prevents lipomas from opening up and releasing their contents... I have realised that the healthy way of eating might well be as the saying goes - \"One man's meat, is a another man's poison!\" In my case with an aspirin and salicylate allergy it proved to be true! Its possible that while fighting allergies daily, cancer developed unnoticed... now giving my body a chance to cope without dialy ingesting what I am allergic to, it can now deal with the cancers... if my immune system is hyper sensitive to food, often reacting even when I pass by something, let alone eat it, it can therefore deal with cancer! We are after all wonderfully made! Each person is so individual that its difficult for one thing to be suitable for everyone. On the caesium chloride - it must be taken after a substantial meal... it should really be taken under a doctor or natropaths direction and guidance - there are some side affects - 2 of them make me very dizzy, hence the reason I only take one at night after my main meal, along with the Selenium and potassium. They have made my lips tingle... and I do drink a fair amount of water with them... When I start to feel headachy - something I do whenever my body seems to have had enough \"metals' then I give myself a day's break from the caesium chloride. To date in  South Africa I have battled to find litmus paper strips to help me ascertain whether taking the caesium chloride is helpful in bring the body's pH level to more alkaline than acidic... As I cannot eat the foods that will alkalize my body, I am relying on the caesium chlordie and all the above things I am doing to help me accomplish this... but I am working in the dark so to speak and also need to be under a medical doctor's supervision. It can also strangely make one feel somewhat negative or fearful. Care must be exercised ao as not to kill off cancer cells too quickly as the dead mass can kill the patient with the body being unable to clean or detox itself - Dr  Paulus Lining top cancer researcher from the 50's 60's was very adamant that such care must be exercised and even he lost patients to their dying from cancer cell death -particularly if the tumors are in the brain.... so please be cautious in whatever course of action you do take. And in all this, it depends entirely on your mom, what further treatment she is prepared to undergo.... many choose to let life take its 'natural course', many choose to undergo conventional treatment with little or no true benefit even experiencing terrible side effects.... its their choice. But what changes your mom can and is willing to make to her own lifestyle will all help her feel much healthier. My prayers go up for you as a family. Its not easy making these decisions - I am turning 51 this week, with many years of living ahead of me... unsure like any other cancer patient whether I will live to see them. What I do know  for certain is this, and please do not take any offence, in time and not too far off from now, our creator, Jehovah God will soon undo all the harm Satan, his demons and all that unwitting humans have done to this marvelous creation, planet earth and its inhabitants! In a beautifully reconstructed, renewed, renovated parklike earth, humans will be brought back to perfect health and even those dead or dying will receive the life they were meant to enjoy, free from sin, sorrow, illness and death.... these wonderful promises found in God's Word the Bible can help sustain anyone on a daily basis... just think, with just a mere thought, a mere utterance of God's mouth, all illness will be a thing of the past, a mere dimming memory....It was never his intention for mankind to  live  like this - even as a careful study of the bible will reveal... May such wonderful thoughts become a reality for you and your family.... pray for guidance in what choices you make regarding treatment... not all works for everyone... Take good care.
