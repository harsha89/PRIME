    "Content": "I was so relieved to find this thread.  In 2/10 I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer that had already metastisized to the lymph nodes.  But, several months, even as much as a year before, I began to feel that something was wrong with me.  I asked my general practitioner to check for heart issues and diabetes, plus asked my ob/gyn about cancer because I had pain in my breast and armpit.  HOWEVER, relative to this post, I had begun smelling a difference in my urine, and no one took me seriously!!  I told them I could smell cancer!!  The smell wasn't unbearable.  It was much like the not-so-clean smell around the time of my period....but, I KNEW!!!  My question is, why aren't doctors taking this seriously?",
