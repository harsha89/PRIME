      "Content": "Hi Susan, I am Surprised how few message boards and patients show up on line who are on Faslodex. I have been on Faslodex every four weeks since November 2011. I have been getting more and more SE. my latest problems are: extreme sciatica pain, injection site pain, lumps under 5he skin, and other problems r3lated to my spinal st3nosis. I believe that that the monthly injections have ascerbated my spinal problems. Nurses are supposed to inject into buttocks carefully missing sciatica nerves. But I don\u2019t thinkk they have been. Now , I can\u2019t walk. My right leg has beeen freezing up w/muscle contractions and excruciating pain, as soon as I stand up for more than5 minutes. It collapses, and I fall. HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS??? I have been on it for 7 & half years. Swagme",
