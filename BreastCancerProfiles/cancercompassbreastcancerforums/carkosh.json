    "Content": "Anyone here taking Arimidex having any fluctuating liver function levels?  I've been taking Arimidex 4 yrs since being dx'd with Stage 1 bc: .8mm tumor, no node involvement, right side mastectomy.  Except for the 1st month taking Arimidex I've had very minimal side effects, just lft levels that are normal sometimes & high at others.  Just curious as I haven't found much info on internet concerning Arimidex & lft levels.  My onc doesn't appear to be much concerned altho he has ordered an abdominal scan (took this yesterday, waiting for results) & a bone scan next week to try to ascertain what is causing these fluctuations.
