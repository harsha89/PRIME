Trigger finger/catches and locks Severe, debilitating joint pain from hips to balls of my feet and bilateral wrists and hands.  Feels like my hands are going to snap off at the wrists. weight gain headaches muscle spasms in my legs, feet and toes loss of energy neuropathy, verified nerve damage can't walk after sitting for a few minutes, feel like I'm 100 yrs old hot flashes feel like my fingers are swollen triple their size but when I look at them and they appear normal in size.  I can't do puzzles, sew, or groom my dogs because my hands don't work. legs, hands, feet throb 24/7 I'm sure there are more but I can't remember all of the problems.  Oh yes, memory problems too. Oh my goodness...I've just found this thread of messages and it seems that I am reading my own thoughts.  I am having so much joint pain and wasn't sure what was going on.  I am taking Aleve everyday..and it does seem to help..but when I sit for a while ... getting up is a real trial.  I mentioned the pain to my oncologist and he said that was one of the side effects of Aromasin...but he didn't elaborate and I wasn't sure that was the sole cause so I didn't pursue it....I will do so when next I see him.  Thank you to everyone who has responded...just knowing that all of this isn't 'in my mind'....has helped me tremendously...Grace to you all...",
