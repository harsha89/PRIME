      "Content": "My sister got a clean bill from her mamogram 2 -3 months ago.  She got a suspicious lump on her stomach, a couple days later a lump between her breast and then a pea size one on her neck gland.  All showed up within a couple of weeks.  She went to the Dr and after an ultrasound and a PET scan, they told her she had stage 4 breast cancer.  Further tests show it has traveled throughout her body, including all of her organs, including her brain.  They have given her 2 -3 months with radiation.  What can we do?",
