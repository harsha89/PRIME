      "Content": "Thank you for replying to me. My angiosarcoma was radiation induced from an earlier 1996 cancer of same breast. A lumpectomy was done at that time with 5 weeks radiation. Cancer at that time was inductal carcinoma insitu, no nodes involved. Very early cancer. I feel if I had not had the radiation I would not have this cancer now. I am to have a cat scan April 30, and will receive results May 2. If it is cancer I understand the surgeon will be excise the nodule. What is a re resection and is irridation the same as radiation? Thank you.",

      "Content": "Wow you certainly were put thru the wringer so to speak. So happy you are okay. I found a very large lump in L breast. Bruising too. Had a mammogram, followed by biopsy. 2 weeks later results said NO cancer. Benign fibroid with inflammation. However, Dr. not happy so sent me to Cancer Clinic for a further biopsy. Another biopsy done. 2 weeks later I was diagnosed with angiosarcoma. I had a radical mastectomy within 2 weeks. After healing I had chemo (doxirubicin and Isophamide). I went into hospital every 3 weeks and my chemo was intraveniously induced for 37.5 hours. It was very aggressive chemo. I had 5 treatments. My oncologist cancelled the 6th, said my body couldn't take any more. I then had a blood transfusion. After that it was a case of recuperation. All that was in 2006/07. In March of this year I had a DIEP reconstruction done. I am still sort of recuperating from this extensive surgery. Sorry for the delay in replying. I hope by now you are doing well and are a survivor. God Bless",

Just to let everyone know that my resection was done and all the lumps were benign. It is now April 30, 2008 and I have just had my 6 monthly check up, X-Ray and physical by oncologist. Everything is good. I feel good. Am trying to exercise more than I usually do. Eat right. By the grace of the good Lord I feel like I have beaten this very rare form of cancer. Every day is a blessing. If there is anyone out there who has been diagnosed with this very rare form of cancer, believe, hope and pray. I AM A SURVIVOR FOR THE 2ND TIME. God Bless you all.",

      "Content": "Hello, I had cancer in 1996 which recurrence again in 2006. I had a radical mastectomy. On March 23, 09 I had a DIEP reconstruction done. I have healed quite well but am concerned about hard lumps now appearing along my abdominal scar line. I also have a large hard lump in my reconstructed breast. Is there anyone who has had DIEP reconstructed with these side effects. I do understand that it may be just fatty tissue, however, sometimes I wonder? Help? Daffodil",
