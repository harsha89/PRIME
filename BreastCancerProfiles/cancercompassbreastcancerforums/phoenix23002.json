      "Content": "Hi Grace234, I was diagnosed with stage 2, estrogen/progesterone positive breast cancer in Dec. 2005.  I went to a surgeon, not an oncologist when I found the lump.  I started Ave & AHCC Immpower the first week in January, had a lumpectomy & sentinel node surgery on March 20, 2006.  I was a very sick puppy that Dec, Jan, Feb.; weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, just felt funny, especially after eating, sore lymph nodes under my armpits.  But first of March, starting feeling better.  Long story but didn't see an oncologist until May, 2007. My lymph nodes had come back clean (no cancer cells in them... shocked me!!) I sat there waiting for her to tell me I would need chemo or something.  But she replied to my question that I had no symptoms... couldn't justify treatment to the insurance company.  I almost kissed her. lol..She did write an rx for tamoxifen.  I told her I would think about taking it.  Filled the rx but it is still in the bag from the pharmacy.  I continue to take Ave & Immpower plus Noni (shipped fresh from Hawaii) and still feel fine.  Just be sure you order the Ave from a reputable company.. it is too expensive to waste your money on an improperly handled product.  Get over night shipping.  Make sure you get a cold pack.  If it is fresh, it will be hard to mix;it will stick to everything when you try to stir it into a liquid. If it is stale (& useless), it will stir into the liquid fairly easily & won't stick hardly at all.  Also, it will taste pretty bland and mild.  Ave is great stuff!!  It has had legitimate clinical trials in 1/2 dozen countries and has been written up in a number of medical journals.  It is the real deal.  If you need additional  info, please private message me.  And good luck to you, my friend.. phoenix23003 On 1/1/2008 Grace234 wrote: Thank you for the information.I was told D-glucorate,indolplex are good supplements for receptor positive cancers.I still have one more chemo to go through and then I will have to see the oncologyst to discuss the treatment that follows.  I am in Los Angeles .I did not trust the people I saw in the natural field very not commited and not reliable. Maybe,I should combine the therapies for best results and less side effects. Thanks a lot,         ",

Then had to go back for 6 days to the hospital due to infection in the incision & had to have another surgery. I have a very large support group of friends. I haven't cried since the day I found out the test results.Everyone says I'm so strong. I'm smiling, joking & thinking & speaking positive.Yesterday I had a melt down. Insurance company was giving me a hard time & I just lost it. My friends think it was just because of the insurance. It was & so much more. I'm in constant discomfort do to the expanders & its getting to me. I just don't feel as strong as I show I am. A close friend has stage 4 rectal cancer & has be going through agressive treatments. I just feel that I have no right to complain. My cancer is gone & he might die from his. Can anyone out there relate? Yes...lol. I can relate.  I went to a surgeon to look at a lump in my right breast, Jan.'06; he did a biopsy that same day & it was cancer.  Dr. wanted me to have a breast MRI before he would operate, my breasts were too dense due to natural progesterone cream and I had to wait six weeks to schedule an MRI.  The delay was the best thing that ever happened to me.  Started some natural/alternative therapies, ate right, took vitamins.  Finally had lumpectomy Mar, 06,  didn't get it all, had some inflammation, on antibiotics for 2 mons, went back in and did a mastectomy with expander (done by a plastic surgeon), Aug '06.  I was miserable.  If I ever have another drainage tube in me, somebody just shoot me!!!   They hurt worse than the surgery.  After they came out, I was so scared to walk or shop or be in a car, scared somebody would walk into me or I would be in a wreck & the expander would just explode...LOL !!!  Dr. thot I was a little nuts, but he just has no idea (and will never know) how unsettling it is to have this foreign 'thing' in you.  To make a long story short, had another surgery for the implant, then had to have another one because the Dr. decided the 'belt' support for the implant was too high and it wasn't connected to anything.  So the implant kept slipping further & further down the chest wall.. well... duh !!...  So had to have the implant replaced and he attached the support this time.  So I was a whole year with surgeries.  Happy I did it & so happy it is behind me.   You aren't as strong as you were before.  Surgery, anesthesia, recovery takes a lot out of you.  I was told not to raise my arms above my head for 4 - 6 wks and not to lift over 5 lbs.  I couldn't open a carton of milk after a year of that advice..lol...  It has been 3 yrs now and I still don't feel as strong as I once was but I am doing great !!  Don't you feel guilty.  No cancer is easy.  It changes your life forever!!  And having been there, you can be so helpful to your friend & vice-versa.   Just eat right, take it easy on yourself.  You 'ain't' going nowhere..lol.  So, stop & smell the roses.  Reach out to others, pray, meditate;God bless & be a blessing to others.  This too shall pass as the old saying goes.  It is kind of you to be sympathetic to your friend.  Be strong for your friend & yourself.  Nothing wrong with an upbeat, positive attitude.  That may be wonderfully helpful to your friend.  If you read the posts in here a lot, they say over & over, attitude can make all the difference.  I wish you patience & tolerance with yourself & others around you.  I wish you strength and joy.  Oh, by the way, it is ok to cry sometimes.  Somebody gave us tear ducts for a reason, right?  I always feel better after a good cry..lol  You take care & God Bless.         ps... just a hint to anybody going thru this.. I sew so I had some packs of seam tape, the white, lacy, polyester type.  It doesn't ravel so it was perfect.  I tied a length of tape around my waist & pinned all the drainage & pain bulbs to the tape at my waist instead of pinning them to my bra. It was great in the shower.  I would just take off the wet tape off after my shower & use a fresh, dry length & repin the bulbs.  Worked wonderfully.  ",

I ahve always to know more about alternative and complemetary medicines and I too came across the name Avemar a few months back and talked to my surgeon who had never heard of it. I talked to my 2 oncologists about what vitamin and minerals to take but they just say eat a healthy diet. Any suggestions on how I can boost my immune system would be helpful, thanks. Also the address of wher I can bury Avemar please. Could I take that with tamoxifen? My cancer was stage 3, HR++, had not spread to sentinel node and was 1.3cm. I had a lumpectomy and am just about to start radiotherapy in August.  Joanne Joanne... hope you are doing well with your radiotherapy.  You can purchase Ave from Better Health International - pho 800-772-5568.  I pay the extra $ 20.00 for overnite shipping (they are in Florida, I am in Va... hot, hot, hot), especially in the warm months of the year so my Ave is cool & I keep it in the frig.  I was taking AHCC by Immpower but now take Mycocelitics Mycophyto Complex.  I think I get it at Vitacost.  It is 1/2 the price of the AHCC & seems to be working well with the Ave.  I take my vitamins am & pm with meals & my Ave last thing at nite before bed.  If you are over 200 # , you probably need to take two packets of Ave for it to be effective.  Ave is wonderful for boosting the immune system, cleaning up stray cancer cells and for alleviating side affects from chemo & radiation.  Eat healthy, avoid sugar & dense carbs, drink organic green tea, exercise and drink plenty of water.  Graviola, an amazon herb, is a neat product that I wish I could take that fights cancer but, it can lower your blood pressure.  Since my blood pressure is way low anyway, I can't take it.  Spring Time Qigong is a great meditative exercise that I practice that has been very helpful.   Good Luck to you, my friend.  Any questions, just 'holler'.    Phoenix23002    ps..  doctors know little if anything about alternative therapies.  It is not their fault.  They can barely keep up with information re: their own areas of practice.  I just didn't mention anything to my surgeons before surgeries.   Listen to your doctors but also listen to your body. :)",
