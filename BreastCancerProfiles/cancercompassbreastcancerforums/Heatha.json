After chemotherapy I was placed on Tamoxifen for five years. The bad side effect I had from the Tamoxifen was hot flashes, which I could live with as long as I was taking effexor along with it. In December 2008 my oncologist decided to put me on Arimidex, that only lasted about three weeks, due to severe knee, foot and thigh pain. I was then started on Aromasin and that lasted about a month. I came home from work the other day with severe hand, feet and arm pain. I barely was able to drive home. I cried myself to sleep that night because the pain was so severe. I had tried alternating motrin and tylenol but that did not seem to help.I called the oncologist office the next day and all they suggested was stopping the medication for a week to see if the symptoms would go away and continue using motrin and tylenol for the pain. I had also placed a call to my primary care physician, who called late yesterday afternoon and called in a steroid to help with the inflammation and vicodin for pain if needed. I was real appreciative of his help. My oncologist's office wants me to call back in a week and if symptoms are better would like to start me on femara. I have discussed this with my husband and don't feel that it worth putting myself through these side effects again, Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Hi........ I was put on Femura - initially - and I had no side effects from it  what-so-ever. I was changed to Aromasin - because tumour marker rising. I have had no side affects from that - either. Recently I had been taking Shark Cartilage and am now taking Bovine Tracheal Cartilage - so whether that has been a help with the joint pain - who knows...... Best Wishes...... Heather .  ",

This is the 1st I have heard of having lymphodeama in the breast as opposed to extremities. And I am interested to know - where information can be found on this. I live in outback Australia - and we get a few minutes a month with a visiting specialist.  Usually un-helpful. I feel I have lymphoedeama in the breast. I certainly have it in an arm - but since I had cellulitis in the limb earlier this year - I feel there is lymphoedeama at the mastectomy site - too.  I have been taking Femura for over 12 months - and as far as I feel......I haven't had the effects that others are talking about on the site. Many Thanks Heather  ",

I am 58 now.  Had a hysterectomy in 1996 and decided to have both ovaries removed at the same time. So I basically went through menopause on the operating table.  Zometa infusion was affecting my kidneys so I now take - Bonefos twice daily. I also have a Herceptin infusion - 3 weekly. Heather  ",
