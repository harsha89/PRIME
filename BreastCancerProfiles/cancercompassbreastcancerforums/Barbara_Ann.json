    "Content": "Hi Everyone, My breast cancer has metastasised to my brain.  I have a very small lesion and my Radiology Oncologist has suggested Stereotactic radio-surgery using Tomotherapy.  I would be interested in being in touch with someone who has gone thru this treatment.  I'd like to know the effects on the brain etc.  I've done a lot of research, realize the treatment is relatively new and am having a time finding a patient who has used this type of treatment.  Let me hear from you.  Thanks and do take care. Barbara Ann",
