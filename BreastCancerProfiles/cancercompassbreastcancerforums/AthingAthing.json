      "Content": "In June I was diagnosed with uterine cancer and had a complete hysterectomy on 6/25/14. At the same time, my dr found a suspicious spot on my left breast at the 2 o'clock position. I had an ultra sound which prompted an ultra sound guided core needle biopsy which came back \"benign with neoplasm and recommending mri with contrast of breast.\" This was one week post-op from the hysterectomy and I was in no emotional condition to go for an mri with contrast. Typically, you inject anything in me I will have a reaction; the antibiotics they gave me pre-op gave me diarehha and horrendous dizziness. Anyhow, this Monday I had my first post-op check up with my dr and we discussed the breast situation. She agreed to forgo the mri for now and instead have another ultra sound on 9/25. I have to wait that long because the tissue is still riled up from the core needle biopsy. My question:  has anyone here had a core needle biopsy come back with similiar results? And, if so, with further investigation (new ultra sound or mri) what was the outcome? Cancer or no cancer? I'd also be interested in hearing others experiences with the breast mri with contrast; maybe  I am making a mountain out of a mole hill? I maybe should add that the culprit for the uterine cancer was likely HRT and this concerns me because I know HRT can be behind breast cancer as well. Bless you all and thanks in advance for any feedback. Valarie",

      "Content": "I had a core needle biopsy in June. My breast, where the neoplasm was located and where they left the titanium clip is so sore and getting more sore by the day. This is kind of freaking me out: is my body rejecting the clip? Or, is it breast cancer? I am scheduled for a follow up ultrasound in two weeks, they have to wait till the tissue from the core needle biopsy is completely healed, they wanted to do an mri but as I've posted here before I am balking at that. So, my question: has anyone here that has had a core needle biopsy experienced pain from the titanium clip they leave behind? Like months after the biopsy....   Valarie",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I posted here before and on the Uterine Cancer board about my journey with Uterine Cancer and then the subsequent travels through several ultra sounds, biopsies and mri's to finally find out that I do not have breast cancer.  Now, my partner has just this week been diagnosed with a cluster of micro calcifications with suspicion warranting referral to a surgeon.  My internet research shows that this is the 3rd option and that when they refer you to a surgeon that it is generally pre-cancer or early stage breast cancer of the DCIS variety.  Can anyone here share their experience with micro calcification clusters? I would appreciate any and all feedback you are willing to share.  Thank you all for being here. And strength to all who are still battling the hard battle. My prayers are with you.  Valarie ",

      "Content": "Hi everyone! One week after beging diagnosed with Endo Cancer my gyno also ordered an ultra sound core needle guided biopsy of my left breast. It came back benign but they are recommend that I have an mri with contrast to confirm. Now, I am 3 weeks post op robotic/vaginal rad hysterectomy to remove the Stage 1 A Endo cancer with clear nodes (thank god!) and I am extremely sensitive to all the crap they pump through your system for ops and mri's. The thought of having an MRI with contrast for what just seems a CYA move on the part of the medical community is repugnant to me and I'm refusing it. Has anyone here had the ultra sound core needle biopsy with benign results but opted to have a recommended confirming mri with contrast? Thanks for your feedback. Peace and healing blessings to us all.   Valarie    ",

      "Content": "My questionable breast now has a visible lump/mass and is extremely painful. The drs office has moved my new ultrasound up to this week but refuses to move my follow up appt from the end of the month. Does this mean that even if the ultrasound shows cancer that they will make me wait until 9/30 (from 9/11) to find out if I have cancer or not??? Does this sound right?   Valarie",
