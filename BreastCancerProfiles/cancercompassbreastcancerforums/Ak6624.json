      "Content": "Springflower, you have been awasome with your recommendations, I like all you are saying, I also use Flaxseed to geth the essential amino acids, I read that we have to make sure we grind it to powder and take a lot of water with it. So I got a coffee grinder and grind a little at a time. Also on the vitamins, I have read that the best form is the capsule or gels for best absorbtion, I also use Who Leaf Aloe very juice about a couple of oz per day to improve the absorbtion. BTW I bought the fucoidan, I am using it, thank you for the tip. I also use deep sea blue algea in powder form am mix it with juice. this also helps the immune system. Â  thank you again for sharing.",

      "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with Stage IV BC in late 2008, this will be my 4 th year working on beating it. The theory on my cancer is that it is a mix'ed genotype, it was first Er+,Pr+,her2-, after a series of chemo treatments it came back in three months as Er-,Pr-,her2+ only in my lymph nodes. After a number of different treatments mostly targeted treatment, the latest pathology shows Er-,Pr-,her2-. I have had 40+ cycles of chemo and raising to small kids. Six months ago I reduced my work days to two days a week, so that I ca rest more and spend more time with my girls. I am determined to beat or at least maintain this cancer. So to help to do that I want to start a more positive discussion on how to beat stage IV BC. This is my 4th year beating it.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for yr posts. I am sorry to hear that we are all going through such a hard journey, but at the same time we are all surviving. I have found it so endearing that we all want to help each other, while we are going through this. Please continue with the positive thoughts. I am still doing chemo and now I am loosing my hair for a second round. As I said I have had 40+ cycles of different chemo , study and standard. Bilateral breast removal and followed by multiple surgeries until very recently. In the last year, I have switched to all organic plant based diet, exception is wild fish once a week. I juice every day, dark leafy greens juice and apples, carrots, beets juice, I also take supplements and herbs, miatake mushrooms. I am now exploring the visualization and power of intention and lots of prayers thanking god for looking over my children and husband. The positive message is very important. I have seen doctors from east coast to west coast, and I admire the doctors that are always positive and believe we can put this in remission. The ones that don't believe this, disappoint me no matter how brilliant they are, but I still work with them to get the best recommendation. I am lucky that my primary oncologist is very supportive and positive.",

      "Content": "I am very very sorry to hear that. I wish you and your Mom the best and lots of strength. I was also diagnosed with stage 4 6 months after my mammogram, I was very mad too and still get mad about it. I was sick all the time for two years before I was diagnosed too and I found out myself that I had Lumps. I can tell you that don't allow anger to take your energy and focus away, stay on course to get the best care possible. Learn from the past and make sure that you and your mom double check all the treatment options. Get second opinions, get to know someone people who can help you.",
