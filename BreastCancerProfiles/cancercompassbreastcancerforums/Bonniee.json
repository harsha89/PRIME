      "Content": "Hi Debbie, I am so sorry about your breast cancer diagnosis. It blew me right out of the water too. I too, must face chemo and radiation. I had a node disection done on Tuesday for staging. The side effects of chemo are quite scary. But - not everyone gets side effects and many of them can be managed. Is there anything in particular that concerns you? If so, talk to your doctor and see if your doctor can link you up to other women who have been through it. If it wasn't manageable or effective treatment they would not be recommending it. Just think of the many many women out there who have beat it! We can too! Take good care of yourself, and let others do the same for you. Love and Blessings, Bonnie",

Tell your friends to send you funny cards! Laughing actually has been proven to increase chemicals that help your immune system. Naturallly you feel sad, but limit the time you think about it. Treatment is temporary, (as my husband reminds me). \"This is a temporary situation\" - Crap to get through. You can do it. The best thing about the future is that it happens one day at a time. Keep us posted out here, ok Debbie? Thinking about you, Love and Blessings, Bonnie",

Maybe Phenergan suppositiories - although they make you sleepy. Also pain medication. Sounds like you need it. I have not started the chemo yet. They just did my node disection on Tuesday and I don't know the results yet. They plan to use Adriamycin, (Doxorubicin) - I don't know if it is the same as yours, but it can cause enlargement of the heart, which they first get a baseline heart scan, and will monitor this during your therapy. Cytoxan will be given along with it, then Taxotere with steriods. 4 1/2 months they tell me. You sound as pertified as I am. I am trying not the think about it a lot. Are you sleeping? Get something so that you are sleeping. Do you have extended family and other support people? Call on them. Debbie, It is too overwhelming to think about it all at once. They may provide some diversion. I try to think that 1. The chemo will be given gradually 2. I will be monitored closely 3. I will have a headset with music and try visual imagey 4. I will deal with things one day at a time. 5. Not everyone gets all the side effects but medical-legally they must paint the picture. 6. Many many woman have gone through this and are survivers. I plan to ask my doctor about the statistics of how many women do get certain side effects. The actual numbers may be reassurring, I am hoping anyway. If anyone else out there has any other suggestions for us, please advise. Love and Blessings, Bonnie",

      "Content": "DEAR CAROLYN, I too, had a negative mammogram, (The research indicates that digital mammogram was more sensitive for dense breasts) so even though my health plan did not pay, I saw an out of plan physican each year and had a breast exam and digital mammogram. Then I would have my GYN exam and another breast exam at the six month interval. I have had multiple breast cysts and aspirations, as well as bipsies - negative for cancer. I thought I was covered. I was wrong. The last mammogram 10/09 showed nothing in in breasts, but an enlarged lymph node in the axilliary. Sonogram, even breast MRI showed - NOTHING! Axilliary node disection = 3 positive nodes. I am in chemo now. Plan on having a double mastectomy after - because how would anyone ever know if/when it relapses?? Then radiation. I already have lymphedema so I am very concerned with the radiation it will increase. Thank you for your story, you brave soul. Sharing gives us hope and more information to work with. I find many of the health care professionals very guarded in what they share with us. We are often the best ones - to share - we have been there!!

      "Content": "Bless you all with all your stories.  I don't know if I can contribute to any knowledge here, but I will share my story. And I have always done everything right, by the way.  Never smoked, rare glass of wine, exercised, weight, normal, although about a year before my diagnosis went up to high, but still within my normal BMI.  I took estrogen replacement therapy and estrogen vaginal creams until my diagnosis at age 57.  Since I had a total hysterectomy and removal of my ovaries at age 29 I was on estrogen for a very long time, but a low dose. I took my estrogen with my grapefruit every morning and now they are finding that grapefruit tends to increase the strength of medications, (some of them).  Anyway in 2008, after having my breast exams done every 6 months, I was diagnosed with stage 2b local metatastic (3nodes) nothing in the breast.  Had a node disection, chemo, radiation and 5 years of Arimadex, then changed to Femora, and finally finished my five years with Aromisn?sp. due to all the aches and pains.   (All do the same thing.)  Now I am taking Evista.  I took 6 doses of Zometa because the chemo and Aromisin thinned my bones.  My diet, (I fight the urge to eat sweets) I have not had milk or milk products for about five years, little meat, mainly organic, increased by fruits and veggies, and do eat whole wheat, not a lot.  I am still here, so I must be doing something right.  They did find something in my hip last year and had another CT scan as follow-up and although it lights up on bone scans, CT scan showed it was about the same, a year later.  They tryed to biopsy it but it was deep in the hip and after a lot of drilling they did not get enought tissue to make a diagnosis. They gave me choice, one being an open hip biopsy, which sounded unreal to me, repeat the biopsy, and it will probably be the same, or follow for change.  I decided to follow with scans.  No invasive stuff.  I think you can have genes that \"express\" in different situations and cancer starts to invade.  I was in an extremely high stress job for 20 years.  The kind that you are responsible for EVERYTHING that goes wrong, but you have absolutely no control or no voice.  I think the stress was the tipping point.  I probably ate too much processed foods. too.  I have one cousin, out of 144, who had breast cancer at age 39.  History is vague on this, but she is alive and happy today at age 75!  Two of my grandmother's sisters had breast cancer, (later in life - 60's and 70's) and passed from it, as far as I can tell!  Anyway, that is my story and my thoughts, for everyone to see and get whatever they can from it! ",

Around my family I have been trying to stay strong and not \"break down\". A friend came with me for my MUGA scan. They could not use my port, just stuck me over and over, (what looked like veins had no blood), and well, I just lost it. I cryed long and hard and my friend held my hand the entire time. I guess I needed it. I am so emotional. I get a \"get well\" card or flowers and the flood gates open. I still feel I need to \"hang tough\" for my family. My parents are in their 80's and Mom was just diagnosed with eye cancer. My younger brother and sister both have many problems themselves with finances, and health. I feel I don't want to put anymore on them, so I fake it. I have 2 Taxotere treatments one tomorrow and in 3 weeks and then I start the AC. Once I start the AC it sounds from you both that it really hits you hard. I have had 2 infusions with Cytoxin and Taxatere and other than ending up in the hospital with Neuropenic fever, I have not had terrible effects. It sounds like they may start with the AC. I know, everyone is different, but those two together seem to really take their toll. I have a wonderful husband, Thank the Lord. Prayer helps. I have not been hungry, but I eat because I know I must. I have lost 15 lbs. I don't have that much more to lose. My doctors said most people gain weight on chemo. I don't think so. Sorry for my rambling. God Love Us All, Blessings and Love, Bonnie",

Mainly it's on my neck, chest, back, abdomen and head. It's like acne is some places and hives in other places. It fades on and off. I am on Doxycycline and Benadryl. They do help, but I must keep taking them. I have not had nausea and I have had a good appetite and I am eating well, I am holding my weight 126-129. After my five day hospitalization for neuropenic fever and rash, (after the first chemo) I had a port put in. I have been giving myself Neutogen injections after my second chemo and that has keep my white cells up. She wants to give me the AC and I am so worried about the heart effects of the A.

Once a little nausea, but they will give you a variety, (or they should) of medications to use for things.  You will get through this - remember - as my husband kept reminding me - \"This is temporary\" and \"this too, shall pass.\" I started it on my 57th birthday!  Ya Whoo!!!  PS I am cancer free today.  I was stage 2 b with lymph node involvement and also had radiation. ",

She got in first try and the Cytoxin was first, that was fine, Taxotere burnt, so she had to slow it down. The infusion took 4.5 hours. I was given Compazine 10 mg before the treatment and went home with that and Zofran, which I am taking around the clock for 3 days. This is my last day of Decadraon. I have noted some generalized puffiness, and flushing, - face and chest, especially in the areas that previous breast biopsies and the axillary node disection was. Otherwise I am feeling fine and drinking lots of water. One down, five to go. I realize it probably will hit me in a day or so, hopefully not too bad. Thanks to all, Blessing for the New Year, and I plan to continue to post. Still unsure whether I will to to radiation, or double mastectomies after chemo. Still consulting. Maybe both. Bonnie",

Fuels cancer growth.  I have become a vegetarian, no dairy and started exersizing 30-40 minutes a day - to change the chemistry in my body. No, I am not sure it will be helpful, but there is surely enough prove out there that we are all eating crap, - not real wholesome foods.   So I figure it is worth a try.  It's my life.    So, again, I ask my question.   Has anyone had a cancer discovered that did not show up on mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI and WHOSE CANCER MARKERS: CA 27, 29 AND CA 125 WHERE ALL NEGATIVE?  Thank you all  Prayers,  Bonnie",

I am drinking lots of water and other fluids, no nausea, just fatigue and body aches, back pain, etc. I can deal with that. My pulse is so high and walking up my stairs makes it go even high and I get shortness of breathe. Saw the doctor yesterday, (just a primary care MD) to check my ears and they had found some blood in my urine, so I had that re-checked and it was ok and ears were fine. I worry from dawn until I finally fall asleep. It's funny that I don't worry so much about the cancer coming back as I do getting through chemo. Is that strange, or what?",

Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! I have a breast clinical exam by my GYN and I private pay for another one every six mos because my HMO does not offer digital mammograms I have very dense fibrocytic breasts. I thought I would be safer with a digital mammogram, because they are computerized, they are more sensitive with dense breast tissue. In October, the breasts looked ok, but they found a enlarged node in my axillary. Ultrasound was negative and so was the breast MRI. I had an axilliary node disection with 3 positive nodes consistant with infiltrating ductal breast cancer - no breast tumor found. I am in chemo now and an trying to decide on mastectomies - bilateral before radiation. I would have someone biopsy that lump! My thoughts and prayers are with you. Bonnie",

They had problems with vein access, as I needed frequent blood tests and they only could use my right arm, (due to node dessection on my left), so they were using my feet also. It was terribly painful to have them attempting to find veins, so Wednesday, when the fever went down I was given a port-a-cath. Acne rash has cleared. They will not allow any vitamins or other supplements while on chemo. I am home now, very weakened. My next Chemo is next Friday.",

I am still in chemo until June and I am using \"Replens\" a non-estrogen vaginal cream, but my chemo is giving me so much skin sensitivity that just the leaking out has given me a rash, so I have had to stop that also. You could have your doctor run a blood estrogen level to see if even a small amount of estrogent cream is making a difference. Unlikely. Have they told you about \"estring\"? It is a ring that you insert into the vagina and gives very low dose estrogen. It stays in place for 3 months. You should not be able to feel it, nor should he. Goggle it! Also you may try GENTLE vibration to increase the blood supply to that area. Good Luck, Blessings, Bonnie",

I was going to go to a registered dietian who specialty is breast cancer - all after my chemo. They told me I could take NOTHING while in chemo - just \"eat a balanced diet\". I try and load up on foods that are high in iron, but I keep getting more and more anemic. I am afraid I will end up needing blood transfusions before too long. Bonnie",

I have had chemo, Jan through May, 28 radiation treatments and except for some nerve damage and lack of range of motion and pain in my arm, axillia, and chest and back, I am really doing well.  I am so glad to be here.  The gift of life is awesome.  No detectable cancer with mammo and sono, but I am fighting my insurance for a breast MRI because my breasts are so dense that a mammogram is just like looking for a snowflake in a blizzard.  I need that breast MRI for comfort.  Initial PET and CT scans were negative.  Thank you for all your support on this web site.

I did 5 months of chemo and now I am starting radiation. They said no further surgery is needed because there is not a detectable cancer. Strange huh? Life is strange. I started Arimadex a month ago and have had some hot flashes, not bad. Otherwise I am doing fine on it. I have learned to just take the #### drugs and not read too much into the side effects. I tend to freak out! Chemo REALLY freaked me out! Good luck to you. I love this site too! Blessings to you, Bonnie",

They want to do chemo only, no radiation or mastectomy. They say it is systemic and not in the breast anymore, or maybe never was. Has anyone faced this type of cancer before? I am told because it is so rare, no good studies exist. I am scheduled for more opinions, but want to know if anyone here has had this experinence. Would appreciate any help.

We have all heard stories of people going on long after the doctors predicted. Everyone is an individual with different body chemistry and the body is an amazing thing! I worked with a woman who was given a very short time and she lived years after their prediction. You never know. We all never know. Enjoy each minute of every day with her. I will pray for her and you. Gods Blessings, Bonnie",
