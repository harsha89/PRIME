I am now on Arimidex for follow up treatment. My question to my doctor is...shouldn't I have a CT Scan to be certain the cancer is truly gone? Since it did spread to my lymph nodes, I cannot help but feel the need to know that it no longer exists in my body. Someone, other than my oncologist, told me I should have a CT scan just to be certain the cancer is gone. I feel the need for closure here, so I too would like a CT scan. However, my oncologist does not feel it is necessary. Has anyone else experienced this situation or have any advice for me in pursuing this matter further? Thanks... Mary Pat Hi Mary Pat I think once we have had cancer we will always want to know that our body is clear of it. If you have a scan now...you could in the future start to worry again & feel the need for another scan. Some can just be glad they have been treated & that its all over...thats just the way some people are...then there are those like myslef who is laways worrying it is back...thats the way I am & it probab;y wont change. I do hope you can trust that the bet treatment has been done for you and to be glad its over ...you deserve to be happy now, not have more tests etc.   Just my opinion...hope it doesnt offend anyone in any way... as is meant as good advice.
