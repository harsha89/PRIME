      "Content": "Hi,  I had stage 1A ER positive, DCIS, 3mm (I got confused at first & thought they were saying centimeters).  It was very tiny.  I had 2 surgeries (they didn't get clear margins the first time).  Then 7 weeks of whole breast radiation with a seven day boost to the cancer site. Really go over the details and ask them about all of the side effects.  A couple of months after the treatment my breast was very hard - cement hard and dark red and still hot to the touch.  They couldn't figure out what was going on so they sent me to have the fluid around the scar site removed (it had built up quite a bit).  They were thinking it had become infected from the surgery.  This provided some releif but a couple of weeks later it was back in the same shape so they sent me back to draw more fluid.  This went on two more times and they were dumbfounded so they sent me to a Surgeon. The Surgeon was great.  He said he doesn't know why they're saying they've never seen this reaction, together they've treated other patients with my reaction. Although it's rare it's not all that uncommon.  My breast will always be dark red, shrunken and rock hard.  It will take 3-5 years to settle down but will never be normal.  Oh and stop taking out the fluid - it's called a seroma and it's the surgeon's friend (wound healing itself).  The Surgeon said in about 5 years I can go to a Plastic Surgeon and have a reduction and lift on the normal breast so under clothing they'll look a little more even... Not too sure I want any further surgery but vacillate on that....  Sounds like yours is also small which is good.  The surgery isn't too bad and if you do have to have radiation the actual visits aren't too bad - just the outcome for me was terrible.  I feel really bad...my intention was not to scare anyone.  You will get through this... During recovery I read an article about a news reporter that was diagnosed with stag 3 DCIS and she decided to treat it as a investigative research project.  She got 4 opinions on treatment before she decided. All were very different... I wish I had done that (not 4 but maybe at least 3).  Yes, I would have had a mastectomy if I had to do it all over again and perhaps I still will.  After much research I read many woman with poor cosmetic results or bad reactions end up having a mastcetomy in the end to correct the problem. So...  Hope this helps.  I don't know you but I wish I could hug you and tell you it will be okay and you'll get through this - you are not alone.  Remember to research everything before making a decision...  ",

      "Content": "Hi,  So sorry you are going through this. I too had micro calcifications and stage 1A DCIS, T1, NO MO was diagnosed.  What really helped me was when I finally realized treatment was a process.  So you go from one step to the next.  I had 2 surgeries (they didn't get clear margins the 1st. time.)  then off to the Radiologist.  After radiation then on to tamoxifen.  Surgery wasn't too bad, radiation wasn't too bad - just annoying to go 5 days a week for 7 weeks... Had a really bad reaction to radiation so make sure you really get in there & ask them about all of the possible side effects before deciding on treatment.  Sounds like they caught yours early so that's good.  It is a lot to take in but know you are not alone and you will survive this.  Attitude is everything during tereatment so chin up and remember - one step at a time.  This will alter your life in many ways.  I'm focusing on the good changes in my life like knowing what matters most and I had my faith to fall back on. Let me know how it goes...  Here to answer anythign I can if it helps.......\"Live stong girl!\" ",

      "Content": "Hi,  I too had DCIS abd the Doctors told me in five years radiation will probably not be recommended for my type and stage of cancer however it is the prescribed treatment.  Oh & don't worry, you'll have excellent cosmetic results and most likely you'll never be able to tell you had radiation.  that was over two years ago.  I now have a cement hard breast that's about five times smaller than the normal left breast.  It's very stiff, red and well...angry!  Doctor's aren't saying much - just that this almost never happens.  I hope with all my heart that you don't have to have the radiation.  Honestly, if I'd have know I would look in the mirror after and see this horribly disfigured reminder of cancer, I would have said no and opted for a mastectomy instead followed by reconstructive.  I'd be somewhat normal now.  As it is, it's a constant reminder of cancer.  Please check all details before agreeing to radiation.  BTW I have a thyroid disease which may have caused this reaction - check everything out before making a decision.   God bless you and help you though this...  ",

      "Content": "I'm so glad I found your message.  Thank you for writing it!  I too have experienced a very bad reaction to radiation.  My DCIS was caught very early and no one told me this could happen.  My Radiologist said I wouldn't even notice I had radiation treatment.  I am now a freak and wish I had been told all of the details before choosing a treatment.   My right breast is rock hard and much smaller than the left.  I have trouble with arm movement.  Every time I look in the mirror I see this horrible disfiguration - A constant reminder of cancer.  I finally put together an insert I can wear in the bra which at least looks a little better under clothes.  It's nto about vanity - it's hard to explain.   I'm really worried as it seems to be getting worse - harder and more stiff.  Glad to know I'm not alone.  I'm sometimes really angry I wasn't given all of the details of possible treatment.  I would have chosen a mastectomy and would at least be pain free and somewhat normal today.  Anyway, thanks for sharing...Bless you...   Mastectomy",
