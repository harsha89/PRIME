      "Content": "I am so sorry that you & your mom have to deal with this yet again. I know it is hard to make a decision for someone else especially when it is concerning their life. I too am dealing with BC with my sis that is mentally retarded so all decisions come to me to make. She is 52 yrs old and it has come back into her lungs now. The doc discussed everything with me and he said my sis has maybe 5 yrs. he suggested arimedex pills to help shrink the tumors. (which it did) He wants her to have quality of life. I am not in your shoes but I will tell you I took care of my grandmother for 27 yrs and when she got very ill at age 92 the doctors and I decided to keep her as comfortable as possible and let God do his work. I am not saying your mom will die but surgery is a very big deal in elderly. you have anesthesia and hearts not as strong as they used to be. Recovery is much slower. You sort of have to look at her and ask yourself would she be better with surgery or without it. I know it is a VERY hard decision but at 92 your mom, by her original decision, seems to opt for quality. maybe the doctor can put her arimedex to help shrink it without putting her through so much trama. God Bless. Joanne I hope I haven't offended you in ANY way. If I did I apologize for it.",

      "Content": "Hi & thank you for responding. Yes my sister is still on arimdex. I did ask some questions and was told if she is lucky she might get 5 years from now. I was glad to hear that because I thought months. You never know what new med comes along every day is hopeful. Her tumors have begun to shrink so that is a good sign. I am sorry you are dealing with cancer also. Is your mom doing ok? Joanne",

      "Content": "Hi, sorry to hear about the agressive nature of your mom's cancer but the good news is there is no sight of it on CT scan. My prayers are with her and you. My sis knows she has cancer. It was found after much arguing for her to get a regular physical. She would never go and everytime an apt. was made the screaming and yelling would force us to cancel. Unfortunatly the cancer was there & we never knew. When we finally got her to go, the doctor showed me the breast. It was totally consumed with tumor and shifted her nipple to her armpit.I have never seen anything so unbelievable in my life. Of course I feel VERY guilty for not enforcing the apts. more aggressivly but she seemed fine. When we asked her about the breast she said it was a little pimple and would go away. She had no idea how bad it was. She never told anyone about it because she felt it was \"just a pimple\". The doc said she had to have it at least 3 yrs. She came through surgery with no pain meds, she was washing windows in 2 weeks and changing curtains. She amazed the surgeon and everyone else because she didn't have pain or even discomfort. The doc said usually people with mental disabilities have a high threshold for pain. Also that she didn't know she was supposed to have limitations. What ever it was she did fine and I am thankful. She was ok with the original diagnosis but I notice a sombering feel about her now with this new recurrence. I think she knows it is serious but she doesn't know how much. She believes she will take arimidex for 5 years and be done and on her merry little way. OH GOD I HOPE SO!!!! Her IQ is 63 so she can do a lot as a \"normal\" person would but her judgement is off and her trust is high. You can tell her anything and she will believe it. I guess I went into too much depth and probably didn't answer your original question. Joanne",

      "Content": "My sis had stage111B, 11/2001.5cm tumor along with some nodes infected. She had a mastectomy, chemo and radiation. We have just found out she it has shown up in her lung. She is mentally retarded so all decisions have to be made by me. She is 52yrs old. The doc said no to more chemo or radiation. Wants to start her on another pill other than Tamoxifen. The CT scan detected nodules have grown in the last month. A biopsy is being done next week. He feels it is the cancer because of the CT scan and her blood levels are elevated. What questions do I ask????? You know the one I DO want to know. What is her life expectancy from here? Do I ask it, will he know???? I am her caretaker as well as my mom...80yrs old, and brother that is mentally slow. What do I do??? I am so scared and want to do the right thing. Thanks.",
