      "Content": "Hello, Much like you, I had a similar pathology report. My mastectomy was in 2003. On my original path report, and all subsequent reports, my cancer was defined as 'metaplastic' or 'carcinoma with squamous differentiation'. Women do survive metaplastic cancer, but it is much more challenging to treat, and somewhat rare. You may want to find out if your pathology report includes this type of distinction. Any poorly differentiated cancer is more challenging. I received both AC and Taxol after my mastectomy, but since only one lymph node was involved, they recommended against radiation. In retrospect, I would have insisted. Potentially, receptor negative cancer can travel through blood as opposed to the lymphatic system. Radiation seems to have a positive effect on reducing metastasis. I wish you the best in your journey.",

According to the pathology report the cancer is HER2+ estrogen/progestron negative.  Six weeks ago, I caught a cold, which I haven't been able to shake.  It starts to go away then comes back on at least three occasions.  what is worrying me, is that a few months ago, the oncologist asked if I had a cough. At that time I didn't but now I do.  I am worried that it may be more than just a persistent cold.  I am going through staging now,  I had a CT scan, and will meet with the oncologist this upcoming Monday to discuss the results, and the next steps.  My question is has anyone dealt with a persistent cough/cold?  Any words of advice.  Hoping to hear from someone out there.  Thanks.     My husband was diagnosed Sept 06 with stage 4 met to lungs and bones, male breast cancer, the cough sent him to the Dr.  He had fluid on his lungs and heart, once this was removed he felt much better and has responded well to treatment.  The cough has finally subsided.  When the fluid comes back he describes it like a cold he can't get out of his system. Your Dr. may be checking for  fluid on your lungs.  The removeal can take place in the hospital (we have it done in the radiology department) and you can go home the same day if the levels are controlable. To my knowledge this is fairly common.  This year we have had no fluid removeal, levels have stayed within limits.  My husband amazes me.  Hi, I would be interested to know if the pathology reports indicated metaplastic, or squamous differentiation. Those two terms describe a different kind of breast cancer. My first bout was in 2003. I was ok until 4 years later. Almost exactly to the day, I was diagnosed with cancer in the lung. Metaplastic almost always goes to the lung first. I did have a nagging cough before my diagnosis. I had most of my left lung removed in August of '07. The cancer was found in my bones in December, and what is left of my left lung in April. I went on Xeloda and Avastin in April, and had amazing results in June. The nodule in my lung was completely off the scan, and the uptake in my bones was diminished. Unfortunately, my scan in August was not as good, even though I continued my chemo regiman. The cancer was small in my lung, but growing more rapidly in my bones. About three weeks ago, the scan showed that the cancer is now systemic. Ribs, hips, femur, spleen, liver, lung......I have so few choices, and it's maddening, but out of my control. I don't mean to frighten anyone. I just know that finding the metastatic cancer earlier is better than later. I hope this is beneficial to someone.  ",

      "Content": "Time for an update.....I traveled extensively last year. Went to Europe a couple of times, and spent 5 weeks in Italy. When I returned from Italy, I was in quite a bit of pain. It turned out that the cancer was really active in my sacrum and bones in my hips. I underwent new chemo and radiation from which I became very ill. I haven't been well since September. In February, I decided to go off all chemo and try herbs. In one month, the PET showed metasteses in both lung and liver. I went back to chemo. I had lost some control over my right foot and had falled a couple of times. I went to the doc, but wasn't able to walk right. She put me in the hospital, and did a spine and brain MRI. They found brain mets, and a compression fracture in my spine. I underwent whole brain radiation. I'm so tired, I lost my hearing, and have been throwing up nearly every day. But my walking is better. I am going to the doc today, so will find out more. I am not discouraged, just tired.",
