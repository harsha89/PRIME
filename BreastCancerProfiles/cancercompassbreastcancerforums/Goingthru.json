      "Content": "Hi. I have been reading posts for a few days now and decided to join To ask others if they have had any of the side effects that I am. It has been 2 years since I had a mesectomy,chemo,radiation about a year and a half since I started arimedex. I have pain hair thinning trouble finding words but the worst is the horrible saddness and crying episodes. It could be over anything or nothing just comes out of no where. Also have pain around my butt bone not the bone it's self nor like nerves. It comes and I'm sure the cancer is back and then it's gone, but the saddness and fear is daily. Have any of you ladies experienced anything like this?? I hope I'm not losing my mind and just goingthru yet another phase of having breast cancer.",

      "Content": "Hello amber596, I too have gone through much of what you have described in your post. I had a lumpectomy that can back without clear margins then a mesectomy within a week of each other. It's been a rough road and I am sorry that any of us have had to travel down it i did not have reconstruction at the same time as my surgery either. Everything happened so fast and then all the chemo and radiation. I have since seen a plastic surgeon who will be doing the reconstruction in a few months. I am scared to have this done but scared not to. Mostly want it done b/c of reasons you stated nothing feels or looks right i guess because there is something missing right?? One thing is right we are alive!!! You mentioned in your post the your surgeon will not perform the reconstruction survey for you. May I asked why??",
