      "Content": "Thanks for responding.  I began to experience increased arthritic pain in my feet, hands, and neck while on the Tamoxifin for 3 years.  In November 06, we changed to Aromasin and I did all right for 8 - 9 months without too much increased pain.  However, November 06, I began to experience extreme pain, unable to walk first thing in the a.m., swelling of hands, 2 - 3 severe bouts of bursitis....chronic pain.  They told me to stop it for a few weeks...the pain decreased, but I began to experience depression and inability to copy with life experiences; bouts of crying; more needy and vulnerable.  I went back on the Aromasin and everything just got worse.  I'm off Aromasin again now for 2 weeks and am gradually feeling better emotionally and mentally, with arthritis pain continuing.  I'm schedule to see dr. next week and am thinking seriously about no more Aromasin, work on controlling arthritis and my quality of life.  I had stage 1 b.c. in 2002, treated with lumpectomy, removal of 10 clean lymph nodes, and radiation followed by Tamoxifin for 3 yrs; then Aromasin.",
