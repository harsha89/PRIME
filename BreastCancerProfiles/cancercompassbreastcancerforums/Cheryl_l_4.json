    "Content": "I've taken tamoxifin for two years, post mastectomy and post chemo. I have actually lost weight, just melted off. Before cancer and tamoxifin, I had to count every bite. Now, my weight is at 120 and hasn't gone up in the two years with no dieting. (I do exercise a lot, chasing my toddler around.) If you're nervous about tamoxifin, ask your onc. about arimidex. It's a new drug, studies show it is more effective at keeping cancer from recurring for women who are post-menopausal. Also: mo blood clots, no endometrial cancer with Arimidex. I'm switching to it this week. Whatever you take, I wouldn't be afraid of the hormone therapies; they are much less toxic than chemo. There's risk in everything, but it's very likely that your worst problem will be hot flashes and they get better with time. God bless and good luck. -C",
