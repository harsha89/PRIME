      "Content": "Michelle, go down the list until you see a message from \"Third Time\" and read my answer to her.I just got of Taxol,and for me it did weird things, but everybody reacts different.I didn,t feel very well on Taxol,numbness in the fingers and toes,and as for tiredness, that's normal for anyone on Chemo,and it's an overwhelming tiredness.Tell your mother to hang in there and keep positive and that goes for you too.I talk about it more in my answer to \"Third Time\".",

      "Content": "Hi Third Time,In 1997,I was diagnosed with BC,had a mastectomy,Had eleven lymph nodes removed, 4 had cancer,I chose not to have Chemo,went on Tamoxifin for 5 years,(My oncologist agreed with my decision),Then ,two years after going of the Tamoxfin,(2004), I discovered the cancer had spread to the bone and lungs.They put me on Fermara,(Which caused me to have a lot of Arthritic sympthoms) and also bone medication.(Pills). The spots in the lungs cleared up for a while but came back after almost a year,then the bone pills stopped working and a tumor at the bottom of the spine acted up and I ended up having radiation there,and they put me on a bone medication,through intravenous, and so far that seems to be working.I get it once a month.I have no pain, I was told by the oncologist,one can live for years with it in the bone.I ended up having 6 treatments of Chemo for the lungs,it cleared up for almost a year, but the spots came back,so aboutÂ  2 months ago I finished another 8 treatments of chemo,There are still some smal spots left but according to my last 2 ct scans, I've stabalized,so I have another ct scan coming up Aug 1st,I hope things are still stable,I can live with that.So I say to you , chin up,there are a lot of treatments out there,so if one doesn,t work, they'll try another. I think it's amazing that you went so many years without a recurrence.I'm 69 years old,and I have a feeling you are also middle aged,I,m feeling pretty good, I planted my flower garden, and I can go about my daily activities without too much trouble.I just wish I had some hair(Ha) but that will come.So Good luck to you, I'm sure you'll be O.K.",
