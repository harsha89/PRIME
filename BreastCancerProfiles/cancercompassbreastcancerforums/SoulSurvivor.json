      "Content": "HI Serg,   I am 41 going on 42. I did contact my GYN and I will see him on the 11th of Aug.  Yes, his concern is to do full testing. Blood, Ultra Sound etc. I thought also about the pre-menopause.  It's just a deep concern after going through the CHEMO & Radiation it just don't want any bad news.  The blessing behind my CA was my hormones were RH negative therefore I did not need to take any additional medication. 21 lymph nodes removed but other than that nothing else. Yes the aches and pains, fatigue at time but not other issues to complain about. \"Blessed\" but now this. No I am not having any more children 1 only but, did not want to get a Hysterectomy but if needed I will and I will also suggest LYPO & Tummy Tuck.  Do you watch Army Wives. My husband is a SSG in the Army 20 years. Thanks Renee aka SoulSurvivor ",
