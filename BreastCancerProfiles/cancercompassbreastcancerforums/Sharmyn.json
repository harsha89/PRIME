    "Content": "Hi Niki I was diagnosed with breast cancer 7 years ago, had mastectomy, chemo and radiation. Was on Tamoxifen for five years with hardly any side effects. I was diagnosed with breast cancer again in March last year and had another mastectomy. Unfortunately the cancer has apparently spread to my lung, liver and bones. Had more chemo and liver was clear. I have been on Aromasin and Femara for about 6 months and have just stopped it as I cannot stand the joint, hands and foot pain. I am an athlete and have done two Ironman triathlon events and now I cannot even run. Still cycling and swimming. Has anyone experienced coughing as a side effect? I'm worried that the lung lesion has grown and going for CT scan tomorrow. Also going for a second opinion next week. I live in South Africa and thought there was perhaps some new medication in the States that we're not aware of, but seems not. My oncologist is putting me back on Tamoxifen but says it is not as effective as the Aromasin. I would rather have a shorter, quality life than live like this on this stuff. Â ",
