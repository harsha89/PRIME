I just finished chemotherapy and am starting radiation.  About a week ago I started having pain under my arm, on my side, and in my breast (which feels swollen, like just before one's period--but I'm post menopause)--it started soon after the simulation for the radiation, so I assumed it was due to the long period of time I had to lie with my arm in an uncomfortable position, but it isn't going away.   I called my surgeon who agreed that was probably the issue, as it wouldn't be post-surgical pain at this point.... but as I say, it's been over a week since the simulation... and it's not getting any better...  I don't know who to ask about this--the medical oncologist, the radiation oncologist or??? Or, am I just being dumb and it will go away on its own?  Any ideas?   Thanks so much. I had a lumpectomy about three month ago, ann i still have pain in my breast ahd under my arm which both oncossaid would happen and it would contiune even after radiation.I devolped swelling i my arm from the top of arm to my finger,and now i go to have treatment for lymphedema,so ask as many ouestions as you need to help you understand  ..good  luck,god bless.                                                                                  ...........................................................................................................goo d                                                          good                                                                .                                                                       ",

I haven't needed to continue the massages or wraps since then.  This therapy took about four months before the lymphadema went away.  I have other pain and fatigue from my cancer, and have found oxycontin to be the best help for that.  Good luck to you.   You made my day its good to hear that the pain and swelling end.I started with thel lymphadema whilegoing through radiation, it went away as long as iwent to clinic for thewraps and massages but now its back so its good to know it willgo away carrie               ",
