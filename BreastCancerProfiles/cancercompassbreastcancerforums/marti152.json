    "Content": "I am so sorry to hear about your friend passing. There is the possibility that she did not know she was going to die and did die from something else not related to the breast cancer issue, such as a heart attack or stroke. It is possible. A few years ago, a coworker who had fought valiantyly against his cancer, died during the night. They were not going to do an autopsy because they assumed it was the cancer but the spouse insisted and the primary cause of death was heart attack and the secondary was cancer. So, it can happen. Please take care of yourself.",
