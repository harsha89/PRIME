Does anybody know of any adverse effects  involved? I also have rheumatoid arthritis and have developed breast cancer.  I also take methotrexate.  My RA is actually in remission right now, but the rheumatologist didn't want to take me off of methotrexate at this time.  I also will need to take radiation therapy after the lumpectomy and removal of the fat pad with the lymph nodes.  I am not sure at this point if I will need chemotherapy.  Ductal carcinoma was also found in the lymph nodes, so they will remove all from under the armpit.  My RA seemed to suddenly go into remission about 8 months ago.  I wonder if the fact that my immune system may have been trying to fight the cancer, caused the remission.",
