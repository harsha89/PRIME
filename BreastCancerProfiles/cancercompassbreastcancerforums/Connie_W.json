    "Content": "Hello and thank you in advance, I have just began to have menstrual cycles following my chemo, surgery, radiation etc. I am ER/PR (-) and Her2neu +++, dx'ed with inflammatory breast cancer. Although I am hormonal negative I am wondering if any survivors have themselves put back into a menopausal state? What advice have your hem/onc's given you? I cannot find any literature pertaining to this. Once again, thanks for your replies. Connie",
