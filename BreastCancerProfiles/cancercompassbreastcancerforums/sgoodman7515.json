      "Content": "PRMA is probably the place to go for DIEP, but I don't have much respect for the pratice. I turned to a surgeon at PRMA after my DIEP reconstruction done by another surgeon failed. I still think DIEP is the way to go, but I was treated like someone else's problem at PRMA. After a flop of a revision, my surgeon at PRMA told me my insurance wouldn't cover anything else and I'd need to pay his higher cosmetic rates if I still wanted a good outcome. Fortunately,  the part about my insurance was a lie, and I found another surgeon to finish my case.",
