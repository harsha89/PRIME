      "Content": "They called me from the Breast Institute shortly after my post.  I went yesterday for ultrasound guided biopsy.  Started with ultrasound where she found two areas that looked like cysts so she did an aspiration instead of a biopsy.  Went to mammo right after and the areas were nearly gone after the aspiration.  She was unable to see the concerning area from the mammo by ultrasound so I go back next week for stereotactic biopsy.  Ready to be done with this.  Hoping for good news by next Friday.",

      "Content": "Hello...  New here. I am 39 years old and the mother of three children.  My cousin was diagnosed with BC two years ago ag the age of 41.  A friend I went to school with was diagnosed last year so I thought I should start my yearly mammos.  Was not expecting anything at all.  Had the first one done on 1/16/15 requesting additional studies.  Went in for another mammogram and an ultrasound.  The mammo cam back with a BIRADS 0 requesting additional imaging.  The ultrasound had a BIRADS 4 -suspicious abnormality.  Biopsy should be considered.  The findings were:  There are two vague areas of altered echotexture that are near each other.  The smaller of teh two is round and well defined and measures only 2 to 3 mm in size.  This is hypoechoic.  Along teh same axis, there is a peripherally lobulated nodule that measures approximately 7.5 x 3.5 x 5.5 cm.  This is taller than its length and width, and thereis posterior acoustical shadowing.  I see no posterior acoustical enhancement or through transmission.  This does not appear to be a cyst.  Impression:  There is a lobulated nodule at the 4 o'clock axis of the right breast in teh region of mammographic concern.  Although this has a mean diameter of only 5.5 cm, it is taller that its length and width, and it exhibits posterior acoustical shadowing.  Although I feel that this is more likely benign, I do believe that a biopsy would be prudent.  This may be accessible sonographically.  I cannot feel it and the surgeon I was referred to could feel it either.  UGH>>> This appointment was a waste of time because she doesn't even do the biopsy.  Have been waiting to hear back on the appointment and still nothing.  Would like to have this over with.  Wasn't really worried but not I kind of am.  I know he said more than likley benign but to me that leaves the door open.  Anybody have any advice or information that might be of comfort?  This seems to be taking way too long.  I just want it done and over with.",
