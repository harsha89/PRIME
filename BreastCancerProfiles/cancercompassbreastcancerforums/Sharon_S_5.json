    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. In addition to chemotherapy, follwed by a lumpectomy and radiation, I was put on Tamoxifen. At my last physical, my doctor told me that my pap test results were \"questionable\". I asked what that meant and was told that there are some atypical cells and that I should have another pap test in 3 months. I was also told that Tamoxifen has nothing to do with this but I'm not so sure. Since I got breast cancer after 5 years of being on HRT, I am naturally a little suspicious of all drugs. I was also told that HRT had nothing to do with my estrogen dependent breast cancer and it has since been proven that it DOES have an effect. Any comments from anyone experiencing qustionable pap test results while on Tamoxifen would be very much appreciated. This will be a long 3 months of waiting.",
