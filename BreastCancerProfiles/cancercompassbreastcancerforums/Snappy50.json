    "Content": "A good friend of mine is being treated for stage 2+ Breast cancer. She had one lymph node with cancer cells in it. To be safe, they took both breasts. She had inplants put in at that time. Now Drs tell her the radiation she will get after chemo is finished may shrink the implants and also the skin in area. They didnt tell her this when she had surgery.She is upset as she may have to start all over again with the implants and possible skin expanders. Should she get a 2nd opinion? Is radiation really the answer after months of chemo and removal of cancer tissue as well? Opinions out there if anyone has had similar situation?",
