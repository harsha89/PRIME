      "Content": " Hi, I know this is about 15 days late, but I don't get to read the message board often. Hope you are doing better. Don't really know if I can help with being scared, but I had stage 3 Breast Cancer in May of 2006. Surgeon performed a radical single mastectomy. I had chemotherapy, but refused radiation. I am very glad of that decision on radiation, because the left tip of the lung would have been damaged which can lead to other complications later. That was just my personal decision & by no means should be yours. I am only telling you my experience & personal decisions. October 2006 I saw a Naturepathic Dr. in Charlotte, NC and have been doing great ever since. I changed my diet, NO SUGAR - Sweets, pasta, white bread of any kind. Drink 8 oz of a Green Drink which consists of juiced green vegetables. If you want the recipe I can give it to you. I take supplements specifically for Cancer remission. My Oncologists semi agrees with me, but they don't have time to read the studies on all of this Chemo and radiation and the side effects, which in my opinion kill your body. I feel better than ever before. You may eat sugar once in awhile, but in moderation. Moderation is the key. I no longer have the headaches, which were daily. Every moment counts, the Lord has given me a second chance at life. Taking care of your body is very important with Cancer. This is the best thing that has happened to me. I have been blessed by this disease and am living better than ever. If you need to talk, feel free to contact me. I have checked the box to receive an email when someone responds to this message. Take care and I will be praying for you. Beverly    On 12/15/2007 lookingforward wrote: Hi everyone! I had a single mastectomy about two weeks ago.

      "Content": "Hi Grac234,   I would suggest you find a \"good honest\" ND, (Naturepath Doctor), one that has a college degree in Naturepathic Medicine. There are a lot of imposters out there who don't know what their doing just to make money off of your illness. I see one in Charlotte, NC. He has my own regimen of diet & supplements. You could call him & ask about a referral in your location. His name is Dr. William Pearce, 704-225-3382 or consult CTCA for one. Combined medicine is becoming popular. I have been under the care of an ND for about a year for my stage 3 Breast Cancer and am doing absolutely wonderful. I also do follow up tests & examines with my oncologist. I have to avoid sugar, which keeps cancer cells growing. This includes pasta, breads...etc.  My supplements for Cancer keep it in remission. This doctor has a track record of patients being 10-20 years out, whereas traditional meds alone are 2-4 yrs. out. I figured what have I got to lose!! It wasn't easy making this decision, but am glad I did. I have lots info. on my illness & how far I have come in a year, but there's not room for all of it. I am a miracle, took chemo, 8 treatments,  but refused radiation. Have not regretted the decision either. Feel free to contact me. Hope everything turns out well for you.  Take care of yourself, would love to hear from you Beverly, (Tumor)   ",

Doctor wants to do a lumpectomy and then 5-6 weeks of radiation.  No lymph nodes will be removed and no chemo. will be given.   Since a digital mammogram done in December 2007 showed nothing an MRI was done on both breasts this past Thursday.  I am awaiting the results that may show something in both breasts.  The doctor has said that I can delay treatment because this is a slow growing cancer. I beleive that cancer is a fungus.  I am familiar with Doug Kaufman.  I plan to follw the Phase One for a least 30 days to help kill off as much fungus as possible but I am not sure that it is a good idea to not have the lumpectomy and radiation. Does anyone know if I consult or get a second opinion with the Cancer Treatment Center will I be obligated to receive treatment from them?  The closest location is Oklahoma but that is 1300 miles round trip. Is there a directory available for doctors that beleive that cancer is a fungus and will prescribe anti-fungal drugs? Does anyone know if Dr. David Holland still sees patients? Thanks for your help.     I have never heard of cancer being a fungal disease. But, I can tell you I had BC in the spring of 2006 and my last mammogram was done in 2004 and nothing showed up. I found my tumor on my own and it was in the ductal glands in the breast that never gave me any problems. My Cancer was, (stage 3) with (3 lymph nodes), affected. Had a single mastectomy.  So, you never know about this cancer. I have heard MRI is a good way to be tested. I had also gotten a CT of my liver in 2005 and no trace of cancer showed on those results. I took chemo. Refused radiation. Have seen too many people suffer permanent damage from radiation. The Radiologist told me I would have lung damage, but only the tip. Have also been told it would damage my heart and that can lead to congestive heart failure. I didn't take the chance and don't regret my decision. I won't let any Doctor burn up my organs. I have changed my diet and take cancer supplements and am doing great!!! I will be interested in how things turn out for you. Only you can decide what is best for your treatment.  Take Care, Beverly   ",

I am sorry to hear about your friend and hope she recovers.  In 2006 I had breast cancer. I refused radiation because of the permanent damage it would cause. To this day I don't regret my decision. I have turned to alternative medicine. Cancer Treatment Centers of America work with a licensed Naturopath in their treatment of cancer.  I see a Naturopath in Charlotte, NC and have been in remission for almost 2 yrs.  Chemotherapy is what I took. Had 8 treatments but will not do that again either.  I feel better than ever because of the cancer supplements and diet change. Some hospitals are integrated alternative medicine into their treatment plans, but it is a slow process. Hopefully, insurance companies will recognize that some of this treatment is much more effective and less costly than traditional medicine alone.  Hope this info. helps.  ",

I rejected radiation therapy for my stage 3 Breast Cancer and am glad I did and even more glad since reading your posting. My Oncologist & Radiologist told me I would have damage to the tip of my lung only, didn't tell me about the heart, but had heard stories of heart damage. I sought out a good ND, (Homeopathic Doctor), in Charlotte, NC and he said there was no way the radiation would bypass my heart. I am on a good cancer diet with supplements and am doing very well. Blood tests are good and feel better than ever before.  God Bless you and take care",

I agree you should pray for your neighbor who has cancer and also pray for the neighbor who told you. She broke confidentiality and if the one who has cancer finds out she may not ever trust her again. With all that said, it is obvious from appearance sake something is wrong with your neighbor. I had the same surgery almost 2 yrs. ago and wore hats. Hope your neighbor eventually shares with you, but until she does, just pray for her. God Bless you, Bev ",
