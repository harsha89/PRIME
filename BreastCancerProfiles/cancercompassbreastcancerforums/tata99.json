      "Content": "congrats on finishing your treatment. I to had allot of the pins and needles symptoms, but it went away in time. Also after a while it started to itch, after 4 years it still happens occationally. As for lumps and bumps I did not have that side affect. Would like to wish you well on your journey to a complete recovery.     tata 99 ",

My onc. wants me to change my Tamoxefin for Aromasin, but from what I have read so far there seems to be allot of joint pain associated with that pill. Is there anyone out there taking this pill with minimal side affect?",

It all seems to be allot of joint pain. I keep looking at the box of pills and find excuses why I can't start them right now. My cancer also was caught early. I had 3 months of chemo and 25 treatment of radiation. Hope you have lots of fun at your pink party on the 23rd. Congrats to you and again thank you.",

I have not seen my oncologist yet dont know what he will have to say about that. I see him in January. Maybe you could let me know how it goes for you in 3 months.  Also for your hot flashes there is a prescription  you can get for that, they work for me, they are called APO-CLONIDINE 0.025MG. Take2 tablets twice daily. Hope this will help you with hotflashes. Good luck to you, hope all goes well with your journey to a full recovery.

I read you planned on starting Aromasin in Sept.  How are things going for you?      ",
