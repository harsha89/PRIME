Mine were damaged by chemo and it is, unfortunately, permanent.  About 40% gone now. Seems like if her ears were peeling inside and out, that it was rad. burns and they should level with you as to the chance of hearing loss from that. Ask. Sometimes just knowing the REASON for something makes it easier to bear and certainly easier to explain to others. But some side-effects are only temporary and it would be nice to know that, too. Hope this helps~ Barb    Thanks so much for your response.  Her hearing has improved some with time.  Unfortunately, she has been battling a bad case of pneumonia and can't take her chemo.  I'll make sure they ask.  Thanks again, Wynette",

      "Content": "Hi there, My favorite Mother-in-Law is battling breast cancer.  A new problem has arisen and I was wondering if anyone has seen this and had any experience.  She has been undergoing chemo and radiation for mets in her spine and other areas.  One area of radiation treatment was in the area of C1 on her neck.  She had pretty serious burns and sores around her ears and there was much peeling in and around the ears.  She has had a severe hearing loss during this time.  Is this something anyone else has encountered? (She also has COPD and has spent part of this week in the hospital receiving breathing treatments because she had gotten some virus that caused a horrible cought.  Don't know if this is related, but the hearing loss had begun before this started.) Thanks for any help. Wynette",
