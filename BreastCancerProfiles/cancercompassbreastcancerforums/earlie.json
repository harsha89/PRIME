      "Content": "I didn't have the problem with my hair not growing back but I did lose my eyelashes which my oncologist prescribed latisse now I have them back but have to continue using it occasssionally or they start falling out.I also had very long thick but frizzy hair but it came back thick and natural curl which I love.For quite awhile I had one bald spot on the top of my head but everywhere else was thick.It eventually filled in.I will hope and pray for your hair to return.I sure wish the hair on my legs wouldn't have came back though.It was nice not having to shave.To be real honest it didn't bother me all that much being bald headed saved alot of time in the mornings.HA !Got to have a little laughter.People who love you accept you no matter how you look,hair no hair.Those that don't,they just don't understand.If you know God,he will take care of you and things will happen in his time. May God always guide and protect you.",

      "Content": "Hi Lori, After completing chemo I was started on arimidex only to have the worst bone and joint pain.I was then switched to tamoxifen which did relieve a lot of the pain but then I got into a deep depression didn't know why found it was the tamoxifen.I am not on aromasin.I have severe neuropathy in feet,legs and hands which was chemo induced.The aromasin also causes joint pain and weight gain but to me is the better of the three or shoild I say the lesser of the three evils.If they save our lives thats all that matters.I also suffer from cardiomyopathy which caused my ejection fraction to lower and make heart weaken after the chemo.I wish everyone on here happiness,bettter health,less pain a long life and may God bless each and everyone.
