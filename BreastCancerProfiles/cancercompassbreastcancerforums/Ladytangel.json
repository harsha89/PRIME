Its been a few years now since she was diagsnosed with stage 1 lobular cancer. she was put on tamoxifin and had a double mastectomy...awhile later she returned to show 3 spots on her liver. the doctors read them out as hemangiomas. three months later she came back, she had full blown mets in her liver. just telling that makes me so angry...anyways, back to it. she did the minimal chemo, she believes in organic foods, good nutrition, supplements, alterative treatments. to say the least chemo made her feel horrible and she felt horrible putting that into her body. so she began alternative options and  started to lose support from the conventional docotrs which is a whole other story, that also frustrates me...well she did her own treatments, and felt great, looked great, sounded great...but 5 weeks ago she had a CT and it is progressing, so she agreed to go on femara. now she feels horrible, the pain is intense, her belly is bloated, and i feel so helpless....not to mention scared. i feel sometimes like the anger is overwhelming these days. why my mom, why any of us? why is it so hard to find a good doctor? why is life so unfair?   Any advice out there would be much apprecitate I understand the anger you are feeling about your mom's cancer and her treatment. I went through my share of grief...I went through something similar with my mom. If you dont mind my sharing..... My mother was diagnosed in 2002 with stage 2 breast cancer without lymph node involvment...she had surgery to remove the lump and some lymph nodes, radiation and 2 rounds (16 treatments) of chemo that seemed to take forever for her to get through. She was terribly ill, had peripheral neuropathy, nothing tasted good...and all the other side effects. She also suffered a mild heart attack when being treated with the Nupogen. Finally she got through it,,,lots of support from family, extended family, church, and she definitely found out who her friends weren't. I think her faith had a lot to do with the healing process. Slowly but surely she began to feel better. She would go in for her every 3 month checkups--regular doc, oncology doc, labs, and whatever other doc she had been seeing during this time. I have lost count. But about a year and a half later she started feeling really fatigued and just dragged, just plain didnt feel well, so she asked her doc to check and see if the cancer had spread. (She is an RN and worked a lot with oncology patients plus keeps up on research) He did the blood tests, CT scan and found nothing out of the ordinary, but still she found no comfort in that. Finally she underwent a PET scan and lo and behold two spots showed up on her liver. Guess what? the doc said they were just hemangioma's. But that didnt seem to account for her health. so they did an extremely painful liver biopsy. I remember my mother saying how she cried during the procedure....not every tool to diagnose is pain free apparently. Anyway, the 'hemangioma's' were something else entirely---metastasized colon cancer cells. Totally unexpected!  When the doc told her that, she was really shocked...she had completely expected it to be met cells from her breast tumor. NOT Finally she saw her oncologist and he suggested she see Paul Hansen, a doc in Portland, Oregon who specializes in liver treatments--he had actually been the one to perfect the liver ablation method. So with a hopeful heart, mom saw him. She went on another round of chemo to help shrink the tumors ( a friend of hers gave her some herbals to help--but you have to be careful that they dont react with other meds)...and within two months time she was scheduled for a dual surgery...a bowel resection (sigmoid) and liver ablation. Family came from all over WA and ORE and I flew up from Nevada, to be with her. Surgery came (Good Samaritan in Portland Oregon--they also have housing for family who has to come a long ways),,,we waited,,,and waited,,,and waited....that was the longest 5 hour surgery we had ever waited through. When they brought her out I ran over to the gurney to see that she was awake. I asked how she felt but I could see that she was aroused enough to feel the horrible pain the ablation had inflicted upon her. But you know what?! Even though it took about a year to get past the pain of that liver surgery (the colon and abdominal surgery were a piece of cake in comparison), the tumors have not returned. She also finished the round of chemo that she had started before the surgery. She is faithful about going to all of her appointments every 3 months. This year she reached the 5 year cure rate for the breast cancer, and will be at the 3 year mark for colon cancer in November. She was told that she only had an 8% chance of surviving the colon cancer. We will see. During her chemo periods where she felt so awful she would always ask God, \"Why?\" I am afraid I wasn't much help in answering her or helping her to find out....but a couple things have happened that kind of answered that question...one is, it brought our family together--a brother who had been estranged miraculously came back into the fold..and the other? wish I could show you my smile on this one...she has counseled many others who are experiencing what she went through...including 2 of my cousins going through breast cancer treatments now and me. She is also writing a book about her experience in words that lay people like you and I can understand. The book is more helpful than anything I have seen simply because it tells you what to expect, how you might feel, and it gives a little ray of hope. I dont know if reading what I wrote helps you much, keep yourself informed--look up Paul Hanson on the web and contact him to see if he can offer another option. If you have faith, cling to it. You and your mother are in my prayers. LadyT",
