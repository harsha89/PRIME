Having a port is initailly painful as you recover from the surgery but well worth it. I still have mine. It needs to be injected with heparin once a month, but the nurses will take care of that! I am so sorry your cancer has returned... Mine never went away. Try to remember you coping skills from the first time and support groups are great for, well, support and freindship from people who understand, I liked \"The Wellness Community\" and they are in many major cities and are free of charge! Except, of course, the entrance fee, which is having cancer or being a caregiver of someone with cancer. They have all kinds of classes too and fun events that are matched with the situation you are in. Your MD or social worker might know what resources are in your area - there should be something or someone to help you share the burden and not be alone. You may also want to talk with your MD about HIPEC. This is only available in major cancer centers. It is Hyperthemic Intraperitnoneal Chemotherapy.  It is a nasty surgical procedure and I'm not sure if it has been tried for Breast cancer. Email me for the web site for details or ask your MD.... It has shown success for other cancers andmight give you some extra time and quality of life, once you recovered. Live every day to the fullest you can. Best of spirits from another person whose \"time\" is limited by cancer... Rachel",

      "Content": " Some B vitamins actually interfere with Taxol's effects as cytotoxic chemo and will prevent it from killing the cancer cells! My oncologist told me NOT to take ANY vitamins unless approved by him. I recall B6 as being one of the vitamins and E. It's important to check out taking ANY supplements or medicines, even a daily vitamin, while you are on chemo! On the other hand, he shared that L-Glutamine , 40 grams a day, is really helpful with the neuropathy without ruining the effects of the Taxol, and sure enough, it worked! Grams need to be put in a shake - I recommend powder and made in America, not China, to be sure of the purity.... Be sure to check with your MD anyway and be careful of advise, even mine that you see on the web. Your doctor is your best resource for the final decision. Best of luck to all who have to go through chemo. It sucks but I am almost one year from the end with not much remaining sickness, except tiredness and some \"chemo brain\" from the taxol and Carboplatin I was given. Have a great day, one day at a time. If you took vitamins during chemo, tell your MD right away.... Rachel K.

The first was taken out because I was cured and when it came back I had the port put back in and have never had a problem with it. The chemo goes in faster and your veins are saved cause they even take your blood samples from your port. Taxol was not very nice to me. Get some B+ and take that to help with the neuropathy. Also use utter cream on your feet and hands day and night. Also try to never own your cancer. Smile as often as you can and laugh.............it is the only way.......you can do it. God Bless Sue  ",
