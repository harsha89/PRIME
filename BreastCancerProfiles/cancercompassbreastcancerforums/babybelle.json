    "Content": "I had a bilateral mastectomy in July, 2015.  I elected not to consult a plastic surgeon because I was not planning to have reconstructive surgery.  I thought I could deal with a flat chest and a straight scar.  I ended up with two concave areas with deep indentations and bulges.  The bulges swell at times and are painful -- the next day, they might be gone.  It has been 8 weeks since my surgery and I am still unable to be fitted for a prosthesis.  I feel extremely uncomfortable to be seen in public because the lumps and valleys are visible even with clothes on.  I would suggest that anyone having a mastectomy - whether you have reconstruction or not -- consult with a plastic surgeon and have him/her team with your surgeon to create a flat-chested scar you can deal with.  I currently have a consultation scheduled with a plastic surgeon for scar revision, but don't know even if I will follow through.  I am so happy to have my life and be cancer free, but so mortified with the way I look.",
