Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated! Lindalou, I am having some of the same issues. I had thyroid cancer in \"2007\" this was after my dr. told me it was nothing to worry about to go live my life. I continued to search for answers as how can you live life, when I times you cannot get out of bed. Within a month of changing dr's I had surgery and I am glad I did and stayed active with this as it was cancer. One month later basal cell cancer on my back. I have multi-organ saracodosis, started in my lungs. Now, with my issue is my left breast I had started to work out on my total gym back on July 8th, and the first pull I dropped the rope and grapped my breast and arm the pain under my armpit and into my breast brought tears to my eyes. My husband what did you do , I had not even started to use the machine yet. So, I did not use anymore, one week the pain still there, waking me up from sleep, lifting my arm up hurt so I requested a mammogram, they said nothing everything fine, but dr. might want to ultrasound due to the tenderness, swelling. So went for ultrasound wow to everyone's surprise a lump was there I mean popped right up shocked me, i guess I was so consumed with the pain never looked at anything else. So, the tech got the radiologist dr. she felt so I think it is lipoma (fatty tumor) but doing just left side mammogram to be sure. She came back said just a lipoma nothing to worry about. She called me the next day and said yes I am right just lipoma nothing to worry about, I said why the pain, swelling etc. she was so rude she said there are a lot of women with pain and swelling and we do not know why, but you are fine. I said you know I respect your opinion but I was told that about thyroid cancer too, and turns out cancer. She said there is not one breast surgeron or radiologist that will do a biopsy on something like this and I will be surprised if they proof me wrong. I was so upset, I cried and I thought this is my body I owe it to myself if I am over reacting so be it, I need to know I have done everything I can to protect myself, before it is to late. I maked up mammograms from 2010,2011, 2014 for one place and then the other place from one week apart and the difference in the reports blows me away. 2010-mamm/ultras -benign focal fatty parenchyma left breastBi-Rads2, 2011 - birads 1 no changeÂ  from 2010, 2014 July 24th - scatter fibroglandular densities 25-50% Birads 1 no mass 2014 7/30 - mamm/ultras - lipoma left breast palpable finding 3.6x4.7cm nearly isoechoic mass in the left breast @ 9 o'clock. breast is almost entirely fat <25% glandular, soft and mobile.this correlates with the lipoma seen on mammogram...Okay how in 6 days did that size of a mass grow..I still have pain, swelling to the point the left breast doesn't fit in my bra correctly, it feels heavy. I am going to a breast surgeon tomorrow but apart of me feels like I am being stupid, but I just feel something is not right. I am so confused...anyone with any advice or experience I would greatly appreciate sorry so long..No child had to have hystercomy at 22 yrs old due to endortermois after 4 miscarriages. Thank you, Pam",
