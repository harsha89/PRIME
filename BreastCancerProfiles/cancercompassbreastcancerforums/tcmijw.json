    "Content": "dear k, hope that this note finds you in great health.  my story is similar to yours, I had node positive, stage lll breast cancer in may of 2007.  I am still trying to find answers to so many issues that I think about even 1 1/2  years later.  I do know that herceptin has a very high approval rate and I can only hope it will do what it is supposed to do for the many women who have taken it or still taking it.  the other e-mail was right, 10 years ago our situations would have been vastly different!  the side effects of herceptin creep up on you over the course of the year... i gained a lot of weight, this could have been from the chemo, not sure? my bones really started to hurt and oddly enough my feet! sometimes it was so hard to walk... anyway I am 5 months free of no drugs and I am really starting to feel great!  I know this may sound crazy but each day that goes by, I think about cancer less and less...it has happened to us for some reason.  when I see or meet someone going through any type of cancer, my heart just melts, knowing that their story is similar to mine and I hope that they are fighting it the beating it the best they can! best of luck!
