      "Content": "Agree with Sandy, pure aloe vera has been successful for me as well. I am starting week five of radiation and have no skin reaction thus far. I have used the lotion they supply immediately after treatment in the changing room, front and back,  and I use the Aubrey pure Aloe Vera every night (can get it on Amazon or a a health store) . I have not worn a bra post lumpectomy and have adhered to the strict 100% cotton against my skin. I was lucky enough to find a bunch of long sleeve light cotton tops on sale at Coldwater Creek and Kohls. Over these I wear a fleece or sweater vest and no one knows I am braless for the Winter. I am, however on the table for 15 minutes due to it being my left breast and the need for using a machine where I hold my breath while the radiation is being delivered.  The most inconvenient part of radiation has been the coming and going. My cancer center has free yoga, reike and massage for patients in treatment. The reike in particular has been a blessing.  Take good care along your journey.",

My name is Emily and my best friend was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer last July that had spread to her bones.  She went through 6 rounds of chemo every 3 weeks and the PET scan showed no cancer! YAY!  She had a double mastectomy and partial hysterectomy (some of the tumors were estrogen-fed) on Jan 13 2014.  She went in for a body scan a few weeks later and they found more cancer under her arm.  They told her they would resume chemo followed with radiation for her bones.   Two weeks ago she went to the ER with severe headaches and back pain.  CT scan showed no cancer in the brain or vital organs.  They put her on pain meds, released.  Several days later she went back for severe headaches, loss of vision.  They did a spinal tap and her spinal pressure was very high and they removed 11 cc of fluid.  They also resumed chemo that day as her oncologist said that it was very important to jump on this NOW. We are supposed to find out if there are cancer cells in her spinal fluid today. I don't even know if I have a question.  We are both 35 - have been inseperable since we were in kindergarten.  Our children are close friends.  She has an 8 year old and a 6 year old.  I don't want to lose her.   I guess since I need a question... can anyone tell me a reason why her spinal pressure would be so high for a reason other than cancer?  Is there any hope?  Everything I have read says once it gets in the spinal fluid prognosis is grim. This sucks. -Emily Dear Emily,  I can not answer your clinical question about your friend's spinal fluid pressure, but what I can do is offer you both encouragement and support. Your fear is palpable, and you are obviously researching to the max, or you wouldn't be here. It appears her medical team is following her closely and treating her cancer aggressively; both which are good at this stage. I can recommend a book titled, \"Outsmart Your Cancer\" Alternative Non-Toxic Treatments That Work. It is by Tanya Harter Pierce. In it they speak of something called Protocel which can only be marketed as a \"nutritional supplement\", but given the extent of your friend's illness, it might be something else to throw at these horrible reproducing cancer cells. I read this book when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, and it is something I may consider trying. You are a wonderful friend. Having people on you team doing the foot-work and seeking all available information, when you are a concer victim, is such a blessing. I send you my prayers and positive thoughts. Dodie ",

Gigi56,  This is excellent advice concerning options outside the USA.   Who is MD Anderson? Not sure how to find this Texas Doc. To the best friend: keep in mind, when diagnosed with cancer, often one's fear of suffering may be far greater than their fear of dying.  While I believe it is important to support the battle, it is equally essential to support the decision not to fight any longer. As a cancer victim, I would at this stage take quality of life over quantity, but I am in my 60's and have witnessed the marriages of my children and the births of six grands. I am blessed. You and your cherished friend remain in my prayers.",

I hope you not a stage 4 terminal patient, but I am. I recommended some legacy options and then being \"present\" for her friend. These are concrete \"how can I help my friend\".....listening, hand holding. This requirement to believe to get benefit, is your approach. Please don't assume it had any value to anyone else. In no other post has the god talk been present and so if you need to spread the good word, please go elsewhere. Please. I am sorry you are in such a negative place. What ever you are seeking, perhaps this is not the best place to find it. Here you will find love, kindness, support and caring from those wanting to be present to help others as they traverse this most difficult journey.
