    "Content": "Hi. I am a 29 year old female with no family history of breast cancer. I went to the doctor with breast issues and basically to make a long story short I was referred to a breast specialist who told me I \"probably\" don't have cancer. After a biopsy and a small lumpectomy it came back benign but I was told that it would have waited it would have most definitely turned into cancer. I go back in 5 months for another ultrasound check up. My problem is, I am still having the same breast issues I had before I went to see the breast specialist but worse now and in my heart I honestly feel that something isn't right. Do I ask for second opinion somewhere else and put myself through all of that again? I'm very scared and at a loss. Does anyone have any suggestions please and thank you!Â ",
