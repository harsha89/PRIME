      "Content": "Jomar - My maternal grandmother died from breast cancer; my mother and her sister both had breast cancer followed by mastectomies. (They both died from other causes.) I am 54 and have had this hanging over me all my life and, although I prayed about it a lot, I guess I never really thought I would get it! I was wrong. The good news is they caught it before it really developed into cancer - I was diagnosed with LCIS from biopsy lab report because of a small lump (which was benign). I then had a lumpectomy wherein they found LCIS present in many areas of the breast. My doctor told me she felt I probably had it or would get it in the other breast as well. I decided to not go through chemo, drugs, and the waiting games. I think that puts too much stress on a person. So, although I only was diagnosed in one breast, I went ahead and had a bilateral mastectomy. (I consulted with 4 doctors before making my decision.) As soon as the doctor was finished, a plastic surgeon came in and put in expanders. That was last March. I now have very pretty boobs with very pretty nipples and they were manmade! What a hoot! I haven't had the nipples tattooed yet, though. No, they are not perfect but the originals weren't either. I feel great - am exercising by walking and doing yoga/pilates with lots of stretching. I am so blessed! Please go ahead and get it done! It is such a relief to not have to worry about breast cancer any more. God bless you. p.s. My husband loves them - he thinks he has a new wife! Ha!",

      "Content": "Hi, Jomar. All doctors recommeded the bilateral mastectomy mainly, I think, because I told them I do not want the stress of worrying about the cancer. I had about 6 or 7 options, and this was the most radical, but I felt that, personally, I did not want to go through the chemo and/or radiation or drugs because of what those can do to one's body. My mother was a physically and mentally strong woman, but after the chemo, her body began breaking down, little by little, and I don't want that for myself. I chose not to have only one breast removed because she did and she was not pleasant to look at (she didn't have reconstruction) and because I didn't want to have to worry about cancer in the other breast. So I chose to go ahead and have both breasts removed so they would look alike. I have a friend who opted to have only one breast removed and now she wishes she had gone ahead with the other for two reasons: (1) they are obviously two different breasts - don't look anything alike, and (2) she now has to live with the worry that the cancer will show up in the other breast. No, the reconstruction is not a long thing. My 1st surgery was March 21st, 2nd was May 24th and my last surgery was August 16th. That's all. Not a big deal, to me. The first surgery was to remove the breast tissue - she left as much as she could - and the nipple. The scars ran from about an inch from my armpits diagonally to the bottom of the breast. The plastic surgeon then put in expanders. I styed overnite in the hospital and went to my sister's for 6 days. She was a Godsend!!! (I wasn't confined to bed or anything - just had to be careful and take care of myself with lots of rest.) I would visit the plastic surgeon about every 3 weeks and he would inject the solution to expand the temporary implants to as large as I could take, then stop. I went to a C cup and only had 3 of the expansion visits. The second surgery in May was to replace the expanders with the permanent inmplants and to do that, he reopened the scars. The third surgery was to make the nipples. Both the 2nd and 3rd surgeries were in an outpatient clinic so I didn't spend the nite. The only thing left to do now is tattoo the nipples and areolas. I can understand your reluctance - I was sad to lose my breasts and I cried once, the nite before my first surgery. After that, I knew I had made the right decision for me and was perfectly at peace with it. Of course, my husband's support, as well as my 23 yr. old and 15 yr. old sons, helped me tremendously. A good support system is essential. Your family must realize that this time is for you to take care of yourself, not them. I did as much as I could and within a month of the 1st surgery I was doing most of my regular housework. Yes, there was pain. Still is, sometimes. But I can deal with it. Yes, there is numbness which my doctor told me would happen. She said I will never have the same sensations as before but at least I can feel touch. And there are other drawbacks. Since there is no breast tissue, the implants are directly under the skin and muscle, which are both thin. Therefore, there is some rippling which you can see in certain positions and lighting. But I don't live in a nudist colony so that doesn't bother me. Ha! (Candles make you look better - you know?) And I'm sure the scars will never completely go away. But my husband thinks my breasts are beautiful just as they are - even with scars and without the tattoos. My doctors said nothing about hormones at all. I don't want to take them anyway unless they are natural. (I am in the beginning stages of menopause and am hoping to get through this without hormones.) Please know that I don't particularly feel brave. What I do feel is blessed and that God is watching over me and, if you ask Him to, He will hold you in His arms and you will feel His strength and love. My prayer for you is to be at peace. I'm sorry this is so long - but I felt you need to know some of the details before making your decision. I really didn't know most of the negative things prior to the surgery, but even if I had it to do over, I would do exactly the same thing. Whatever you decide, you should move on it as soon as possible. The sooner, the better. Feel free to ask me any other questions. Blessings on you!",
