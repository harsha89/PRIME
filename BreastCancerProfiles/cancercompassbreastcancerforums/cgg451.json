She had the nuelasta shot the day after chemo. She hasn't experienced any side effects until today. She is having a spasm in her lower back. I gave her a muscle relaxer and a heating pad. She's feeling better, napping, but the pain is not completely gone. I thought it might be from the neulasta but wasn't sure. From reading this thread, I think my initial instict was right and that it's from the shot. Thanks. This website is going to be of great use to me! I am now out of the treatment stage after 3 years, but thought I'd comment to Bronwen.  The Neulasta shot seems to make the chemo work better, although I always teased (after a couple of treatments) that I came in for the shot so that I could feel worse.  I ended up having more leg pains (like nervous leg syndrome), but that went away after treatment.  Anyhow, I think my back pain may have come from helping someone to move (after I'd completed treatment by a few months).  Oddly, the pain continued for 5 months so I finally went for a bone scan and all was clear.  Since I knew the scan was clear, I then checked with a chiropracter but after a few treatments was still sore.  Next was P.T. and I knew after the second treatment, I was on the mend.  So, who knows if chemo was involved - getting the bone scan gave me the greatest mental relief.  I wish your mother the best although I see your message is from 2010, so she's now done with treatment.  I received a note on my e-mail, so thought this was a new message.  Regardless, I'll still send this note.",

      "Content": "Here I am, out of chemo for 3+ years (and the cancer diagnosis of almost 4 years ago), but I still wanted to respond.  Now, this should give your mother even more hope of what's ahead - good health.  The nuelasta shot is a bummer and I can still (in my mind) feel/remember the effects on my legs.  There was pain along with the restless leg syndrome (which I suppose was like a spasm).  She will sleep a lot and don't let that bother you.  My husband reminded me the other day of how much time I spent on the couch.  Other cancer survivers also told me they couldn't imagine how much they slept.  If your mom has cable, I especially enjoyed the \"bio\" channel when I got up at 4 am, because I had slept so much during the day.  I still know answers to some trivia questions because of it:)  Tell her also to never be afraid to call her nurses if she's feeling sick to her stomach or has a lot of acid reflux.  There is medicine for everything and she does not have to suffer.  Each day is one more day closer to being done and I hope that she does well on the chemo.",

It continues, in an abated, come and go way, ever since. I have done acupuncture and massage, but it still hangs on. Stretching and advil help. Drs say it is muscle pain, not a sign of cancer. Has anyone else had this lingering pain? I finished chemo in April. Did your back pain ever go away.  I finished chemo with A/C, Taxol and Neulasta on Jan. 12, 2009.  The Neulasta caused a lot of leg pain during treatment, but now I find that my back is sore (especially trying to make it through a good night's sleep).  I had a bone scan and all is fine with that.  I have never experienced back aches prior to this but am 62 yrs old plus gained some weight - so thought that might be part of it.  Your page and people's experience with this has helped me to think that it may be the chemo.  I took glocosamine today and will continue each day to see if that works.  The pain I have is like a stenosis (and actually ends up heading down my leg which eventually causes knee pain).  I may get an xray and then try some other treatments.  Is your pain still there.  What have you done since your 8/13/08 message.  Thanks and hope all else is well.",

      "Content": "I've now  been out for almost 5 years and no more back pain.  It did seem to linger a bit after the complete chemo (8 times), but I had a bone scan and there was no problem.  The Neulasta (sp?) does give a lot of bone pain - back and legs if I remember right.  I think one way to get through it is to know that it's making the chemo work better.  Sometimes the Ibuprofen did not cut the pain, so I had also used some pain killers as it got really sore in the legs, but only used 1/2 of Vicadin at a time.  It was just enough to take away pain. Seemed like the legs were having almost spasms (like restless leg syndrome).  I hope that your Mom is able to handle any of the side effects of chemo.  My best advice, if she's feeling sick to her stomach or having dizziness, etc., she should not wait to call her nurses.  I had a lot of medications changed until the right one worked.  Lots of hugs to you and your mom - this too shall pass, but it's so hard on all concerned when you're in the midst of it.",
