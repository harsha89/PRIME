    "Content": "I too am a survivor of non-Hodgkin\u2019s and it's a daily battle. I imagine all kind of horrible things I even go so far as to imagine a headache is a sign the cancer moved to my brain. I have been so well blessed with support, the support of my co-workers and my boss has been outstanding, my friends from church who have prayed for me through the worst and most of all my husband who I never thought could be as strong as he was. I have been out of treatment almost a year but the sheer hell of waiting for a relapse is almost enough to send you over the edge. Since I am incurable (but containable) it\u2019s just a waiting game. My thoughts and prayers are with you and keep positive because that is the only way you will win.",
