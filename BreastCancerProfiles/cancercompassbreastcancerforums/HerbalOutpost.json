It's a given that chemo is hard, however it doesn't have to be quite as hard. Your onco is a TRAINED professional, and he/she is better informed in what is best for your situation. However, what is best is NOT necessarily what is comfortable. And know that, even though oncologists are well educated in cancer, they are not taught holistic methods and this is why they often times don't prescribe such methods. Absolutely use holistic methods, but be sure you know that the methods actually work WITH your onco's treatment, not \"instead of\".",

Chemo meds that are known for this include anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin) trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab (Perjeta). According to the Mayo Clinic: The chances of heart damage caused by anthracyclines coincides with the total amount of exposure to the drug during your lifetime. So if this is a brand new drug to you, your chances are better. As for trastuzumab, it is not lifetime exposure, but any exposure you need to be aware of. Taxanes may have the side effect of causing an abnormal heart rhythm. Fluorouracil and capecitabine (Xeloda) may cause spasms of the arteries in the heart, a heart attack. The Mayo Clinic strongly recommends that you undergo heart function tests before receiving any chemotherapy drug known to affect the heart.Â  It is also advised that a combination of chemo with radiation can increase the risk of heart effects. I am not trying to scare you into or out of anything, but you do need to know exactly what you are getting into what you need to discuss with your onco.",

If this is a new \"issue\" for you, sometimes medications can change the bacterial populations on your skin, causing that vinegar odor. Changing medication may or may not eliminate the bacteria, IF that is what's even causing your problem. Alternatively, your diet may cause a vinegar type odor as well -- have you changed your dietary routine in the past year? Other health problems that can cause a vinegar-like body odor include the development of diabetes, hormonal imbalances, and menopause. The only way to know the root of the problem is to be tested for those things. Since ovarian cancers and some breast cancers are hormonally related it wouldn't be a bad idea to check for that as well, if you haven't already. Whatever is causing it, do advocate for investigation, but don't get overly paranoid. It may be something much simpler than cancer. Let us know how the investigation goes!",

A study involving 46 breast cancer patients using chemotherapy found that those who were given 2.1 grams of A. sylvaticus extract divided into two doses daily, for six months experienced an 80% decrease in nausea and vomiting symptoms GINGER Zingiber officinale: is a spice related to turmeric. Ginger, a well-known remedy for nausea and vomiting has been noted as effective for adult cancer patients.1 Precautions: Ginger is a known blood thinner. Use in moderation. If pregnant be sure to seek a qualified practitioner's guidance before use as overuse may stimulate uterine contractions. Ginger can prolong the sedative effect of barbituates. Use caution if you are suffering from gallstones, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or ulcers. Dosages: Ginger comes in several forms. A single dose of ginger is: 1 cup of ginger tea one medium piece of crystallized ginger 2 droppers of ginger extract 2 teaspoons of ginger syrup 1 tablespoon freshly grated root Â½ teaspoon of ground ginger. Take a single dose up to three times daily. 1 Supportive Care in Cancer \u2013 Official Journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Car in Cancer, July 2012, Vol. 20, No.7, pp. 1479-1489, \u201cGinger (Zingiber officinale) reduces acute chemotherapy-induced nausea: a URCC CCOP study of 576 patients\u201d J. L. Ryan, et al HOT PEPPERS: Hot peppers contain a substance known as capsaicin, which gives the peppers their spicy hot flavor; the hotter the pepper, the more capsaicin it contains. It is well known in scientific circles that capsaicin reduces a neurotransmitter known as Substance P,1 a compound which transmits pain signals and induces nausea.2 Precautions: Do not use capsaicin cream or cayenne pepper on surgical sites, radiation sites, broken skin, mucous membranes, or get it in your eyes. Do not use internally in therapeutic doses during pregnancy due to a possible risk of childhood brain tumors. Taking cayenne internally for long periods can reduce your liver's ability to process certain prescription medications. Excessive use of capsaicin internally may increase the risk of developing liver and stomach cancers. Capsaicin may thin the blood. Excessive internal use may irritate the intestinal tract. Wash hands thoroughly after using the fresh peppers or the topical remedies. Women with lobular breast cancer should moderate their intake due to an increased risk of metastasis to the stomach. Peppers are in the nightshade family; avoid use if you are allergic to other members of nightshades such as potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, tomatillos, ground cherries, and goji berries. Dosage: Normal dietary intake is safe. Because scientific studies have shown conflicting results as to whether capsaicin may be carcinogenic in high doses I do not recommend using capsaicin supplements without the oversight of an experienced practitioner. 1Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology, June 1981, Vol. 317, No.2, pp.140-148 \u201cDifferential effects of capsaicin on the content of somatostatin, substance P, and neurotensin in the nervous system of the rat\u201d Rainer Gamse, et al 2Drugs, 2000, Vol.60, No.3, p.535, \u201cPotential of Substance P Antagonists as Antiemetics\u201d Pierre Diemunsch et al",

A whole body scan tends to give a relatively high exposure to radiation and is known to increase the risk of developing a cancer later on; therefore it is not a recommended procedure for people who don't have clear symptoms. In other words, your doctor is not being dismissive, he is being cautious, as he should be. You may want to ask about having an MRI scan done instead (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). It does not use radiation and is generally safer so long as your mother does not have any implants inside her (pacemakers, rods, pins, etc.). Some doctors combine MRI's with PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography). PET scans do have a lower dose of radiation exposure than CT scans, so I would discuss this with your oncologist.",

The boswellic acid molecules are too heavy to transfer into the oil when being produced, therefore she should actually be using the extract instead. Also, it is important to know whether she is receiving any radiation treatments, thermal treatments, or other treatments directly on the skin of the tumor site. If she is, she needs to check with her doctor to be sure that the frankincense extract is not interfereing with the prescribed treatment.",

According to Johns Hopkins University: \"There is no way to determine the presence of ADH by reviewing a mammogram or other breast imaging study. It also cannot be felt on a clinical breast exam. If ADH cells are found on a core biopsy, an excisional open breast biopsy is necessary so more tissue can be examined. Approximately 25 percent of the time when ADH cells are found on a core biopsy, the cancer is determined to be early stage.\" They also state that women with ADH who have not developed cancer sometimes opt to be on tamoxifen as a preventative measure. However, since you are so young, you may also want to consider the possibility of developing a triple negative breast cancer (which tends to show up in younger women). You definitely need to have a conversation with your oncologist about these things.",

      "Content": "Stage 1 breast cancer has a phenomenal survival rate between 98% - 100%, depending on which source you go by. This is great odds, I'm so glad you found it this early! You probably already know that the anastazole is an aromatase inhibitor, which means it blocks the synthesis of estrogen in your body, reducing your estrogen levels. This is different than how tamoxifen works (which simply blocks already-produced estrogen from attaching to your estrogen receptors). Although anastazole tends to work better than tamoxifen, rashes are a known side effect of the medication. I hesitate to advise alternative chemo drugs since I don't know you whole health history but I do strongly advise you to trust your oncologist to give you a different medication to try. Because you have an estrogen positive cancer you should also be sure that you aren't taking any herbals or supplements containing plant-based estrogens. This includes soy, red clover, licorice, black cohosh, or anything that is meant to help ease menopause symptoms without your oncologist's advice. Also realize that no chemotherapy medication will be \"comfortable\", they all have unlovable side effects, but these effects are only temporary (and WORTH IT to kill the disease!) Once you've beaten the cancer you will have plenty of time to enjoy your children! Yes, breast cancer is a serious diagnosis, and can be very scary. But don't let it scare you witless; stage 1 is very treatable and very survivable. Let us know how things go with your doctor visit!",

If you want to reduces the symptoms of menopause, but do not want to increase your risk of breast cancer, it's better to speak to your doctor about using foods which contain phytoestrogens (plant-based estrogens). Plant estrogens can help reduce menopause symptoms however they are much weaker than synthetic estrogens, thereby reducing the risk. Do not use estrogen-heavy supplements (such as soy isoflavones) because these are more concentrated and increases the risk of cancer.
