    "Content": "HKI-272, a Her2/EGFR inhibitor and a previous drug of Wyeth, is outlisenced to Puma biotechnology by Pfizer last year. This drug has been on the clinical trial phase for several years. Last week, the CEO of Puma announced that Â the company has reached a SPA (special protocol assessment) deal with FDA for the phase 3 trial of HKI-272. \"The SPA is a written agreement between the company, as the trial's sponsor, and the FDA regarding the design, endpoints and planned statistical analysis approach of the Phase III trial to be used in support of a New Drug Application or NDA for PB272.\" I wonder what SPA means to HKI-272? Does that mean HKI-272 a promising drug?",
