    "Content": "hi just to let you know, i was on dexamethasone, its a steroid table, they gave it to me along with my chemo and then i had to take 2 tablets for 2 days after.. i also had anti sickness drugs too. it does help to make you feel better! but makes you want to eat, not sleep and you will no doubt get bloated.. Dexamethasone is in a class of drugs called steroids. Dexamethasone reduces swelling and decreases the body's immune response. hope this helps lindsay (scotland)",
