    "Content": "New Here.. My husband found a lump in my right breast. Its about the size of large grape or small stawberry.  Its about 1inch away from my nipple to the upper right. I have no idea how long it had been there. Today though, things changed. My breasts become sore and i have what can only be described as think discharge with a hint of green color. Im worried. I have only 1 lump in my right breast ,but now both are sore with discharge. Can anyone help me? My doctor cant see me for 2 weeks. ",
