      "Content": "What tx is yours Dr. doing. Is this your first occurance? My mother is being treated at the Cancer Treatment Center of America in Philadelphia. They do alternative treatments along with the chemotherapy. She is getting Taxol and Carbo along with a new drug called Avastin. It is a protein they put in the IV, that makes the chemo work better it cuts off blood supply to the cancer cell. It is supposed to be a wonderful adjuct to chemo. Ask your Dr. About it. They also give alot of vitamins and certain supplements to help with the side effects. Their web site in cancercenter.com It has alot of info. Good luck to you! ;) Cathy",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply, glad to hear that Avastin is a good adjuct to chemo. Her Dr. in NJ was going to do abraxane also...we went to the Cancer Treatment Center of America in Philidelphia, they decided to go the Taxol route with my mother. She had been on the Zometa for about 2 years now, but now they give it every 5-7 weeks for her. Her Cancer also spread to the liver, bone and lung. Good Luck to you!",

      "Content": "My mother had pleural effusion, they took out 2 liters of fluid, hers did contain cancer cells, they put the talc. She had to stay 2 days in hosp. with that surgery, they make 4 small incisions to access the area. They told her that the reason the fluid built up was b/c the actual cancer was blocking the tiny spaces that the fluid flows in and out of normally. She is now under going her second round of chemo at the CTCA in Philadelphia. First round was 11 years ago. The pain was not too bad with the surgery, she was sore but the pain pills helped. Her quality of life was very strained b/c of the shortness of breath, it was very bad.... now she can walk, and go up and down stairs, go to mall, and enjoy herself. Good luck to you! Cathy",

      "Content": "My mother gets taxol and carbo(something) in IV once a week for 3 weeks, then 1 week off, for six months, she is considered stage 4 now. Also ask your oncologist about Avastin in with the IV, she gets that on week 1 and week 3. A drug that stops the blood flow to the cancer cells. They also put a steroid and benadryl in the IV to help with the side effects of the chemo. Yours right abut the cancer in the lung being Br. Cancer, more treatable....Her prognosis is very good, b/c her cancer has not been exposed chemo in 11 years. The cancer center in Philly that we go to, also has her on some supplements to help with the neuropathy side effects, and the mouth sore side effects, they do alternative tx along with the traditional chemo. Do you go with your husband on the road?",
