    "Content": "I am so sorry to hear of your sister's cancer.  I too have breast cancer at the nipple and aereola. I have not had surgery and am using Protocel and much prayer support. My cancer has not changed size in 8 months, but I have closely followed the diet suggestions from the book: ANTICANCER: A New Way of Life. Daily I use a large quanity of raw cruciferous vegetables, and absolutely avoid sugar.  Perhaps these suggestions will help.",
