Only side effect is night sweats and hot flushes. Oncologist wants to put me on monthly zometa infusions. Having had a look at the side effects am not happy about bisphosforates in general. Have found out by googling that natural strontium citrate plus calcium and vit d can do the bone building just as well without side effects ( not strontium range late). Am fairly sure onc will try to put me off this route as its not a 'pharmaceutical' and I am now of the opinion that pharma companies do not create cures they create customers! Not once since my diagnosis has diet and nutrition been mentioned except to say eat what you like ! Is there anyone on cancer compass who can advise me. Do not want to sign up for monthly infusions if there's a more natural way.... Look forward to your comments I was diagnosed 1/07 with cancer - took Zometa until 3/12.  I wouldn't do it again.  My lower jaw deteriorated 1/3 from dental xrays taken over a 5 year period.  My front lower teeth are loose and may have to be pulled.  They said Zometa only affects some people but with the problems and dental bills I am having I would not take Zometa again.",
