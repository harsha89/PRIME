    "Content": "Hi, Yvonne, I know what you mean about every ache & pain scaring you. My mother heard about a blood test called AMAS which tells you if there is the presence of cancer in any part of your body. More information is available from Oncolabs. They will send you a free kit & tell you how to get the test. Most doctors have not heard of it, but I did some research on the Net & it is supposed to be very accurate. It will not tell you what kind of cancer is present, only that your body is making antibodies if it is present. I think it would be worth your while to look into it. Andrea",
