    "Content": "Hello. I usually post in the brain cancer section, since my mom had brain cancer. Recently, my aunt was asked to perform an breast ultrasound because of some irregularities in her mammomgram. She received the results of the ultrasound from a physician's assistant at her primary care doctor's office. The assistant said everything is normal. I, unfortunately, don't live in the same city as my aunt and was not able to accompany her to the appointment. The results of the ultrasound were as follows: \"FINDING The study shows pliable summation of normal fibroglandular parenchyma. There are no real nodularities masses, or pleomorphic cluster of microcalcifications. IMPRESSION; 1.   DIAGNOSTIC LEFT MAMMOGRAM UNREMARKABLE 2.  BI-RADS CATEGORY 1, NEGATIVE,  ROUTINE FOLLOWUP IS SUGGESTED. IMPRESSION;   1. Left breast 0.7X0.2 cem focal ductal ectasia with intraluminal 0.2 cm solid component or alteranatively an atypical complex cyst  Follow up of thhis lesion with a six months breast sonography to establish stability is recommended. 2. Bi-brads 3, probably benign need short-term followup.\" I am concerned about the \"probably benign\" remark on the last line. Should I encourage my aunt to get further follow-up? Have others here received similar results--only to find out later they had breast cancer? I really appreciate any comments or feedback. I already lost my mom, and I cannot afford to lose my aunt.",
