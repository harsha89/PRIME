      "Content": "Dear Sherlaud, Unfortunately, the numbness is often permanent. Some patients do get the feeling back in this area, but most do not. The reason for this numbness is that when the surgeons perform an axillary lymph node dissection, they may cut through a small sensory nerve that is responsible for sensation in exactly the area that you are feeling the numbness. I have had a few patients in whom the numbness resolves after a couple of years. This is most likely due to regeneration of the nerve, such that the two cut-ends of the nerve reconnect. So, there is a chance that your feeling will return. On an aside, I am a big proponent for having all of my patients who have undergone an axillary lymph node dissection to have an assessment for arm lymphedema. This condition is quite common and can be minimized if diagnosed early. Ask your primary care physician, oncologist or surgeon to place a referral to someone who can make this diagnosis. http://www.integrativeoncology-essentials.com/menu/topics/ly",

      "Content": "Dear Moonwalker, Aromatase inhibitors are well-known to cause hot flashes and joint/muscle aches & stiffness in a fair number of patients who take them. There are a variety of therapies that might be tried before discontinuing this class of medication (i.e. antidepressant medications, acupuncture, meditation, massage, etc.) I would discuss this with your oncologist. If these therapies are not effective for you, switching to a different aromatase inhibitor may be worth a trial to see if another may cause less symptoms. A recently updated study has also demonstrated that the use of a commonly prescribed medication for osteoporosis (Raloxifene) may be another option for decreasing your risk of recurrence. This medication is much more tolerable for many patients as it does not cause hot flashes or the muscle/joint pains & stiffness. Again, I would recommend discussing this with your oncologist.
