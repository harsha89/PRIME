      "Content": "Hi! I got my scan results today. I am flying so high I need big steel blocks to keep me grounded. There is no further spread of the cancer and the liver mets have shrunk. With good news I will continue the Xeloda sessions and monthly Pamitrogen infusions. If it comes to a point where the cancer is growing or spreading I will be like you and try alternative medicine. I love life and plan to hang on to it as long as I can enjoy it. God Bless and prayers for all.",

I am still able to do most things like drive and travel so life is good. I must say I do miss some of the things I can no longer do but am so grateful for each day I get. God has been so good to me. Keep your head held high and enjoy what time we have on earth, Joanne",

      "Content": "Thank you. I also have Stage 4 Breast cancer with mets to bones, lungs and liver. My Rx came last September for the bone mets liver and lungs in January this year. I had gamma nail implants to both femurs as the bone is so fragile. I am on Xeloda (2 week on 1 week off) and Pamitrogen infusions monthly. I have constant back pain but it is controlled with Morphine 10 m. Twice a day. I am able to enjoy life and am independent to date. I wish you all well and will look forward to hearing how the battle is going.",

      "Content": "Thanks! I'm another with the same story. Stage 3!in 2004 and had be lateral mastectomy, chemo and radiation.....then had 6 or 7 good years thinking I ad beat the demon. My back was giving me lots of pain last summer and I was treated with physio and acupuncture before finally getting the stage 4 dx. I have mets to bones, now lungs and liver. I have been on Xeloda and Pamitrogen since January. I am doing quite well and having scans on Tuesday. I will be nervously waiting the results. I just live each day thanking God for the bonus time I get. I have shrunk 3 inches in the past year or so due to spine involvement. I don't know what or I guess when life has in store so best just to make as good memories as I can for my family and friends. None of us asked for this miserable disease but we have to eat as healthy as possible, drink plenty of water and enjoy life even if it is slightly modified. Take care and prayer for all of you.",

      "Content": "Can you help me? You mentioned CSCI in your reply to me. I don't know what that means. Some of our treatments have different names or results are calibrated differently. I have shrunk 3\" in the past year or so my back is in pretty bad shape. It's the only place I have much pain. I feel like my spine is bubble pack and someone keeps bursting my bubbles. I didn't know any better so had bilateral mastectomies with lymph nodes removed so I deginately know what the Christmas turkey feels like. You get your scan results on July 3 and I get mine July 9 so I will be praying for hgood results for us both.",

      "Content": "Hi I am also stage 4 breast cancer gal and after stage 4 dx 14 months ago I am still on the green side of the grass. In 2004 I had bilateral mastectomies with many lymph nodes removed. I did TAC chemo and 28 rad. Treatments then. I was fine on Arimidex for 5 years then was taken off it. In May of 2011 had back pains and after being treated for possible disk problem I had an MRI which showed mets to bones especially spine and femurs. I had rads to spine for pain which didn't help then gnail implants to both femurs as legs were very fragile. In January 2012 was Dx'ed with mets to lungs and liver so went on Xeloda. I now have had some shrinkage of mets in liver and rest is stable. My doc lets me have 2 weeks off after Xeloda so I can go on holidays for 4 weeks. So far so good and still no expiration date on my foot. My back is still painful but with medication is tolerable. Best wishes for you on your journey....stay strong in spirit and the rest will fall in place.",
