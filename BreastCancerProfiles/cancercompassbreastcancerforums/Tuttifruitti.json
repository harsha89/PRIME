      "Content": "Please ensure you're doing whatever it takes to reduce estrogen in your diet if you will refrain from letrozole. My sister couldn't tolerate it either. We weren't sure if it was the injection for her bones since it's mets stage 4, or the letrozole . She complained of all her bones hurting her suddenly and was in pain. Very moody and cranky. Avoid soy, milk, and any phytoestrogens that mimic estrogen in your body, even nuts.",

      "Content": "No problem. Also, look up natural Aromatase Inhibitors or you can always talk to your doctor for alternatives to letrozole. Arimidex or aromasin are other alternatives that also block hormones. If you're in the US I would say to refrain from all meats and dairies as they inject hormones into all here in the US. Not sure about the UK, but avoid all creams , lotions, Makeup that have estrogen, and foods big on phytoestrogens. I try to tell my sister this all the time although it's hard here in the US because they use soy in everything!! So if you quit the medication that blocks hormones, please try to lower intake of hormones from foods or cosmetics. Also, eat lots of cruciferous veggies that block hormones as well. The best of luck to you and sending you hugs!",
