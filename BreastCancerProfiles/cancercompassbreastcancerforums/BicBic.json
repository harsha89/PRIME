      "Content": "I would opt for the biopsy.  I had a needle biopsy in my right breast that came back benign but several years later I needed another one in my left breast that came back positive for breast cancer.  Thankfully, it was detected early and with a lumpectomy and mammosite radiation I am now cancer free for 2 years now.  Early detection would be what I would want.  Hope this helps.",
