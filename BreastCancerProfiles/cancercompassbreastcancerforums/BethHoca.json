    "Content": "Hi, I am so happy to have found this site!  I had a small strage 2 lump removed last May and have been on Arimidix for eight months.  I'm a professor in Istanbul Turkey with a very stressful job, arrived here in September.  At first I seemed to be doing fine; I ascribed my difficulties to the stresses of living in Turkey.  But lately I have been having overwhelming fatigue, pain in my hands, constantly drenched in sweat. What has me worried the most is sudden spikes in my blood pressure, which will spike and cause me to faint.  Again, I thought this was stress, but now I think the Arimidex is contributing.  It's hard for me to find an English-speaking oncologist, and I was mailed the results of my first mammography written in Turkish! I AM going to book an appointment with an oncologist soon because of the concern over the blood pressure, which I know can be dangerous.  However, I am really reluctant to give up Arimidex; I'd rather scale way back on my career and get better medical care back in the states.  You see, I have a very strongly estrogen-positive type of breast cancer and have been told that Arimidex very effectively targets this type of cancer. I am told by my oncologist in the states that--if I can stay on the drug 5 years--I have a 94% chance of long term survival.  I am only 58 years old, and my two daughters really want me to stay around to be \"grandma\" eventually. I would rather put up with these side effects in a less stressful atmosphere than switch to a different drug. I'd be interested in hearing from others what sorts of remedies your stateside doctors have prescribed for the side effects I'm having.  I think I have found an English-speaking oncologist and want to be able to tell him what is usually done in the states. Thanks for any and all advice, Beth",
