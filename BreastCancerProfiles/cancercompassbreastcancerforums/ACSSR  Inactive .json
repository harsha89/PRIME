    "Content": "So sorry to hear of your mother's passing.  I was 50 when my mother died and did not realize how profoundly it had affected me.  One year after her death I became extremely ill and without thinking my first thought was I want my mama. Your heart will heal with time but you will always miss you mama.  Mothers are very special people.",
