      "Content": "I was on Letrozole/Femara for only 8 weeks and my oncologist took me off because the joint pain was so severe, it got to the point that I couldn't open doors, and the pain in my knees, ankles, and feet was unbearable.  At the 5 week mark I see the oncologist again and she couldn't believe that my joints were still so bad, the day I saw her my hand was swollen and I couldn't bend my thumb, index and middle fingers.  She referred me to a rheumatologist to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, before the medicine I had never had any of these pains/symptoms.  The rheumatologist said that I do not have RA but that I do have Osteoarthritis.  The rheumatologist says that she is seeing lots of women due to these meds and that in her experience it can take 6 months to get out of your system.  I have now been off for 11 weeks and I'm still having joint pain, mostly in the mornings, it has lessened and the top of my feet and knees aren't as bad. But I still wake up every morning with right hand swollen and stiff and it takes an hour or so before I can bend the fingers. Lately the joints in my fingers just ache quite a bit. I see the oncologist tomorrow and I know she is going to start me on one of the other AI's since I don't have RA.  I'm so torn, obviously if it keeps cancer from coming back I want to be on it, but if the joint pain gets worse again I don't think I can tolerate it.  I'm 52 and my joints feel like they're 92!",

      "Content": "I started Letrozole on June 1st, 2015 the first two weeks I was constantly nauseous.  Around the two week period the joint pain started in my knees, ankles, and feet.  After one month I woke during the night to severe pain in my right index finger. The joint pain got worse and worse in my hands, I met with the oncologist after two months and after explaining to her that I could barely use my right hand some days (and of course I'm right handed) and that the morning of my appt with her I could not open the front door of my house, both my hands bothered me that day, she said it was time to take me off of the letrozole, I agreed.  She gave me an appt in 5 weeks and at that time if the joint pain has subsided she will start me on one of the other AI's, and if I can't tolerate any of them she will prescribe Tamoxifen.  She stated that the joint pain should subside within two weeks, well I'm at the two week point and still wake up with achy, stiff fingers and my knees and feet still hurt quite a bit in the mornings. I'm wondering after being on for just two months how long it will take for the pain to go away? ",
