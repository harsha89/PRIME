    "Content": "Good day!  Thanks for taking a peek at my post:) After losing my mother to breast cancer 9 years ago, the fight against breast cancer has become an importan issue to me.  I'm in the process of writing a 2500 word magazine feature about the state of breast cancer fundraising and cause-marketing in Canada. I'm looking to talk with breast cancer survivors--or those who've had personal experience with the disease.  If you'd like to talk with me further, please email me at               --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
