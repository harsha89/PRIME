She lost most of her vision and has had a few vp shunt revisions due to infections or her filter clogging with cancer cells.  The most recent shunt surgery was two days ago where she had to have the shunt removed because it was infected.  She has not gotten any chemo in over a month because she was in the middle of being reevaluated (via PET, CT, etc.) to see if the methotrexate was working.  Her cell count was up. She currently has other complications as well. There is a lot of fluid in her lungs and her left side (neck and arm).  At this point, we are trying to make her comfortable by allevating the pain she is experiencing as the cancer has made it to the bone level.   ",
