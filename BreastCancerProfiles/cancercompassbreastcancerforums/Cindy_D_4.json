Nadine     I looked up the snopes report on the Johns Hopkins article. If it is the same one I read, it does not say that the information is false. It says that the origin is not Johns Hopkins. The information contained in the e-mail is very similar to the advice I am getting from a professional nutritionist (Phd) specializing in cancer and the nutritionists and naturopaths at my cancer center. I also have read several books that confirm much of the info - Anti-Cancer by Schrieber and Fighting Cancer with Nutrition by Quillan. I believe that what we eat does matter and that sugar is not good for our cancer. I'm glad that you are in remission and support your right to eat however you choose but to call the info \"stupid and false\" is misleading may be going too far. If it is different e-mail circulating than the one I read, then I apologize.  ",
