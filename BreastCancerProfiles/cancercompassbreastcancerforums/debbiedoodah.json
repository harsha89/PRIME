    "Content": "I had a left mastectomy for breast cancer with full clearance of axilliary lymph nodes in 2006.  Took Tamoxifen for 5yrs.  In 2008 I had a reconstruction done with an expandable implant.  On inflation was too high and had to be redone.  The second reconstruction was done with an advancement flap.  After 2yrs this had to be removed as it was causing a chest wall concavity. Following removal I had staphylococcal septicaemia and was very poorly.  I recently requested my medical notes and discovered that in 2008 on the first reconstruction they took out a very large piece of breast tissue (14cms x 9cms x 2.5cms).  I was never informed of this despite complaining of small pea like lumps in my armpit and questioning whether these were lymph nodes as I had supposed to have had a full clearance.  Then in 2012 after the implant was removed they apparently performed a completion mastectomy along with removal of implant again without my knowledge.  In between all of this deceit I have been having yearly mammograms to the right breast but no one has even suggested any investigation on the left side despite all of these findings.  I feel so hurt and let down by health care.  In 2012 when the implant was eventually removed the consultant dropped me from his care when I became seriously ill  because I had put a complaint in!  I am feeling desperately in need of some good advice.  Thanking you in anticipation. x",
