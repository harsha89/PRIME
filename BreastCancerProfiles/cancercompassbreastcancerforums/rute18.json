      "Content": "Thanks god and thanks to everyone who responded to my question but i did a couple exames like: blood exemps, etc.... Thanks god its nothing. My doctor said that it was normal and i dont have anything my blood level is normal and all the results came out positive. Now my doctor did gave me some intresting information about what might had caused this liquid coming out.   Witch is: irregular or no menstrual periods (amenorrhea), emotional or physical stress ( occasionally ), high-protein meals, intense breast stimulation, recent breast exam, and recent exercise. Now in the other paper he also gave me says that \" contractions of prolactin in blood rise in response to exercise, sleep, anxiety, hypoglycemia, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and nipple stimulation (suckling). So if anyone out there has this same problem you should be concern please visit a doctor asap because it could be normal but it also can be abnormal and you want to make sure everything is okay especially if your under 25 years old. Thank you everybody....  ",
