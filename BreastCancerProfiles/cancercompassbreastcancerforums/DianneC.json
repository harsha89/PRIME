    "Content": "Hi Everyone  I read with interest the various side effects you have experience taking Tomoxofin, femara and or aramasin.  Six years ago my mother was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer.  She has a mastectomy, two lymph nodes removed and chemo. For the next 5 years she took Tomoxofin and then the doctor prescribed Femara which she took up until 1 week ago.  For six weeks before Christmas 07 she had been complaining of severe neck pain, inability to eat, weakness and a general feeling of being unwell.  The doctor tested for several things, all with negatives results.  The neck pain was put down to her age 74 and disintegrated disks in her neck.  She got weaker and more unwell, experiencing bone pain in her legs, back, shoulders as well as her neck. Finally the doctor agree to admit her to hospital. Mum had more tests and the doctor thought some of her problems could have been caused by taking Femara.  Unfortunately after a complete bone scan (CT scan) and a bone marrow biopsy it was shown that her cancer was back and had moved to the bones as a secondary site.  The oncologist has prescribed her aramasin in an effort to contain the cancer from spreading.  He said that if after a month Mum shows no improvement in her well being or gets worst then they will do a type of Chemo which will hopefully contain the cancer and extend her time by how much he didn't know. Unfortunately once breast cancer like all primary cancers have spread to a secondary site (primarily to the bones for breast caner) then it can not be cured.  I went on the Internet to look up information about Aramasin and hence came across this site.  Since been taken off the Femara by the oncologist Mums neck pain and in fact all her skeletal pains have diminished if not disappeared.  I have noticed for the past 9 months she has been getting a little vaguer and not as active something that normally you would put down to her age.  But this is a woman who at 73 still mowed her yard, climbed on ladders to fix things and loved to walk.  Now she can only walk from the hospital bed to the bathroom.  She is coming home on the weekend and will be working to get her strength back. Good luck to all you ladies, thank you for letting me share this with you and for sharing your information for other to see and learn from.",
