    "Content": "Hello- My name is Henry i am 24yrs old. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, a biospy was completed with hormones pills being given to her. But no chemo or radiation was done. This past year she began having horrable headaches which worried my father, broher and I. After a few days in the hospital it was said to be Carcinoma Meningitis. She stayed at St, Joseph hospital. She was there for approx 3 months as her headaches got worse she began to lose her vision , doctors gave her no hope and less then weeks to survive. They recomended hospice service to us but my father brother and i and our immediate family did not want to give up hope. We took my mom to Glendale Advenstist where they inplanted a Omaya Reservoir, which helped her relieve pressure from her head/spine which helped with the Headaches. Now it is 2007 and she just turned 50 years old. She is completely blind and has lost hearing in her left ear. She is begining to helucinate, she thinks she see's people/things around her talking to her. The Omaya Reservoir was taken out due to a leak in the tubing. Doctors have no actual answer for all of our questions, they have no idea why her vision is lost or how to stop the headaches and helucinating. My father has been home for 8 months taking complete care of my loving mother. We have many unanswered questions that would like to have some help answering.If you know of anything that might be of help to us please respond. I thank you for taking the time to help.",
