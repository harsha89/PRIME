Sorry about your current situation. but saddened about statements that were leveled.  I have not worked in 7 months, but pay for COBRA which is extremely expensive.  As a SW in a hospital for over 24 years, your statements are totally incorrect.  Maybe that energy can be used to attempt to access assistance rather than exhibit misguided anger, and leveling false information.  Good luck in accessing assistance.",
