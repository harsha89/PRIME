    "Content": "  Hi, My name is Erin and I am a researcher at the University of Illinois. I am working to learn more about how people live through cancer.  I am in search of volunteers for a study about communication while experiencing breast cancer. If you are receiving treatment for breast cancer, or if you have completed treatment recently (within the past year or so), please consider participating. The study is an online questionnaire. You will be asked about your experience with cancer, your health, and your communication patterns with your spouse or partner. Feel free to contact me by private reply to learn more.  Thank you!    ",
