    "Content": "I know a couple people who have had treatment in Mexican clinics. One was stage 4 sarcoma (very aggressive) and although she is not cured, she's still alive after more than 5 years, which wasn't in her prognosis. The other just went through treatment at Oasis of Hope for MM and it is too soon to know results. Dr. Ralf Kleef in Austria is well regarded at his hyperthermia/immunotherapy clinic. I spent a month there, know several patients who are in remission from stage 4 cancers, but of course, not everyone has great response. I get scans today to see if it worked for me - I wasn't stage 4 yet, and hope I'm not now! But I think there is some validity to some of the treatments in integrative/alternative clinics. Many use natural therapies, hyperthermia (I think important aspect), but also use targeted chemo and radiation if needed plus diet. I think you have to do your research and the hardest part is getting hard data of survival on their patients. Many of these clinics deal mostly with stage 4 patients, so of course, those are much more challenging than early stage cancers. Good luck to you!Â ",
