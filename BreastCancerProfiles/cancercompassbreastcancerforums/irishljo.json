      "Content": "Hello, 3+ years ago, I noticed that my left nipple was leaking! I made an appointment to see a Doctor but I was told it was very common, I shouldn't be concerned, and I should return in one YEAR for a follow up! Right!!!! So, instead, I immediatly scheduled a consultation with a surgeon at a different hospital. The surgeon did an exploration of the breast and - whatdoya know - she found stage 1 breast cancer! We had recently lost my Aunt to BC, so I decided to be as pro-active as possible and have a double mascectomy. Good thing, as once the \"Tram Flap\" operation was over, the Doctor informed my family that it was stage 3a! Oh, and I had two types of BC - One that had the tendancy to spread and one that did not! I had complications and infections following surgery, and was hospitalized more than 15 times in the last 3 years. Because of this, I spend most of the time in bed in pain, take pain meds, and by the time I have recouperated from surgery and/or the infections cleared up, I'm back in the hospital! OK, I'll end this with good news: I am still in remission. I realize that is a blessing and I should be grateful. I just wish I could enjoy this time instead of spending most of it either in the hospital or in bed. I have one last operation in a few months. Hopefully, since I changed surgeons, there will be NO crazy complications * :0) * God Bless. ~Ljo *",

      "Content": "QUESTION: Has anyone had a bad experience with Arimidex? I have been on anti-depressants, anti-anxiety and pain meds for as long as I can remember (before the big \"C\", I had to have a hysterectomy. Before the big \"H\" I had ovarian cyst problems which also caused me to have to have a bunch of surgeries prior to the big \"H\") * If anyone has had bad experiences with PAXIL or ARIMIDEX (including stopping one or both abruptly) please advise what you went through and how you corrected the issue. * My Oncologist thought it would be a good idea if I stopped the Arimidex after being on it for almost 3 years, to see if any of my chronic pain would subside. I came close to taking my own life and it wasnt until I recieved a letter from the Arimidex supplier scolding me because I wasnt ordering the drug that I looked up side effects of abruptly stopping the drug. I should have known this - its common sense- but I didnt think about it because I trusted my Oncologist to know what was best! *OK, enough already, right? LOL! Thank you for your help.",
