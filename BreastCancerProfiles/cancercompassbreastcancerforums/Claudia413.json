      "Content": "BettyBoob, For your health's sake, I would google IBC (inflammatory breast cancer). That is what I have. You have several of the signs and symptoms of IBC; and if I were you, I would insist that your doctor rule out IBC by performing a biopsy.  Inflammatory breast cancer is highly aggressive, rare and usually does not show up on a routine mammogram (mine didn't).  Also, no doctor ever told me that you don't have to have a lump to have breast cancer, but it's true.  IBC usually has no lump. Please check out the signs and symptoms of IBC at ibcsupport.org and eraseibc.com.  A misdiagnosis can mean Stage IV rather than the \"normal\" IBC Stage IIIB.  You may not have IBC, but better safe than sorry.  My regular doctor wasn't even aware of IBC and most of the medical personnel I've seen over the last 18 months know very little about it.  Even the oncologist I went to said he would not have suspected IBC just looking at my breast.  I'm so glad that I screamed and hollered until I got the tests I need to either rule out IBC or confirm it as IBC (which it was) and got my treatment started.  With IBC you have chemo, then surgery, radiation and maybe more chemo.  If you have any questions, just ask.

I was told I simply have dense breasts and don't worry. Fast forward one year, started having breast pain in Dec. Waited two months, made appt wit doc, had another mammo, US and nothing once again. Four weeks ago, started having armpit pain and arm pain on same side as lump/breast pain. Went back to primary doc and was told I had a swollen lymph node and was referred to surgeon. Had appt. with surgeon, she said all diagnostic tests showed nothing, lymph node no longer swollen and the lump feels like just dense breast tissue. Said she could not explain armpit and arm pain. Recommended I take a gamma linolenci acid for 4 weeks and if pain persists to return and have possile MRI on shoulder to find out about armpit/arm pain. Surgeon said she would biopsy lump if I wanted but did not recommend a biopsy at this point. Has anyone here that has been diagnosed had these symptoms? Should I wait or go ahead and have the biopsy? One of the symptoms of Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is pain in the breast or armpit. Another sign is swollen lymph nodes in the armpit or above the collarbone. Since IBC is the most aggressive form of breast cancer, we (I am a 4-year survivor of IBC) always say, \"If in doubt, rule it out\", meaning rule out IBC first.  You can read about the signs and symptoms of IBC at www.eraseibc.com . It's always good to have a breast surgeon who is familiar with IBC. There are many doctors (like yours) who are not. The most definitive method is having biopsies on the breast. Most of the time there is no lump; therefore, the IBC won't show on a routine mammo, ultrasound or MRI. Do your research and get to one of the IBC clinics around the U.S. They are in at least 6 different states (TX, PA, NC, MA, MI and AZ are ones I can think of). With IBC you have chemo first, then surgery and rads, and maybe even more chemo after surgery or after rads. ",

In fact in Jan., I had a \"normal\" mammogram and ultrasound. BUT, I knew something was wrong because I had dimpling and an inverted nipple in one breast. I had pain in both breasts, and I had heard that breast cancer was not painful so I wasn't worried. Boy, was I wrong! Because of the dimpling and inverted nipple, they did an MRI.  I was shocked to find out that the one breast had a 4\" and a 1.5\" tumor - basically, my whole breast was full of the two tumors. It was estimated that I had the large tumor for 15-20 years. Later I was told that I had dense, fibrous breasts and that's why all of the mammograms were normal. Recently, I told my 40-yr old daughter to demand an MRI after her normal mammogram and ultrasound. It was discovered that she had a 1/2\" tumor! So, if you know of anyone that has been told they have dense, fibrous breast tissue, tell them to demand an MRI in order to get a much more accurate exam of their breasts. This could save thousands of lives a year! Carolyn Carolyn, You mentioned \" pain, dimpling and an inverted nipple\".  Were you ever told that you had Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) or were you told you had something else?  Those are some of the main symptoms of IBC, which I have, and I just wondered since you didn't mentioned IBC in your posting. Since IBC doesn't usually present itself with a lump and doesn't usually show up on a routine mammogram (you need a diagnostic mammogram which specifically looks for the nesting or sheeting of IBC), many times women are misdiagnosed. A biopsy is done to rule out IBC or to confirm the diagnosis. IBC is highly aggressive, can appear seemingly overnight, and is treated first with chemo, then surgery, and followed by radiation and maybe more chemo.  Women are always told to feel for lumps and get their annual mammos. They should also be told that there's a breast cancer that doesn't usually have a lump and that doesn't show on a routine mammo...that's IBC. If doctors would tell their patients to look for ANY changes in their breasts and to notify their doctors of those changes, it might save more lives. We also need to help educate the medical profession and the general public about the signs and symptoms of IBC and the importance of early detection and treatment.  That's been my mission since my diagnosis in August 2007.  To learn about the signs and symptoms of IBC, go to eraseibc.com and get information that can save lives.

Rett          Rett, Like you, I live in Broward County.  I have recently been diagnosed with IBC, inflammatory breast cancer.  Please check out ibcsupport.org and find out how important it is to IMMEDIATELY get a biopsy and a diagnosis if you do have IBC.  I hope and pray you don't.  However, the ibc support group is a wonderful bunch of people that I've come to love in a very short time.  They are so willing to help in so many ways. God bless you, my friend. Claudia  ",

So right now the right breast seems ok but I am now dealing with my left breast and removal of my port..... Thank you for your love and concern Rett   Rett, So far, I've only had my first chemo treatment (last Friday), and so far no problems at all.  I haven't had a port put in yet.  I have heard and read so much for it and so much against it.  Will wait for results of my bone scan (which I'm still waiting to have done) before I decide if I will have one put in or not.  My veins are small, roll a lot, and are hard to find. So, if I need more than the 4 chemo treatments prior to surgery, I may have one put in.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  I'm so sorry that you had such a hard time with your last treatment. It's pretty scary at times, isn't it? Hugs, Claudia  ",

There are women in my online support group who have been around for up to 17 years with IBC.  Protocol calls for treatment with chemotherapy, then mastectomy and then radiation and possibly more chemo.  I have finished radiation a few weeks ago and am taking Arimidex (oral pill) for 5 years. It does have some side effects (as you can see by some of the other messages), but it does help prevent recurrences.  Some of the signs and symptoms of IBC are rapid increase in breast size; redness, rash or blotchiness on the breast (this is only symptom I had), consistent pain and/or soreness of the breast; lump, or thickening or dimpling of the skin of the breast; warmth or tenderness of the breast; lymph node swelling under the arm or above the collarbone; flattening of the nipple or discharge from the nipple.  Most doctors want to treat you for mastitis with a course of antibiotics. If there is no response to the antibiotics within 5 days, you should immediately demand that IBC be ruled out since it is so highly aggressive. IBC lies in sheets or nests, not the usual lymp women are told to look for, thus rarely seen on routine mammograms.   I'll be glad to answer any other questions you may have. You might also want to check into the support group at www.ibcsupport.org.  It's a wonderful group of IBC survivors and caregivers who have the most wonderful knowledge and share it so freely.

I knew after reading and researching that I had either mastitis or IBC.  At age 65, I was pretty sure it was  probably IBC and not mastitis.  Yet, I was forced to go through two different 10-day antibiotic treatments since the doctor was pretty sure it was probably mastitis.  I finally got a diagnostic mammo, specifically looking for the \"sheeting or nesting\" of the tumors in IBC, and the report suggested I get a biopsy to rule out IBC.  In my case, it was to rule it in.  The surgeon did 4 separate biopsies on my breast and they confirmed the diagnosis of IBC. By early September, I was getting my first chemo treatment.  My last chemo was in March of 2008, followed by a right MRM in April and almost 7 weeks of daily radiation in June/July.  Every day now I take this tiny little white pill called Arimidex to hopefully keep the cancer from recurring.  Wicked side effects...oh yes; but if it works, I'll take it for a full 5 years.  It's now been almost a year since I saw my oncologist, and I will see him for my follow-up in August.  I have no idea if he'll order any tests or if I have to have a specific complaint to get any testing done.  My heartfelt thanks to all the wonderful people I've met through my association with ibcresearch.org.  They are the ones who educated me and now it's my mission to educate everyone I come in contact with every day, including the medical profession...especially the medical profession, I should say.  No one should be misdiagnosed or have their diagnosis delayed because their doctor isn't aware of the signs and symptoms of IBC.  Note:  I only had one symptom and was even told I didn't have enough of the symptoms to have IBC.  Yeah, right. Gotta educate these doctors and also make everyone aware of the signs and symptoms of IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer).",

I do consider myself lucky.  My hubby and I would go out to breakfast or lunch after I finished my treatments.  The only thing I can remember botherine me was the fact that I would want to take a nap some afternoons. I had chemo from Sept 2007 through Feb 2008. I had a right mastectomy this April, then had almost 7 weeks of radiation therapy. I only had some minor burning in the area above my collarbone. We had late afternoon or early evening appointments for radiation, so we usually went out to eat supper after my treatments.  Again, I consider myself lucky. The main problems I've had are from the Arimidex pill which I've been taking since March 2008.  I believe I've had every side effect I've ever seen listed by anyone at one time or another.  However, in spite of the joint pain, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting and other side effects from time to time, as long as it works I will continue taking it. Good luck with your treatment.  Keep laughing and thinking positive thoughts.  Claudia",

I'm on Arimidex (2+ yrs) and right after I was placed on it my hair started falling out and became much much thinner, particularly at the back of the crown and the front of the head. My solution to the hair problem was a human hair wig that clips to my hair.  No more bad hair days and thicker bangs than I'd ever had!  What I'd love to know from those who had this same problem is:  does the hair come in better once they quit the aromatase inhibitors? I'd like to know if the Arimidex I've been on for about 16 months is what is causing my hair to thin out.  It had come back in nice and thick after my chemo treatments, just like it was prior to cancer.  Now I notice that it's thinning out mainly in the front.  Hadn't given a thought to Arimidex maybe causing it.  I have enough side effects from it...gimme a break.",

I had chemo for 6 months (A/C then Taxotere), a right MRM, then almost 7 weeks of radiation.  Now I'm on Arimidex for 5 years.  My joints and bones are so stiff in the morning, but get better after I get going.  Luckily, I've got my husband in good health and he has been by my side through all of this.  He just retired last weekend and can now take me to all my appointments for follow-up testing without having to take time off work.   The other side effects I have from Arimidex are weight gain, sleeplessness and hot flashes every now and then.  The weight gain I hate, the aching joints and bones I can tolerate, the sleeplessness gets to me at times, and I'm just glad that I can nap whenever I want.   Many women I've talked to had horrible reactions during chemo...not me.  Others had problems during radiation...I just got burned badly in one area near the collarbone.  I feel I have been very lucky throughout all my treatments during this past year.  Now I am waiting to have tests to see how I'm doing after all this treatment. I'm hoping to be NED (no evidence of disease or no expiration date).  I try to stay positive and actually hand out a \"Laugh of the Day Award\" to someone who sent me the funniest email each day.  I let all my friends and family know I need to have something to laugh about each day. My online support group at www.ibcsupport.org is a group of women with IBC and some caregivers. They are very knowledgeable and glad to share that knowledge with all of us.  You can search the archives there on many topics and ask a question of the group any time. I would also be happy to answer any questions you may have, if I can. Hugs, Claudia in FL   ",

I am really scared because I have read that it is the worst of all breast cancers to get because it is so aggressive. I am to get a port put in my chest 3-24 so I can begin chemo. I see my cancer specialist on 3-23. So far I have only had the mammograms,sonograms, and biopsy done. the biopsy came back malignant and the doctor told me I have IBC. I knew it anyway from my symtoms, but it sure hit me like a ton of bricks anyway when the doctor told me and it made it \"REAL\" if you can imagine. Anyway, I am very worried how I'm going to do on chemo. I have chronic lyme disease already and have FMS also, I know, lucky me, haha! I would really welcome any advise you can offer me! Your friend, Kellyann Kellyann, I know exactly what you're going through since I was diagnosed with IBC in August 2007.  Luckily, I breezed through my chemo treatment, and I certainly hope you do the same.  I took a styrofoam cup full of ice chips with me to each treatment and sucked on those during the treatment.  I felt good enough after each treatment that my hubby and I went out to eat breakfast afterwards.  Not everyone feels that good, but I'm thankful that I did.  You can read the archives at ibcsupport.org to get an idea of what others with IBC went through at each stage of treatment.  There is a lot of info at that site and at eraseibc.com.  If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them if I can.  Claudia in Florida",

I cant take any more cancer or chemo, the chemo almost killed me, I stayed in bed 21 days with treatments, could not get out of bed so weak. Is there any treatment that would help oxygenate my tissue presurgery, i.e. hyperbaric treatment for a few months before surgery to help me, I simply have to have this elective mastectomy before it is too late.  I have never had metastasis..   I was stunned for him to say that.   What can I do to help myself rather than stay home and wait to die? I was cured of lung cancer.I feel well, really well.   I am 70.   When you said inverted nipple and cancer not showing up on tests, my mind jumped to IBC (inflammatory breast cancer), which is what I have.  IBC is highly aggressive and is treated differently than most breast cancers (chemo first to reduce the tumor size, then surgery followed by radiation and possibly more chemo).  Please check out the signs and symptoms of IBC, mention this to your doctor, and beg him to rule out IBC with a biopsy.  You may save your life.  There are also other causes for an inverted nipple, but please have your doctor rule out IBC first.  My doctor insisted that I be treated for mastitis with two 10-day treatments of antibiotics even though I was 65 years of age.  I kept insisting that I get a biopsy since I felt I wasn't a candidate for mastitis (usually found in young nursing women), and finally I got one.  The biopsy showed that I did have IBC and treatment was started within a week.  Many doctors do not know about IBC and have never seen a case of IBC because it is rare.  It is very commonly misdiagnosed as mastitis. A misdiagnosis can be a death sentence if the cancer spreads. It is either stage IIIB or IIIC when diagnosed.  If it's spread to other organs, it's stage IV.  I now try to educate people in the medical profession, not just doctors, about IBC.  I also try to educate the general population so they will know the signs and symptoms of IBC. You don't have to have a lump to have breast cancer, and there is a breast cancer that doesn't show up on a routine mammo.  I don't know of any doctor who tells you this.  All they say is feel for lumps and have your mammograms.  They should be saying to check for ANY changes in your breasts and notify your doctor of them. ",
