      "Content": "I am a 4 yr. breast cancer survior. My sister-in-law was diagnosised with metaplastic breast cancer in Jan 2008. I found this site tonight and there were discussions of women who have or have had the same. Her prognosis is not good and I see from the conversations that lots of women who are doing well have had Chemo and radition. I am trying to find out where some of you who are having success with this cancer are being treated. I have contacted one well known cancer center and they said they would look at her records and see if there was anything they could do to help but her oncologist said there was nothing that could be done. I am grasping at straws but I want to help her. I believe another set of eyes may help. She believes in her dr. but I see conversations where people are living and recovering from this and I want her to have a chance at help if something else can be done. If anyone will give me the name of  where they were treated for metaplastic breast cancer with good results I would be forever grateful.",

      "Content": "Chris thanks so much for responding. She was diagnosed in July 2007 and at first they said it was invasive ductle?? carcinoma. She had double a mastectomy in Aug 2007 and was going through chemo when she discovered a lump below her reconstruction in Jan 2008. They biopsed that lump and said it was metplastic. When they did a pet skan it was everywhere hip,ribs, lungs now liver and chest wall. I just do not understand how they missed it being metaplastic at the first. I guess there is so much I do not know about metaplastic cancer but in reading the message board many have had good results with this kind of cancer. I just want her to have any and all help that is available for her to live. MAybe I want to much. Thanks again for writing. Gayle Cooper",

      "Content": " Diane thanks for responding. I live in Tifton GA  and mysister-in-law lives in Goose Creek SC. I just think if you are not getting better a second opion can not hurt. I an glad you are doing well she had chemo but never radiation. In reading the message board it seems like most of those with metaplastic cancer had radiation. I could be wrong and maybe those are just the ones who have posted messages. I wish you only the best. I am a 4 year survivor of lobular breast cancer and did not have to have chemo or radiation.",
