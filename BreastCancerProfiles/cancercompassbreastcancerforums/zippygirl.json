    "Content": "Can anyone tell me the SPECIFIC names of the facilities in the US to seek treatment for Iscar??  I have just discovered a lump in my armpit area & having an ultrasound today. From what I understand there are many benefits of using Iscar. Can I use it in such an early stage?  Can it be used in conjunction with the Apricot kernals products?? I read people swear by the Apricot therapies too. Anyone tried them??? I am scared - big time! zippygirl",
