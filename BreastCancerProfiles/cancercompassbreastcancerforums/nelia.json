      "Content": "I've been on Aromasin for almost 6 month and only in the last two weeks I am starting to feel pain in my joints. Especially in the morning when I get up. Is there anything that may help? Yoga? Also in the last two weeks I noticed that my hair got very thin...I always had a lot and strong hair, but I must have lost half of my hair in the front...and this in two weeks time. In the back they still feel OK. Are those side effects getting worse? Does the hair grow back? I could tolerate being bold through the chemo, but now loosing all this hair again is difficult to cope with. Anybody out there having some answers?",

      "Content": "I finished chemo 1 1/2 year ago and I have chronic neuropathy in my feet caused by taxol. After seeing a neurologist for more than a year and little help, I switched to the pain clinic. My present doctor has managed the pain much better, although I can still not walk more than 20 Min. I take Neurotin, Tramadol and Venlafaxine for the pain and Aromasin for the cancer not to return. I have 2 small children and I am pretty much in despair about the chronic foot pain. Sometimes it gets so bad I can barely walk around in the apartment. I used to be a very energetic person, very active, always traveling, but now I feel very vulnerable and isolated. I barely go out and I cannot imagine to grow old like this. The kids is really the only thing that keeps me going. Has anybody found a method to help chronic neuropathy in the feet?",

      "Content": "Thank you Gayle for the tip. I'll talk to my doctors about it. I do have to keep my feet warm and soft all the time, but it sounds like you have it worse then me. What really made a difference is when I got special insoles for the shoes, prescribed by a foot doctor I consulted. They take the weight of the front of the foot. This really helps a lot.",
