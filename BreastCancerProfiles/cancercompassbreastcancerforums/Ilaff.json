Thanks in advance NL     I had a bilateral mastechtomy in 2006.  I was glad to be rid of the too large breasts that had been my enemies practically all my life.  I don't advocate for lumpectomy or mastectomy, it is strictly a personal choice.  It also depends on the type of cancer.  I made my decision based on lowering my percentage by as much as possible.  Each treatment lowered the percentage until it was down to around %7.  Good enough for me...I am 57 years old (not too old...not too young)  I think age has something to do with a decision like this .  I have never seen this up for discussion before: when you lose your breasts, you lose your nipples and it can be bothersome in the sex department-depending ...I found it to be something I had not thought of and no one told me...just a thought.  Your health is the main thing so My ultimate decision was with recurrance in mind.  I did have some cancer in the nodes (I waited too long) and so they told me the cancer \"got loose\" in my body.  I refuse to believe that cancer could live through chemo x8  and radiation x33.  Ask your docs to map out all your options and have someone with you who can write this all down for discussion later.  I wish  you the best and hope to hear you are doing great!",

She has breast cancer, liver cancer, lesions in her lungs and two spots on her rib bone. This whole thing has been a huge train running through my families lives and especially my moms. My mom is (57)years old and is one of the strongest people i know and it was deffiently a hard thing to watch her grow more and more dependant on my father sister and I. I really have lost alot of faith in pretty much anything and everything and i feel myself everyday getting more and more mad about this situation. My sister (33) on the other hand has become more faithful to certain things and knows there is something beyond this. Not to long ago my mom asked to stop the chemo and wanted hospice to come in and take over. That is not easy to hear. But as a family we had to respect moms wishes and at least meet with some people and get a plan together. Now we have been with hospice for almost three weeks and i will say that we have had our ups and downs. She once got over medicated and was completely zoned out so we had to stop that certain medicine, but on the other hand my mom can get the built up stomach fluid (due to her liver not functioning correctly) drained in the comforts of home. I know a lot of people my age,19, that have lost a parent to cancer, and honestly ontil now i cant imagine how they did it. I dont really have advice nor do i have something witty or eye opening to say, but just that everynight you dont sleep and every sick pain in your stomach dont hide it and dont hide what you feel make sure you live each day doesnt have to be to the fullest but make sure you live. I'm so sorry for you.  I lost a parent when I was 21 and it sucks.  You are too young for this.  If I had it to do over I would've asked a lot of questions stuff  you need to know.  Maybe you can write some stuff down..with her for her and about her.  Make recordings that are silly and encouraging because with all the high tech ways we have to memorialize someone ,,,it can be there for you as needed.  Perhaps you could initiate a letter (if she is able to write back) and see how you are alike and find that she is so deeply ingrained in you..you will never really be without her.  I want to hug you from here.  I am also 57 and a mom.  I'm sending these ideas as encouragement to you.  I hope it helps.",

Did any of you find a lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound but turned out to be malignant? I found a pea size lump 2 weeks ago and went to my gyno. He also felt it and sent me for a diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound. The tech, AND the radiologist could feel it but could see nothing on the ultrasound. I was relieved at first but now I'm wondering if I should still worry. My thyroid cancer was found as a fluke so I'm a little skeptical. Any advise is appreciated!   I was dignosed with stage 4 cancer one month after a clean mammogram.  The physical check  was cause enough for a breast MRI, an ultrasound and a needle biopsy.  If you have any doubts about anything go see your primary... Your doc knows how hard it is for us to believe we are well.  Your intuition will guide you.  Pay attention to any changes and report them to the docs.  I have survieved for 2 years and it has only been recently that I have let down a  enough to enjoy my life, rather than wonder about things that could be easily answered.  Sometimes, the answer arrives via intuition.  It truely is on a need to know basis.  YOU NEED TO KNOW!  As I look back to pre-cancer, my dog was very interested in that area where the tumor was located.   I found that to be an interesting.  YES, find the answer that satisfies you.  Good luck and Godspeed on those answers. Take care of yourself and be pro-active in your search for health.",

Thanks Leeanne   hI, I had a clean mammogram in April, 2006.  In May of 2006, I was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer.  My thought was that all the previous mammograms had missed this for years.  Since you have already had issues (surgery) you must be considered high risk.  I would ask for a breast MRI.  Insist that you are still having pain and need to know.  Insurance has to pay if ordered by your doc.  Get your doc to see it this way so you can have peace of mind.  When I survived, I knew this was to be my message: DO NOT TRUST YOUR MAMMOGRAM warmest wishes.",
