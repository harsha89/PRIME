    "Content": "Megan, Pick up the phone TODAY and call for an appointment.  There is no reason to wait, especially given your family history.  We want the best for you. I know it's scary, but as you know, cancer is more treatable the earlier it is found.  And waiting is terrible, so why not find out now.  That way you'll have information and can deal with what is. Be brave, friend, and just do it.  Keep us up-to-date.  We all support you. Best, Maggie",
