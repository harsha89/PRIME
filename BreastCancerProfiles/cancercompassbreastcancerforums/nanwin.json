      "Content": "Hi Lisa, I feel for you for I too am in the same place, I am 50 and after 28 years my husband left after the breast  cancer. He stayed through it until 1 year he likes to tell everyone how he stayed by my side thru it but not many know he was never home during it all. He could not handle the attention for one thing that I was getting and it made him mad I was sick .I was diagnoisedi n 2005 and the one great thing I can say about all of this especially him leaving is I have been able to return to God and I do thank him for that and that has been my saving grace for this time. I will keep you in my prayers  be strong. I am a very positive person so if you need to vent or chat email me njwinfrey@yahoo.com   Nancy",

Please go back and demand tests  maybe a mri or cat, my friend just diagnosed with mastitis and ended up in the er with an unrelated problem a staff infection on her leg then the er Dr. saw her breast and said lets test an she has IBC and extremly bad. please I understand thats a  problem is the miss diagnoises.  please let me know your ok  ",
