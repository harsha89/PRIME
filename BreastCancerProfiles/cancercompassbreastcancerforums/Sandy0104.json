I pray for good results and for peace whatever the results.",

For me, the worst part is getting the IV started.  I did not have a port during chemo, so my veins are not the best.  The noise, if you anticipate it, is not too bad and I have very sensitive hearing.  One thing I would like to pass along from my GYN (the prescribing doctor.)  He indicated, when we first started MRI's, that they have a higher than normal incidence of false positives on dense breast tissue due to the high detail they reveal.  He told me this so if a biopsy was called for, I'd not automatically panic.  I've had 4 biopsies since 2005 as a result of MRI or mammo images and do I still have a case of the nerves til results are known?  You betcha! Good luck and try and stay calm.",

      "Content": "Nine years after lumpectomy and 4 later biopsies, I can recommend the Champion front zip sports bra.  After all biopsies, they even recommend a compression bra to ease the discomfort of \"jiggling.\"  (I'm a 36C-D)  The zipper is very easy to deal with, more so than the hook-type, I think. You're also going to want to probably ditch underwire bras.  Depending on the lympectomy site and how many lymph nodes are taken, you may find underwires uncomfortable. There is one fact I'd like to make you, and any other BC radiation patients aware of.  Certainly if you're a larger breast size, you want to always wear a really good sports bra when exercising. Radiation changes the muscle/ligament structure in your breast, making it easier to strain those muscles.  The first time it happened to me, it scared me til I learned it's another of those \"oh, didn't we tell you that\" facts the doctors neglect to mention. Holding you up in prayer for best results!    ",

During the 5 years I took Armidex, I had no side effects:  no weight gain, no loss of bone density and no ill effects.  Though I continue to have good density, I am now a multi-joint arthritis sufferer - just had my right hip replaced in Nov. (But, I'd fallen in 2002 and was warned it was likely I'd develop arthritis in that joint due to the severity of the fall.)  Do I think Armidex contributed to my arthritis - possibly.  Would I take it now realizing that my multi-joint arthritis may be due to the Arimidex - yes.  I took it for the same reason I elected to do chemo - I wanted the very best chances of survival. Best of luck to you, Sandy",
