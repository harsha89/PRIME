    "Content": "Hi, I am a surviver of 2 years TNBC, stage 4, grade 3, 6.5 c tumor, metastatic.  It had spread to a couple of nodes and I had a spot in my lower neck.  I recieved neoadjuvant treatment of 4 every other week A/C and 12 weekly taxol.  Complete mesectomy.  They said after surgery, I had a full response. Then went on to radiation. What a bear! My question is this.  I have had no test since my initial diagnosis.  My doctors say I will know if it comes back. Is this the regular course of treatment? Driving me crazy. ",
