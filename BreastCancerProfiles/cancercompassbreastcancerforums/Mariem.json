      "Content": "Having cancer in your lymph nodes does not mean it has already spread to other organs, but it could spread through the lymphatic system. Yes, you can still be cured. I had seriously inflammed and cancerous lymph nodes a few months ago, but chemo treatments have worked wonderfully. I expect to be \"cured\" by the end of radiation treatments. The sentinel node is the first node that breat lymphatics drain to, so they remove that one first and then if it's positive, they want to remove as many as they can find. These should have been sent to pathology and you should get a report from your doc as to exactly how many nodes contained cancer. Make sure you doctor explains all this to you fully, the good docs aren't intimidated by questions!",

      "Content": "I am in treatment for stage iv (\"early\" stage iv, no organ or bone mets) and the surgeon in the group I am seeing does not want to do a mastectomy. I have had great results from chemo, and am 1/3 through the radiation process, but I'm concerned about recurrence if I don't have a mastectomy. Has anyone else tried this treatment plan? Chemo and rads w/o surgery?",
