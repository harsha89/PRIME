    "Content": "I am new to this site and I have been tested for ovarian cancer and was found not have it after many 'scarey' months of testing, both my biological parents have had cancer, one prostrate the other breast, since the scare I now have to get tested every two years which is stressful but I know its nothing to complain about.Â  I have met each of my biological parents only once so there is no advice or help from them but I heard that maple syrup has very strong properties that help with cancer and/or helps prevents cancer, so I ordered pure organic maple syrup and am sitting here looking at it, but not sure one, is it truly helpful? and two how does one use it to be effective? Does one take a spoonful a day, or three times a day, use it to replace all sugar in the home and that suffices?",
