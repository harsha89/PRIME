I saw the pictures, it gets like a pancake!!!  I wanted to know who was the person how invented mammography. Certainly is NOT a woman. Shouldn't someone find an easer way? Now they did find it, but there are a lot of studies and a lot of bureaucracy to go through yet. Hope they get it out there faster, I need to start screening my breasts! http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/pr/current_research/Cone_Beam/ It probably WAS invented by a man. But if men had to put their balls in that thing to test for Testicular Cancer, they'd soon come up with something different! ",
