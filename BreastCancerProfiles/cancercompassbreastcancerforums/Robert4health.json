I still have to get chemo. 4 rounds over 12 weeks of cytoxyn and tamofere. I am more petrified of the chemo than i was of the surgery. I dont want to loose my hair but i know thats not AN OPTION. I have no idea what to excpect, other than what the doctors are telling me, Im a wreck. Please any info will help. I am getting my first round of chemo this Monday wich is also my 45th bday ughhh..l  thanks   Liza - I feel for you. You want answers and an alternative solution that will help you to beat this cancer. All cancers have one thing in common and that is FREE Radicals GONE WILD - Dr McCord spent 40 years researching antioxidants and just a few years ago he was able to brake the Oxidative Stress Code. Many people are using his formula with great results. Take a few minutes and listen this cancer recovery testimonies with Dr Marvin 1-559-546-1799 pass code 200765# then referrence code 10# Also here is an online video that will tell you more about Dr McCord and his research with Tumors. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm9oZ3s8a38 - Bottom line is that cancer cells feed on free radicals and Dr McCord's formula has 4 patents and 11 peer reviewed reports to vaildate its effectiveness. I will add you to our prayer list and pray for your speedy recovery.",
