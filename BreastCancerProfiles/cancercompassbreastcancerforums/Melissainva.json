    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with colon cancer in November and had surgery. The colon became infected in January and she nearly died in the ICU. She was just diagnosed with breast cancer and found out yesterday she would need to have chemo in addition to the radiation she had planned on. She is very upset about losing her hair. Does anyone have an average sized wig in a medium to dark brown they are willing to donate? This will be a long road and I want to do everything I can possible to make it easier for her. Thanks to all!",
