    "Content": "Hi all, My mom has been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer.  She has mets in abdomen, liver and lung fluid build up.  She is also 25% ER positive.  Her physician is starting her off with q3wkly adriamycin + Taxotere.  After 3 rounds, she will continue onto hormonal therapy.  My question to you - does this course of treatment sound right?  She is being treated in India so I don't have as much access to her physician as normally (I visit but live in the US).  Can she still take hormones after anthracycline therapy?  The sequencing of options is confusing to me.  I am glad there are multiple treatments but want to know whether it is possible to \"reduce\" access to hormones by sequencing inappropriately.  Thank you so much.  God bless all of you and hang in there.  ",
