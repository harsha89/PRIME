    "Content": "I had my annual mamo 10/05, then an ultrasound, than a biopsy and there was positive small cancer estrogen/progesterine receptive.  The surgeon ordered a MRI to check the other breast.  They found another cancer in the same breast very small.  They suggested a mastectomy.  I went to the Norris Cancer at USC for a second opinon.  Took my slides, x-rays etc.  The surgeon there agreed.  They all said they were very small and I had time to think it over.  Also at USC they did a biopsy of another questionalbe spot on my other breast.  Found a small insitu spot and now suggested double mastectomy.  I had been a Prempro user for about 10 years to ease the symtoms of menopause.  I quit taking it immediately  after the first mamogram.  I then saw an oncologist, and he also said I had time to watch them if I was not ready to get the surgery.  So I waited 4 months and had another ultrasound.  They could see the same areas and they appeared to be much smaller.  They then ordered an MRI and the conclusion was that the lesions were in fact almost gone.  I have had three MRI since then and they can't find anything there.  They can see the markers that were placed there during my biopsies, but all clear.  I am very happy and feeling very good.  I have good medical care with the same oncologist.  He has tried to present my case at the tumor board, (which is made up of mostly surgeons) and they don't want to here my story.  Please give my your take on all this.",
