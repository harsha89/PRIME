    "Content": "Hi!  I have been taking zoladex injections for about 18 months along with Arimidex.  My last blood work showed that my estrogen level was too high, where previously everything looked good.  My oncologist had me repeat the blood work and I am still waiting for the results.  Does Zoladex stop working after awhile?  I am also curious about whether it could be related to my weight loss.  I've lost 60 lbs over the last 8 months.  I know that estrogen is stored in fat.  Could the weight loss in effect turned the estrogen \"free\" and is now being picked up on the blood testing.  If so, what can I do?",
