    "Content": "Hello ladies It is so important to talk to other women about female issues.  I have been struggling over almost 2 years with yeast infections after intercourse.  My gyn has not an answer for me, just continued to recommend ky or vaseline for lubrication and prevent the friction.  However, not once was there a connection made with the cancer treatment, having cancer or going through menopause due to chemo. In am also on Tamoxifen.  My fiance in conversation with a co-worker found out that an item called \"evening primrose\" helps with hot flashs and sleeping at night.  I shared the info with anothr women at my job who was experiencing hot flashes and  she shared with me that her gyn told her about it and it helps with the vaginal dryness she experiences. A light bulb went off connecting everything, which is what led me to this webpage.  I am going to my nutritionist this week as well as my oncologist to consult.  I will also be looking for a new gyn.  I look forward to learning from you guys as well as sharing anything I may know.  ",
