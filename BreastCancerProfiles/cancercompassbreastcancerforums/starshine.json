Chemo and Armidex was working it killied the tumours so it seemed but another spot appeared on the lining of my lung so they put me on Avastin and Aromasin and I have been getting Avastin every two weeks since January of this year. I am due for new scans soon to see if it is working. Ask your doctor kudos to all who are going beyond conventional  medicine and LIVING with cancer.  I highly recommend the book \"getting well again\" by Karl simonton.  It changed my life, and is a short, easy read.  Starshine about Avastin treatment it is supposed to be a very good new drug. toMy daughter has stage 1V breast cancer after chemo, lumpectomy with 21 negative lymph nodes dissection and a 2-cm tumor removed.  ep-postive Her 2 receptor negative. She had radiation after.  She was cancer free for 3 years and then it was discovered as she was having tumor marker test every three months.  Since then, she has had the iv vitamin infusions, 3, in New Jersery and then we found a place here.  She has been taking it once a week.  In October, 2006, she entered into a trail with Abraxine and Avastin.  It was not know whether she was getting the avastin, but from her symptoms, we thought not.  She would have scans every six weeks.  Because of neuropoty in the feet, she recently elected to stop the abraxine and went out of the study.  Prior to that decision, she took 30 days off and went to Europe in which she had a great time.  I forgot to mention that she took tamoxifen for the three years up until the time she was diagnosed again.  It had awful side efects with extreme weight gain, depression, and nausea. I beleieve it did her system more harm than good.  This time she has changed her diet, but is still somewhat over weight.  She takes numerous vitamins.  She will be having scans again and they are trying to get her to take another drug that will supress harmones, but I am afraid that it will put her into the situation she had with tamoxefin.  The last scans she had, the nodes in her lungs, 4 of which had disappeared with the largest, almost gone.  I am so encouraged to hear how long you have lived because I believe that she can do it, but not with chemo and just conventional medicine.  No one seems to care what you eat, what your akline level is, nor anything even though they know that they only speak of months to live and not years with the treatment available. I am more the one that looks for everything and she is more the one to do as the doctor request.  Sometimes I make her mad and I admit to stepping over the line since it is her life.  On the first time around, I was not actively involved as she is independent, but this time, I feel it is our last chance and that you have to fight, study, believe, and be actiive in the choices that are available.      Kudos",

It's a good thing to do as a general rule, but in your case, it sounds like your original health care providers are not on the ball-doing the wrong breast, not communicating with you, and not respecting your emotional needs as you move through your treatment. As Sherryingeorgia wrote to you, you should never go to an appointment alone; you need morale support, (we all do!) and you are in such shock and dismay that it's very easy to miss things the doctor says. I have a friend who goes to every appt. with me, takes notes in a notebook, and questions the doc about things I forget to ask. Before each appt. we make a list of concerns and questions, so that nothing is forgotten. And she's right there when I need a shoulder to cry on. At the same time I agree on getting a second opinion, try not to wait any longer than necessary to remove the cancer. You don't want to deal with it spreading, so the sooner you find a doc you trust and get started, the better your outcomes will be. I don't know what part of the country you're in, but in my area, The Cancer Center, City of Hope, UCLA Medical Center and Cancer Centers of America are the best places I know of-and they all treated me as a person with feelings and ideas, not just a body to deal with.

A support group can really help-a cancer center or medical facility in your town shoul be able to put you in touch with one.  They aren't all the same, so if you don't care for a group after the first 2-3 times, try a different groups, until you find one where you are understood and supported.  Also, find a good counselor who's experienced with cancer issues.  When I got my diagnosis, I was in shock and denial, and for a while just drifted through treatment.  Then I read Peace, love and Healing (I think that's the title) by Bernie Siegal, and it made me do an about face.  I realized I'd been waiting around to die, instead of taking action to live.  I highly recommend the book. Finally, since I don't want to overwhelm you, be aware that there are lots of complementary treatments that help with side effects and increase positive outcomes of traditional medicine.  Reiki, herbs, meditation and visualization, and nutritional therapy have all helped me a lot.  Everyone's different, so try things out and see what helps you. You sound like a great person who's had an unusually rough time-I hope it gets better for you.  Write back and let me know how you're doing, starshine  ",
