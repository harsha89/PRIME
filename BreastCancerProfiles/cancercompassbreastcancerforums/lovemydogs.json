    "Content": "Hi, My name is Charlene and I was on Arimidex for almost a year, my joints and legs hurt me so bad sometimes I had a hard time walking and even getting up from a sitting position. My Dr. put me on Aromsain about 21/2 months ago and today my hands starting hurting me so badÂ I can hardly pick anything up. I have started aching all over, my Dr. said that there are very few side effects, then I started reading up on the medication and there are a lot of side effects. Do you take the awful chance of getting cancer again or do you hurt and ache to the point you just feel like never getting out of bed. I want more in life than either of these choices. I guess I will call my Dr. back this, even though I was just in his office last week and wasn't having any pain then. I just wanted to respond to everyone there seems to be a lot more side effects than we are being told about. Charlene",
