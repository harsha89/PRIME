      "Content": "Hi,  I have stage 4 pancratic cancer....the chemo threw me into menapause no more period but all of the extra's that go along with it plus the added HOT FLASHES....OH SO HOT, AND THE NIGHT SWEATS OMG.  I spoke with my gyn and she advised me to go to the health fool store and by \"EVENING PRIMROSE\" , when I started them I was taking 6 gel caps per day now I take only 3 per day.  After about 5 days after I began them I notices that the flashes were on little sparks and I was still having night sweats but it was not like sleeping on the beach.  I have been using  Evening Primrose for 2 months now and I can not believe the difference in my life.  I had approched this treatment with a what do I have to loose attitude, and now I recommend it to all of my middle aged friends, cancer vic or not.  I have become the best friend to the hot flash/night sweat sufferer.  I hope this helps you, Evening Primrose is very inexpensive, down right cheap...........And oh the benifits.
