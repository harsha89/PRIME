      "Content": "I had a double mastectomy with reconstruction on Jan. 17, 2012.  Still have pain under both arms and across the right side of my chest.  The pain is not constant, but often enough that it disrupts my life sometimes.  I take no meds for this...hallucinations are not fun. Gabepentin and Neurotin make me want to jump off a bridge!  Narcotics make me sick to my stomach or hallucinate.  I've tried the patches, warm showers, cold showers, acupuncture, massage...ugh!  This is so frustrating.  My breast surgeon, oncologist and plastic surgeon all think that \"it can't be that bad\".  Most days it isn't, but when the pain does get to a level that you are sweating, that truly is a problem. Wish that I had been warned about this from the start. The perpetual numbness, but hypersensetive to touch. The dull ach that turns into full blown \"holy s**t\" pain in a matter of minutes. MRI shows nothing, neither does an ultra sound.   I try to put this into perspective: If I didn't have the double mastectomy, I would probably be gone by now. I suppose some pain is not the end of the world, but why do we (collectively...breast cancer survivors) have to have any pain....haven't we been through enough????",

      "Content": "Thanks!  I will ask about it.  I don't believe in pain either, but I have such a bad reaction to most meds.  Every time I do take something I never read the side effects until weird things start to happen!!! Is Cymbalta something that you take long-term?",
