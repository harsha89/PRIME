    "Content": "I searched many sites before finding this one.  I am 9 years out from a 1.2 cm lump in right breast, which was found to be CA positive with microscopic tracings of cancer in 2 of 18 lymph nodes.  Folllowing lumpectomy, I underwent chemo and radiation.  The breast which was treated for radiation has been different ever since treatment, but recently, began getting even harder (cement like) and uncomfortable.  Drs' exam and mammogram and ultrasound showed nothing but surgical changes, which is good, but I am so disfigured!  Does anyone know if surgery is possible to correct this?",
