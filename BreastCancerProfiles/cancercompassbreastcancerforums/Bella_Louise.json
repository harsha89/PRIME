    "Content": "I was diagnosed in October, 2007 with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  I am Progesterone Negative, Estrogen Positive and Her2Nu Negative.  I tested positive for the BrCA1 gene.  An Oncotype DX was done on my tumor and it tested to be a very aggressive cancer and I have a 34% chance of recurrence. I did a double masectomy, DIEP flap reconstruct in October, 2007.  I underwent 6 treatments Doxorubicin, Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide.  I am currently taking Arimidex.  I had my ovaries removed (uterus was already gone).  A few weeks ago I noticed some swelling in my neck.  I went to my oncologist and he ordered a CT Scan.  The CT scan showed the neck issue was not cancer, but I have a 5.5 MM noncalcified nodule abutting the major fissure within the superior segment right lower lobe of my lung.  I also have an additional smaller 4 mm pleural based nodule and additional small flatter regions of apparent pleural thickening noted posteriorly at the same level.  I am going to have a Pet Scan done next week.  Has anyone else encountered this issue?  I know it is what it is and worrying isn't going to help, but I want to know what questions to ask and what this may be.  Any suggestions are welcome.",
