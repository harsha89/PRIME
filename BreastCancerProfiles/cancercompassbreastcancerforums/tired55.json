      "Content": "Hi Newbie!  I'm new to this as well!  I was dx with lobular carcinoma in may 2012 in my left breast.  Had a PET scan was told I had lesions on my pelvis, rib and lower spine.  Then had a Bone PET scan and was told I had lesions up and down my spine.  This was after I had a bi-lateral mastectomy.  I also felt that things just kept getting worst!  What kind of treatment are you getting?  I'm getting two hormone therapy treatments with no radiation or chemo at this point.  I'm still scared and hoping the hormone therapies work.  Too much, too soon! would love to hear from you!   Tired55",

I too am more than glad to write back and forth anytime!  It helps a great deal talking to someone thats on the same road as I am.  Has your doctor given you a survial rate ?  My hasn't committed to say.   Thanks so much for responding!!!!!
