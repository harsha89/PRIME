After partial mastectomy last week, my doctor now suggests chemotherapy followed by Herceptin and radiation. Should I benefit from chemotherapy?   Absolutely go with chemo and herceptin! If you are her2/neu poslitive you want to take every precaution possible! I'm a 7 year breast cancer survivor. I was estrogen positive, but her2/neu negative and still had chemo, (and a mastectomy) then 5 years of tamoxifen. I can live with - and sleep well - knowing that I took EVERY STEP I could to keep from having a recurrence. I was afraid of chemo, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. There are so many new meds to keep you from being nauseous. Good luck and God speed! Anita",

      "Content": "Hi Susan: thanks so much for your note. Good to know that maybe the pain will lessen as I take the Femara for a few months. I guess I can put up with it if it keeps the cancer away! My oncologist suggested one of the antidepressants for hot flashes when I first went on Tamoxifin, but I hesitate to get on them, because I understand its hard to get off of them. I just don't want to take another pill. I already take meds for high blood pressure, thyroid and cholesteral among others. The hot flashes are worse at night because I take the Femara at bedtime. My poor husband freezes while I run the air conditioner all winter, but it helps! Again, thanks for your suggestions. Take care and stay healthy! Anita",

      "Content": "Well, I feel better knowing that my muscle pain is a normal response to Femara. But, it's no consolation that I have to put up with it! I'm 5 1/2 years in remission, thank God, and was on Tamoxifin for 5 years. Now on the Femara but not a happy camper. I guess that's the price we have to pay! Don't want to take anything stronger than Tylenol or Advil for the pain. I walk every day and sometimes it's very painful. Have had days where every muscle in my body is literally burning and I start to shiver and can't get warm. (Thought I was coming down with the flu.)Then I put on a sweater and get a hot flash and have to take off the sweater. OY!!!! Very annoying. Anyone with any thoughts about how to remedy this without taking strong painkillers? I eat healthy and walk every day. Any suggestions? (I'm 61 and in pretty good health otherwise.)",
