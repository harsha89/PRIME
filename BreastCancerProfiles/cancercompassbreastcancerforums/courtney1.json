      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy last Jan. and just finished chemo, radiation etc. I visited with a plastic surgeon today about reconstruction. I had infection and have a indentation in the side of my left breast along with the nipple pulled to the side. Has anyone ever had flap surgery (from the back muscle), and what were your results. How did the recovery go? Is there a wait period after radiation? Also I am having pain under my arm and along the bra line under the breat, has anyone ever had that before? Thanks in advance for you help.",

      "Content": "My surgeon recommends that I do not have the flap surgery as reconstrucion for my breast.  He recommends that I try the scar tissue removal and rebuilding where the indentation is. Has anyone had this and has it corrected the problem? It is a same day surgery which I like and hopefully will be healed within 4 to 6 weeks so I can go on vacation. I need advise. My insurance is will cover me completely until Dec. 31, but leaving for Mexico on the 27th. If I wait for next year I will have to come up with a minimum of $3000 to have the surgery. And as you know this is not a cheap disease! Any advice will be appreciated. Courtney",
