    "Content": "the breast and cervical cancer prevention project act of 2000 and all associated federal acts need immediate repair. the state departments of health (employees and their agents) keep this law a secret. you will not find flyers in any kind of m.d.'s office/clinic/hospital etc. etc. informing you that in order to qualify for bccp medicaid treatment, you must demand that your mammography screening gets billed to your state department of health - not to a private charitable corporation such as avon, susan b. komen etc. presume a legal battle until proven otherwise. applications for bccp medicaid forms in ohio aren't on the ohio department of job and family website - unlike normal ohio medicaid applications that you can print. theoretically if your screener is morally intact, you should have the ohio bccp medicaid application form handed to you during your intake, as well as carbons/photocopies of the screening about to be performed on you getting billed to the ohio department of health. when employed, i'm a special education teacher. those special education services are federal and state mandates for publication of those services. signs are up in school buildings, flyers are available etc. it's time to repair this half-cooked law. mandatory publication/distribution of our rights must be built into the law.
