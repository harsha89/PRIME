    "Content": "My tips, from my experiences, to have a better chance to beat your cancer or give you or your loved ones a better quality of life. *Know the medical system. If you don't know it, learn it quickly and stay sharp. Most lung cancer patients do not live long enough to learn through trial error. The mortality rate is so high that there's few left to speak out and call attention to system flaws, errors and gaps, and their families are either still in shock because it happened too quick, diagnosis came too late or they are just too mentally, physically, emotionally drained and exhausted, to have a hope in hell fighting another up hill battle, the epidemic of lung cancer. *Make a point to communicate to your treatment team with a calm and respectful manner. They are more likely to hear you and any concerns you have. Some health professionals are suprisingly quick to conclude that you are just an emotional mess, and well the see that every day. That's not excusing that behavior by any means. *Whenever possible communicate your concerns and frustrations with words chosen carefully before hand. I recommend writing them down and give a copy to your dr to keep in your chart, that way your concerns won't be forgotten so easily if you cannot fit it into one appointment. Use a respectful tone. Even though your team is well aware of the range of emotions and stress that come along with your cancer, but you will not leave your appointment feeling any better. Also keep copies in a journal handy for unexpected emergencies. They may be nothing or they maybe a clue to an unfamiliar doctor and save some time. I recommend always having a current copy of your chart with you at all times, especially if live in a rural/remote location. *If you feel like you aren't being heard or your questions aren't being answered, calmly tell someone in your care team exactly that. Don't assume that your team will realize your source of frustration. They are oncologists, and nurses etc.... not mind readers. *In fact don't assume anything about your care and treatments. A cancer centre/hospital are busy places, although an ideal, it's not yet realistic to expect your team to catch everything that's going on, especially if you have prior health conditions. It is your responsiblity to bring your concerns that may or not be directly related to cancer, to their attention and make sure they are followed up. You cannot afford to feel like your just a nuisance, that what you are going through is common among cancer patients. You cannot afford to feel that you are not worth the trouble. You are fighting a battle and if you don't believe in what you are fighting for you will likely lose. Cancer patients must fight for themselves first, and loved ones 2nd. You should not get by saying I need to fight this for my kids etc... that makes set backs so much worse on you and now you feel like you are weak and have let down to the people who love you. Many patients start to draw inward and push themselves away from the people they love because they feel like a burden and just want to make everything easier for their loved ones. I feel this is the point a patient can seal there own fate on some level whether the realize it or not. Let your loved ones be incentives to fight your cancer, not the motive. *One last point for now, give your dr an idea of who you are as a person and your reasons to take on your fight. You are important, you are a person, you are not a number. PLEASE VISIT MY BLOG AND SPEAK UP AGAINST CANCER IN  ANY FORM.    mom's story http://ca.360.yahoo.com/ rhondamckelviefoley",
