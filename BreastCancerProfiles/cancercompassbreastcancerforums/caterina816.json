My husband and I could not believe the news, and I think the surgeon himself was a little surprised.  I am due for another surgery next week and hopefully radiation after that.  Has anyone out there had more than two lumpectomys????    I am 67 years old and still in shock.  Thanks for any info,  Monika          I am 64 years old had lymdectomy in 2000-clear lymphnodes cancer returned 2007-same size as first cancer 2-7cm this time they told me its hidden in scar-tissue-i don,t believe them i refuse to be cut open again. I am watching it i will go for my mamo every year if they say it grew .i will go for lazer treatments-meanwhile i eat healthy take vits-your cancer is still small explore your options-and please don't trust doctors-keep in mind there in it for money good luck               --Message edited by CancerCompass staff.
