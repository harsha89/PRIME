Then I also had a biopsy done to confirm that it was breast cancer.  Mine was a pretty large lesion, though.  If your spot is too small to biopsy, they will probably just put you on Xeloda and/or Tykerb and watch you for now, although it would be good for them to know if your spot is ER+/- and Her2neu+/- Lisa   I will immediately research \"CA153\".....never heard of it even though I know there are several liver tests.   I plan to check PH levels recommended by Steve.  Grateful to you Lisa and Steve",

I cannot find in research any firm symptom list.  A CT scan revealed a small hypodensity on the liver with a mildly elevated AST level of 43.   I am worried that my liver is my most vulnerable site for spread of breast cancer.What else should I look for? More liver tests? I know there are 6 more other than AST.",
