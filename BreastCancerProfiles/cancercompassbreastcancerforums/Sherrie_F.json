      "Content": "July 3, 2007 I had surgery for breast cancer, invasive DCIS.  It was stage 1, low grade, 1 centimeter.  The Surgeon announced the good news to my husband.....No cancer in the lymph nodes! We were so happy, and then a week later, the good news.....no cancer in the margins!  My Surgeon then announced he was making me appointments with an Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist.  I told him I would keep the appointments, but would refuse further treatment.  He said they would do everything to \"scare\" me into it.  Instead of the Meds, I told the Oncologist I had changed my lifestyle, learned to forgive people, eat much more healthy...No sugar, lots of raw vegies, flax oil, little red meat, no alcohol, joined a Gym.  I told the Radiation Dr. the same thing.  Two weeks ago, my Surgeon called to say he heard I wasn't doing any of the follow up procedural treatments, and emplored me to do so.  I had been so sure I would be fine without this because he removed over 9 centimeters.  He said my breast tissue had been compromised.  I am so confused now......this sounds like the surgery has put me at risk.  Does anyone know what this means, I'm seriously considering the Radiation. Thank You, Sail On",

      "Content": "Leemg..... Thank You for your response!  It's just what I needed to hear tonight, because I started the first part of radiation treatment (Cat Scan), and was seriously considering not going back.....It's funny how we get the best perspective by fellow cancer/patient/survivors.  I just read Deanna Favre's book, \"Don't Bet Against Me!, and the Lumpectomy/Radiation was listed as being just as effective as Mastectomy, but your explanation was really clear and thorough.  I was blessed by the book and blessed by your response.
