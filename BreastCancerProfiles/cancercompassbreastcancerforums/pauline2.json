    "Content": "I had a terrible constipation after my first round chemo, doc gave me a luctose based laxative and it cramping so badly for hours and still not working for 4 days. I have always been on high fiber diet, lots of water, vege/fruits, but it still don't work. When the laxative eventually work, after much cramping, it ended up with diarrhea. I went for my 2nd chemo yesterday and worry that it will all happen again. I wonder how long can one not going to the loo? Can any one help please?",
