    "Content": "My wife Marilyn is concerned about taking cesium (High pH Therapy)and chemo at the same time. She worries that the cesium will interfere with the effectiveness of the chemo. Does any one out there have any evidence to support or debunk this concern? Marilyn has breast cancer that has metastasized to her bones and chest wall. It is now inflammatory carcinoma. The chemo she is taking is Taxol. Thanks, Dick",
