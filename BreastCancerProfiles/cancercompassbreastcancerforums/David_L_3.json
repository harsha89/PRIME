      "Content": "Yes for about 6 months and it worked well. Now I have heard rummors that junk batteries are being dumped around the calcium beds. Traces of lead are showing up in the calcium. I don't know for sure. Now we are using a product from Zion called Citrus Calcium plus-d. Its highly absorbent. Calcium builds good bones, good bones build good marrow , good marrow makes oxygen rich blood. A long shot but it worked for us. We ended up not taking the 2 transfusions per month after 2.5 months of the calcium. Also a good vit. Maybe look at R M 10. It contains organic grown mushrooms. This may inhance the immune system. Looks to be better that what I gave my wife. We then found a naturopathic Dr. that started her on I V Bags of Vits and Minerals which worked well. Good luck, My wife was well on her way to death with the western medicine approach. Cll. mersa, scinus disease,hemolitic anemia. Also 60 bags of vacromicin did help her a lot. Hope something said here will help. I feel every cancer patient needs a support Dr.",

      "Content": "After being a caregiver for my wife {CLL} for 6 years and gone thru many crises I would say every one need a cancer support Dr. Western medicine as it is called is based on scientific proof and did not work for my wife. I felt my wife was a expentable soldier in his was on the ins companies. Whole Food energizers with medical mushrooms and good calciun did wonders but that was just the start.",
