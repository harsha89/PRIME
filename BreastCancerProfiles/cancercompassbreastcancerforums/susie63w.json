      "Content": "I did a lot of research and found the Cantin Ketogenic Diet by Elaine Cantin.  I would recommend anyone with cancer to read and understand the science and what feeds cancer.  I did not take the Arimidex as I feel it can do more harm!  How did we get cancer to begin with?  What are we eating - what is our lifestyle?  Those are the things we should be addressing.  Doing nothing without research and education would be foolish of course.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy followed by 1 week of radiation twice per day.  My lump was stage 1 and they got clean edges when it was removed.  I opted to forego the chemo drug Arimadex.  The side efftects seemed much worse than getting the breast cancer.  I then found a book by Elaine Cantin called \"The Cantin Ketogenic Diet\".  I am getting ready to go on it again for 4 weeks and highly recommend you reading it.  One thing that bothered me was there was no mention of diet or watching sugar in your diet.  Cancer feeds on glucose!  Do your research and I wish you the best!",
