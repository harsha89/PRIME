I had this done over 5 years ago.  The one thing to consider with radiation is tha, as they say, it is the gift that keeps on giving.  It will continue to cause shrinkage of the breast tissue over time.  My surgeon intitially told me that once you have radiation you cannot have reconstruction but I fought for that as I lost quite a bit of tissue from an already modest breast.  I've had implants for 4 years now and have had to the affected breast tweeked once but I'm very pleased with the results.  Would you consider reconstruction if you opt for mastectomy??  Considering the DCIS is in two different quadrants of the same breasts this should prompt you to find out what the resultant cosmetic appearance may be.  This may influence you decision.  Get as much info as possible so you feel comfortable in your decision.  Know what they have in mind as far as extent of surgery in either case.  Again, with DCIS there is the possibility of not achieving clear margins and then the decision would then be mastectomy.  Best of luck to you!",

An MRI also indicated I had a 90% probable malignancy in the opposite breast which turned out to be benign.  My experience is that these tests are extremely sensitive and will show previous scar tissue, degeneration, bone healing processes etc. so it may very well be related to something other than mets.  Hope this helps!",

      "Content": "I read you story, so sorry you are going through this. Tamoxifen has been on the market for about 30 years and has been used by early stage breast cancer patients, it actually was the \"gold standard\" until additional drugs in different classes starting hitting the market such as Arimidex and Femara. Tamoxifen is the only one I'm aware of for premenapausal women. It works by blocking estrogen from the breast acting as a receptor in the breast. Estrogen has been known to fuel breast cancer and may be indicated in it's development although no study clearly shows that. It is suggested that some premenapausal women have their ovaries removed in order to stop the main production, however, the body makes estrogen even after menapause, lower amounts of course. Tamoxifen has proven to help prevent the occurrence and recurrence in both breasts. There was actually a program being developed to give younger women who are at high risk, particulary daughters of breast cancer first degree relatives,tamoxifen to see in fact if it actually prevent or delay the onset. Don't know what happened to the study or if it is ongoing. Losing both breasts and going through reconstructive surgery is a big ordeal, physically and emotionally, of course, in some cases of breast cancer the woman doesn't have a choice. I guess what your doctor is saying, in a case where there is no cancer tamoxifen may work to prevent or delay. As long as careful monitoring continues and I'm sure it will it may be a viable option. If you ever have any doubt you should always seek a second or third opinion if necessary. It that way you will feel more comfortable with you decision and that is important because living with breast cancer and your choices can be tough. Hope this helps.",

Again, if you think that only one cell is needed to start a process that can spread beyond the breast and once this occurs the average life span is two years.  Of course, some have lived with metastatic disease longer but why not do everything possible to prevent this occurence.  I am glad that you are tolerating the Arimedex well.  It definitely has been shown to REDUCE the risk of recurrence in the breast and other areas of the body.  Before you forego radiation please get as much info again from a radiation oncologist specialist.  They can give you a good estimate of the actual % of benefit in your particular case.  Best of luck to you!",

The most I had was a pink breast that eventually faded, very little if any discomfort.  The doctors did comment on the fact that I fared very well.  I believe it was the cream.  You want to address any break off cancer cells anywhere in the breast, rather treat the breast and lessen the chance of cells migrating beyond to other organs or lymph.  Cancer cells travel through blood as well and you only need one cell to begin the process.  I have been breast cancer free for five years come October 2008.  Best of luck to you!",

D supplements because calcium needs D to absorb?  Only if the oral form and supplements are not controlling your bone should you have to be on Zometa if indeed it is only being given to treat your osteoporosis that you do not know if you have?  I would first ask for a dexascan, a simple test that will tell you what your bone status is.  Based on that information you can discuss all options.  You definitely should be on calcium supplements and D.  Having Zometa every 3 months is rather aggressive also particulary if there isn't a documented problem.  Zometa is also used for bone spread as it stabalizes bone and recent published reports shows a positive effect on postmenapausal women with early BC as well which they were unaware of and further research is going on to determine if this is a course of treatment for some early BC.  But again, if it is not well tolerated you should discuss your options as there are some and demand a bone density so you know your bone status.",

They should have followed up with an ultrasound as this seems to be where the lesion was seen initially, however, they can use MRI in conjuction with a mammo and ultrasound to better determine the need for biopsy. There is a fine line for radioligst between watching and sending women in for biopsy for many reasons. The bottom line however is that you don't feel comfortable waiting and doing nothing more, and this should be expressed to your doctors. They should work with you in making a determination of what this may at this time so you can feel comfortable in the ultimate decision to follow up or go in for biopsy and what kind. Good luck!",

I also work with a lady who has been on Femara slightly longer after coming off of 5 years of Tamoxifen and she also states no side effects. Both of us, however, are on medications for osteoporosis as Femara can deplete the bone somewhat. I have read where some women have experienced side effects of joint and muscle pain but maybe the counter osteoporosis medications has something to do with voiding any side effects of the bones or joints. I don't know, maybe you can ask your doctor. I do know that Tamoxifen, Femara and Arimidex work in slightly different ways to block estrogen in the body. Good luck!",

Some I've talked to say this may have damaged the DNA at such a young age.  A genetic counselor explained that some people may have one damaged match of a cell which could be inherited.  If the second copy due to enviornment or other exposures becomes damaged as well, cancer can begin and cells may no longer have the ability to keep from reproducing abnormally.  We need healthy matching copies to produce healthy reproduction of cells.  We probaly will never know unless a mutation is revealed in the genes as to what we may be predisposed to and what other component is all that is needed to start the process.  We seek to understand somehow as if it would change things, not for us, but maybe for our children.  I sought a lumpectomy with radiation with my stage l BC and had reconstructive surgery in the form of implants a year after finishing radiation.  I also take Femara and I'm fortunate to have tolerated well thus far.  As of my last check, up, Jan. 08, all is quiet, now if I can also get my thyroid cancer in check, and my hearing and pulsatile tinnitus, oh well....just have to take one day at a time.  I just tell doctors and others that I was put together wrong.",

Atomicjoy Atomicjoy, I can't believe that we are like a carbon copy of one another.  I too was diagnosed with stage 1 BC but in September of 2003, and stage 3 thyroid cancer (also tall cell, more aggressive variant) in August 2007,  after awhile it all goes together.  I was not aware of any problem with my thyroid so that was also a total surprise.  I'm assuming it had spread to some lymph nodes to be classified as stage 3 (thyroid cancer)?  I had a left neck dissection in February of 2008.  So far it looks stable, although my thyroglobulin is measureable it is still under 2.  Breast cancer is stable as well although I've had two biopsies since.  How are you doing?  My parotid glands were damaged, not right away, but after my year scan so I deal with dry mouth.  (I lost one parathyroid gland with surgery).  I also have problems keeping my calcium levels within normal limits and had a low D which has been corrected.  Love to hear how things have gone for you.",

      "Content": "I can relate.  If you were diagnosed with either stage l or 11 BC, estrogen positive & Her neg, then lumpectomy with radiation has proven to be just as effective as mastectomy.  This was my choice 4 years ago and I also have small breasts.  I was concerned about the amount of tissue I lost from the affected breast as I needed two biopsies, one which developed and infection and then the lumpectomy to obtain clear margins.  If they can not obtain clear margins then you would have to resort to mastectomy anyway.  One word of caution as you mention you weren't doing reconstruction.  The radiation continues to shrink the treated breast as my surgeon said, \"it is the gift that keeps on giving\".  This was concerning for me as I had to wear a prosthesis over the remaining breast to balance.  Once being radiated you can opt for reconstruction but would have to wait about a year before doing so.  I had implants put in a year after completion of my radiation.  The scar which went across most of the middle of my breast was tight so I had a second procedure to soften the scar and the implant fell into a normal placing.  I am very satisfied with the final result today.  Of course, implants have to be replaced in about 5 years so this is something else to consider.  If you do opt. for a mastectomy, they can do reconstruction immediately or at a later time as well if you change your mind down the road.  As you can see this is a personal decision.  One other word of caution, a friend of a woman I work with opt for a mastectomy after diagnosed with in-situ and they couldn't obtain clear margins but didn't understand the extent of her procedure.  She lost muscle and her scar came above the scoop line in a normal top one would wear and she lost so much tissue under her arm that left a hole that needed a flap and she can't wear sleeveless tops either because she feels so self conscious.  This has caused her some depression as she was not aware of the extent of her mastectomy so make sure you have this understanding before making your choice.  Hope this helps!!",

I don't know specific sites as I'm a breast cancer patient and usually hit those sites. Your doctors should be candid about your treatment options available for your stage and type of cancer. Many doctors who are affilated with larger hospital systems or care centers have people on board such as cancer counselors, nutrionist, social workers etc. If you see a local doctor, most counties have programs, look in the phone book or call your county office. As far as disability, you didn't say what state you are from, NJ has state short term disability as well as long term disability if needed. Check with your state. How long it takes to get back into the main stream depends on your treatment and stage. Surgery generally takes about 6 weeks to recover. Radiation if considered can cause fatigue and some other symptoms pending on the area of body radiated. Your radiation oncologist would be able to advise you on this. You probably will also have a medical oncologist and they plan and treat with any oral medications or chemotherapy that may be necessay, here again, ask questions. Your doctors should be willing to discuss any and all you questions andif they do not, find other doctors who will work with you to provide the best treatment plan for your specific case. There is information out there, take a deep breath and start making phone calls etc. The internet is a good source of finding others in your situation. I wish you the best,you're not alone. Hope this brings some comfort.",

I had to wear a prosthesis against the remaining breast tissue for balance. My doctors tried to sway me away from reconstructive surgery due to the questionable outcome on a radiated breast but I was persistent. I faired well with my skin actually. Having sensitive skin from the onset I was given a radiation cream that kept any redness or burning to a minimum. After one year (I agreed to wait one year) I had implants although due to the large scar area across my breast the implant did not fall properly behind the scar. I had an implant that also served as an expander. But after a doctor ruptured the implant in the opposite breast trying to perform a core biopsy I headed back to surgery. My cosmetic surgeon softened the original lumpectomy scar allowing the implant to assume a more natural position. Of course, I understand radiation is the gift that keeps on giving so I'm hoping the implant keeps it from rising to my scapula. You made me laugh. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "I agree with the other responses that you have to find an oncologist that your are comfortable with.  As far as the estrogen, Tamoxifen works to block the amount of estrogen that could stimulate a new cancer.  They have found, however, that Arimidex and Femara both of which work in a similar way but different from Tamoxifen work better in deterring the recurrernce of BC.  That is why you doctor was so insistent but you are right with those drugs can come a problem with bone loss.  However, there are drugs like Fosamax and the taking of calcium and Vit. D that can counter those side effects.  But Tamoxifen is still a good product.  They normally do not monitor the amounts of estrogen circulating in your body as they are doing all they can by prescribing the above drugs to deal with that.  There are cancer markers, however, that have come about since I was diagnosed 4 years ago.  I don't know the name of the specific marker but some doctors may not feel comfortable with relying on these as yet.  If you have had cancer in one breast, we are at an increased risk of having it in the other so vigilance and having your mammos are still extremely important, self exams and reporting any changes to your doctor right away. Also, you should be followed at least yearly if not more to look for clinical sings of a recurrence such as a lump or swollen lymph nodes any where.  Excercise has been proven to play an important role as well as diet.  So these are some of the things we can do day to day.  But most importantly is to find someone you trust in dealing with your health that you feel comfortable with.  I was recently diagnosed with thyroid cancer and my breast medical and surgical team were able to help me by getting and supplying medical info that helped me in my treatment plan with that.  You need to find a team that sees you as a person.  I've been fortunate to have that.",

      "Content": "Hi Hollyhobby! I'm sorry to hear you haveto face BC.  I know you must be scared.  Stage 1 BC is highly treatable and the prognosis is very good.  I was diagnosed with stage 1 in Sept. 2003 and also had a lumpectomy with radiation.  With a lumpectomy the idea is to get what is referred to as \"clear margins\" which means what it implies, normal tissue surrounding the entire tumor area.  If this is obtained they probably will do a sentinel node biopsy to determine if the cancer has not spread to the nodes.  I actually had a node dissection which is a little more involved but I faired well with this procedure also.  Just had to do some exercises which helps prevent any complication such as lymphadema which is rare with sentinel node biopsy, and it addresses the soreness and stiffness accompanied with it.  Depending on the size of your affected breast there may hardly be anything but a scar.  One note I would like to mention with radiation therapy the treated breast will tend to pull back or shrink if you will so if this is a concern discuss it with your surgeon.  I ended up having breast reconstruction with implants with good results.  The method of radiation which lasts for about 7 weeks, although I understand there is a shorter course with higher doses some places may be using with good success is not bad.  I looked at it like having another part time job and actually drove myself every day an hour away.  The treatment itself lasts a couple minutes.  You may get some irritation in the form of redness.  I have very sensitive skin so I asked my radiologist for something at the onset.  She prescribed Biafine and it worked wonders.  I only had a little pink discoloration and it goes away after treatment gradually.  If you have radiation and you feel you may need reconstruction it can't be done for about a year after treatment so discuss this with your surgeon.  A couple weeks into radiation therapy you probably will feel very tired.  It is a different tired, like early in the day you have filled your gas tank and about 2:00 or so it it empty and you just can't go anymore, you need to rest. This is normal and eventually after finished treatment it will pass.  I continued to work part time job and was able to do so but by the time I got home and hit the couch I couldn't move any more the rest of the night.  There are so many support groups, take advantage of them.  For a time your life will seem like doctors and hospitals and you may feel somewhat detached from the rest of the world but be assured this will pass and believe me life will be normal again, it may be a new normal but just know things will be okay again.  I'm post menapausal so I was also placed on a anticancer hormone Femara which I take daily and tolerate very well.  Some people don't tolerate it as well.  I know this seems like an arduous process and it is but it is only temporary.  I was recently diagnosed with thryoid cancer, no connection to my BC and will have to go through another arduous process but again I have to remind myself there is light beyond the tunnel.  Good luck!  I hoped this has helped.",

Chemotherapy would address this, unfortunately, it is much harsher then radiation.  I don't know your age but there are many support groups out there and hospitals offer sessions where they address various topics involved with BC.  Can you talk to your mom about what her doctor's are saying, or maybe you can go with her and have the doctor address any concerns you and she may have.  Worrying unfortunately changes nothing.  It is more important that you both take an active role in dealing with her disease and enjoy one another.  Do those things you've always wanted to do.  Ask the doctor how she can address her tiredness in hopes of feeling better so you both can accomplish this.  I know how terrifying all this can be but try to find some normalcy in your life and treat this just as something she has to deal with in her life but allow life to go on.  Best wishes!",

      "Content": "Thanks for responding!  We're about the same age.  I'm 58.  It sounds as though you did have the thyroid cancer before your BC but in my case it is almost as if it developed at the same time, like something derailed per as my genetic counselor commented.  I have read an association between the RAI treatment for thryoid cancer increasing the occurrence of BC but what other relationship are you referring as you have not had RAI as yet?  It is interesting you indicate that while going through radiation for your breast (which is part 2 of the initial treatment when you have surgery and lumpectomy, you can avoid radiation if you opt for mastectomy but it is not a choice with lumpectomy as there is too great a chance for remnant cells to be left behind in the breast tissue), that your neck swelled.  I asked my rad onc. if while doing the radiation on my breast and axillary area if it could have hit the isthmus or thyroid.  She didn't feel that was the case and indicated usually with radiation exposure it takes at least 5 years to show.  Have you heard different?  No one that I know with BC is on progesterin as I mentioned.  If you are ER positive you are probably progesterin positive as well meaning neither hormone is good for your type of BC, of matter of fact, it is harmful but I may be in error.  Although most thyroid cancer is slow growing such as the common type of papillary, don't be fooled, there are other types which are much more agressive even in the papillay diagnosis such as mine which is a subtype of papillary \"tall cell\".  I only had at largest a 1.3 cm nodule and it was most aggressive invading the isthmus and leaving the thyroid capsule into the fat tissue and in one node in the center compartment but leaving the node capsule and I still have at least one positive 4mm node in my neck region which still has to be addressed.  And in my case it probably only has been present 3 to 4 years and I'm still stage 3.  Cancer in any part of your body is nothing to take lightly nor play the odds.  Better be agressive without overkill up front then to give it a better opportunity to take hold then there may not be much hope only to extend a decent quality of life.  Good luck with your pathology report, hope it is good news, being the common variety papillary type.  And you are definitely doing the right thing with radiation, after all if you had not gone through this process your thyroid cancer may not have discovered until it was doing the bad things mine has attempted to do and I'm still lucky as it could have been worse.  I would like to keep in touch as we have a lot in common hear.  By the way the name of the syndrome is \"Cowden Syndrome\", you can check it out on line and you don't have to have all the symptoms.",

      "Content": "Your situation sounds oh so familiar. I also had a hysterectomy before starting on Premarin for, at that time the science community believed, heart benefit, to decrease the risk of osteoporosis and hot flashes. As you are probably aware it does not provide any heart benefit, and I actually developed osteoporosis and osteopenia while on Premarin. I must admit it did address the hot flashes. I stayed on estrogen for l0 years to one of my primary doctors dismay, but my OB/GYN was in agreement. I stopped a month before I read that there was a connection with women taking estrogen long term, more than a couple years, and the develop- ment of breast cancer. I didn't stop soon enough. When I found out that the treatment for most breast cancers were anti-estrogen drugs it was a no brainer for me. I was angry that my doctors didn't take this more seriously. I also have no history of breast cancer in my family but there is colon and melanoma. Colon cancer is more likely to develop in woman with breast cancer and vice versa, as well as ovarian. I know hot flashes and night sweats can drive one crazy, I continue to deal with them although not as bad as first going off estrogen. One thing for sure, hot flashes and night sweats won't kill you but dealing with the traumatic diagnosis of breast cancer and the ever present worry of a recurrence can. I would suggest you do your own research and get another opinion regarding the relationship between breast cancer. If you were not having breast difficulty I might agree with your doctor but if you indeed have an early stage cancer the doctor's will have you stop it as it causes the tumor to grow. Hopefully, this will be a false alarm but one you should consider about what to do and take in the future. I just don't want you to end up like me. Good luck!",

I believe there is an ongoing study on estrogen only drugs to see the actual relationship it plays. I know there is at least a hint that long term use of ERT plays a role. I haven't heard any connection with dementia. If you understand the role that breastcancer therapy such as Tamoxifen and Armidex etc. play, working as ANTI-estrogen, it baffles me why there is still question whether the reverse, given menapausal women estrogen long term can play a role in the development of breast cancer.

Thank you.   Hi!  I had a lumpectomy and second biopsy of the same breast 3 & l/2 yrs. ago for BC stage 1 and my surgeon did a node ressection (11 nodes)rather than the sentinel node, not sure why but I just wanted to tell you yes, it does increase the incidence of lymphadema but if you do the exercises after surgery as instructed it will help,  They will instruct you not to have blood drawn from this arm after the procedure and to be careful of any infection in that arm as this can predispose you to lymphadema. I have not had a problem and the scar healed very well and quickly.  If you are not comfortable with his answer however, seek a second opinion.  I believe it helps if you are in on the decision making process when suitable and this is suitable.  Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Anni!  Sorry you are going through all this emotional pain and anxiety.  You are right as far as risk factor, with your familiar history, your risk is much higher, and you mentioned colon and ovarian cancer in your familar history.  They have found a connection between these and breast cancer.  There are syndromes that link these together.  Genetic counseling would help here.  As far as the problem with your left breast.  I have learned that we know our bodies better than anyone.  Something is telling you to pursue this, I would.  One possible symptom mentioned as worisome is a breast that changes shape or size.  When you meet with the surgeon, he or she will probably have you fill out a medical questionnaire.  They will ask about family history of cancer.  I have found out in my journey that most doctor's do not refer to this so reiterate to the surgeon about your mother and those blood family members who have had ovarian or colon, and your personal history of polyps.  This should get his or her attention if their degree is worth anything.  Point blank talk to them about the change in breast size and what other causes it could be.  Were the calcifications macocalcifications, which are less worrisome, or microcalcifications which may signal a potential problem as in my case.  If would be helpful if you had your past mammos with you and a copy of the reports.  You should have no problem in requesting and obtaining them.  I would normally advise to get a second opinion if the first leaves you feeling unsure but I understand you no longer have insurance.  Write down any questions that your have as you think of them and take them along and don't leave the office until your questions are put to rest.  Again, a breast that changes in size or shape is a red flag.  I know one time I went into my primary doctors office with no ankle, due to fluid, and I mentioned my swollen ankle and the doctor immediately dismissed it, I guess because he didn't realize that it was not normal for me to not see my ankle.  Some people normally have fuller ankles.  Let us know how you make out.  Hope this was of some help!",

I did have some soreness in the rib area but I have no symptoms today, have not had a follow up scan, but 4 years later have no indication of mets.  Was it the Zometa??  Don't know but I feel it had something to do with it.  As for the problem in the jaw bone.  I actually met the doctor who first discovered this problem, necrosis of the jawbone.  Just don't have any teeth removed.  The problem is more likely to come about if teeth are removed, otherwise, it is very unlikely you would have to worry about this.  With bone mets it is more prudent to address this and make any attempt to keep it under raps because it can spread quickly not only to bone but other internal organs.  If you were me that would be my only concern now.  Best of luck to you!",

A follow up bone scan showed a spot on one rib and yet a 3rd showed an additional 2 spots on my ribs (questionable for mets again)and the spinal area was no longer suspicious. An abdominal scan also revealed probable cysts on my liver. I also take Calcium supplements and Vit. D and take Zometa infusions not for bone mets but for osteoporosis. My point, even though these tests have come back confirming probable mets because of my diagnosis of BCC the tests are so sensitive that they can pick up other things giving a false positive. So far my doctor's have declared me mets free and will not do any more testing unless I become symptomatic clinically or otherwise. Ask for further confirmation of these results before giving up hope. Even with the possibility they confirm mets, I understand from others that you can live for a very long time with treatment.

Since your doctor indicated you are a candidate for lumpectomy you will require radiation, it is a 2 step process, you either opt for mastectomy and no radiation or lumpectomy with. Radiation wasn't bad for me. I have very sensitive skin so I mentioned that to doc. and was given a radiation cream, Biafine. It worked wonders, just some pinkness that went away in a couple months. Did your doctor mention lymph node or sentinel node dissection? You will probably need one or the other, sentinel is the least invasive. This will determine if it has reached any of the lymph nodes. This information is needed as well as the size, grade, etc. which will determine your current stage and what treatment options are recommended. Also, you age is important as there are hormone therapies only post menapausal women can take. I know this all seems overwhelming so take it one step at a time. Ask questions, ask about options, get a second opinion if you do not feel comfortable with what is being offered to you. I had a second opinion and when he also agreed with the options being given I felt better. I felt better when I had some control over my own health so I sought out information as it was told to me. I did not have to have chemo as a 54 year old women with stage l, but I do take Femara, a hormonal therapy and have been fortunate enough to have not experienced side effects from the medication. One last point if it shows in one or two lymph nodes it is not a death sentence as in some cancers, it is still curable at this stage. And there are many woman living with breast cancer and going on with their lives. You are not alone. Best of luck as you go through this process and keep the faith.",

      "Content": "Many of us have gone through a similar experience.  I personally went through this 4 years ago this month.  It was a horror story.  The waiting and questionable information was the worse.  I remember at that time I felt as if my world had stopped and I was consumed with doctors, hospitals and medical terminology.  It was like the rest of the world was moving without me.  But I'm glad to say that will pass in do time and there is life after a breast cancer diagnosis.  I had another set back this year when I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer but for now I've been able to move past that as well.  People I know shake their heads in awe as to the bad luck I've experienced over the past years but I feel that I am stronger and a better person as a result of getting through all this, and using my experiences to help someone who is just facing or about to face this.  I would agree with one of the postings to take some time and educate yourself and get a 2nd even 3rd opinion.  I have even learned that it is a good idea to have a second pathologist confirm the findings.  At first it is all over whelming but once you get over the initial shock you can take action to be an active player in your own treatment and care.  I know this empowered me.  God bless you and things will get better.",
