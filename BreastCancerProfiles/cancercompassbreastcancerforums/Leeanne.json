    "Content": "I am a 46 year old who was misdiagnosed in 2006 with invasive BC Stage 2 node negative, I had pain and a lump of 3cm which was not seen on mammo was picked up on ultrasound but only as dense tissue, not cancer..Lump was removed due to the size but doctors showed no concern until after biopsy....Didnt clear margins so needed follow up surgery and node removal...Chemo and Radiation followed...My last few mammo's have shown distortion on Mammo and it always says MORE THAN LIKELY due to surgery changes, my recent mammo has shown calcification in an area that causes me pain and where lump was removed, the results were again POSSIBLY due to surgery....it's always more than likely or possibly never a definate answer.....Would appreciate a few more opinions on what you would do in my situation..... Thanks Leeanne",
