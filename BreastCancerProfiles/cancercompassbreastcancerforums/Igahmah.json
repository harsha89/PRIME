      "Content": "I am on my 5th year of taking tamoxifen.  I have had a back ache for over two years.  I have told my oncologist and she says it is soft tissue pain.  I have not had a bone scan, mri or any other type of test, just the regular blood tests every 6 months.  I wouldn't call it a pain in my back, it just aches, especially if I have been sitting down or laying down for a while.  I am also overweight, so could be that too.  But just wondered it it could be the tamoxifen.  I remember when I first started taking it some people said they would rather not take it because of the side effects.  I wondered if an aching body could be a side effect.  My bc was smaller than .5 cm, no lymph node involvement, her negative, and estrogen positive.  No chemo or radiation needed.  I opted for the mastectomy instead of the lumpectomy.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your answer.  I have had this off an on for about two years.  I went to a regular doctor and they gave me just an Xray and told me I have the spine of a 20 year old.  The ache is not in the spine or the tailbone area it is on either side like in the muscle, some days on one side some days on the other.  Like I said I have ask my oncologist about it and she doesn't seem concerned, pokes around ask me if it hurts and tells me it is soft tissue.  I go back again in August.  If it has not gotten better by then (bought a new mattress) then I think I will request a scan of some kind.  Seems to me she would have recommended one if she thought it necessary.  Sometimes I wonder about the oncologist.  Mine comes in for about 10 minutes tells me my test results are good, how do I feel, must be soft tissue pain, and she is gone.  I left one doctor because I thought he was so impersonal, but she is just as bad, I guess in their field you couldn't get to personal with your patients.  Again, thanks for your info.",
