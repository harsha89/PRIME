      "Content": "Hi, i am so glad to help. I did had the first biospy, and then had a lumpectomy, and then when they found more cancer behind the breast tissue i had a double mascetomy. I also had reconstructive surgery. But everyone scenario is different. My mother was diagnosed two years prior to me and her cancer was the kind that don't spread so she had a lumpectomy. She had to have radiation a  small amount of chemo, i did not have to have radiation because their was nother to radiate because i had it all removed, breast, breast tissue and nipples, so i had reconstruction, with implants. And my mother and i are both survivor's and you will too, so don't be scared, and please ask any question at anytime. god bless you!",
