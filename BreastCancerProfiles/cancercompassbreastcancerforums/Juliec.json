      "Content": "My heart goes out to you Tammy in your struggle sincerely. but please try not to lose hope...your children need you, need you to believe & hope so that they can also do the same. You would want them to do the same if this situation were reversed wouldn't you? Do you honestly think that they would be willing to go & just leave you behind to move on??! I really am not trying to preach or lecture...I'm sorry if it is coming out that way. I just have such strong feelings about this I cannot explain it any other way. I have heard many stories of women with your stage/grade that have beaten this monster. So there is always hope, just keep on looking for that light & reaching for your families love to get you through. Much respect & faith, Julie",
