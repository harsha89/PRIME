      "Content": "Arimidex caused severe tingling like electricity running up and down arms. This resulted in carpal Tunnel,surgery. Switched to aromasin. Side effects seemed less at first, but gradually worsened. After 2 yrs of aromatase inhibitors. had many Aches and Pain in both arms and hands.  Tingling in fingers, sweaty back, tiredness, drowsiness, neck pain (mostly on the right). Too dry and painful to have relationsw with my spouse.Took a medication vacation and things improved. I do not want to go back on it. See Doc Tomorrow. Wish me luck",

      "Content": "Hi,   I had Arimidex followed by Aromasin for a total of 21/2yrs. The wk I went on Arimidex I started radiation, so when my arms began having shooting pins and needles, like electricity running from the hands up I questioned it but both oncol and radiol drs said it couldn't be either of their therapies. Long story short, hands got worse and I had carpel tunnel surgery on the right hand.  Switching to Aromosin i thought there was slight improvement but eventually (6M0s later) realized it was worsening again. Oncol Doc switched me to Tamoxefin and I have almost recovered. The hand that had surgery is still painful in the AM but only upon wakening.  I would be careful about taking an aromatase inhibitor. My Doc will never give it to me again.  Wishing you luck,  Carole",

What I wanted to say was pay attention to your body and symptoms.  I suffered a lot more than \"discomfort\" for almost three years.  I know we are all different and that some meds have better results than others, but we may need to advocate for ourselves at times.",

      "Content": "Hi Dee,  I certainly had very bad arm, shoulder, wrist and hand pain while on Arimidex. It became so bad after about 1 yr on the drug that I had carpel tunnel surgery.  (The doc did not believe that the drug caused it at that time)  I continued to have pain in limited use of my hands. The one that was operated on was worse than the one that wasn't.  After almost two yrs of suffering, the doc finally switched me to Tamoxifen and I am happy to say that I am so much better.  Now that you mention it, I also developed a floater but attributed it to age.  Maybe that was related to arimidex too. The other major draw back was the discomfort that it caused vaginally.  Tamoxifen is so much better for me.  Hope this helps and you do not suffer too long as I did.  ",
