    "Content": "My twin sister just completed radiation therapy for breast cancer.  After the radiation was completed the area under her arm turned black (we are African American).  I\u2019ve read the skin should heal 100% in time with no scaring or discoloration. Is this the case for women of color also? Is there anything that can be done to help the healing process?",
