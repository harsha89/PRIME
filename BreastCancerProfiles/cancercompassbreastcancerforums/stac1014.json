      "Content": "I have decreased my Arimidex from every day to 3 days a week related to severe side effects, mainly depression. (I've never had a problem with depression) My onc is aware of my decreased dosage and said that there are no studies to address this issue so she can't advise me as to whether I'm greatly decreasing my benefits from the drug or not. She said she just doesn't know. She did say \"at least you're still taking it\" We discussed quality of life and she said that what I was doing was ok with her. My question is this: Have any of you done the same thing? If you have I'd love to know what your onc said about it. My symptoms have decreased to a tolerable level but isn't gone. I would love to hear from anyone who has done this to see if your symptoms eased. Thank you in advance and good luck on your journey to better health.  ",
