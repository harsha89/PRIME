    "Content": "Hi I'm new to the board but wanted to add my 2 cents. I was diagnosed with lobular breast cancer May 2005. In August 2004 went for a mammogram - could feel a lump but the mammogram didn't pick it up. Went back in Feb. for more testing as I wasn't comfortable with the lump. Had mammogram and ultra sound which both came back negative. So if it was nothing what in the world was it? The dr. figured it was fibroids. Went to a surgeon to double check who said it was 98% sure to be fibroids, but wanted to do a needle aspiration to make double sure. It came back negative. The surgeon and I agreed that we wanted one more test just to make double sure, so he performed a core biopsy. It came back positive. This is not to unduly alarm you, but I have learned that one needs to be pro active. Squeaky wheel gets the grease! Hopefully you will discover it is really nothing. But please don't wait - get answers. Ria",
