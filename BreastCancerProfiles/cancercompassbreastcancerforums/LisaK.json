My surgery was an extreme case.  My pain was worst than most and I was slow to heal.  With all that said, I would do it again in a heart beat.   Two months post-surgery I felt better than new.   It's a hard procedure but totally worth it. Just be prepared that you will be a mess the first week in the hospital. Feel free to ask questions.   I had a mastectomy 5 years ago. I was 28 with a 1 year old and two months pregnant. Now after our fouth child I think we are done having children and am looking at options. I am very interested in the DIEP. Where did you have yours done?",
