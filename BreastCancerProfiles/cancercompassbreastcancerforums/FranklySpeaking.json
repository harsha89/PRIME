Joanne my wife has been on 8+ therapies in 6 years of stage 4 breast cancer....have you read the book Beating Cancer with Nutrition by Quillan ?  might look there for some ideas to complement traditional therapy ..it has helped us ....     and also there is a new test out called Target Now by a company called Carisdx that does a molecular profile of the DNA of your cancer to guide them in choosing a better chemo ... FDA approved in May 2009 .....we are getting the biopsy done this week then get results in about 10 days .....anybody else here do this test yet?",

      "Content": "My Thanks to everyone here for their condolences.  When diagnosed (at Stage 4 breast cancer) we knew the prognosis was only one to two years.  We are blessed to have had my lovely Lynda for 6 years.   Looking back ,the one thing I wish we had found sooner was a place called The Bright Spot for Health in Kansas.  www.brightspot.org  They have a  medicare certified lab and an oncologist on staff but they treat a whole host of diseases besides cancer.  I have seen them mentioned as a Sherlock Holmes of chronic illness and their doctors and lab work on nutritional medicine.  There are ongoing studies on IV vitamin C at the University of Kansas with Dr. Jeanne Drisko  .. see here for a FAQ and also many full published articles (links at bottom of page) re IV C (at IV concentrations it acts differently than oral)  http://integrativemed.kumc.edu/ivvitaminc.htm      We went there early in the summer of 2008 and started the IV vitamin C there and then back in north Houston after receiving the results.  Lynda never had more energy and felt better than while on this. We even went to Disney World in July.  Unfortunately she got a port infection and it had to be removed, one arm had lymphedema (no IV in that arm) and the other was a very difficult stick due to the many sticks over the years.   IV vitamin C is not the only thing they do but is a great thing for cancer patients. I wish we had started there and with Patrick Quillans' book, Beating Cancer thru Nutrition 1st (complementary not alternative see Amazon) or had gone after the very 1st round of chemo if not before.  With the exception of a few targeted theapies (Herceptin etc.)  why not give your body a chance to heal by finding out any deficiences and/or toxic problems ? before you go far down the chemo trail ...once too far there is no going back as your body is too depleted or just plain worn out.   Lynda also had the least side effects of anybody in her 100 person support group while on supplements.  We should have stayed with the IV C no matter what ... oh well... hindsight is 20-20 ...but if even 1 person decides to check this research and these places out it will be worth it!    If anyone wants more info or a personal point of view than send me a private message and i will be happy to talk on the phone or converse via e mail.   Good luck and God Bless",
