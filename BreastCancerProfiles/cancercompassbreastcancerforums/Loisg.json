    "Content": "After my lumpectomy I was, of course, taken off my Prempro because my tumor was estrogen positive. I've been losing my hair since then but the loss is now visible and dramatic. Believe me I know how lucky I am that my tumor was easily removed but I'm so depressed that I'm losing my hair even though I didn't need chemo. S0.. any solutions or suggestions. Â ",
