    "Content": "I would for sure get a second opinion and educate myself. I recently have been diagnosed with stage 2 melanoma (at 53) and have been on the internet everyday. I'm not at the stage of choosing radiation over surgery. But I have seen what radiation does and I would do what I could to avoid it. If your not that attached to the \"GIRLS\", I'd let them go. My insurance covers mastectomies 100%, but chemo and radiation are covered at 80% after the $1000.00 deductable. Â Educate yourself on what what insurance covers also! Hang in there!! You are not alone!!=)",
