    "Content": "My chemo nurse also told me to take Claritan or Zyrtec for 5 days after the Neulasta to help lessen the pain. The antihistamine in it is what helps. I'm also taking Taxol and the combo does give me leg, knee, ankle and upper arm pain but I just keep telling myself if this is all I have to go thru to be free from cancer, I can do it! God bless us all for we will come out winners! Gina",
