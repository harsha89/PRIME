    "Content": "Hi ladies! I hope that it's alright if I post here, I am just looking for some guidance! For some background information, I am a 24 year old female with fibrocystic breasts (I have very dense tissue and I am very lumpy). When the doctor was initially explaining the condition, she told me to frequently feel my breasts so that I can become aware of what is \"my normal\" and what is not. In august I found a lump that kind of jumped out at me, it is in the \"5 o clock\" position, and it is rock hard, and I can grab it between my fingers, where as my other lumps they just kinda roll around within my breast. I waited until last week to have it checked because mostly I forgot that it was there and I already had my well woman exam scheduled months prior. It actually turned out for the better that I waited because I was able to tell her that it does NOT fluctuate with my period cycles and it has not decreased in size. It feels as though it has very irregular borders, like a bunch of cluster lumps lumped together. The doctor who I saw for the well woman exam (I am living temp in a different state right now, so I don't have a regular gyno) was alarmed by the lump. She set me up with the breast surgeon in town and I had an ultrasound done this morning. The radiology clinic that I was at was running behind an hour, and the lady was very rushed when she was in there. The actual ultrasound lasted less than 5 minutes and she took 3 pictures, so I was not feeling very hopeful that anything was found. She also was only scanning one area, even though I told her it can be hard for me at times to find the exact lump I am able to grab, the entire breast was not scanned. I was told that afternoon that the report said \"no cysts, lumps, or abnormal tissue\". I'm extremely confused by all this, especially because the doctor I saw was concerned about my breast lump. I also have been very winded lately, but that could be related to a heart problem that I have and I am being monitored for. We do have breast cancer in my family, but it is in my great grandparents. I felt a bit trivial that I had been SO worried about this lump in my breast and then absolutely nothing was seen on my ultrasound, not even a cyst. This absolutely perplexes me, so I came on the internet and I saw that some women had negative mammos and ultrasounds, but still had breast cancer. I decided for peace of mind to call the breast clinic, since the earliest I am able to see him is December 1st. She reassured me that many women come in with negative ultrasounds and that if there is a PALPABLE lump that it needs to be fully examined. She said it could be something it could be nothing, but you just don't know until you further examine it. Long story short: Did anyone have a negative ultrasound?Did they do a biopsy without being able to visually see the lump on imaging? I am just very perplexed about the ultrasound not showing a SINGLE thing, even though I know there are cysts throughout my breast and I am having an internal debate with myself on whether I should cancel my appointment or not. I just don't want to look silly showing up with a negative ultrasound. Many thanks to anyone who takes the time to respond, I would so appreciate it!!:)",
