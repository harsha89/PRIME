      "Content": "Hi Gayle58  Since I wrote my last message I flew from Ohio to Seattle and went to the Seattle Cancer clinic and met with my naturopath there. He said after 6 years I am in remission and should be able to get off of the aromasin but to check with my oncologist which I will be doing Dec 13th and hopefully she will give me the pros and cons of getting off of the medication that is making me feel like I am 100 years old.  I was seriously contemplating hip replacement along with a knee replacement but if the severe pain is due to the aromasin I do not want to go through those surgeries.  I will let you know what she says.  It would be such a blessing to be pain free and know that my chances of cancer returning would not be because I stopped the aromasin.",

      "Content": "In 2001 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, choose not to have chemo but did have a lumpectomy and radiation.  I was on tamoxifen for a couple of years but like everyone else had extreme joint pain so was switched to aromasin in 2004.  I have now been on it for 3 years and have had several bone scan and PET scans because of joint pain and have even had a knee arthroscopic surgery and am contemplating knee replacement.  My left hip kills me certain days.  After reading some of the comments I am wondering if it is not just the aromasin and wonder if I should still be taking it after 3 years.  It is quite an expensive drug but would I be sorry if I was to stop it.  Has anyone taken it for over 3 years or has been taken off it and have still been in remission?  I am sort of afraid to change anything since I have done good but what is it doing to my joints.  Is it worth being cancer free and living with the joint pain......but as I am sure anyone that has had breast cancer lives with the fear of any little ache or pain could be \"IT\".  I try to be positive and have come a long way.  My husband died while on a European vacation in 2000 and 8 months later I was diagnosed with breast cancer but continued building our dream home on a mountain lake in Washington while doing the radiation bout.  After 5 years I needed a change in my life so up and sold my home and moved to Ohio where I did not know anyone.  Love it here and will probably make another move in 5 years to who know where.  Cancer makes you realize life is short and if you want to do something ....just DO IT.  I am 65 and and have many years ahead of me. I just found this site and would love to hear from anyone going through the aches and pains of the cancer drugs.",
