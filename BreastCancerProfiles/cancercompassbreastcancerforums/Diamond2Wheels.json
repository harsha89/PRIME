    "Content": "Had a mastectomy 4/2010 of left breast with flesh and some muscle - The cancer returned this time with a vengance!  It has inhabited under my arm pit to almost the last rib on left side through the center and onto the right breast.  It feels as if I have been wearing a underwire bra that is restricting me to breathe!  I can not sleep at night because I must sleep on my back and the shoulderblade feels burning hot and often times itchy with so much pain that the Oxy's of any kind do not work! I'm stage 4 (withing 2 months) during my clinical trial which I was not treated very well. I would ask the doctor a question and the clinical trial nurse would be in the room and blurt out, she is PROTOCOL only!  Needless to say, I thought Doctors had to take an oath? None of my questions were answered and then they kicked me off the clinical trial and never told me why! Is there any way to get a good nights sleep?  Does massage help or hurt?  What about heating pads??? I know they take away the bodys electrolites.... Please help...I'm in desperate need.  ",
