    "Content": "Just waiting to see the Onc to see how Xeloda is working for me....feeling great.  For me, I only tell my personal friends and family about what's going on.  The frustrating part is that casual friends will call and say \"heard you weren't well\".  How would they hear...maybe someone in the Healthcare field.  I don't know why this upset me soooo much...It's frustrating enough that you have this disease....Just venting and being anxious about Monday's appointment.  Just want to know how to answer ignorant, nosey people..   Thanks!",
