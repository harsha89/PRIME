      "Content": "Hi, What you are feeling is NORMAL! \"I'm extremely scared of what will happen.\" First, you need more specific information about you Mom's breast cancer. i.e. what kind does she have, what treatments are being reccommended, etc. Second, FORGET statistics !!! The numbers that you find are based on OLD survival rates. Surviving breast cancer increases daily because of the developments in treatments that enter the scene monthly. Third, Turn to whatever spiritual beliefs you practice and trust they will make you strong enough to be a help to you Mom. Fourth, be sure she has help while she is undergoing treatment and that means someone to go with her and to be at home when she needs extra house help. I doubt you can do that since you live so far away, but perhaps a neighbor, relative or someone. Fifth, Breast Cancer is NOT a death sentence!!! I found my breast cancer 12 years ago, had the proper treatments, and have had no further problems. If I knew how to send links, I have a lot that can be of help. Here I'll give it a try; http://www.cancer.org/docroot/LRN/LRN_0.asp?dt=5 http://www.breastcancer.org/ http://www.imaginis.com/ http://www.cancer.gov/ If these work, you can research your Mom's specific type of BC and get answers that may be helpful to you and to her.",

      "Content": "I think you and your Mom would do well to follow her Oncologists advise which will probably be a course of radiotherapy for the bone mets. I know many women who have been in the same situation with liver mets and the drugs/chemotherapy helped enormously. Most had shrinkgage in their nodules and a few had them disapear. You said; what can i do? pls help me.. some people says radiation/chemo could only shorten the lifespan of the patient.. is this true? Not true. There are a very few instances when the side effects of some do kill the patient, but that is true with other treatments not related to cancer. My advise is to follow the recommendations of her Oncologist and if she doesn't trust him/her, find a new one. Do NOT take any kind of alternatives unless her Oncologist knows about it and says it won't hurt her.",
