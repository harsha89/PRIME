At that time my oncologist said that as a result of the radiation you can have cracked or broken ribs up to 2 years after. Well it was 2 years and I was pulling weeds in my garden and it happened. After many xrays and scans having a hard time finding what was causing the pain, she sent me for a PET scan that found the 2 broken ribs. I was then told that they never heal completely. This is true because when I do certain poses in yoga I can feel them pull and I have to change position to make the pain go away. Just the other day I was leaning over tying my tennis shoes and I felt another rib crack. So it seems that this condition never goes away. Unless you really, really need the radiation, I would recommend not to have it. My cancer was a stage 1 and if I had it to do over again I would not have the radiation and just take my chances. I hope this helps others. my oncologist told me that pain in the breast area after radiation is typical and can last forever--off and on.Â  Mine has subsided quite a bit after nearly two years, but returns from time to time.",
