      "Content": "Hi, I had double mastectomies with silicone implant reconstruction.  My surgeon had said I would never have to have a mammogram again and now he says it is recommended.  I also have just had rectal cancer and have chest/abdominal CT's every 3 months.  I just wonder if I really need a mammogram.  Wouldn't a chest CT show something?  Anyone out there with mastectomies and implant reconstruction still getting mammograms? Appreciate your help!   RosyDosy  ",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your reply.  I actually went today to have the mammogram and explained everything. They still insisted that I have it.  I had put on the gown waiting for them to call me back and a nurse came out and asked me why I was having a mammogram.  She went back and asked the radiologist and he said I did not need one.  So I was examined by a P.A. and I nicely put my clothes back on and left!!!!!!!   RosyDosy",

I am not 100% if I remember this correctly (chemo brain) so make sure you ask a professional before you do anything. I think my friend had this and it was a reaction to the pre meds they gave her (steroids). Don't be afraid to ask. You are paying them. Thanks for replying! They do give me Benedryl before the chemo, but I don't know what else.  I will ask. Thanks!",

Breast Cancer and doing Herceptin, Perjeta, and Taxotere.  My hair started coming out so I had a friend shave it.  Then I noticed the bumps. (hurt and itch) I have been using Nioxin and have even put alcohol on them.  My doctor thought it was folliclitis at first, but noticed some on my back so he thinks it is from chemo.  He was hesitant to put me on an antiobiotic and didn't.  Anyone know what to do to get rid of the bumps??
