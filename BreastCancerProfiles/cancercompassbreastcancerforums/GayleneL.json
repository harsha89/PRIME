    "Content": "I am 13 years out from my breast cancer diagnosis and surgery (lumpectomy and breast reduction).   I had chemo and radiation treatments that followed.   Does anyone else experience a kind of spasm in the chest area when straining to reach?  I have experienced this quite frequently and for several years.  I think it first started approx.  3 years after surgery.  I first thought I was having a heart attack, but my doctor said it was from the scar tissue.  It can be quite painful.  Does anyone have suggestions to remedy or aliviate this?",
