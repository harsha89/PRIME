    "Content": "You may, also, want to contact the Y-Me Organization re your questions. You can find their web site on the internet. I receive their weekly newsletter. There's a message board that covers a myriad of cancer topics, and the organization has trained counselors to speak with you, or refer you to someone who can answer your questions. You can contact them 24-7. Have you discussed these issues with your primary Dr? I survived breast cancer 10 years ago and now have breast cancer of the liver. I am presently undergoing chemo treatments. I've been on the treatments for 7 mos and may need to go for a year. The prognosis is good. The disease is not curable, but it is controllable. I'll live with that. If there's any advice I may give, it's not to ever give up, and always maintain a good, positive attitude. Good luck!",
