    "Content": "I have just discovered your CancerCompass message of Oct 8, 2003. I am a male who had breast cancer in 1998. I had a mastectomy, took tamoxifen for five years, and I am still cancer free. How did your husband fare? I hope he is still with you and healthy. If either of you would like to correspond with another man who had breast cancer, please reply. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Lyn onein100",
