    "Content": "Greetings to all.  I need your input and encouragement...Last year my aunt (Mom;s baby sister) celebrated 5 years being cancer free (originally breast cancer with removal of a breast).  A couple of months ago she complained of back and leg pain. Last week she fell 3 times, went to the ER and test results showed the cancer is back and is now in her spine, hip, brain lesions, etc. She is in the hospital now, in a great deal of pain...they are keeping her sedated.  Has anyone survived the terminal stage or is this the end for her?  I am so worried, we love her dearly!",
