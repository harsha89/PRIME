I was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the year of 1995. I went to a lenghty treatment for that. During my treatment of chemo, I have noticed some unusual side effect including hearing things as you discribed. I can actually hear my heartbeat, whoosing sound, sarcastic loughing sound and low sound of someone talking like the conversation coming from a radio station. I went to my doctor and explain the whole thing. With my disgust, he started asking me if the voices I was hearing coming from man or woman and what were they talking about. I was so mad, I screamed and told him how the hell do I know what they were talking about. it's none of my concern. My concern was lacking of sleep due to my nerves damage. He prescribed aprasolam and I was able to get at least 4hours of sleep max. It then gradually disappeared but still exist once in a while. I just learned to ignore it. You are not out of your mind as my doctor was indicating. I since then changed health care provider. Now I was diagnosed with breast cancer. With all of the side effect I have experienced, I'm so scared s---less. How my system will cope with the second round of treatment. My system was badly beaten with the harsh treatment and now I have to go down that road once again. Back to your hearing sound you're not alone. Do not allow anyone to convince you that you're out of your mind. My suggestion to you is,  if you can  adjust to ignore it just try.  Proper sleep may help you achieve that as it did me.   I guess,I should say goodluck to everyone of us through our journey.                                                buang",

Teresa dear teresa, for 10 years I condemned my ownself for taking so many prescriptions. I was very angry why is it that it seems like i'm the only only living a miserable life after cancer treatment with so much side effect such as muscle pain and nauseating nerves pain and have to take pain killers just to be able to function in very limited passion. On top of that, I have to take anti anxiety drugs at night just to get 4 hours of sleep. I also developed a heart problem. I am now facing treatment for breast cancer for the second time. I am so lost and very confused wether get treatment again or just take defeat lying down. with all the drugs I had ingested into my system, I'm worried my liver and my kidney might not hold up. I was so glad finding this site hoping I will find support and advice from the outsider I cannot find from my own family. They're seem's to be very busy with their own. Yes I am married but it feels like it's just on papers. this is the reason why it felt I lost my faith on surviving. If you or anyone don't mind to throw in some input to my dilema, it will be appreciated deeply. I thank everyone of you. hopefully I will see some respond before I run out of time.     thank you everyone.                              buang  ",
