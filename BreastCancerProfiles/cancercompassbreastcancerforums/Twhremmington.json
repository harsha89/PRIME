      "Content": "Hi, Talk with your physician about getting Xanax or some sort or calming prescription to take prior to your chemo apt. It will help. I am 41 and was diagnosed with Metastic Adencarcinoma in july, still waiting to have my surgery, but my surgeon chose to go with chemo first. Loss of my hair was hard, but easier to adjust to than the pain of the Neulasta injection (causes bone pain). I am now on my 2nd round of chemo and looking towards the last treatment that is scheduled for new years eve. Taking the Xanax was the best thing I could have done for myself as the first chemo treatment caused me a HUGE anxiety attach that almost stopped the treatment! Hope this helps!",

      "Content": "I have heard that about the Claritin, I didn't try it, as the oncologist said there was no proof of it and I am already on so many meds. The nausea in the first 2 chemos you spoke of was really hard on me, even with all the drugs they give both during and after the chemo. The cytoxin will cause your excretions to be red/orange including your tears! They warned me of this, but I still scared myself in October as the chemo really caused some serious dry eyes and then they watered red! Imagine that as a Halloween prank! I'm on the Taxotere now, it includes muscle aches as it's biggest side effect. Add that to the Neulasta injection and you can only imagine the achiness both produce. Also, towards the end of the A/C chemo I got a skin rash that itched like nobody's business. 50mg of benedryl and 600mg of ibuprofen for the inflammation was the only thing I found that allowed me to function without trying to rip my skin off! All in all it's been tough, but YOU can do it! Nobody that has not been through this will truly understand how you are feeling, don't allow them to force you into something you feel you can't do. I also have used quite a bit of essential oils for the side effects with great results, if interested pm me and I'll let you know what helped. Don't forget to detox yourself after the chemo, let it in your body to do it's job and then \"help\" it get out as quickly as possible!",

      "Content": "That injection was deffinately the hardest, but a necessary evil as my counts have not dropped once through this and the amount of chemo is known to cause those counts to drop and delay your treatment until they come up. My loss of hair started about day 13 after the first treatment. My best friend took me to the local cancer store and we bought the cutest hats, I made an apointment with an awesome wig store and got in with them while I still had hair, and off to home where my girlfriend helped me shave it off. I cried, it felt like a huge part of my identity was missing. I have a wonderful fiance in my life who won't let me forget that this is all temporary and soon enough everything will be back where it is supposed to be. My next treatment is tomarrow and then only 2 more left. I can hardly wait to start growing my hair again, and though it's been awesome not having to shave my legs, I'm kinda looking forward to doing it again! You have already been through the first 1/2 of this, just as I'm getting ready to finish my first 1/2, we are ALL tough, you just get through it, nobody understands how, hell I don't even understand how, but we do. I keep going because of my kids (now 20 and 21, both young ladies), my fiance, and my horses. Find something to fight for because if you don't, you will get swallowed up in this. One step at a time and it will be done before you know it!",
