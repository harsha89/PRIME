    "Content": "Hi, I'm not sure if you still check your messages. I did a search and only four messages showed up. I just noticed the date you wrote this and it was in 2004. Please let me know how you are doing. My mother just had a ct scan that showed multiple masses in her rt breast and have metastasized to her liver.  Innumerable in her liver.  She doesn't have insurance & came to stay with me a few months back.  I just found out about all of it, when I took her to the ER last week.  I live in Houston, TX where we just had a devastating hurricane, Ike.  I'm waiting on the DAMP office at UTMB in Galveston, but I'm not sure that they are up and running, yet due to the storm.  I feel so hopeless.  I need someone to help me get her some help.  Thanks, Kate",
