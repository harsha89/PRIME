      "Content": "Terry-- You didn't upset me...Believe me this is something I've already thought of. We all fall short of feeling sorry for ourselves when you go through pain and suffering. It's hard not to when you've had your parents all your life and know that they might not be with you much longer. I do believe in God and YES I've been upset with him. Sure we all go through several different types of emotions when going through these trials of life. God really knows my heart and he knows that I can be upset with him at times. He is a God of all understanding.. You may want to look towards your family since you are the one who has cancer. They just might be going through the same feelings as I am. They will need support and comfort just like the ones who are sick. Thanks for your response. Take care of yourself and family.",

      "Content": "Michelle-- Wow! What can I say... you must be an amazing woman to be going through all of this. I can totally relate to your feelings. Yes, it is a nightmare and there are times/days I feel that I'm truly going insane. There are times when I feel that our family is being punished for some reason?? There are times when I feel that my kids are getting robbed of their grandparents and vice versa. My Mom & Dad will not get to see my kids first love, first date, etc. It's just flat out not fair. We've always been taught life was not fair but I guess I figured it would never be this unfair to me. I have some of the same questions as you to God. They always say he seems to take the \"good ones\". If he took all the bad ones, it would never affect other peoples life. Easier said than done uh? Your absolutely right! I'm looking at life differently now. I look back at all the wasted time and energy that I had realizing that I should have made the best of every moment and I should have done it with more love. Yes, maybe time will heal our wounds. Take Care of yourself!!",

      "Content": "My Father has bone cancer and my Mom has breast cancer. Both are terminally ill right now. They gave my father a yr to live in Feb. of this year and my Mother 6 months just recently. Unfortunately, my Mom's cancer has spread to her lungs and there is not a whole lot they can do for her. As we all know with bone cancer there's not much hope either. What I can't seem to understand is why is my family having to go through this at the same time. It's not like one yr my father and a few years later my Mother....No it's all at once. On top of things, they have been divorced since I was thirteen and I'm spread very thin between the two trying to take care of them. I don't feel I can really give time to either of them like I should be able to. I'm very mad right now and upset with God. If my parents are going to go through this then why couldn't it be at different times so we can at least spend \"quality time\" together. ?? I just don't get it. Both my parents are very young. My father is 57 and my Mother is 54. This really makes me wonder what kind of health future that my Brother and I will have and our kids? Has anyone been through this with both parents at the same time?",
