I have been told by a breast specialist that i have some fibrocrstic tissue in my left breast, but lately my right breast seems to be a bit larger than my left breast. I don't know if it matters or not but I don't get normal periods and havent had one this month I am about a week late and am not sure if this could be related, I plan on going to the doctors I just wanted to get some info on what this could possible be before I go. I don't have any other symptoms. Hi, I am 57 and have had breast cancer twice.  My experience both times was an unusual lump or formation and that the specific area was warm.  Just felt different that the other tissue.  Not sure about the whole breast being larger but would try not to worry.  Also your age is on your side.",
