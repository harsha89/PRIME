      "Content": "In the French study above, Transipeg is actually identical to Miralax - PEG 3350. It is also effective and superior to lactulose, but the taste is not as palatable as Forlax. Forlax looks even more effective than Transipeg/Miralax. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9054308 http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/53/11/1590",

      "Content": "Another option is cellulose-based fibers. I've taking a local version of this refined cellulose product before, and I find it alright. It doesn't really cause gas or cramping. It doesn't gel up too, unlike bran, psyllium or isphagula husk fiber products (Metamucil, Fybogel), which you have to make sure you drink plenty of water or else they may cause choking or blockages. Psyllium also gives me cramps. http://www.unifiber.com/productinfo.html http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090502225806AA",
