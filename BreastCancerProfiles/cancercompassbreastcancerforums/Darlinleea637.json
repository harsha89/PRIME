    "Content": "my mother in law was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer a few months ago.. the cancer had spread to her brain.. i dont know much about breast cancer, just that she was first diagnosed in 2005, and had it removed, underwent radiation therapy, and chemo therapy.  she finished that and was doing real well, on her feet and living her life, until january 2007 when a tumor was found at the base of her brain (it was the cerebrum i believe?) so now she is diagnosed with stage 4, and is on chemo once again.  for the past two months she has been in bed, non-mobile, not eating, getting up to shower or anything.  I believe she has given up on life once she was given the news of the stage 4 cancer.  she has two sons, who are twins in their 20's, her husband, and a mother who is a breast cancer survivor, and me who all support her and would love to see her well again. the problem is that she is now majorly depressed and havent gotten out of bed for two months. we have tried to seek help but all they gave her were anti-depressants.  we all work full-time jobs, and go to school. when we get up in the morning she is in bed, and when we get home in the evening she is still in the same position. She doesnt eat all day, but smokes cigarettes.  she is doing everything wrong to better herself and she wont allow any of us to help her in anyway.  if we tell her she needs to go to the hospital to be seen that she is well nourished and taken care of, we are criticized for not \"loving her\" and not \"wanting her around\".  please we need help on what to do. we all love her dearly and want to see her at her best and want to live... what options do we have? any advice is greatly appreciated!  leea",
