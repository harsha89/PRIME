      "Content": "I am very sorry to hear about your wife. My father, age 63, was diagnosed with carcinoma meningitis at the end of August. For the past 15 years he has had melenoma in multiple areas of his body, but was in remission for the past 5-6 years until March of 2005 when he had a tumor on his acustic nerve removed and then radiated. he also had a few tiny spots on his spine radiated as well, all responded very well to the radiation. When diagnosed with carcinoma meningitis his symptoms were poor balance, diziness, absent seizures and severe back pain and loss of hearing. While in the hospital he also developed a hoarseness to his voice and his balance rapidly declined as did his strength. At that point he began chemotherapy called the dartmouth regimen through a port. So far he has had two treatments and has been out of the hospital for almost 6 weeks. His progress is amazing. His seizures and pain are controlled by medicine, but his balance and strength are vastly improved. Also, his voice is back to normal, and even his hearing, which was the first thing to be effected, is improved. He is getting stronger every day and hopefully his progress will continue. So far the doctor is very pleased with everything he is seeing. I hope your wife has similar success with her treatments. Alyse",

      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your mother, however a positive attitude is a good thing, and I am convinced that my father's positive attitude towards beating the meningitis kept him alive longer. As for symptoms, my father experienced absent seizures, hearing loss (which was heightened due to a tumor on his acustic nerve), trouble with balance and walking, weaking of his voice, drooping of one side of his face, and a strange sensation in his hands which he described as feeling like string was wrapped around each finger. As the disease progressed, within his last month of life he become increasingly disoreineted and mixed up wrods, became agitated with my mother (his primary care giver) which required medicine. There were times when he lost feeling in various parts of his body. The last two weeks he was very disoriented and began incoherent rambling. I hope this information helps you and your mother. Also know that our doctor told us that all patients react differently and present with different symptoms. If you would like any more information about my experience with my father feel free to contact me at --- Message edited by CancerCompass staff: for personal protection, email address removed.

      "Content": "Hello all, I wrote a few months ago about my father's positive response to treatment and how with chemo he was improving and many of symptoms were vanishing. Unfortunately, this past november he became weaker, and in december the doctors decided to stop chemo. In the beginning of January, his doctor suggested that we call hospice, and from there it was a long and agonizing three weeks of constant deterioration. By the last week and a half, my father had no idea where he was, and only recognized his wife and children during fleeting moments of clarity. He passed away Januwary 29th. I know all of us on this thread have had loved ones plagued by this disease, and I was wondering if anyone knew of research being done to find further treatment for this horrid disease. I would love to get involved with raising awareness about carcinoma meningitis, but have no idea where to start. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Alyse",
