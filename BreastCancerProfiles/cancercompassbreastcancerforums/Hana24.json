      "Content": "Sarah, thank you so much for responding. Im so sorry for your loss. I cant believe it was only a wk ago and what you are going through. The think w/ my mom is that she doesnt want anyone to know what she is going through and dosent what me to worry. I had to find out everything from my aunt who also lives w/us. She told me that my mom is more scared of the double dose of chemo and rad treatment again then anything. My aunt said it hurt her so much that she would fall asleep w/ tears rolling down her check. It hurt to know my mom was in that much pain and now she has to go through it again, twice as more. Also whats sad it that she has always had a rough life support me by her self. If i could i wish i had the cancer and not her.  I always wondered why her?  We have no one in our familly that has any kind of cancer? I just hope god dosent take her from me anytime soon. I feel she's not ready to go and im not ready to say goodbye. I just hope god has been listening to my prayers. Well thank you and i send you my best wishes to you and your new son.",

      "Content": "Hi ashley. sounds like we have alot in common. My mom was dx in 04 and it came back this yr/january in her lymph node(above collar bone). She had to take chemo and radiation again. Was approved for tykerb in march. Pet and cat scan in june. Her oncologist said it looked good. That the cancer in her lymph nodes dont look like it's getting bigger. They had to take her off chemo/rad early last week due to her high blood pressure/heart problems. Also cut her med(tykerb) in 1/2. We are kinda relieved that she wont have to go to the hospital as much which was about 3 times a wk and the hospital is 40min away:( But also scared that since she is stopping everything early, does that mean the cancer can spread faster if its not being treated??? Also the chemo was causing her nail infection/numbness of her feet and fingers/cant taste anything and bleeding of the gums in her mouth. i know exactly how you feel when you think that this is not fair and that it hurts to see her like this. Sometimes i wish it was me and not her. And it has brought our familly closer but we always been really close b/c we are a small family that live within 10 miles of  eachother. It's really hard for me b/c she is my only parent and i constantly worry about her and can concentrate in school /work/ or my own relationship. Thank god my boyfriend has always been supportive and understanding. There are plenty of moments were i just feel like crying and he is there to hold me and cry together. Sometimes crying just feels good.. If you ever need to talk please send private messege. I would love to talk and help relieve the pain we all are going through. Hana",

I know it means the cancer has come back, but does she have to go through chemo again or does it mean she is going to DIE fro m this now?

Not knowing the facts exactly as they are will cause you more stress and grief. This is not the place to get medical advice but definately the place to get support. I know how afraid you must be right now. Talk to your family and friends and especially your mom. Life would go on even without your mom but cherish each moment with her. Even if the lump is another cancer I am sure they will treat it promptly. Just make sure that you and your mom are very involved with her health care and educate yourself as much as possible. The book \"Living Through Breast Cancer\" by Carolyn M. Kaelin, M.D., M.P.H. is a wonderful resource written by an oncologist breast cancer survivior. Best of luck to you and your mom. Linda Lou     Hi Linda, Thank you for responding .  I have tried contacting my mom's Dr. but the receptionist says she is always unavailable at the time. Finally i sat down with my mom and asked her what exactly is going on cause i need to know and im very scared for her. Well she said her Dr. was just checking around her breast when she felt something unnormal around her port, so she recommend my mom to see her surgery Dr. to check. Well my mom went there asap. She told me that her surgery Dr. thinks it might be some dead tissue around her port and she shouldnt really worry about anything. Plus she just had a full exam about 3 mths ago and everything was OK. So im keeping my fingers crossed. I dont really know how many stages there is, my mom said 4 and that she is b/w the beginning and middle. Is that bad? B/c of her stage she said they put her on some new med that my cause side effects like heart problems wich she has had alot thats why she's not completely finish w/her treatment. Well thank you gotta go back to work. If you have any more advise for me I would be very thankful.  Hana",

Found out that it came back in her lymph node above her collar bone. They removed it but her oncologist said when cancer comes back in the lymph  node that means it can spread b/c its a blood stream. thats why its not curable but the tx they do is more chemo and radiation to help control the cancer from spreading or to shrink the cancer. My mom has already started tx. Also that are mom will always have to have tx for the rest of there lives until unless it has spread to much. But just a mth ago i believe the FDA has just approved a med called tykerb thats just for recurrent breast cancer pt's like our mom. It supposed to trigger only the cancer cells and not the good ones. Ask her oncologist about it. Dont forget though that it just got approved so it's still basically a trial, not a 100% sure. You can look it up on google. There are some side effects like high blood pressure, diahrreah and some others. Well good luck, Ill keep your mom in my prayer",
