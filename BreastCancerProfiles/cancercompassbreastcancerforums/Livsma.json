Everything was great for 15 years, but then I started having problems: thyroid cancer, bowel obstructions caused by adhesions (scar tissue), breast cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, aortic valve damage....all attributed to radiation (not anecdotally, but by all of the doctors). The breast cancer was the one that really threw me, because I hadn't heard about that as a potential side effect. I'd love to hear from anyone who has experienced. BC or any long term side effects from radiation. Thank you!Hi my name is Deb and I know this post is 5-6 months old but I stumbled upon it doing some research. I had mantle radiation in 1995 after 7 months of chemotherapy after a dx of hodgkins disease. I have had multiple complications from the radiation treatments. It started 7 years post treatment. Had a baby and post partum ended up in ICU in congestive heart failure, from a damaged mitral valve most likely from the radiation. On meds forever now for that and hope that I won't need a valve replacement in the future but it's a possibility. I have pulmonary issues also, shortness of breath and a constant cough. Then my thyroid started messing with me. Hypothyroidism. I take meds for that too. Then in late 2010 I was dx with breast cancer, in both breasts. Again probably from the radiation, but because the cancer was bilateral, they will never be able to say for sure. Anyway, had a bilateral mastectomy. Got severe bilateral necrosis post surgery, again because of the radiation in 1995. Had to have skin grafting done. I am one year post diagnosis. It's been an uphill battle , but I continue to fight it. I am on tamoxifin for the next 5 yrs, hopefully that won't do anything to me. So I understand where you are coming from and I think there are probably more of us out there. How are you now? What are they doing for you now? My oncologist did tell me that I had an increased risk of breast cancer. Hope you are well. Deb",
