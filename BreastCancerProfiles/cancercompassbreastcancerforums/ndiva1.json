    "Content": "Hello....I have an aunt that was diagnosed in December with stage IV breast cancer. It has spread to her bone, lymph nodes, and her lung. The doctors have told her that her tumor is inoperable. She is living with this tumor on her body...it has broken through the skin, which I didn't even know was possible. She has received radiation for the past few months and it has helped a little. She refuses chemo....because of the side effects and her negative attitude about her diagnosis. I guess what I am asking to whoever has any information is........ should she go get a second opinion?, should she go to an area that specializes in breast cancer? I know there is a great cancer center in Rochester, NY and others. (we live in NY state). Is there any chance that she can prolong her life? I realize that her cancer isn't curable, but is there a chance that a doctor would operate on her? Or is the tumor too invasive and has to stay on her body? Is each doctor different with their prognosis and will going somewhere else make a difference for her? Right now she has only seen a couple doctors at our local hospital. What other treatments may help her? What foods are good for her to eat? She hides her pain a lot so its hard to talk to her about this but I need to talk to someone who has experienced this or has helpful information that I can discuss with her.    Thank you very much for your time :)",
