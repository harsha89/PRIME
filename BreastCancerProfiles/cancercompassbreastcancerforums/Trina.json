I had a mastectomy and radiotherapy to the chest wall. I did not need chemotherapy.I am on Tamoxifen for five years. In 2007 I had an LD Breast reconstruction. Recently I have found a very tiny lump on th escar of th ereconstruction. I am now terrified that it has come back. I have made an appointment to get it checked out bu t I am very anxious and so many questions keep popping up in my head. If the cancer has returned how will they deal with it if I have had a reconstruction? Will I have to have chemo this time round? If it is not cancer again what could th ehard lump be? Any advice appreciated. Thinking of you all.x   I also had reconstruction and found a place that concerned me on my scar.  They ran all the test, and determined that it was only scar tissue.  The place is still there, but I don't worry about it anymore.  And with time, the pain that was associated with it went away.  This was almost 2 years ago So I hope this helps and that yours is just scar tissue.",
