      "Content": "Hi! I'm sorry to hear you are dealing with this! I would recommend probiotics as well. I get mine from the local vitamin store 50 billion (refrigerated kind). Also, have you tried Apple cider vinegar? I drink 1 teaspoon mixed with 1 cup of cold water (use a straw because can be hard on teeth). I do it twice a day. Lots of great articles out there about it's benefits. I use both probiotics and the Apple cider vinegar because I take a low dose daily antibiotics for my face. Helps even out the good and back bacteria in the gut to prevent candida/yeast/kidney/ bladder infections.",
