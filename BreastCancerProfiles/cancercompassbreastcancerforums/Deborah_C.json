      "Content": "Hello to everyone who responded to this e-mail...I must say that I too am feeling the same way many of you are. Truthfully, if anyone tells me to \"be positive\" just one more time, I may lose it. Yes it is difficult to get on with our lives and we aren't all these wonderfully \"transformed\" people that we hear about. In 1997 I had a mastectomy followed by several high dose treatments of chemotherapy. Doctors didn't think I'd make it through the year. Well I did...I thought my family needed me and I completely changed my diet, took supplements and tried some of the alternative approaches that are available...It's been over 5 years now, but this past year my cancer was found throughout my spinal cord and in my hip socket. Had radiation treatment and now am having Zometa treatments (a bone building treatment) and am on Femara. I attempted to return to school to become a massage therapist, but had to quit because of my illness. So now I am kind of stuck in a job that I'm not esp. thrilled about because my husband has had a difficult time finding work that is consistent. And I also carry the Health Insurance Benefits, so I will have to work until I drop. I feel ok except for minor pains and all and it most likely is better that I do work. Well anyway...I too am feeling very discouraged and the \"waiting for the other shoe to drop\" expression is exactly how I feel. I made an effort to become a massage therapist and thought my life would really be different. But I guess it just wasn't in the cards. Now, I just can't seem to move on anymore. I'm tired and just feel that I don't have long for this world. It seems that I've suffered long enough and that I've had my share, but problems just keep surfacing and I'm tired of dealing with them...I really don't know where to turn. I don't want to take any anti-depressant because I want to be able to deal with these feelings. I've been on those before and its as if you have no feeling. It's just hard to move forward. I just wish I could find some peace in all of this.",

      "Content": "Hello Jan, I just want to thank you for your understanding and for your sharing your faith. I DO believe angels are helping us...guess I just struggle with letting myself have total comfort and trust in that. I'm trying to cope and may go back to a counselor again. I want to make the best of my life, but just get real down in the dumps at times. It just seems like I've had enough pain in my life and would really like to have that be over with. I would really like to experience some true JOY before I leave this world and to maybe be able to share that with others. I am searching and will hopefully find the peace I need. Thank you and good luck to you with your struggle. Please write again soon and thanks again for the understanding words. Deb",

      "Content": "Hello Doris, It sounds like we are experiencing the same kind of recurrence and that we are being treated in a similar manner. I don't have any answers and feel discouraged...My doctor just acts like this is all \"normal\" and seems to think I should accept it. I'm having a difficult time doing that. I am also on Zometa, a bone-building drug along with Femara. I ache a bit and have pains now and then and never really know what's going on...How often do you have tests? What tests do you have? What does your Doctor tell you? Does he ever tell you how long it will take for the cancer to become unmanageable or how long the treatments might last? I know they don't have answers, but I really get tired of not being told anything. Please share more of what you are experiencing, I feel very alone in this. Deb",
