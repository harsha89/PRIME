I am getting my first round of chemo this Monday wich is also my 45th bday ughhh..l  thanks   The chemo is a must, so take it!  I took 3 types for 6 months as I was stage 3 breast cancer in 2005 - the only side effect I had other the hair loss was exhaustion.  I literally slept most of the time. However, I have friends that worked the whole time.  I hope you will be like them.  It's worth it though, as I'm here 8 yrs later. I have just been diagnosed with a recurrance in my bone mrrow and am taking Afinitor which has wonderful reviews and hopefully will keep me kicking around for many more years! Good luck to you - I believe you will do fine!     I was diagnosed in September with triple negative breast cancer and also had double mastectomies with reconstruction.  I actually just had my 3rd round of chemo, Cytoxan and Taxotere yesterday and I just got back to work after having my Neulasta injection.  I thought that the side effect of losing my hair would be horrible but actually it was much less painful than I thought.  I get tired from it all but as I had read many posts before I started this journey..it do-able.  You just do what you have to do to survive.  I still have 5 more treatments to go and I shouldn't have to have any radiation or at least not on the agenda yet.  Hope everyone is doing well.  :) Kris, gee I forgot I had the radiation for 30 days - I have very fair skin and had some burning, but a friend told me to use cornstarch as a powder and it would help, and it did.  Seems so long ago that I had this cancer.  Have no pain with this recurrance in bone marrow and so far no bad side effects of the Atinitor.  Lots of my friends have better hair than they had before!  It's just part of the treatment.  I belong to a Dragon Boat Team and we are all breast cancer survivors.  We race in the US and Canada -great exercise and you can't beat the women, just fabulous.  If there is a team near you, you might want to check into it.  just google 'Dragon boat teams for breast cancer' in your state or city and see what comes up.  Hope it works for you! kitty",
