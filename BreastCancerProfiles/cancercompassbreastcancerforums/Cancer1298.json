    "Content": "Does anyone have any advice on alternative screening for breast cancer? For some reason I find mammograms to be the worst sort of torture, maybe because I am so small chested. You just can't stretch so little material out over such a large plate!! At any rate I'm hoping there are some good alternatives as I would like to have a screening once a year (I am 57). Thanks...Cici",
