I too have had to have 2 cancer surgeries. Ovarian and Brest cancer with 9 lymphs nodes removed. I had 9 months of Chemo and was out on Arimdex for 5 years, After they took my off of that, I now have more cancer. I have been looking for a lawyer for about 2 years now to take my case, but they keep telling me that the case should have been filed back when I was going through cancer surgeries. If anyone knows of a lawyer that can help me, Please let me know.",
