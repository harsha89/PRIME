      "Content": " Thanks everybody for the information...it helps. I guess the deal is, stage 1, grade 1 we were counting on Radiation and Tamoxifen only,  so when the Onco told us what her plan was regardless of the outcome of the Oncotype results, our jaws dropped. I immediately started looking online about these two drugs. I mean , even the Taxotere website (the makers of this drug!) didn't hardly have anything positive to say about the product that they create...not just things like hair loss, vomiting, diarrhea but things like \u2018may cause life threatening side effects such as secondary cancers, infection, low blood cell counts, etc etc\u201d\u2026So we\u2019re thinking, who the heck in their right mind would even want to even think about taking this drug? Anyway we appreciate the comments and good luck to all\u2026.we\u2019re all in this thing together.",

      "Content": "Hi All - Just a follow up...my wife's Oncotype DX results came back and the good news is her score was only 13, which obviously puts her in the low category... So as result, we have decided to forgo the Cytoxan and Taxotere chemo treatments and stick with the Radiation and Tamoxifen only plan...due to situation (stage 1-grade 1, low score, etc) our Oncologist was fine and OK with this (which gives us some comfort) and supported our decision. Thanks to all for the info and good luck to everyone...",

      "Content": "Hi All - Does anybody have insight to the chemo drugs Cytoxan and Taxotere? Everything I read seems to be negative. In a nutshell, my 46 y/o wife had stage 1, lymph node-negative breast cancer , with the tumor being under 2cm. The oncologist has informed us that she wants to administer this Cytoxan and Taxotere cocktail every three weeks for a total of 4 treatments...this along with the usual tamoxifen treatment and radiation. We're not sure what to do because my opinion is that this seems to be a bit extreme based on the circumstances...or maybe not. Any opinions? Thanks for the help.",
