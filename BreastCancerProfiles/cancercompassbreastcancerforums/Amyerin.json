      "Content": "My mother, 58, was diagnosed with Metastatic Breast cancer which has spread to her lungs, brain and liver. She is currently on Gemzar & Taxol combo. Chemo and radiation for her brain. As of today she has finished 13 days of radiation and is on her second session of her second cycle of chemo. Her local Dr. is not very optimistic that is has been effective. Is there something else that she should try? We are working towards getting her into the CTCA in Zion hoping they can help us ASAP!!!! Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!",
