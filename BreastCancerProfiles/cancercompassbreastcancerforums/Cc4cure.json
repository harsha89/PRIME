When I did my research on it, what I understood it to say was that soy actually jumps in and takes a place on an estrogen receptor, which blocks the estrogen from grabbing that place. That is a good thing. Some docs say yay and some say nay. Look into it and understand what they are saying about soy's estrogen blocking effects. Me...I am on the side that says its okay. ----------------------------------------------- Where is the cure??? www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

You can read a little about that here: www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org/eating.htm One thing to remember is that as long as cancer is stable, it will not kill you. That is why docs are so happy if they can even get their patients to stabilize. A person can live with a cancerous tumor in their body, forever...as long as it does not grow and spread. The metastasis, whereby it spreads and destroys tissue is what is toxic to the body and what kills. Wishing you the best. C",

With the negatives, the greater chance for recurrence is the few years after the initial diagnosis, with much less chance for recurrence after those first few years of being cancer free. That, to me, is good news. With positives, the chance for recurrence does not diminish as greatly, over the years, due to the fact that their cancer is hormone driven. The reason why you may read that having negative receptors is bad is only because after our initial treatment, there is nothing else that can be done for us. There are no inhibitors we can take. I believe they are working on a vaccine for us negatives, which is now in clinical trials.\"",

      "Content": "I had skin-sparing, bilateral mastectomies, prophylactic on the left. They did the diep at the same time. I initially had a lumpectomy, but the doc didn't get clean margins. My cancer was so bad and so aggressive that the doc sent me straight to chemo, telling me that I didn't have time for mastectomy, right then. I had to get chemo right away. Anyway, once I was done with chemo, my onc sent me for rads, even though I was having mastectomies. I told the rad onc that I was having mastectomies. He told me it was best to have the rads because I didn't want the bc coming back in the skin. So, I had 33 rads. I then had to wait at least 6 months ( I waited 7) before I could have my dieps. After 7 months, I had the surgery and now I have breast that are so normal looking and feeling that I never even missed my other breasts. No one would even know that I had mastectomies, unless I told them. Necrosis is a piece of the fat that dies. It gets hard and feels like a lump. I had 4 areas of necrosis...three in the radiated breast and one in the non-cancerous breast. Many times they dissappear on their own, but your doc can also go in at the stage 2 revsion and break it up so that it dissolves better. One of mine dissolved. Just waiting for the others to dissolve. It can take a long time. Yes, I did have axillary dissection, along with snb, when I had my lumpectomy. I had 17 nodes removed. Three were positive. I never had any problem with lymphedma. I have never heard of any woman getting lympedema after diep. Not saying it isn't true, I just have never heard of one case. Basically, the necrosis, as it relates to diep, is a section of the transferred fat that dies due to it not having enough blood reaching it. It is best to have both sides done at the same time, for a few reasons: 1. One surgery, which means that you only have to go under anesthesia the one time. 2. One recovery. You get it over all at once, instead of being down, twice. 3. They will be able to better match your breasts and make them symmetrical, if done at the same time....etc. I also lived alone when I had my surgery (now caregiver to my elderly mom). It is so doable. I know that we are all different and what is easy for one person is not as easy for another. I took only one pain pill in the hosipital (5 days). I was out walking on day 8, was at Harrah's on day 9 and I shopped all day on day 10. I took a few of the pain pills after I was out of the hospital. Just a few. I was able to shower and wash my hair on day three. I never needed any help getting out of the bed or doing anything for myself. I couldn't reach the top cabinet shelves, however. I never had any surgical pain in my breast. I had a lot of discomfort in my tummy, but I can't call it pain. Out of all of the recons available, diep has the less pain and less complications than the others. Go over to www.nolasociety.org/forum and view some of the posts. The forum is for women interested in, having or had diep or gap reconstructions. It is a little slow, so you may wait a bit for a response, but it is growing, as it is new. Maybe you can read some info there that will help you.",

      "Content": "Correct. No blood pressure, no blood draws, etc should be taken from the arm where you had axillary dissection. I think you read too much between the lines. Yes, I did have someone with me, but what I stated was that I did not need anyone to help me. I had someone with me but I could have very well traveled alone and gotten along very well. Some people can do that just fine, others really need to rely on someone. The absolutely only thing I had help with was the limo driver lifting my suitcase out of the trunk of the car. I tugged it, as my daughter had her own bags to tug. When my daughter and I went shopping, I carried bags. Heavy ones. We had shopped so much that I had to help get the bags back to McFarland. Basically, I had company. I did not need to rely on anyone for help. So, there was not much difference, at all. I basically \"hoofed\" on my own. If you have the correct drain belt, drains are a nusiance, but not so great of a problem. I think it all depends on how one views situations. If you tell yourself they will be a problem...then they will be. With a drain belt, you put place the tubes through the loops and move on. When you take a shower, tie a terry cloth robe belt around your neck and pin the drains to it and your hands are free. Wring the belt, hang it over the rod to dry, until the next shower. Some women come home with 0 to 2 drains. I had one. After three weeks, I removed it myself. You have one drain at the bottom of each breast and one drain on each side of the pubic area. I faxed them a copy of my docs recommendations for mastectomy and my history. I took with me only the copy of my mammo's. 48 pounds overweight is but a mere issue, compared to some of the heavier women that have this surgery. Go the the \"Before & After\" section of this site, to see photos: www.breastcenter.com. You really do not want to lose weight, as the tissue from your tummy will lose and gain weight just as it did on the tummy. You want to go into surgery as close to your normal weight as possible. If you are 48 pounds overweight, that is fine, as long as you are healthy and do not smoke. If you do smoke, you will need to stop before and after the surgery. Not sure why you are feeling vain to consider this surgery. You want to feel whole. That is how God made you and you have the right to be whole again. No vainity here. If your leg was amputated, would you feel vain to want your leg back, if that were possible? If your ear was amputated, would it mean you were vain to want your ear back? Your breast is another part of your body. Would a man be considered vain if his \"you know what\" was amputated he he had the opportunity to have it reconstructed? I think not.

We may not have any other treatments available to us after chemo, but what we do have going for us is that the farther out from diagnosos we get, the less chance we have for recurrence. They say that after the first two years, which is the most common chance of recurrence for us, the recurrence rate diminishes greatly. After you get to five years, it is said that we are once again like the normal population. Women with positive receptors do not get this chance. They are at strong risk for recurrence for the rest of their lives. We are at less risk for recurrence the farther out we get. Some women are so fearful of being triple negative...I was happy to be - - -. When my breast surgeon told me I was triple negative, I went \"Yesssss!\" and he looked at me like I was crazy. I did not want any part of those meds that the positive receptor women have to take. Many of them have horrific side effect for all of the years they have to take it. They have to be screened closely for uterine cancer, if they are on Tamoxifen. I am sorry I got BC, but I feel I lucked out with the bc that I got...bad report and all. I am 5 years and two months out from diagnosis and I have not had a recurrence...knock on wood.

      "Content": "I traveled by plane from California to New Orleans to have my surgery. I could have managed it by myself, because the plastic surgeon I went to had a limo pick me up at the airport and take me back. The driver lifted my luggage, though my daughter was there for the return. My PS took great care of me. If daughter wasn't there, I would have tipped a handler to do it for me. My daughter flew into New Orleans on day 7, thinking I would need taken care of. My sis was there with me for the first week, but she left on the morning of the day I was discharged, so she wasn't there if I needed anything, but was there for company while I was in the hospital. I was discharged on Sunday and my daughter arrived on Tuesday, at midnight, so I was there, alone, for going into 3 days. I never needed help with anything at all. The nurses kept calling me a \"phenomenon\". When my daughter arrived, she called me to let me know she was a couple of minutes away. I was staying at McFarland Inn, which was a building attached to the hospital. Everything closes up after a certain hour and the only entrance is through the emergency room. I went down there to meet her. She said she was so shocked when she saw me because she was expecting a sick looking mom, bent over and in pain and what she saw was a mom standing straight, smiling. Since Katrina, the docs have relocated. Still in Louisiana, but just not in New Orleans. I think they are in Meterie (sp?). No...not saying rads have influence on diep. It would be the same no matter what recon you have, probably except the pedicle tram...which you really do not want to think about...believe me. Women can get necrosis, without surgery, just by getting hit in the breast. I also had an area of necrosis in the non-radiated breast. It just so happened that I had 3 areas in the radiated breast and one in the other. It could have been vice versa. Never think it is too late. Women have recons even when they have find out that they have mets. You have to do what makes you feel good and whole...no matter what. I, too, was very lucky in not having mets. I do so much research and take supps to help keep it at bay. Docs have expected me to recur before now, but so far so good. I am nearly 3.5 years out from diagnosis. If I were you, I would certainly ask my PS about the issue with your having nodes removed from both axillaries and if that would cause concern. Believe me, by the time you leave, you won't be at a stage where you will pass out at the airport. You will feel quite well, with some soreness in the abdomen. You will be able to walk, sit, stand, without much effort. I was in New Orleans for 13 days. The norm is about 10, when you travel. I stayed the extra 3 days on my own. I had gone there not knowing what to expect and did not want to come home til I knew I would be fine, so I booked 13 days. I actually felt well enough to come home by day 6 or 7. cc4cure (aka Cindy) www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

It grew from the size of the dime, when I found it, to almost 5cm's by the time I had surgery. I had 4 AC and 4 Taxotere, plus 33 rads. Docs were expecting me to recur by now, as I had extensive angiolymphatic invasion and multi focal spread. I did tons of research and after my treatments, I started taking a lot of supplements, to include IP6, with inositol hexaphosphate. I also take Turmeric, quercetin and everything I could find that was anti-tumor, to include, enzymes and aspirin a few times per week. What I found through my research is that researchers believe there is a connection between inflammation in the body and cancer, as everywhere they find cancer, they find inflammation. So I take a lot of supps that are natural anti-inflammatories, as well as anti-tumor. So far, so good. cc4cure www.truefacesofbreastcancer.org",

Please review CancerCompass Member Guidelines at http://www.cancercompass.com/common/guidelines.html-- I STILL have ringing in my ears...4 years after finishing chemo. I was also left with headaches (daily) and other stuff. In May, I lost all hearing in my right ear. It came back gradually over 4 days. People sounded like they were talking like chipmunks, as the hearing was coming back. I look at all of the stuff I was dealt, with having the chemo, but had I not had it, I would not have survived. I know I have been made old before my time...but I am so thankful to be alive. Where is the cure??? truefacesofbreastcancer.org",
