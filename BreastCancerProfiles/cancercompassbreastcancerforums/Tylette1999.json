      "Content": "Oh yes, I definitely realize this is a message board only. it's just nice hearing what other people have done with something similar and making sure that I'm just not paranoid I guess. I am going to see my family doctor on Thursday to just get an opinion. My mother actually was going there for her annual when they found her lump. They know her history and might take me a bit more seriously. Maybe I am overreacting, but like everyone has sad, best to be cautious with this. Thanks again for your help. I am definitely going to keep your suggestion in mind if nobody else will do anything.",

      "Content": "Hello, I just found this board and have some questions. About a month ago I went in to have my pap done. Of course the nurse practitioner does the breast exam. She told me to keep an eye on the right breast as it was red around the areloa and nipple. I didn't really pay much attention. I think it may have went away. Then last week I noticed it was red on the nipple and aerola. More pink I guess. No other problems though, just red. Called the doctor went in and he said to treat it with a clot/bet something and to come back in 2 weeks. Well Saturday I started experiencing ithcing and burning so quit the med. Tuesday called them and they said try lotrimin. The burning is gone and the redness is almost gone, but every now and then my nipple looks more purple than the other. Does anyone know anything about paget's (this is what the practitioner said we would watch for)? Does this sound like it? Sorry so long, and thanks to any replies. I am 24 years old and my mother has Stage 4 Breast Cancer. Had in both breasts, went to ovaries, had hysterecomty, now in her bones. Thanks, Tylette",

      "Content": "Hello again all! Thanks for all your replies. Here's the scoop 10 days later I went back to the doctor. I only used the lotrimin cream two days. Went back to the doctor today. The redness is better, I am having very slight itching/and every now and then a VERY LIGHT pain. He is having me get an ultrasound of the breast tomorrow. He said that if I notice any scaliness of the breast to let him know and he will set me up with my dermatologist. Do you think he is taking the right approach to this. As I said before I just went with slight redness, didn't have any other problems until i started medicine for it. The redness is just about gone, but notice an itch every now and then...which has gotten much better since quit taking both meds. With this info do you think my doctor has taken the correct apporach with an ultrasound and moving on from what they find in that? Thanks again to everyone of you! Tylette",
