    "Content": "Hi everyone. My brother-in-law was diagnosed with a grade 4 glioblastoma on March 18th, 2014. The baseball sized tumor was in the right temporal lobe, and his brilliant surgeon was able to remove the whole (baseball sized) tumor, without any damage to his brain. He has been through radiation and chemo and has been prescribed an antiviral (Valcyte) that is \"off label\" so insurance will not pay for it. The cost is $7,000 per month, but in Canada it only costs about 1G per month. Does anyone here have any ideas for how we can get him his medications from Canada, or another source? Read his surgeon's blog post if you are interested. http://www.braincancer.org/blog/2014/03/31/valcyte-and-cytom This is a great site. I'm pulling for all of you people in this battle - it's a rough one for sure!",
