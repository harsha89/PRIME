    "Content": "I pray that all goes well with people on this site. It was one of the best ones that I came across after I started searching. Here is what I am looking for. My mother is 73 and has just been diagnosied with metaplastic spindle cell carcinomia. She will have her first appointment with the oncoligist this week and I want to ask the right questions as far as treatments that have been working, what she should expect and things like that. Also, should she get a second opinion? She had several biopsies with the same doctor. It is pretty scary to hear that it is rare and yet see that it is such a treatable cancer. I just want to make sure to ask the right questions from people that have learned from experience. Again I pray for all that have to deal with this and thank you for any and all help.",
