    "Content": "My treatment ended 3 months ago and I had horrible neuropathy in my hands and feet the whole time. Now my hands are better, but my feet are still bad. Not AS bad as they were during treatment, but it still affects how much I can be on my feet in a day(they burn and swell) and what shoes I can wear. But I am alive!!! I have found that the b vitamins work, as well as epsom salt soaks and a good lotion (mentholated feels really good!) Other than that, take really good care of your feet,wear good shoes and moisture wicking socks, and check your feet everyday for cuts, etc..",
