    "Content": "Hello I see on your post you are having the Taxol treatments. I am starting Taxol next Monday having weekly treatments for 12 weeks also. I just finished three months (4 treatments) of Adriamycin/Cytoxan treatments two weeks ago also having the Neaulasta the day after each treatment. It seems like the more treatments the sicker I became. I spent two days in the hospital after my last treatment. Sorry to ramble, what I really would like to ask/know if possible is if you can tell me a little what to expect? I have read numerous articles but they do not have very positive things to say. I do have pain in hips and joints. The Dr says from the Neaulasta but she also says the Taxol might cause feet and hand numbing. I guess I am just really worried. Any feedback would be appreciated. Good luck. And I hope to hear from you.",
