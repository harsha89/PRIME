    "Content": "Absolutely!!!!  I also had a bilateral, and had my ovaries removed and am now on Arimidex. I have no libido at all, and on the few occasions that we did \"try\", I was so sore that it really wasn't possible.  I know a couple of my doctors have mentioned vagifem or another \"low\" estrogen solution, but I do not want to go that route. After all, I had my ovaries removed and am now on the arimidex to get rid of estrogen so that this darn cancer doesn't return. Why would I want to tempt fate????  Let me know if you figure out a solution!",
