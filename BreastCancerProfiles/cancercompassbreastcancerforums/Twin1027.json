    "Content": "I haven't read much about this so I thought I'd see if anyone has experienced this.  I was on Exemestane for five years.  I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoporosis, and I'm 64.  Those are all contributing factors to my sacral insufficiency fracture.  All of these cause the bones to thin, even though I am on Fosomax.  The anti-inflammatory I take is suspected to inhibit healing.  So all of these things seemed to lead to my recent sacral fracture, which is not usually suspected as a cause of lower back pain.  It took two MRIs to diagnose it.  Two doctors thought it was muscle pain.  Anyone else have this?",
