    "Content": "Hello, I developed a horrible, painful and itchy rash under my breast. Turned out to be a fungal infection. Believe it or not was advised to use Lotromin or a similair product for Jock Itch. Also to use a hair dryer on low setting to make sure the area is completely dry after bathing. This has occured several times during the past three years and has worked well. Good luck",
