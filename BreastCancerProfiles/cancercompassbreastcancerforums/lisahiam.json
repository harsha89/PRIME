    "Content": "My father-in-law had his first treatment with Taxol and then Carboplatin last Thursday. Last night, he had severe stomach pain. Once he took his pain medication, he slept through the night, but then this morning, his stomach was hurting him again. So, it's not so much his abdomen as his stomach that's bothering him.",
