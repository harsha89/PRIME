      "Content": " I've been looking for someone else complaining of neck pain. Could you tell me more about your neck pain symptoms. I've switched from Arimidex to Aromasin since April because of worsening of osteoporosis. I don't seem to have the other side effects, other than hot flashes. I've had 5 opinions about my neck pain, which radiates to the right side of my head and don't know where to go from here. I'm trying to decide if it's comforting to know that many others have to take strong pain pills to get through the day. That seems to be the solution for me too. Thanks.

Was warned there would likely be same problems- but just as with arimidex, there was somewhat of a delay in onset of symptoms, so have not yet reported to oncologist. will next month. how are you doing????   On 9/15/2005 Cjgeorge wrote: Please advise if anyone but me is experiencing pain in hands, legs, feet from taking aromasin. I have been on the medication for 3 months following Tamaxifin and called physician to explain my concerns and he said to continue but in addition take a baby aspirin. I am concerned that my systems will get worse? Any advise will be helpful. Many thanks!!!!    ",

She told me yesterday that they are going to start Chemo all over again her first treatment will be monday, but just not as much of the dosage she had the first time. I thought if that was an option they would at least giver her body some rest from the previous Chemo and the radiation, it has only been two weeks since her last treatment. She  now has lost a totaly of 168 pounds due to Chemo and Radition!..Will they just keep giving her Chemo If she needs it? Or when is it to a point where the body just say's \" no more\".....She wasn't going to go through chemo again but any with glimmer of hope.....   I'm certainly no expert but I would surely think there's no way her body can survive more chemo. Any chance of getting a second opinion? There's such a fine line between proper treatment and how much they can get from insurance companies. I would think she would be subject to serious infection since her blood counts must be terribly low already. Apparently she's willing to go ahead with more chemo. What did the PET scan reveal? Cancer in several organs I presume. I understand the glimmer of hope. You can't give up the fight. If I were you I'd do like the other responder did and just show up. It has to be terribly hard to be far away from her at this time. My sincere sympathy for your situation. It's probably a no-win and you should work on keeping yourself healthy. Best regards.

They tested her said the breast cancer was in remission, she lived with that for about 3 weeks, went back in because the place where they removed the lymp nodes was infection with staff, ran some tests and now, say there are small specs in her liver and lung!.....How can this be?.....They did say the tumors she has popping up was from the Chemo treatment. I'm not so sure she can take another bout of Chemo like that again. my question is, Breast cancer caused the cancer in her liver and lung or was it the skin cancer that branched out? What treatment do they ususally do with her situation now?. I'm so worried about her. What's scary, my mom's mother had breast cancern my dad's mother passed from complications of breast cancer, So i have three female close generations that has or had breast cancer, I just feel like i need to brace myself for what may come for me or/and my daughter. :o(   I'm a 3-year survivor always feeling like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I've had several PET scans since the treatments in 05 which have shown spots on the lung and liver but didn't show up as cancer. Has your mom had a PET scan? They have given me considerable peace of mind. I just read the article on this site about healthy diet and lifestyle can change cancer genes. I sure think all of us should research that possibility further. Good luck to you, your mother and your daughter. JudyB     ",

I also have severe neck/head pain and feel that I should be grateful they seemingly got rid of the cancer but I have no quality of life because of this constant suffering. I also feel they take no interest in any nerve damage or after-effects from their powerful treatments. I've seen about 8 drs./treaters about the neck pain. It's been diagnosed as occipital neuralgia. Nothing I've tried has helped. MRI doesn't seem to explain what's causing it. I also have degenerative disc. I do get relief lying down and with pain meds - Vicodin. It ONLY hurts when I move. My most recent attempt was with 10 laser treatments by a chiropractor. Nothing changed. It hurts less when I look down. Working in the kitchen isn't so bad - fortunately for my husband! About the arm pain. I am hopeful that I've avoided the lymphedema by doing two arm exercises every day. I do it before I get out of bed. Hold the arm up, lying on my side so arm is higher than heart, and make a fist and squeeze. Also, I \"pump\" my arm bending at the elbow. I do 75 \"for good measure\" because I've never known how many are recommended. I feel women have been shortchanged by PT people. I had heard it was important to exercise the arm and did read about it in all the literature I received in the beginning. So far, no lymphedema. I think I would be totally discouraged if I had to endure that pain along with everything else. I'm doing the Faslodex injection every 4 weeks. I just couldn't deal with the side effects from Arimidex and Aromacin. I hate the expense of the injection however. My heart aches for young women going through all this. I'm 68 and have had a happy life. I just didn't know the retirement years would include quite this much pain. Regards and here's to a solution out there somewhere. JudyB        ",
