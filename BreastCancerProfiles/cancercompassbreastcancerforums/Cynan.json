    "Content": "Please get a second opinion. This is not the time to worry about hurting your doctors feelings. This is about your future. Tell you doctor you were advised to get a second opinion and do it. Even if you get the same opinion from more than one doctor the decision is still up to you. I was diagnosed with a rare form of bc and am waiting for an appointment for a 2nd with a cancer hospital. I expect the dx and recommendations to be the same. I didn't like my doctors recommendations but if I hear the same thing again, I will probably feel more comfortable that is the best way to go to get rid of this disease. Try to find a doctor who specializes in your type of cancer. And again, you don't have to stop with just one more opinion. Prayers for you, Cynthia",
