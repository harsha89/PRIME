    "Content": "  Found a lump and dimple last week in my right breast. I\u2019m 32 with no family history and no risk factors other than being a bit overweight. Gyn sent me for mammo and US yesterday and things did not go well. Had My Mammo then U/S and afterwards the Radiologist came in and her exact words were \u201c I don\u2019t like what I see\u201d She sees a solid mass with 1 lymph node involved. The borders seem irregular. She wants a biopsy. I will have that tomorrow at 10 am and will know the results on Monday. I did ask the bi-rad score and it was a 5. So I know from reading that means it\u2019s 95% mailgnant. I didn\u2019t get a copy of the report but asked my gyn when called today how big it was and she said 2.7 X 1.3 X 2.1 CM--- That seems huge to me. I am scared to death. I\u2019m only 32 with 2 small kids\u2026. SO SO scared  ",
