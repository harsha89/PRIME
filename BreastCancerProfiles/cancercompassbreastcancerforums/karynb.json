      "Content": "You should absolutely have the biopsy. If your dr doesn't want to adhere to your wishes, find another dr who will. Breastcancer is in your family history and that should be enough to convince any dr to do it. These cysts/lumps are new to your breast, you've been having discharge... there's obviously irregularities. On a side note, I've had the green discharge before, and it was always from benign cysts. I've had these cysts drained in the past and it always turned out ok. But I was in my teens. Good luck to you! Karyn",
