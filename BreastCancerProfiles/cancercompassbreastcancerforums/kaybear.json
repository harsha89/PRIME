      "Content": "My Breast Cancer wasn't a lump. It was a thickening, an increase in size that I put off to weight gain. It was the most common kind \"Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\" Because it was caught early and was still in the original type of tissue that it started in, I would end up having surgical removal and only Tamoxifen, a pill for 5 years. I didn't have to have radiation or chemo. Getting a mammiogram is well worth it. Even though it is stressful. Not knowing is even more stressful.   ",

For work this week, I've made a pad to pin in the health side cup, it makes it less notisable. Like you said, the things we have to go for. at least its just temporary. Kay",

      "Content": "Dear Nennette, Happy Birthday. this month. Hope that This year will be a new beginning for you. I've ended up wearing a cotton button shirt over my tanks and t-shirts. I'm starting to be less self concious at the pool or beach. I have to still push myself out the door to go.  Due to the size of the scar, the goal is 1600ml. Huge. I'm a June Baby too. By this time next year, it'll have all passed. Someone tiny new will have my attention. Newest Grand Baby due in Dec. Thanks for the suggestion. Kaylyn",

      "Content": "I'm embarrassed by having lots of cleavage on the still being reconstructed side from the tissue expander. My Healthy breast is a saggy Barely B, the side that had cancer was 1+ sizes bigger to start with. And the Sports Bras really flatten out my smaller natural breast. I'm several months away from the implant exchange and from a surgery to bring back symetry. Has anyone else had this problem? any ideas how to gain cleavage on the healthy side while wearing sports bras. For right now, that is the only kind I'm allowed to wear. Thank you. Kaybear  ",
