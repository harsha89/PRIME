Since being diagnosed in 2008 and having two separate mastectomies and a prophalyctic hysterectomy in 2010(where they found ovarian cancer) I have taken tamoxifin, femara, and now arimidex. what I have taken for the leg pain and cramps is oste-biflex once a day, plus caltrate ,and 1000 units of vitamin d. Its not for everyone, but after chemo my vitamin d levels were very low and are just starting to become normal. This has helped a lot with the leg pains. The only other real problem I have is headaches every morning when I wake up.  Good luck to you. I hope this helps a little.    ct Thanks so very much for your reply.... My problems sound insignificant compared with yours. I will take \"onboard\" what you have mentioned...my Chemo Oncologist today has insisted to stop the Arimidex for 1 month...then she will do some blood tests & re-evaluate ... I'm looking forward to relief from some of this pain... Good luck to you too...& thanks so much",

      "Content": "I am a 65 yr old female...diagnosed April 2010 with breast cancer. Lumpectomy followed 3 days later, then 3 months of Chemotherapy, & Radiation Therapy followed that. At the end of 7 months therapy I commenced taking Arimidex 6 weeks ago..I feel absolutely terrible... Cramping, leg aches, fatigue, sleeplessness, emotionionally \"fragile\", dry vagina, dry cough, sweats. I feel like I have the flu, and going through menopause all over again...and the list goes on...I am concerned that I cannot go on with this drug any further, but the other choice \"temoxafin\", I cannot take due to \"TIA's\" I have already x 4 experienced.....My husband says it's only for 5 years...I know I cant keep going like this for another month...let alone another 5 years!!! Any suggestions please...Anne  ",
