      "Content": "I had a needle localization and biopsy/right breast yesterday--most horrible experience of my life.  The info I was given before go to the hospital was completely wrong, I had to threaten to leave without having anyghint done after being stuck in a corner and ignored for over 2 hours to get anyone to explain what was going to be happening, was told the the localization would feel lke a bee sting when it hurt like haveing a root canal without novacaine, had to argue with the anesthesiologist so that she wouldn't give me drugs I'm allergic to.  Now I have to have a sentinel node biopsy and lumpectomy/left breast and am already shaking and crying every time I think about it.  I'm considering stopping all treatment right now--it can't be anywhere near as bad as what I went through yesterday. Does anyone have any suggestions?  I really can't go through that again, and my surgeon says the sentinel node biopsy is worse. ",

      "Content": "Update: yesterday I had SN mapping (injections done under sedation but still increadibly painful) and lumpectomy.  Dr very happy with surgery, feels she go good margins, took 1 lymph node.  She will call with path reports next Wed.  I strongly surrgest to any woman having SN mapping INSIST on sedation--after all you are lying on that table for over an hour, and lying down for the injections, so there is no reason not to be if not comfortable, at least not in agony. It's a bit better than a needle localizationin one respect--you get to see the face of the person injecting you, not just a disembodied arm coming over your shoulder and jabbing you. ",

      "Content": "I'm not afraid of the lumpectomy, I'm afraid of the process when they inject dye and radioactive whatever--apparently that is done several hours before surgery with no sedation or anethsesia--\"like a needle localization\" was what I was told, and the localization was like haveing a red hot poker jabbed into my breast and then hooked up to an electrical shocker that went off everycouple of seconds until the surgeon took it out.  I don't think I can handle that for hours (they said it take up to 4 hours for the dye to get to the nodes).  I had to be medicated just to get through the hour between the localization and the biopsy, and they say they will not medicate me for this--\"no one else has ever needed medication\".  Of course, no one else ever needed medication for the localization, either, but I did.  I'm almost ready to write off treatment althogether.  I'm not afraid of dying, I'm terrifed of going through the procedures.  What happens if I have a complete panic attack?  Or a heart attack from the fear and anxiety?  ",

      "Content": "I found a lump in my left breast in January.  Mammogram and ulstrasounds were done on both breasts, then referal to surgeon who I saw this week.  Needle aspiration of the lump is positive for cancer, and I am scheduled for localization and biopsy of a  \"concerning\" spot in the right breast.  I know I don't have anywhere near enough info right now, but after helping my mother take care of my father while he underwent chemo and died and watching others spend the last months/years of their life in misery and tied to a chemo schedule I know I will never be able to brind myself to submit to chemo.  How will the medical community react to my refusal to take chemo?  Will they write me off as \"uncooperative\"?  Is there any hope without chemo? ",

      "Content": "Dear Kimarie How long did the 6 rounds of chemo take?  Where you able to work full time or part time?  I live alone and need to work at least 32 hours a week in a fairly strenous job to pay the mortgage and other bills.  Where you tired?  Where you able to drive yourself to your treatments?  If I am too sck to work or unable to drive I will have to go to a nursing home, and I'm only 48, I don't want to have to do that.  Sorry for all the questions, but I need to get good information--the doctors told my father he would nto be sick and would be able to continue to be as active as he was before, but he was so sick several days after each treatment that he couldn't even get out of bed, so I don't trust what the doctors say.  NativeMainer",
