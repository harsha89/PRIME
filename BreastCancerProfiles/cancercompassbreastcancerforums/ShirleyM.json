I have found that if I take Arimidex at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening ,that I don't have as much pain.  Most of the pain is at night and I take Excedrin PM at bedtime and that stops the pain,plus it helps me sleep. Don't get Tylenol b/c it don't work as well.Also take 2 Calcium pills with Vit. D with the Arimidex . That has helped me so much and my pain is liveable now. I have arthritis and the Dr gave me Plaquenil,which I take in the morning. This is working for me.I just take a very low dose ! Hugs Shirley  ",

My questions are: In my mom's case, is it better to take Arimidex or to just remove the other breast ... considering her age and the possible severe side effects of the drug? Are all side effects of Arimidex reversible? (In case she decides to take the drug and later to stop before the end of fifth year) Thank you for your help. Mei     Hi Mei If your mother would have her other breast removed,Dr's would still want her to take Arimidex! What Arimidex does is stop the production of Estrogen! You didn't say she was Estrogen positive but I'm assuming she is,if Dr's put her on Arimidex! I don't think anyone really knows if the side effects are reversible or not! I am on Arimidex and had my left breast removed. I was in so much pain,I couldn't stand it. I stopped taking it and will go back to the ONCologist on the 28th. Maybe she will put me on Tamoxifen which does not hurt the bones,BUT has many other side effects . I didn't take Chemo or Radiation but put on Arimidex. I guess I was lucky ,when I didn't have Chemo and Rads. !!! I am 69 now and have a lot of bone and joint pain! All the Aromatase inhibitors work by stopping Estrogen Production. Tamoxifen is the only bone friendly drug for Cancer of the Breast.   Hugs Shirley      ",

Before I say anything to her, I wanted to get some input from folks who have had personal experience with Aromasin, regardless of whether you had a positive or negative experience with it. I am new to the Breast Cancer Board here at Cancercompass, but am completely familiar with the website as I have been using it for almost 2 years after my Dad was diagnosed with Brain Cancer.  So, I have learned that the best \"info\" one can get is from the people who are experiencing it. 1.  Is is normal for this drug to be used for someone who has not had cancer so serious as to require invasive surgery? 2.  Is there anyone who has NOT had really negative effects from this medication. 3.  Can anyone tell me if this is a well-known drug, and if so, is it expensive or relatively low in cost.  If is it expensive, we will never convince her to start the treatment. 4.  Has anyone experienced hospitalization as a result of Aromasin?  Julie does not provide us much information about her situation.  With my dad's cancer, we knew everything that went on.  Because she is such a private preson, she does not talk about it much. Thanks so much.  I do hope that someone will help us with the answers we are looking for...Please pray for Julie and her family also....Thanks again.....brenda I have taken Arimadex and Aromisin which are Aromatase inhibitors!  I have been almost crippled from these drugs!  I had horrible joint pain ! I quit taking all of it b/c from what I've read,most people experience a lot of pain. I am not willing to take a drug that causes the pain I have went through.It is a personal decision for your MIL ! Yes it is very expensive drug but sometimes the Dr will get it for you free,if you don't have drug coverage. It also causes weight gain,hair thinning, bone pain,among many other things. It stops production of estrogen and you can see the results of that  in all the old people ,when their body stops producing it. I have read that the only time that helps is when there is a tumor present. After the tumor is removed,why would they want us to take that. Some DR's give the Aromasin first , to shrink the tumor before surgery! Don't make any sense to me. I had a mastectomy  about one year ago. I refused to take these drugs. I am 69 yrs. old and know  that I can't live too long anyway,with or without the drugs. I hope this helps! Hugs Shirley",

I believe that people are willing to suffer through Chemo and all other terrible treatments, \"instead of \" trusting God to be our healer. His treatment is so pure and so free. Pray on a consistant bases and ask God to lead you and he will . I have left it at Jesus feet and I am satisfied,that Jesus will take care of me. When I had surgery I had a reaction to all the pain meds. My 2 daughters and I prayed and I said Lord please stop my pain b/c I can't take the drugs and guess what.....I had NO pain what so ever,after the surgery. I was sore but no pain. Trust in God,that's what I will do. Love Shirley",

Hugs Shirley Hi Shirley, pardon my saying so, but what you had doesn't sound like a stereotactic biopsy, but sounds like a core needle biopsy, which I also had.  That one stung a little.  Really, I can truly say that the stereotactic biopsy didn't hurt at all.  My back and shoulders were killing me while laying on my stomach with my breast down in the hole, but the actual procedure didn't hurt at all.  I remember telling the technicians that. Best wishes, Carolyn        Yes you may be right about the type of biopsy,not sure what kind BUT too,  Like you I laid on that table and my arthritis was really hurting too. I must have been on there 2 hours or more.To have a long needle stuck in my breast and then the pellet shot in, was horrible. They didn't numb mine ! I had another procedure done with dye injected all around my nipple and that was just as painful and again they gave me nothing! I will be sure that they will not do that again. My daughter-in-law had the biopsy with the hollow needle and they hurt her so bad, Jim said that she almost passed out when she came out of the room and he caught her! SOOO I know that it wasn't just me!  Hugs Shirley",
