      "Content": "About 6 months ago, I felt a lump in my breast, near my armpit. I saw by OBGYN, who said \"You're young, and there is a lot of lumpy tissue there.\" I am 29, with no family history. Needless to say, I will not see that doctor again. Now I am having a discharge that comes out clear, but dries yellow, and a dimple. I don't know what I should do if it gets blown off again by my new doctor, who I have an appointment with Thursday. Have any of you felt like there was something wrong and demanded further disgnostic tests?",

      "Content": "Have an ultrasound next week. Because I also have an enlarged thyroid, coupled with the discharge (galactorrhea), they are looking at my prolactin levels. If high, could be a prolactinoma (tumor on the pituitary). Just something for those of you with discharge to be aware of, even though prolactinomas most likely are treatable with medication.",
