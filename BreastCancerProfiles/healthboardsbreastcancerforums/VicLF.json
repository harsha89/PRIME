    "Content": "HI! Hope all is well. I am just reading through threads and read yours. What were your results? I had an \"abnormal\" mammo 6 months ago and was called back in for an ultrasound. I was given the Bi Rads 3 rating - Probably benign and told to come back in 6 months. I go in tomorrow for my 6-month follow-up. I had melanoma (caught early, thank goodness) before, so cancer is always a fear for me. Anyway, I hope you got good news!!",
