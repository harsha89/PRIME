      "Content": "If it's been going on for several years now, it's probably fine. When a nipple that's never been inverted before suddenly becomes inverted, then you need to get it checked out. Still, if it bugs you, you can ask your doctor. When you go for an annual exam, doctors should examine your breasts, also.",

It might be some sort of cyst or infection, in which case the doctor might remove it. Or, it might go away on its own after your next period. Or it might be more serious, but you'll find out when you get your exam.",

Not only is breast cancer less likely, but it's just so darned hard to SEE anything, because the breast tissue is denser. If there was anything BIG in there, they'd probably have found it. They're just being thorough.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear you have to go through this! The good news is, almost 90% of abnormalities found on mammogram are benign when biopsied. When you go for biopsy, the doctor will use an ultrasound machine to place a long needle right into the \"suspicious abnormality.\" He will remove a little tissue and send it to a lab for analysis. The bad news is, it'll be a while until you know for sure, because it takes 3-4 weeks for the biopsy results to come back. Still, it's good that you are getting tested appropriately. If it is benign, maybe it's still something a surgeon could remove, to relieve your pain.",
