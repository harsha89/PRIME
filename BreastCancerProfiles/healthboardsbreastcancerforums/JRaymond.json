    "Content": "I know you have probably already made your decision, but for others who may read this....I had a similar size tumor, no lymph node involvement, lumpectomy, no chemo. I did choose to do radiation and, for me, the treatment wasn't bad at all. I stopped on the way to work each morning, I wasn't fatigued....I did have some skin burning the last week, but it wasn't painful and it healed very quickly. I used two different types of lotion every day right from the beginning. I am also taking tamoxifin, but didn't start that until after the radiation. It's only been about three weeks, but, so far, I haven't had any side effects from that. I really trusted my doctors and they felt that the radiation could decrease my chances of a reoccurence.",
