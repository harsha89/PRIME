      "Content": "Hi Miley713, I read your post that you were going to have a breast biopsy and that you have a birads 4. I can understand the fear of having to be told you \"might\" have a malignancy in your breast and that you have to have a biopsy. The waiting, from being told you have to set up appointment to the day you have the biopsy and then waiting for the results can cause a lot of anxiety. What type of biopsy did you have? an excisional or a needle core biopsy, etc. How did you make out with the results? I pray that all turned out well for you and hope you come back to let us know how you made out. I'm here for you if you need to vent. I've had 3 biopsies and all were different. A core needle biopsy guided by ultra sound, an MRI guided, and last a lumpectomy which I had no idea they were going to take out as much tissue as they did. It wound up being atypical ductal hyperplasia. called, ADH with other changes too within the breasts. Some people are put on med's to prevent cancer with a diagnosis of ADH, but I wasn't told to take it. Both my sisters had breast cancers. both different types and both different treatments. My 1St sister didn't have a lump therefore couldn't have a lumpectomy but had it biopsied and was positive, then had other breast tested, that came back with positive tissue so she opted to have a total mastectomy.. my 2nd sister, who was older had a cyst that kept coming back. they watched it.. finally aspirated it and it had cancer cells in it. she was put on tamoxifin for many years. It prevented breast cancer from ever coming back. Best wishes to you.. hope to hear back from you, sincerely, Lintek",

      "Content": "GRM136, I'm sorry this is such a late reply to your question. I can't answer them for you but I can relate to what you have because I too have gone through multiple breast biopsied, core needle, MRI guided, and finally a lumpectomy. mine wound up being a small area too of ADH and UDH, but my surgeon never told me that I have to follow up with treatment for it other than continue getting my bilateral MRI's, with an ultra sound and mammo's. I found out other woman were put on tamoxifen for our diagnosis so you can imagine my possible fear of not being told too. I opt not to take the tamoxifen if I was told to go on it because of the side effects my sister suffered while on it and then years after. years. not months of intense heat like waves and sweat through her body. and not just the normal type of menopausal sweats. she's way past menopause. my sister had a cyst in her breast that never went away and they finally tested it with a needle biopsy and it wound up being cancer cells in it. the next step up from what you and I have. something carcinoma in the ducts? she is still seeing her oncologist for follow ups and this happened yrs ago. I just make sure I follow up diligently with my exams. I'm 55 yrs old now and this started for me in 2011. I am in surgical menopause since 2005 and on just straight estrogen patches which I LOVE. I wasn't told to stop it or else. I was given the option to think about it. I tried once before to go down in strength but couldn't handle the symptoms. PLUS my other sister when she was in her late 30's was diagnosed with breast cancer too, and wound up having to have a mastectomy. the first sister I mentioned with breast cancer also wound up just having thyroid cancer last year and I found out from my breast surgeon that there's a gene defect, that causes both breast AND thyroid cancer. she told me this years before my sister was dx'd with the thyroid. My sister only found it by accident. They did an ultra sound on her carotid arteries and found the lumps on her thyroid. the dr.. told her not to worry that it didn't look malignant but when they did the biopsy, it was in fact malignant. but it was caught at such an early stage. Now a year later she found out from her breast cancer Dr. that she should've received radiation treatment of the thyroid area just to be safe in case other cells got it. I was so upset when I heard this. I was told one of my aunts had breast CA too. I never met ALL of my aunts and only met one uncle being all my relatives lived or live in Slovakia. so it does run pretty rampant in my family genes. My grandmother, maternal side, who lived in Slovakia died of some type of gynecological cancer. her stomach was HUGE my mom told me. I dont' know if it was uterine or ovarian. I had chronic hemorrphagic ovarian cysts and other strange growths on them for many years which is why I wound up having to finally get the total hysterectomy.. not because of cancer. My gyno recommended it because of the potential for it turning to. I'm very interested in knowing what you wound up doing for you ADH. Did you wind up seeing an oncologist and I'd like to know their opinion of it and what they did. If anyone else who reads this that has ADH, please share what happened to you and what your plan of treatment was. It would be so helpful..",
