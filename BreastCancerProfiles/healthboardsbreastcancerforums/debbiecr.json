      "Content": "to both ladies who have lumps under the armpit, Go see not just a doctor but an Oncologist .And insist on a biopsy! I don't want to friek you out but I am a 5 year breast cancer survivor who was mis-diagnosed for years (We always like to hear Dr. say \" Oh it's just a cyst, and besides it HURTS so it can't be Cancer\" WRONG!!! Mine lump in the breast hurt and the lump under my arm which appeared SIX months after my mastectomy turned out to be a recurrence in my lyphm nodes.EVEN though my Onclogist told me the underarm lump was just scar tissue!!! I knew better and got a second opinion who verified my suspicion of a recurrence .I was sent immediately for another operation and Radiotherapy. So IF it turns out to be malignent there are treatments but get checked PLEASE! Godbless and Goodluck ...\"Stayin Alive\" lala",

      "Content": "Get it checked gal Boy as a 5 year survivor of BC I agree with the other ladies GET a biobsy or ultrasound. I had mammograms for 7 years and they showed NOTHING. BUT I felt a lump YES it WAS painful.(DARN doctors still say \"If it hurts it cant be Cancer\") I am writing a book with that title. I am outraged when I hear newbies who are told this After a mastectomy I had a lump in my arpmit Yes even though my Onclogogist insisted that it was Scar tissue from the mastectomy I felt oterwise and saught a second opinion .THAT Oncologist said it was a recurrance to my lypmph nodes and I had to have 15malignent lyphmph nodes removed followed by radiotherapy immediately. SO MUCH for \"Scar tissue\" . PLEASE insist on at least an ultrasound which discovered my cancer when Mammograms did not! Good Luck",
