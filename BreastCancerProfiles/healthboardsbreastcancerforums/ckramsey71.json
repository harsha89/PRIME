    "Content": "I am 44 years old mother of 2 teenage daughters, 16 & 14. I have just had a punch biopsy of my right nipple today. The anxiety is crippling! Last week I noticed some oozing from my right breast. I have always had inverted nipples, so that's kind of hard to tell if it is part of this process. I have a lump in that breast that was biopsied 2-3 years ago and was benign, but I have heard horror stories. My mother had breast cancer almost 10 years ago and is doing fine. I also have the fibrocystic disease, aka very dense breasts. Anybody have any wisdom to share? Thanks in advance! Kathye",
