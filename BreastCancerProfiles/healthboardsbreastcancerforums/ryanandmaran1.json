    "Content": "I'm so glad to see that someone wrote about the same thing I've been experiencing! Lately, for the past couple of months, my right breast near my armpit has been sore--but deep down, like it's a muscle--just like you said. Also, the top part of my right breast sometimes feels sore when I breathe in too deeply. That pain also feels muscular. But it still makes me worry, because I don't know why the same muscles would be so sore for so long. And I feel so uncertain when it comes to self-examining my breasts every month, because I'm not altogether sure what to feel for! I feel hard little nodules near the edges of my breasts that I can only assume are my lymph nodes, but then I begin to doubt when I start feeling tenderness there! I like to have my husband do it because then he can feel both of them at the same time to see if there are any differences. But he's never really sure what to look for either... Does this tenderness sound like something I should have checked out? I haven't had a doctor check my breasts since last April (10 months ago).",
