      "Content": "Hi Robin (love that name), You're so right, life if precious. We never know what is \"around the corner\". As long as you get your mammograms on a regular bais, you will be fine. The ealier it's detected, the better. I have read so much on the internet and the mammogram is the most reliable test so far. Maybe you could go every six months. I know insurance only pays for one every year, but Reflections ( I don't know if you have those in CA.) but you could go to a private facility to get one more often. I called Reflectios and it's $110. I went there four years ago because I had a three week wait to get an appointment in a place that accepts Summa. I just couldn't wait that long, so paid the then $75 to get it done earlier. The waiting would have \"done me in\". Sorry to hear about your other problem. Sounds like you are doing okay with that. That's good. The shower is over and it went very well. I was so busy and don't really know what that received. We had about 36 guests. I have another one to attend on June 3 for my daughter-in-law. Grandchildren are great. I had some problems with my first one (a boy). Our DIL keep him from us for four years. He was only 2 1/2 weeks old when she decided her Mom and Dad should have all rights to see him. That tore me up and I've never been the same. Everything is okay now, but I will never get over it. Funny, the same thing happened to my Mom when her first (a girl) was born. My brother's wife did the same thing to my parents. It's strage that the same thing happend to us. My younget son and DIL would never let that happen with this baby. Even though this is her Moms first grandchild (she's 3 yrs. older than me) I have no problem thinking it would happen with them. Being a Mother-In-Law is not like being the mother of the Mom to be. They are very close to us, but so was our oldest son. We're doing okay now, but will never be like it would be if that didn't happen. We can't understand why they would do this to us. No explanations after four years. We started seeing them four years ago Christmas Day because our youngest son had a long talk with them. Today at the shower, my oldest DIL didn't talk to my son's wife. I'm down because of that. This hurts us and also hurts my son and DIL. They only gave them a card, and my youngest son and DIL goes all out on the three kid's birthdays, etc. Sorry to get off the subject. I don't care for get togethers because I'm very sensitive and hate seeing this. Yesterday at husbands birthday was the same thing. And we have no idea what's going on. It's time to have a \"pow-wow\" and get things out in the open. We all are clueless about it. Thanks for listening and at least we have one less worry. I only hope those others on this board get good news about their mammograms. Life is tough sometimes and most things can be fixed. Let's be thankful and count our blessings.",

      "Content": "Well, that's over with. Your prayers worked. I'll try and make this short as possible. The tech. took a regular mammogram and showed it to the radiologist. Then was told to take more views. They even did one that they twisted my breast. The girls said the rad. was puzzled and frustrated because she could see something in one x-ray but not in any others. The tech. showed me the x-ray. The rad. even called in another rad. out of frustration. I had told the tech that I had an ABBI 4 years ago. More x-rays were ordered. The tech. said the rad. pulled out all my x-rays from 2002 to present. She was going nuts. Then she noticed a metal marker on one of my previous mammograms. The tech. came in and asked me to show her the scar from the ABBI. She said they are usually about 1/4\" but mine is 2\" long. I told her I told the tech. on Monday when I had my screening that I had an ABBI. I was told by my surgeon to always mention it when getting a mammogram. The tech. said she couldn't see a scar. Soooooo, the tech. today made yet another mammogram with the metal strip showing the scar. Low and behold. That's what they were seeing. Guess tissue from the ABBI. The tech. today said don't say I had an ABBI, but a biopsy procedure because I have a larger scar. I will be going to the hospital for my next mammogram in a year and not an off site facility. Bet they took 15 x-rays all different positions. So I feel so much better. Now I can enjoy all the other things coming up in my life. Thank you so much for your support and prayers. This has been a real nightmare, but turned out okay. I hope you could understand what I was explaining. You're a sweet person!!!",

      "Content": "Thanks Robin, Whew, so glad it's over. But I place some blame on the tech that did my screening mammogram on Monday. Yes, I have a 2\" scar since they removed the whole cyst. Wish they would have put a marker in me. The tech today couldn't believe the tech on Monday didn't see it. I showed her where it was located. I don't pay any attention to it anymore. It's on the bottom near the n. so I would have to left it up to see it. Wish I was in California. Here in Ohio, it's been raining for days and days. Our grass is like a forest. Will be hard to mow when it finally dries out. I'm so glad I had you to talk to these past few days. And I'm so glad we are both doing fine. I couldn't wait to e-mail you with the results. I told my husband, on the way home, he went with me, that I had to e-mail you first thing.",

      "Content": "Oh yes, I will be sure to tell the tech. at my next mammogram. I'll put the metal strip on myself if I have to and carry a sign with me announcing my past procedure. LOL! Going through a \"scare\" four years ago and then again this time, I am very grateful that both times it was nothing serious. It's a real wake-up call. The tech said I would be very sore and black and blue today. Nope, I'm not. I weigh 120 lbs and am considered petite. And not big busted either. Guess I'm pretty tough because I did the same thing. I told the tech. to even make it tighter. She tightened it one more turn and I was fine. I too wanted her to get the best possible x-rays. Husband's birthday is over and tomorrow is the baby shower. Whew! Tomorrow will be a long day, but am looking forward to it. I'm so glad I don't have to think about getting a biopsy and letting that destroy my day. Like I said before, I just don't handle these things well at all. It was a beautiful afternoon here, but had rain this morning. Hope my husband can mow the grass tomorrow while I'm at the shower. But the ground is so wet you can hear noises when you walk on it. Saturated! Thanks again Robin. By the way, my name is Judy.",

      "Content": "I'm 57 and have had mammograms since 35. Four years agothis month, had surgery, which turned out to be a cyst. Went this Monday for annual mammogram. Got a call on Wed. Have to have a diagnostic mammogram tomorrow. Said there was neo density. My Dr. said the report said it was extremely suttle change and didn't seem concerned. I'm a nervous wreck again. My heart is pounding. I don't handle these things well.",

      "Content": "They said they used the ABBI on me because the abnormality was at a good location. Sure was better than being put out, I guess. They didn't tell me it was for a biopsy that it was a surgery to remove it. I'm just glad it's out of there. A surgeon performed mine. I'm so glad yours was okay. It sure does make me a nervous wreck. Breast cancer doesn't run in my family, which is good. Sorry about your family history. That makes it so important to keep your mammograms up to date even more. I'm only getting the diagnostic mammogram tomorrow. And am hoping that that will be it. I really don't think I can handle anything else. My husband will be 60, oh no, on Saturday, we've having a baby shower for our daughter-in-law on Sunday, a friend's 50th BD surprise party on the 28th, another baby shower for her on the June 3, granddaughter's 2nd BD on the 4th and daughter-in-law's BD on the 11th. But this has consumed my mind that I can't concentrate on anything else. I think I know everything there is about mammograms, etc. That's all I've been doing on the computer. This brings back memories from four years ago. Always looking for something positive. But still don't know what neo density means. At my age, I shouldn't have any density in there. Yep, looked that up too on the computer. LOL! Think I'll ask them tomorrow about that. Thank you again for your reply. I'm just hoping I don't have to have anything else done. I'll be asking a lot of questions.",
