      "Content": "Im worried sick about tiny red thread veins on my breast which the dr said were superficial .they went away for a while but it seems to have come back but the strange thing is that they are not there all the time when I wake in the mornings they are not there it seems to appear throughout the day and they dont feel swollen or hot .Its a kind of red/purply pale bruise type marking a bit like mottled skin (I have nf1 too so have lots of caf√© au lait spots on my breast too) that comes and goes I have quite large breasts and the one that is affected is larger than the other always has been since I was a teenager. Is it something I should be concerned about I just wondered whether I was putting too much pressure on it from my bra or my arm (tend to cross them a lot .any help would be appreciated thanks Kat",
