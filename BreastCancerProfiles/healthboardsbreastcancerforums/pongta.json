      "Content": "Hey... My sis(35yrs) recently had a mamogram done and then was called back in for a second one. The doc said that he saw something \"suspicious\" that he wants to take a closer look at so he he now wants her to come in once again(in 3 weeks) for a \"spot magnification of breast density\"? Not to familiar with what that is or what is involved so I am wondering if this is something to be concerned about or is this just a precautionary measure. My Aunt recently passed from liver cancer but it started in her breast(which was removed)... she is the only female in our family to have breast cancer but I am wondering if the doctor is taking more measures to be safe because of the family history or is this something that I need to worry about. Any info from you girls/guys would be much appreciated. Thanks!",
