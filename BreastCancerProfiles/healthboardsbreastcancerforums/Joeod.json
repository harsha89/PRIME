    "Content": "I have had breast cancer since 1994. A year ago I had Taxol and herceptin, they worked briefly for me. Now I am on Xeloda. The taxol left me with nerve damage in the feet so that they tingle/burn all the time. I wonder if anyone has found an alternative treatment to get rid of this effect, especially since the Xeloda has a similar side effect that I am dealing with. Anyone tried acupuncture?",
