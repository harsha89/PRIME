      "Content": "Shirley, I can understand your concern and fear. Having gone thru a number of \"scares\", the only thing that helps me is getting that answer from my doctor that all is okay. If my doctor can't give that because he/she feels that more testing is necessary (especially if a second doc suggests the same), I would go with the test. That is only MY opinion. I know myself well enough to know that I would worry and the worry would get worse and worse until I had something done. Good luck and let us know what happens.",

Recently a 1.8cm non calcified lesion was found on my lung. A year ago it was below a cm in size, but I wasn't told about it by my oncologist. It wasn't until this fall when another doc found it and noticed that the follow up testing had not been done, because I wasn't told. It has obviously grown some, my oncologist is not concerned. My other doc is very concerned and said I should have a follow up CAT every 4 months. A pET scan in Nov. did not show any cancer. Should I be worried??? I have, in the mean time changed cancer docs but have not seen the new one yet. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I really don't have any advice only that my prayers are with you. I'm having a breast biopsy today on a lump with a couple of small calcifications. About the same time I found out about this I was contacted concerning my recent chest x-ray that showed a small nodule. The radiologist suggested a CAT scan but I've already had 4 of them and they are NOT good for you. Surely there is another option for this. If you have breast problems and have a CAT scan of the chest area looks like it wouldn't be a good thing. Hope that your new cancer doc will be on top of this and all will be well. I have a friend who had a nodule on an x-ray for years. It was just followed with x-rays periodically. It's been probably more than 10-15 years and all is well. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi, I've been one of those people who have always had breast pain right before my period. I am now 56 and menopausal. I went for my mammogram in March and was called back for a diagnostic mammogram for something that was termed \"structure changes in the breast\". The compression mammogram showed nothing and was told that many times once the breast is flattened out that nothing will show up. Shortly after that mammogram I started having some breast pain occassionally and sore breasts. If I feel them, I don't necessarily feel any soreness. It's only when they are touched or I least up again something that I feel it. In fact, they feel much like when I was still having periods. Does anyone else have problems such as this. I have been checking and checking for any lumps and finally thought that I felt something a few nights ago. I believe that sometimes I MAKE things worse by checking. I will probably go in to have this checked out though. I am concerned about having another mammogram. I can find \"inconsistencies\" often and if I ran to have it checked each time I found these problems I would be glowing in the dark from the radiation. Could I ask for an ultrasound instead or would they do the mammogram first THEN the ultrasound (as I've had several times before)? Sometimes I would just love to have them removed so that I don't have to keep worrying.....only sometimes. I am adopted and have no family history to fall back on.",

It isn't painful (I know that doesn't mean anything). It is high up on my armpit, at the very top where you would just start your deodorant. This is really scaring me. I have an appointment Wednesday at my regular doctor just for prescription refills so I will mention this to him. I had a mammogram and ultrasound at a breast care specialist back in September and all was fine. However, the location of this lump is so high that a mammogram wouldn't pick it up. Anyone with any experience with this. PLEASE make me feel better!!",

ANYWAY..........he did finally say that he felt it after feeling around (hope he was feeling the same thing I was) but he said that it was too high to be a lymph node and that he felt that it was nothing to be concerned about. Probably could have been an inflammation from an ingrown hair at some time. Even said that it was too small to be pathological. I thought that anything was pathological. Anyway, I feel better about it but still can work myself into believing that he wasn't feeling ths same thing that I was feeling. I worry too much I guess. He did say to keep an eye on it to make sure that it didn't get larger.",
