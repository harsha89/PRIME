This lump is movable and has a rubbery feel to it. It is also very tender. I've read that cancerous lumps are usually hard and fixed. What are the chances my lump might be malignant? I would really appreciate any replys. I have 3 weeks to worry about this. Thanks~ Hi hilery, Are you on thyroid medications ? I was diagnosed recently with hypo and as soon as I started meds my breasts increased in size so much I had to buy new bras. I was due for a mammogram and now I have to go in for another mammogram and a sonogram and the radiologist will talk to me on that day (dec 18). I am scared, but hoping that the changes are only due to the thyroid medication, and nothing else. Hope your lump is nothing as well. Mintchocolate",
