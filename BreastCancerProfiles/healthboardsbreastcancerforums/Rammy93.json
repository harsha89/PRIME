    "Content": "Hello everyone, I'm reposting this here because I had no replies on my previous post in women's health and I'm really scared. My doctor's appointment isn't until next week so I'm looking for some kind of insight to calm my nerves for the time being. Hi, I am a 22 year old female and I have a very tender/sore spot on my left breast I've had this pain before and it usually comes and goes and has been since around March, I went to the doctor and he found nothing wrong with it so I've never been that concerned with it. Yesterday I noticed that it hurt/was tender more than it has been before. It hurts to the touch and it is very sore, so now I'm starting to worry that it could be breast cancer. The pain is in the same spot that it is always in and hasn't moved, but it is way more sore than before. I've been checking myself regularly and haven't found any lumps. I should add that this is the first time it has come back since about Feb/March (it was off and on then). Should I be concerned? I will be making an appointment with my doctor for sometime this week, I'm just looking to get some answers for the time being to calm my nerves. Thank you! Thought I should add, I am now starting to feel some tenderness on my right breast in the same exact spot as my left, I'm really worried... Also the pain I am feeling in my left breast is worse and seems to have spread a little throughout the breast. I am really scared that this is something bad. Any insight on what this may be would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all so much!",
