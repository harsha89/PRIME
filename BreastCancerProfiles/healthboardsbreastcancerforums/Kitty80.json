    "Content": "My story is a little different, but I can relate 100% with you. I am 26 and I have 2 children. When I was 16 I found the first lump, my only thought was I am only 16 I am too young for this, 10 yrs later, I lose count as how many lumps I have. I was given two options from my Breast Dr. 1- I can go back every six months and have a mammogram and a ultrasound and wait for the cancer to appear, 2- Or I could have a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. But again I am a little different cause not only my mother had breast cancer, but my aunts and my grandmother. I do feel for you. You are more than welcome to contact me as you wish. I hope the best for you.",
