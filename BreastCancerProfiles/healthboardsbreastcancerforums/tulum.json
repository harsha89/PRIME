    "Content": "Hello, Sorry, not sure where to post this but I am worried so I thought it best to post here. The past few days, I have had an itchy rash that developed on the right side of my right breast. I also noticed that when I touch that area, it feels harder than usual and there are small dot sized raised bumps on and around my areola. Should I be concerned about this? Someone please advise. Thank you.",
