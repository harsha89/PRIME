    "Content": "Hi, I am 28 years old and have no family history of breast cancer but I have noticed today while showering that the skin just underneath one of my nipples is slightly lighter in color than the surrounding skin. It was never like that before so I noticed it right away but it's just a very tiny spot that is discolored about the size of a speck of oregano. I did not feel any lumps in my breasts but I do have breast implants so it is really hard to tell. I guess my question is if this discoloration can be a sign of breast cancer or maybe is just some hormonal change. TIA everyone. This is a great website!",
