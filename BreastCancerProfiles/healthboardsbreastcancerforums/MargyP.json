    "Content": "I'm sorry I can't help with your problem as such, you should just really insist your doctor do more tests. What I am wondering about is the way you said you are 34 and never had a mamogram, I was under the impression you had to be 65+ before they gave you one of those?? Is it different where you live? I am 35 and would be glad to have a mamogram as my Mum dies from breast cancer when she was 46 ( I was 10 and she got the disease when she was 39). I strongly recommend that if you have the chance you should have one especially as you have a family history of the disease!! Take care Margy xxxx Can I have a P.S here to save me doing a seperate post? (if not get a moderator to remove this next bit) I came to this part of the board (i'm usually in depression erkk!!) to ask if an itchy nipple could be a symtom of breast cancer?? Thanks again xxxxxxxxxxxx",
