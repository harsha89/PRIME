      "Content": "When I posted that I had been called back for further mammograms I was told that it is pretty common. If they do find something, 80% of the time it is benign. It's easy to say \"don't worry\" (I know, I've been there) but a lot harder not to actually worry. All I can say to you is that worrying won't do anything to help you at all so try to put it out of your mind. I just kept telling myself that 80% of the time it's nothing. That helped.",

Nine o'clock is in line with the nipple, ten o'clock is a little above. I had a cyst removed from my left breast 28 years ago, it was benign.",

They ran an MRI every time before to make sure that the balloon was in the exact right spot and that it hadn't burst. This was in August of this year.",
