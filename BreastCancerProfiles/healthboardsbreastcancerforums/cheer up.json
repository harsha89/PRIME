Surgeon says I am OK but let's take out the ducts so no more bleeding. Thus far, only the one episode that was off and on for two days. I'm seeing the doc again in a few weeks -- all tests were fine --",

Sure enough, when I got up and touched the breast, there were more blood spots oozing out of the center of one nipple. Whaat??? Will call breast center/breast specialist tomorrow to see about getting in there quickly but has anyone heard of this? Several years ago I had a 'scare' with the same breast but three docs confirmed it was an infection (hot and red and achy, came on suddenly after being outdoors in 108 degree weather), probably from a bug bite. Antibiotics took the problem away within days and there was no recurrent problem until now, some three years later. At the time I was told that if it had been a cancer, it would've recurred within a month after appearing to be gone. In the meantime I've had a few other manual breast exams, one of them months after the 'bug bite' from the same specialist -- and her exam made me sore for DAYS. I know this might be benign or malignant and there are several tests that might need to be done. Anyone out there have anything similar and if so, what was your outcome? Thanks! I am really panicky and it's 3 a.m.!",

An anecdote: I know a woman who had radiation after lumpectomy and after that, when she got checked out for something via X-ray, docs saw what they thought were spots on her lung. Turned out it was radiation burns re the breast cancer and the burns disappeared later. No more problems..... Just let them do the test they want now, but don't worry -- I have heard of exactly what you are describing.",

I can't get in to see my breast specialist for at least a week as she is out of town, but her receptionist is e-mailing her my details and will get back to me to tell me if the doctor thinks I need to go to someone else in her absence, and if so, who that might be. I don't want to go 'doctor shopping' on my own. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Well here's my story re the bleeding nipple. Went in for bilateral diagnostic mammogram and right-sided ultrasound. ALL CLEAR -- Met with a very highly regarded breast surgeon here, who recommended ductogram or MRI. Ductogram sounded brutal and radiology tech from mammo test site (a friend of mine) said go for the MRI even though it's more expensive. So... days later had a 'bilateral breast MRI with and without 'contrast. That meant they did the MRI first just by itself and then next with some material injected into a vein in my arm. Met with surgeon the next day and yet again, ALL CLEAR. Now he thinks it's just a duct problem and not papilloma. He said I 'DO NOT HAVE CANCER.' Good news, but there has to be a reason for bleeding, right? So since Thanksgiving and vacations are here and he said no urgency to do a surgery right now (cut under nipple and remove duct(s) that may have issues) -- I am on hold until mid December or January. Friend, the radiology tech and director of breast center, said 'since you are all clear re all the tests, she would recommend NOT rushing into surgery. I don't know what to do but I will have the next month to think about it before meeting with surgeon again. Surgeons always want to CUT, I do know that, but he was adamant that there is no cancer in there. Who knows? If I dig hard enough I can always find some woman's story of a hidden cancer that was caught too late. Many tell me to TRUST the doctor(s) who have looked at the results and just relax for a bit. Yet I always second guess everything. I need to calm down.",

Went for mammogram and ultrasound, and only a cyst was found that did not appear cancerous. A few weeks later went for a ductogram with a doctor who thought he found the right duct, checked it and told me it was a tiny short duct which did not have anything going on with it and deemed me cancer free, but told me if it worsens, I need to get rechecked. Three weeks later now, I looked down at my left breast and noticed a bright red spot in another area of the nipple, gently squeezed it, and now I have bright red blood from another duct and the same brown in the other. Is this worth mentioning? Does anyone know what could cause this in just one breast? I was so happy that I was given a cancer-free unless it worsens diagnosis that it didn't bother me that no one told me what could be causing the issue, but now that it is spreading, I am wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar? Thank you. Are you still wondering what to do about that one breast with the bleeding or did you see the doctor again? I know what you are going through. I had mammogram and ultrasound for the same thing and they showed nothing at all -- not even a cyst. So...I had a bilateral breast MRI with and without 'contrast.' Believe it or not, that came up clear, too. NOW what to do? The doctor says I can wait and see what more happens but he is certain it is a duct and can be removed easily in a small procedure --a duct excision -- at my convenience. He said: \"You do NOT have cancer.\" Sounds to me like you and I may be in the same boat. Since you have had a bit more bleeding, which is annoying and really should not be happening, I would agree that having another appointment with the doc (for another test) would be a good idea. Let us know what you decide to do! I am waiting a little bit before discussing specifics of surgery --",

      "Content": "Good grief! These doctors sure have messed up nicely with your case! I wish I could say it's rare for them to screw up, but it is not. I am not in medicine, in fact I wrote you back about your earlier post before I saw this new one. But I've had the spontaneous and discharge from squeezing thing/discomfort (primarily in one breast) for DECADES. Several docs over time have simply said \"fibrocystic breasts\" or not commented much or said just worry about RED or BLACK discharges -- greyish green or straw colored or white/clear are \"normal\" per one GYN who was a VERY good doctor. I've decided not to stress about the latest episode of single breast soreness and discharge. It is probably more of the same thing I had years ago; seems exactly the same. I refuse to be a guinea pig and get all these tests done, probably for nothing. I'm 60 now and figure if this syndrome has not killed me since I first noticed it in my early thirties, it can't be much of anything. I see on these boards that others have little or no diagnosis and some deem it \"normal.\" Let us know how you are doing.

I had the ultrasound to be sure it was truly a cyst and it was was. then the hospital screwed up the report saying I had one in both breasts. So they send me to a surgeon , why I don't understand. He could not find a cyst in the right breast and said the discharge which he would not even look at must be caused by a ruptured cyst. After the hospital fixed the typo and said there was only a cyst in the left one , I called his office and told them about the discharge being there still along with a knife-like sharp pain. They said just to wait until my recheck in a few months. So since it was really hurting I went to another doc about it. He said I have fibrocystic breast disease. He also said my pain near my areola is papillomitis or papilloma. I just wonder why the other doc never noticed the papilloma and the fibrocystic breast. the mammogram report said prominent fibroglandular breasts. Is that what that means -- fibrocystic ??? And he tried to pop what he thought was a cyst on the duct. Now the pain seems worse. Is that normal , I wonder if i should call back and ask??",

      "Content": "Whatever happened with your nipple discharge? Hope all is well. I have had left breast (usually left) discomfort over the decades from time to time -- am now 60 and still have it, though rarely. Along with that, I have sometimes had a slight discharge: clear, straw colored, greyish green. Have that now after long absence. I was told years ago not to worry; just worry about RED or BLACK discharge. Many of us have or had cystic breasts (some doctors said yes, some said no so you can see how subjective this stuff is) and this can cause the problem, ducts get clogged, etc. Medications can cause trouble, too. Please let us know how you are doing and if you found an answer to your nipple discharge problem. Quote: Originally Posted by Bryansmom I am a 37 yr old mother of 2 from CA.

I do have systemic lupus and my symptoms are flaring right now; it's possible that this is some kind of mastitis associated with that. My youngest is 7 and so this is not breast feeding related, but the pain is exactly like the pain I would get when I had a clogged duct when I was nursing. My question is this: has anyone on this board had experience with discharge from the nipple as a symptom of a cancerous condition? The literature out there is ambiguous with respect to nipple discharge and I'm a little concerned. Thanks in advance for any input. Michelle",
