    "Content": "Hello: My wife was diagnosed y'day w/ breast cancer. Last year she went in for a biopsy on a lump amd was told it was a fibroadenoma (benign) and when we had it removed monday, it had miraculously become malignant. It is 0.9cm in size,invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade is 5/9, the resection margins are negative for carcinoma. Needless to say we are shocked and scared. She will have to go back in for a sential node biopsy and also to remove some more tissue from where the tumor was to get a better read and staging. She is lucky she insisted on having it removed, for it could have been much worse. Now we have to wait...I would love to hear any comments at all, as I am scouring the internet trying to learn as much as I can about this....Thanks",
