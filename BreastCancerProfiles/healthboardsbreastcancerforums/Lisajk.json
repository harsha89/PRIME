      "Content": "My mother just recently went off of her hormone replacement therapy (she is 67). She noticed a very large lump, the size of an egg near in her nipple area. It seemed to grow overnight. She went to the doc and they set her up to have a mammogram and a biopsy. She has since went for the mammogram, and an ultra sound. Her appointment with the surgeon is this Thurs. She says there is some pain associated with the lump. On the ultra sound she said it looked like another \"mass\" was growing from the lump itself. My question is, since it grew so rapidly after she went off of her hormones could it have something to do with that? Should we be overly concerned since it grew so fast? No one in my family has had breast cancer, so I'm very new at this. Thank you! Lisa",
