    "Content": "hello, all i start my post by wish you all a merry christmas and a very happy new year. I am 21 yr old male. 106 kgs, 5 foot 10 inches,got gynecomastia( also called as man boobs) i guess there will be less men here with gynecomastia. my problems are i have got gynecomastia from the age of 10. thick soft breast tissue is present with glands. for the past few days i have been experiencing pain along the extreme left of my left breast along the borderline leading to my armpit and shoulder. i have been able to feel a cluster of lumps under skin which feels exactly like bubble wrap( used in safeguarding electronic items while shipping) they are less than 0.5 cm in diameter but there are some 10 or 15 present. the paint doesn't actually originate from them (they are actually present around the nipple) but my pain is around the boxer line where the lymph glands is said to exist. there is no swelling in lymph glands. but i can feel a very slight swelling in my left armpit.no signs of enlarged lymph nodes like cysts in armpits. no dimpling, i can't feel the lumps in my chest when i press my chest with the palm. but when i touch it with a singe finger like poking or scratching i can feel like wires or threads and the bubble wrap like lumps which i described earlier. the pain has grown a bit( bit still under limits) i read online that breast problems in men is just same as in women. but i am embarrassed to speak about this to my mom or dad. my pain has got down to the left upper part of abdomen . so on the whole the left upper abdomen upper left chest and shoulder hurts. i don't know whether is a fat deposit lumps or something like a breast cancer or gas due to gerd causing this pain. i need the help of some sisters here who have some experience with breast examination so they can tell me how the glands feels like( just like the bubble wrap? ) and pain plus when should i think about something serious. any kind of info with help me to reduce my anxiety. i have made an appointment with my gp and gonna take a mamo to find anything like lumps or something. thanks in advance.",
