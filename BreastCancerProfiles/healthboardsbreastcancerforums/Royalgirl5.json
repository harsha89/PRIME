    "Content": "After 2 mamograms showing microcalcifications, & a stereotactic biopsy with results of atypical cells, I recently had surgery to remove the questionable cells from my left breast. I was diagnosed with DCIS, micro papillary. He said the size was 1.2 cm. The surgeon wants to go back in to remove more tissue until he gets a clear margin. He wants to wait a few weeks to give me time to heal from the previous surgery & speak with a radiologist in regards to whether radiation is necessary. He also wants to start me on Tamoxifen. All of the researching I have been doing online suggests 2 options; additional surgery w/ radiation or mastectomy. From what I've read, radiation is almost always done except after the mastectomy. My surgeon has also suggested that after our next meeting I listen to his game plan & then go see another breast specialist or an oncologist for a second or third opinion so I can weigh all of my options & make a decision that I am comfortable with. Can anyone please share your experience with me? Sometimes I'm leaning toward just removing the additional tissue & keeping my fingers crossed for future mamograms & other times I think maybe it would be best to just have the whole breast removed so there is no chance for the cancer to come back. Any advise would be greatly appreciated!",
