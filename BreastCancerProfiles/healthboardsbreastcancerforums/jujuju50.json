      "Content": "Hi: My name is Julie 50 years old. Had a total hyst 9 years ago, on HRT (Patch) since. I go each year for my Mamo gram. Last year I got a clean bill of health. Well yesterday that all changed, can someone please explain the report to me, this. Thank you so much Julie The issue of both breasts is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. Current study was also evaluated with a computer aided detection (Cad) system. The cyst in the right breast at 6 o\u0092clock posterior depth is no longer seen. There is a stable asymmetry in the right breast posterior depth central to the nipple seen on the mediolateral oblique view only. There is a focal asymmetry with associated heterogeneous calcifications in the left breast at 1 o\u0092clock posterior depth. Targeted ultrasound demonstrates a corresponding irregular hypoechoic mass with an indistinct boarder. Vascularity (blood flow is flowing) is present. Sonographic evaluation of the axilla demonstrates only normal appearing lymph nodes. No lymphadenopathy is identified. Physical exam does not reveal a corresponding suspicious palpable abnormality. No other significant masses or calcifications are seen in either breast. IMPRESSION: SUSPICIOUS OF MALIGNANCY, TARGETED ULTRASOUND SUSPICIOUS OF MALIGNANCY. The stable asymmetry in the right breast posterior depth central to the nipple seen on the mediolateral obique view only is benign. The focal asymmetry in the left breast at 1 o\u0092clock posterior depth is at an intermediate suspicion for malignancy. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is highly recommended as soon as possible. This document has been signed by Dr. Lee",

      "Content": "Hi: THank you so much for the email. Boy you had been through a lot..I pray for you!!! \"what birad number did the radiologist give you\" is 4b, what does that mean??? I just read what you said, does not sound to good... They did say there is blood flowing, which I already know is not a good sign. Just had cysts removed from my kidney and they said it was not cancer and no blood flowing through it... I go on Wed for the Core needle biopsy..Does it hurt much?? What about after they are done??? Thank you again for the email and I wish you good health Julie",
