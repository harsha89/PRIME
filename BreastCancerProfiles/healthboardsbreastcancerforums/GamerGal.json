    "Content": "I have bilateral inversion of both nipples, and have had problems with a condition called mammary duct ectasia in the past. MDE is caused by a blockage in a milk duct, and it can be very painful. After diagnosis in my mid-20s, I treated mine with OTC anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and a hot compress on the site every couple of hours for 10-15 minutes. The condition still requires me to express my nipples every now and then to help keep the ducts clear. MariaBB is correct; worry would be premature at this point. I would encourage her to get a examination since MDE can be mistaken for Paget's Disease of the Breast, and vice versa, because the external symptoms are pretty much the same. It's not a diagnosis that someone could make based on their own research; let her doctor accurately assess the problem and prescribe treatment. Good luck to you.",
