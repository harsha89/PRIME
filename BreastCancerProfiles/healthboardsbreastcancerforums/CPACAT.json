      "Content": "Hi All, First posting. I recently had an abdominal CT scan in hospital with incidental finding of multiple nodular densities in lower left lobe of lung. I am a 6 year breast cancer survivor. Anyone else out there gone though this and have any input about whether or not I should be worried by these findings? I am going tomorrow for another CT scan with contrast to look at both lungs. What can I expect to know from this CT and what other tests/procedures might be ordered? I am scared about a recurrence of the breast cancer. Thanks for any response. CPACAT",

      "Content": "Just got the results of my lung CT. 8 nodules from 3mm to 6 mm - both lungs. Report says nodules do not appear calcified. \"Conclusion is that there are bilateral pulmonary nodules which are considered to be indeterminate due to their small size and lack of calcification.\"Do I understand correctly that lack of calcification is a negative sign that there may be a possible cancer? Radiologist goes on to recommend a noncontrast follow up CT in 1 year \"If the Patient is clinically at low risk for developing lung cancer.\" Am I considered to be low risk or high risk with my history of breast cancer? Thanks in advance for your answer. Helen",

      "Content": "Hi Suggi, Thanks for your post! My docs office said no problem, get a repeat CT scan in one year. I asked the nurse further and she said the doc said to refer to a pulmonoligist if I wanted a further review of the findings. ( I hate that I had to ask her to get that information - that kind of stuff drives me crazy. I totally trust my doctor to tell me what is going on - not so much the staff. I think thay just want to get my chart off of their desk...) I did schedule a consult with a pulmonologist on February 14th - guess that is my Valentine's Day gift (lol) I think I will feel better after the consult. I am still concerned about the calcification issue, but trying not to be a worry wort. I would be curious to hear the outcome of your interactions, test, etc. I know insurance coverage and permissions can be a big pain in the butt. I have had a hard time finding someone else to talk to that has had breast cancer and then multiple lung nodules. Good luck with your tests and results. Let me know how you are doing. Helen",

      "Content": "Hi! Thanks so much for your words of encouragement and your prayers. I appreciate both. It is hard living with uncertainty. The further out I get from the breast cancer, the more I realize that it is never REALLY over. That fear of a recurrence just lies dormant until some question comes to the surface and brings it all up again. I guess I just need to accept that reality as part of my life and spend my time knowing that I am truly blessed and in good health. A good positive outlook on life does no harm and can do great good. I just need to remember that when I get scared. Thanks for your support. Helen",
