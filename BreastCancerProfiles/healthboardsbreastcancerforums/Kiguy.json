    "Content": "Hi, I am a 24 year old that was diagnosed with a borderline phyllodes tumor three months ago. I had it removed with clean wide margins. I also have over half a dozen fibroadenomas (split between both breasts). Just the other day I was told that I have atypical ductal hyperplasia. My doctors have been scratching their heads to figure out why someone my age has already had so many issues. I am not sure about my complete family history due to my dad being adopted. I do know that I have a second cousin, a great-aunt, and a great-grandmother on my mom's side who have all been diagnosed with breast cancer. I would be lying if I said I am not absolutely terrified of a re-occurrence of the phyllodes tumor or the ADH turning into DCIS. Any words of wisdom? Has anyone else been diagnosed with both conditions? And if so, what did you do?",
