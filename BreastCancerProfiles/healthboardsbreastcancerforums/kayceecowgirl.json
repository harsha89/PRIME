    "Content": "Hello. I am going in for a stereotactic breast biopsy tomorrow (Friday) morning and I,too, am anxious and scared. I don't have any health insurance and am petrified about the cost and what it will show. I just know that God will not give me more than I can handle. I've felt a peace this week since my ultrasound and I think He's trying to make things easier for me. Good luck and I'll be back. So glad to have found this forum to learn about what to expect. God Bless. Sunny",
