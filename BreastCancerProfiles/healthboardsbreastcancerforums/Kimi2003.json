    "Content": "OHMYGOSH! I have the same symptoms. My Dr. put me on Zoloft and Gabapentin because she said I will have real bad mood swings, since I'm only 43, we found my BC when I was 41. I am more depressed because I have gained so much weight. The zoloft causes me to be financially irresponsible, the Gabapentin has caused me to be constipated and dizzy, I just don't know what to do anymore. I need some advice right away! Thanks, Kimi2003",
