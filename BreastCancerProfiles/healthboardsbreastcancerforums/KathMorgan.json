    "Content": "Scheduled for mid May right now. Every female in my family has either died of BC or Ovarian cancer in the last 3 generations and my identical twin had BC when we were 26. I have been religioous about self and medical screenings. I don't have to worry about the ovarian cancer as I had a complete Hyst 10 years ago. Had a BRCA-1 and 2 test done an it came back positive. On top of that my mommo's have bee indecinct because of very dense tissue all over both breasts. I'm kind of apprehensive and would like to know what to expect. As of right now I don;t plan on having implants. Just FYI I am a DD size. Any words of experience would help, thanks Kathy",
