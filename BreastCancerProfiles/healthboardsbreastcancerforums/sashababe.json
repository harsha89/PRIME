      "Content": "I didn't know there were different sorts of cysts. They showed up as little lumps on the mammogram. When I had the ultrasound it's obvious they are cysts as they're hollow. The lump that wasn't hollow they did the core biopsy on and that was the fibronoma. I then had a really big cyst that literally came up overnight. That was drained and hasn't reoccurred. The doctor says I have fibrocystic breasts. The main concern with this is that with all these various lumps, a new more sinister lump might go unnoticed.",
