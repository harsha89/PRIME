    "Content": "Starting last month, my 15 year old daughter has been having a discharge from the nipple of her left breast only. It only lasts for about 2-3 days and the one last month happened 2 weeks before her period and the time this month was one week before her period. Of course, at her age, her periods are still irregular so I can't really tell if there's a pattern. What I have seen come out of her nipple is clear but what has leaked and dried on her bra and clothes is yellowish brown but not a bloody brown. She has had hormonal issues in the past pertaining with her breasts. When she was 18 motnhs old one of her breasts started developing. She had one breast until puberty and the other one developed normally. The only diagnosis any doctor could give me was breast thelarche. And what's odd is that it's the normal breast that is having the discharge, not the premature one. Just wondered if anyone has ever heard of something like this. My gut is that it's something hormonal but it worries me that it's only one breast. She has an appointment with our GP, thought I would start there and see what she has to say. Any thought?",
