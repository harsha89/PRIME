    "Content": "I am 40 and for the last couple of years have been experiencing really weird periods. When my period comes, I notice that it is accompanied by very loose bowels. It seems to be increasing with time to the point of being diarrhea....sometimes severe diarrhea. In the middle of the period - on day 3 usually - the bleeding will stop completely and entirely - for at least 24 hours - and then start up again. When it starts up again on day 4, it is accompanied with the loose bowels once more - WHAT IS THIS??! I asked the doctor and he didn't seem to think much about it. Last summer I had a time with an ovarian cyst - they ran an abdominal ultrasound -the tech saw a complex cyst - my gyn said it was scar tissue from surgery probably - we did a CA 125 and it was pretty normal. I then got pregnant and miscarried - two months later he had an abdominal and a vaginal ultrasound done and he showed me the picture saying my uterus looked fine, normal and ovary appeared fine/normal, just enlarged. He said it was enlarged because I only have had the ONE for most of my life and it does all the work of two. Two months after he told me I was fine, no ovarian cancer in his opinion, I was diagnosed with lung cancer - they found a nodule in one lung, very tiny and very early stage. I had part of a lung removed and they say I am cancer free. The cat scans show healthy kidneys, healthy liver, etc. and they say the lung cancer hadn't spread to anywhere else. They never did a scan of my abdomen or a mammogram so I wonder if I still have cancer in there somewhere, Sorry this is so long. Has anyone here had the diarrhea with period thing? Comes with cancer?",
