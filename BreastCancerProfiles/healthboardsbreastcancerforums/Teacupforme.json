      "Content": "For the last 2 months I have noticed a lump of some sort on my left breast on the far right side,almost towards the part where the breast meets the breast bone. I am not able to feel it standing up,only lying down. I went to my GP today and she felt it,and said \"don't think you have manything to worry about, because you can actally lift it.\" I presume she ment that the lump or growth was a bit gushy and can be moved around. There is definately something there, and it's about 1.5 cm in size at the 9 o'clock position. She has ordered a mamogram and ultrasound. She notes on the referal... Cyst or Hnoaderome? Her writing is very messy and I can't make out that last word but it definately ends in \"aderome\" Can anyone advise as to what she may mean by all this,as I was in her office maybe 2 minutes,she felt it and satred writing her referal to the imaging place. I was a bit embaressed because I was still half naked and didn't ask any questions. Thank you so much!",
