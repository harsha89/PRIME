      "Content": "I would say call your surgeons office this doesn't sound normal, he will probably need you to come in and be seen. He may or may not want you to go ahead and do the mammogram. I would call before doing anything. My mother had a lumpectomy and radiation done she had a follow up mammogram 6 months after her surgery was done, she had none of the problems that you are having. Hope this helps, A.",

      "Content": "Hi, I noticed your post, I myself have no experience but I can tell you my mother was diagnosed last yr with breast cancer, 1cm tumor, had lumpectomy, lymph nodes were negative and she recvd I think about 30 radiation tx's to her rt breast. She is 75yrs old, she went prior to tx's to be marked with a marker and had some type of marking type of clip inserted at the lumpectomy site so the radiation tech could pinpoint the area. She drove herself too and from the radiation center and tolerated the treatments extremely well, they recommended some type of soap and cream to use to the area because the skin can become irritated. Otherwise no problems. She just had her 2nd follow up mammogram done this month and all is negative. Praise God. Hope this helps. A.",
