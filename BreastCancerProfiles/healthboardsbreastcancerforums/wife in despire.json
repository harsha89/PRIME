      "Content": "Hi I really need someone to talk to about this. I have been on my period for 2 months and one day now. Non stop bleeding. I am 36. I went to my gyn the 20th of may. the following tuesday he called and said that he wanted me in his office immediately. He did a endo biopsy and a viganial ultasound he said that my overies looked good.and that there wasn't much that looked pathalogical, the thing is I was hemmoraging when he done this . He said my uterus was acended but not much and that there was a mass in the wall of my uterus. My mom had to have a complete hysterectomy when she was 24 she had uterian cancer and my sister had to have one last year for the same thing. also he said my fasting sugar level was 141 and my cholesterol was high. Now I have to wait till June the 3rd to find out the results of my biopsy. He said my reg Dr would have to treat me for the diabetes and cholesterol . This is really worring me half to death. When I was 22 i was diaganosed with the first stages of cervical cancer while I was pregnant with my 2nd child. then they did cryo surgery and I had to come back every 3 month for a pap. everything has always came back fine until I started doing this. When he did the biopsy and the ultrasound I thought I was going to die. I have never had anything hurt like that before in my life. this time even my Pap hurt and it never does that . Any help or suggestions. he put me on 20 mg. of provera and iron pills because i was loosing too much blood. it has slacked down after taking it for 4 days now but it still has not stopped. I need some help here I am going out of my mind worring.",
