      "Content": "Dear Nibbsie I saw your previous answer to Chis and I was hoping you could give me some information. In 2006 I had microcalcifications that I had a Stero biopsy that was benign. Every year since I have had a normal mamogram. This year it showed new, clustered microcalcifications. The radiologist said they looked different. They are very small even with the magnifying glass. He said that there was a 70-75% that they were normal but if it was something this would be what I would want because it was small and slow. He said I didn't have to make up my mind then about the biopsy (but he didn't say how long I could wait) but I made an appointment to have it done right away. What do you think my chances are since he said they were different? If I have to have a lumpectomy what is invloved? Could this be early stage breast cancer and is there usually a good outcome to it? Thank you so much for your response. Sweetpea",
