      "Content": "I was wondering why my boobs always itch. I mean there are times I can just itch for ever.It's not exactly in the nipple area just below that area. I am constantly scratching and it gets embarrasing...Can someone answer this question? This isn't a sign of breast cancer is it? I am concerned because my mom had breast cancer and died at 48 and now I am 45....SCARY",
