    "Content": "I hope someone on here can shed some light on this. I have always heard that it's your maternal ancestors that are taken into consideration when evaluating a person's risk of breast cancer and that your paternal side isn't something that would affect you. My sister said she received a letter from her doctor stating that new evidence has shown that a paternal grandmother with breast cancer puts you at just as high of a risk as your maternal grandmother. My father's mother died from breast cancer when she was in her 40's, but up until now neither my sister or I thought it was something to be concerned about. Is this something new as the letter stated? My sister and I have always been very good about getting a mammogram every year (she's 49, I'm 53) but this letter stated that because our risk has now been raised, they would do a 'different' kind mammogram now that is more sensitive to detecting a problem than a 'regular' mammogram....I believe they said digital? Is this true also? I always thought a mammogram is a mammogram and there's only one way to do it, but if what this letter states is true, then yes, we would certainly prefer the 'better' one. Does anyone on here know anything about this? Any insight would be very much appreciated.",
