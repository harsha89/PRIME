    "Content": "There is definitely a lot of sense removing your bra and going without! 90% of the women with fibrocystic breast disease get relief from it if they go without bras. And most likely your breast pain will disappear or diminish a lot if you throw that garment away. It has been compared to the foot binding process that chinese did... Bras constrict and immobilize breasts, and inhibit the normal lymph flow. They cause the normal ligaments in breasts to atrophy (grow thin and weak) which means your breasts will sag MORE. Try camisoles/vests instead. You're on the right track! Maria ------------------ Breasts are for babies http://www.00b.com",
