    "Content": "I had an ultrasound on the 26th of August and am now scheduled for a biopsy on Monday Sep 9th, had an issue with the breast center being able to read the US and Mamo results, and now have to wait at least 5 days as I take Celebrex and that has to be out of my system. The report I have says the following: Hypoechoic avascular microlobulated horizontally oriented lesions. These lesions appear to be solid and demonstrate mild posterior acoustic enhancement. (There are 2) I have no idea what this actually means. Should I be really worried? Any info would be appreciated.",
