    "Content": "so to introduce myself, i will say i am a 27 year old healthy female with severe severe health anxiety in general and even more to the breast. in the past 7 years i have undergone at least 10 ultrasounds on breast alone, i even had 1 biopsy bec i touched my breast too much and ended up inflaming the tissue so i thought it was a lump. it wasnt, it was plain breast tissue. i go to my ob/gyn often for clicincal breast exam. occasionally i go for ultrasound just for reassurance purposes. makes me feel better for next few months. so i asked for an ultrasound even though i didnt feel any lumps at all. i went yesterday and expected just to have it done quickly and the technician would usually tell me everything looks normal and confirm it with radiologist later. this time however, she looked and i saw she was concentrating on something. needless to say i PANICKEDDDDDD! i hate doing further testing and going to breast specialists. this increases my HA tremendously. Anyway, after she was done, i asked her what she was looking at cuz im drop dead nervous. she looked at me weird and said, what makes you think its anything abnormal, so i told her u never usually look so long. she wasn't very nice and told me there are many normal things they look at during an ultrasound. but i shouldn't worry cuz it was only cyst & lymph node when my Dr called me back to give me the results of my Ultrasound, all he said is that its normal. i did know however, that the sonographer found a 0.03 cm cyst but he said its normal. Now, he uploaded the results on his patient portal, and i'm freaking out again. here is what it sais: There is a 0.3 cm cyst localized to the 11:00 position. A 0.08 cm intrammary lymph node is seen localized ot the 2:00 position. no discrete mass or region of shadowing seen. for goodness sake, what does this mean????? never heard of an intrammary lymph node. when i called my doctor for results, he just told me everything is normal. he didnt even bother telling me about cyst, when i asked him, he said its common and on the report it sais benign. my question now is, have any of you ever had normal ultrasounds with a cyst? did you do any following up? ( my doctor said i dont have to do a thing) did an ultrasound ever reveal a cyst without u feeling it? as i have severe HA, im worried that maybe its a mass and they made mistake? please share your experience if you ever had s/t like this. im so nervous and confused.",
