    "Content": "Hi there. I would like to discuss primary peritoneal cancer with anyone that has this cancer and is in treatment. My mother has had this for 4 years, had chemo, and seen the ca-125 rise and fall. I'd like to discuss your experiences, etc. Thanks so much in advance, JON [This message has been edited by moderator3 (edited 03-13-2001).]",
