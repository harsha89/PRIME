    "Content": "Hi, I too am in California, San Fernando Valley and am being treated for breast cancer. I also have medi-cal and I do know that they have various programs for medically indigent care and also share of cost programs. Where I'm being treated at the Leavey Cancer Center they also treat people that are unable to pay for free. Another place she may want to check out is Avon's Breast Cancer Crusade [url=\"http://www.avoncompany.com/women/avoncrusade/\"]http://www.avoncompany.com/women/avoncrusade/[/url] I believe they have financial assistance for women that need medical care for breast cancer but don't have the financial ability to pay. Good luck. Tonia",
