    "Content": "I am calling to make an appointment tomorrow, but I wanted to get opinions in the mean time. I'm 24 years old, and I have a 4 year old son. I breastfed him until he was 2.. Yesterday I noticed a slightly large (about the size of two quarters) red spot on the edge of my areola. I pushed on it and it was extremely painful. I haven't had any injuries to that area. I don't really do self breast exams as often as I should, but I do look at them in the mirror quite often. I decided to feel around to see if anything felt abnormal, although I'll admit I've never really known what I was looking for. They have always felt slightly \"lumpy\" to me anyway, but I did find one spot that felt different, its slightly deeper in the tissue and feels hard. After I was done doing that I noticed my nipple looked wet so I wiped it off and squeezed it and some clear fluid came out. Since then I've been paying more attention, there was fluid on it this morning, and this evening there is a stain in my bra about the size of a quarter. I've squeezed and squeezed my other nipple and it stays bone dry (I did breastfeed, so I've learned different ways of squeezing to get milk (or in this case fluid) to come out). My nipple on the breast that is bothering me is also swollen looking. Since then the red spot that originally got me looking at all of this has gone away, but the rest of the symptoms are still there. One other thing I have noticed is that although my left breast has always been slightly smaller than my right, it seems like now it is about a cup size smaller, almost like it shrank. I know for a fact that it wasn't like that even a month ago.. So I'm wondering if I should be worried about cancer at my age. I'm fairly certain I don't have an infection, its not warm to the touch and that one red spot went away. I also don't have a fever. I'm pretty sure I'm not pregnant either.. I'm not sure if it is relevant but I did have a benign tumor removed from my ovary last year.",
