      "Content": "I guess you need to decide on your quality of life and if you can tolerate no hormones. In the late 1990's I went to a seminar of Dr. Lazlo Tabar. He is the leading Mammographer wordwide and one of the pioneers of mammography. He was asked by a physician if estrogen caused breast cancer. Dr. Tabar stated yes it does but (at that time thought) it does great things for the bones and heart so keep taking it and have your mammograms. The last seminar of Dr. Tabars I went to in 2002 he was asked the very same question. His response was yes it does cause breast cancer, it does not help the heart, or bones. Also he showed a picture of a type of very dense breast tissue. He stated this is angry tissue and if this women is given estrogen it will cause breast ca for her. As I said before if you can do without the hormones and function than I would think it a better way to go. Newfie11",

This leaves the wire for the surgeon to follow. The blue dye is there for the surgeon to find the exact spot. Sometimes the wire can travel out of the exact area and the dye ensures the surgeon has that area. I would bet that is what you are seeing.

One thing about breast ultrasounds, it is always wise to be sure the technologist doing the ultrasound is ARDMS registered. Ultrasound diagnosis is very dependant on the person doing the scanning. Sometimes the radiologist will come in and scan after the technologist and that is fine. It is always better to have a radiologist read the scans instead of another type of doctor. As of right now most states do not require an US technologist be registered. That means anyone off the street can walk in and do an US with very little training. However I don't know any radiologist that would read them. The same can be said for x-ray technologists. There are still states out there that will allow anyone to do x-rays,ct,mri, etc on people. The on the job training lacks lots of important information. Newfie11",

Was there an ultrasound done? Was it done in an imaging cernter or hospital or by the surgeon? Fibroadenoma's are fairly easy to detect on mammography and ultrasound will definitely show it. It will show as a solid mass but cancers measure differently (highth vs width). They are very common in a woman under 40. Most radiologists will not pursue a known fibroadneoma. I guess I would want to see the mammo report the doctor got and what the radioogist said. Every good radiologist will look at the previous mammo to compare and if there is a concern they will compare previous years of mammos. Most Rads if they are not positive on something will order a 3 to 6 month follow up. It all boils down to \"can you live with this\"? If it is going to worry you then have it removed if not then ask your doctor to have a 6 month follow up done with ultrasound. If you have a breast imaging center near you I would use them for a follow up. On a diagnostic they should work you up the same day and most will have the radiologist explain what he see. newfie11",

If it was a screening mammo I would relax a bit as this very well maybe just the case of needing better pictures. I am only familiar with facilities that show all diagnostic films to the rad BEFORE the patient leaves the building and the patient has an answer to the problem before she/he leaves. If yours was a diagnostic mammo and films were not shown to a Rad before leaving it could well be the films were not adequate. Having said this, I have seen Rads look at mammograms, say everything is fine, and then once they sit down to really go over them want to call the patient back. Maybe this is what has happened.

One other note, usually the cancer has passed where the calcs show up. They are left in the process of it moving through. There are still cancer cells there. When you see the radiologist I would ask him/her to point out the area of concern. I don't know if you got to talk to the radiologist after your mammogram or not. I would stress you do before the bx.

      "Content": "Because you have calcifications I would suspect you will have a Stereotactic Core bx. Most places do not use ultrasound guided core bx's for calcifications due to the difficulty on seeing the calcs with U/S. On a stereo you will lie face down on a table with a hole for the breast to fall through. There will be some compression (not as much as required for a mammogram). There will be prelim pictures taken (of only the area of interest) and then you will have a numbing shot. After all the parameters are set the doctor will shoot the needle into the breast taking tissue samples. It depends on the doctor and what they see on the sample films as to how many times this is done. There should be very little to no pain. They will insert a tiny marker into the area they did the bx. You will not ever know it is there but it will show on every mammo you ever have. Afterwards the technologist will apply pressure to the breast to halt any bleeding (be sure you are off all meds that can cause bleeding well before this procedure). They may do a follow up mammogram film before you go home. Most places have a small ice pack that you will place in your bra. The samples as sent to a lab and hopefully you will hear something within a day or two. Good luck to you and you are right in thinking not all calcs are cancerous. Newfie11",

My only dealings with inflammatory breast ca, both patients had orange peel looking skin. The skin was not discolored. Their breast was rock hard. The cancer your doctor is referring to is metz from your previous breast ca to skin. You have had radiation therapy on your breast so maybe that is what is causing the rash. Grasping at straws here. Good luck to you newfie11.",

      "Content": "Kathy, WOW!!! That is a tough call. If I had your family history and like you also tested positive for BRCA-1 and 2 I would probably have the mastectomy. Thats easy for me to say as I am almost 60 years old. I have seen one case of identical twins having breast ca. They were 2 years apart but in the identical area. Have you talked to your doctor about having MRI's due to your dense breast? I must say sometimes MRI's miss thing also but they are great for looking through dense breast. Digital mammography is also SO much better for dense breast than film mammography. I am sorry I can't be of more help to you. Good luck in you decision. Newfie11",

      "Content": "Calcifications are not always cancer. Most are not cancer. They can be caused by many things benign. Most of the bx for calcs are benign. Radiologist are always jumpy if the calcs have increased. I assume they did magnification views on you before ordering the core. What concerns the Rads is the shape, density, cluster, what direction the calcs are going(are they tracking toward the nipple), what the area around them looks like on the picture, and sometimes if they are increasing. By the way, the core films are digital and show on a computer screen. There will be no developing films unless they use a non digital mammo unit to x-ray the specimens. I assume, boodle2, that you had a needle loc. That is done with the mammo machine and there are times the stereo cannot be used and a needle loc is necessary. In that case films are taken to find the area. The Radiologist will have to insert a needle, then films are taken to see if the needle is in the right place. If it is, the a wire is advanced through the needle and the needle is pulled out. All this time the patient is in compression so the area of concern doesn't move from the first film. The wire has a small hook on the end and remains in the breast until a surgeon follows the wire down and remove wire and breast tissue. Most of the time this is done in surgery, years back some doctors did this in their offices. As far as lumpectomy vs mastectomy, IF you have cancer and that is a big IF at this point I would talk to your doctor and an oncologist before making the decision. I do not know your age. I can tell you at my age (60) I would very likely have a mastectomy without reconstruction. That is a very personal thing and each woman who has breast cancer will need to do what is right for her. When faced with breast ca I think the very best thing emotionally is talking to others that have been through it. I thank goodness have not. Newfie11",

They may have been on the path report but one cell over could be a cancer cell. No one can tell that. Thats the reason for chemo/radiation! I do not know your age but if you are premenopausal and this cancer is estrogen receptive I would do everything the doctors recommend. Newfie 11",

      "Content": "deleted If I were in the position of Atid I would darn sure have both if thats what the doctor recommended. Breast cancer in a premenopausal woman can be extremely agressive. In a younger woman it can unbelievably aggressive. It depends on which type of breast cancer she has. Would you not try what is recommended by the latest in medicine? Most breast cancers can be cured if found and treated early enough. Breast cancer kills women with the attitude of lets ignore it and let fate do what it will. There are many different types of breast cancer. Some are born killers and no matter what is done they will kill, some are born hugh ( they are not found until very large) but are not aggressive and take a very long time to kill, all the while thay can be stopped. Some will never grow and stay the way they are, but those are VERY few and far between. I am sure there is scientific proof as far as the success of chemo/radiation or it would not continue to be done. In fact if you search \"10 year survival rate for breast cancer with chemotherapy\" there are lots of studies to prove the subject! I see women now who I know didn't stand a chance in h... but are alive 10 years down the road BECAUSE of treatments. I also remember women who tried the latest vitamins (and I am for vitamins), teas, mushrooms, and something from Mexico that didn't last a year. Was it because the cancer was aggressive or was it because the treatment didn't work. Doctors are not God but they do what they can and there is many an oncologist in tears when one doesn't make it! Being in it only for the money is not worth the emotional strain.",

      "Content": "You are being called back for a diagnostic mammogram. That means they did see something and want to look a little further. They are doing a ultrasound so that means whatever they saw was a mass. Don't get upset. Masses usually are benign.Cysts, oil cysts, fibroadenomas, etc are all thing that could have a Radiologist wanting a look with u/s. It is very common to do an u/s if there is a new mass. They will probably also do additional views (Add Views). That means the positions are a little different and/or they will do spot views(compression of only the area of interest). Depending on the facility you may get an answer the day you are there. Some will work you up as far as needed the day you are there. It takes longer to do a diagnostic mammo than a screening so maybe they are booked out that long for diagnostics. Many mammogram facilities have closed in the last several years and the ones still open are really busy. If you have another in your area and can get in earlier for a diagnostic you certainly can go there. You will need to pick up your films (if not digital) to take with you. Try not to stress. I know it's easier said than done. Good luck.",
