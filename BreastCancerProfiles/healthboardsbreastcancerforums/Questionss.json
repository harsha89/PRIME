      "Content": "Thank you for thinking of me, that really means a lot.... I'm so freaked out. I went to my doctor appointment and she said the tissue felt the same on both breasts but that the left one is larger, so she's sending me to a Breast Clinic to get an ultrasound. My appointment for that is tomorrow and I'll let you know... Thank you again for being so nice.",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by cancersux Questionss, PLEASE report this to your ob/gyn. I noticed breast changes since I was about 26/27. I told my doc, they sent me for a mammogram. I had pain/enlargement for years. Nothing significant was found on my mammogram but they asked me to come back in 6 months. I didn't. Then a few years later, (I'm 33 now) my left breast became very large. I told my \"new\" ob/gyn and got the ball rolling. Not to scare you but mine turned out to be stage III breast cancer. Best of luck to you. cancersux, thank you so much for responding. Can I ask you what breast changes you noticed when you were about 27? I'm still freaked out about this, I ended up getting a mamogram and a different doctor at the breast clinic and he said that all is normal, and when I asked why the change in size he said that this can happen and that it's not a huge change, and that almost always on the mamagram there will be something unusual if it were IBC. And that I don't have any pain in my breasts. He said he wouldn't be able to biopsy anyway because there's no particular worry spot or pain or anything. I don't know, I will make an appointment with an OB, I just don't have any faith in doctors, especially now... I doubt they will do anything either.... Thanks for your input and help I would love to continue to chat with you about this.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 27 and I recently noticed that one of my breasts are larger than the other. It didn't used to be that way. I also just had a miscarriage at 6 weeks along a few weeks ago, however I think I noticed this shortly before I was pregnant. I was originally thinking that it was due to my pregnancy and I'm being paranoid but now my hormone levels are back to normal and it's still larger....I can't remember exactly when I first noticed it....... I'm very concerned, could this be cancer?....... any comments are greatly appreciated.....",

      "Content": "Well I came back from my appointment at the breast clinic. they did an ultrasound and said all is well, however they can't explain the change in breast size. When I told him that what I've researched is that you need a biopsy to find out if you have inflammatory breast cancer (because there are no lumps) he skirted around my questions. He didn't even exam me at all. I don't feel assured and I think I am going back to my doctor and hopefully either I'll get more explanation or a biopsy or a second opinion.",
