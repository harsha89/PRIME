    "Content": "A bit of history: I'm 54 and have family cancer history--breast, brain & colon. I have fibromyalgia, cervical and lumbar stenosis, degenerative disc and joint disease, etc., but a few weeks ago I began having chest pain and pain down my left arm so I went to see my cardiologist. He said it was probably related to the fibromyalgia and/or cervical stenosis after running some tests, but it probably wasn't my heart. I had my well-woman, went in for the mamogram and they just called me back to say that I have an 8mm mass on the left. I noticed when she did the compression for the film on the left that it really, really hurt and the chest pain was worse for a few days afterward. I'm scheduled for an ultrasound on Monday, July 7, but I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced chest pains almost like angina with breast cancer and if that's what could be causing this intractible pain that I can't seem to get rid of even with the pain meds they give me for my neck and back. They've told me to double up on my meds and use a heating pad, etc., and nothing seems to work. Thanks in advance for any suggestions or shared stories. Deb",
