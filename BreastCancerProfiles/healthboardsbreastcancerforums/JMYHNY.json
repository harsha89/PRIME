Also, both my grandmothers on my dad's and mom's side of the family had breast cancer. One of my grandmother's had one of her breast removed completly. When should I go to the doctor...should I be worried? I'm only 24 years old too. Any suggestions!!!",

IF you've never felt this lump before, I would see a doctor just to make sure all is ok. If it's a lymph node, it can be enlarged due to inflammatory reasons. you could've nicked yourself while shaving under your arms, etc. Lymph nodes filter out the bad things that enter our body. that's their job. being you have a family history, they'll probably start sending you for mammograms at an earlier age too, like they did to me because of both of my sisters having had breast cancer. It's frightening, I know. You'll have to be diligent in giving yourself monthly breast exams and having your gyno give you breasts exams annually too. This is the best thing you can do to watch for any changes if anything should start to happen. you have to become used to your breasts so that if any changes start to happen in your breast, you'll be right ontop of it. IF you're concerned, I think you should call your doctor and have them give you an exam just to make sure. let us know what happens,. try not to worry hon. it's normal to be able to feel your lymph nodes under your arm pits. to a certain extent that is. Linda Thanks Linda.....I will keep you posted. I plan on going to the doctor about it the 7th of April since I am already off that day. I am going to get my blood taken too since I haven't done that since like middle school and I know that's bad for waiting too long. But I am trying not to worry but I have been told I'm a worry wart.",
