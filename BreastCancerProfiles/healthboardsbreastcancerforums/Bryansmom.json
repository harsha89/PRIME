    "Content": "I am a 37 yr old mother of 2 from CA. I've been having some minor pain in my left breast for about a month now, and just last week started having greenish discharge (sorry to gross everyone out) from that nipple. I saw a nurse practicioner on Thursday who immediately set me up with an appointment in the surgery clinic. I do have systemic lupus and my symptoms are flaring right now; it's possible that this is some kind of mastitis associated with that. My youngest is 7 and so this is not breast feeding related, but the pain is exactly like the pain I would get when I had a clogged duct when I was nursing. My question is this: has anyone on this board had experience with discharge from the nipple as a symptom of a cancerous condition? The literature out there is ambiguous with respect to nipple discharge and I'm a little concerned. Thanks in advance for any input. Michelle",
