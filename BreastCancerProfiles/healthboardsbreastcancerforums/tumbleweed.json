      "Content": "Hi, my daughter has just had a breast lump (and some lymph nodes) removed. Initially she was expecting only a dose of radiation treatment (\"to clear up anything left behind\") in about 6 weeks after the surgery has healed up. However she has now been told her tumour cells were triple negative so she will probably be in for some chemotherapy as well. This is a bit confusing, we don't see why the triple negative discovery would cause extra treatment - there was no mention of any hormone treatment previously. We are in different countries so communication is not easy and I do not wnat to bother / worry her by asking too many questions, so I wonder if there is anyone out there who can give me a clue as to what thinking might be going on?",

My son is a doctor and attends her medical appointments with her and her next one is next Monday, so I will talk to them both after this and keep you informed.",

Was there any reason why they needed so many attempts to sort you out? I hope that you have finished with treatments now - you were wise / lucky to avoid radiation - I've had it twice. All the best, peter",
