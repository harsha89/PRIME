    "Content": "I am 29.. always had lumpy breasts. I think I \"know\" my breasts pretty well, but it's hard to keep track of each and every lump! I have a breast exam by a doctor every six months.. never had any problems. About a week ago I noticed a thin line of tissue under the skin of my areola..don't know how else to describe it. Almost like a tube. It's only in one breast. I have felt the same thing on a different part of the same breast that has always been there.. but I think this one might be new. I've read on the internet that you shouldn't \"pinch breast tissue\" during a self exam.. because something might appear as a lump that isn't.. I definitely do have to \"pinch\" to feel this tissue. Could it be a milk duct? I have an appointment in a month for a regular exam.. is it okay to wait that long to have it looked at by my gynocologist?
