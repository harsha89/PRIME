She didn't tell me if it was actually tumor or what. Her beside manner wasn't desirable. However I off to get mammogram and an ultrasound and then to see a specialist. Now my question is on her paper to the specialist she indicated \"Breast Density 4 o'clock. I am really scared because I've never had a doctor to be so vague. I also check my breast and couldn't notice what she was talking about. Could someone shed some light.",
