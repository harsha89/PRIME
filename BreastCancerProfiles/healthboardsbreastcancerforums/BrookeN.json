      "Content": "Hi! I'm 25 and I have a question about an ultrasound a had a week ago. I found a lump at the top of my left breast. I went to my OBGYN and he said he wasn't worried about it that it felt like a cyst ( I have very cystic breasts) he said it is nothing that he would have mentioned even being concerned with during a routine check. He ordered an ultrasound for peace of mind. Well I went and the tech asked me specifically where the lump was. I showed her and she put the transducer on it to take a photo and she took a photo underneath my armpit as well bc I asked her to ( I have anxiety btw) and she was done after that and got up and left . In and out in 7 minutes if that: I went into the bathroom and I was thinking OMG what if I didn't show her the correct spot bc she was sorta rushing me . So my question is ... When the ultrasound wand takes a photo of the concerned \" spot\" is it taking a small photo or pretty much all of the area it's around? I'm sorry the post was so long!! Thanks! ~~ Brooke",

      "Content": "Titchou, Thank you so much for replying so quickly! I understand what you're saying , but she didn't pass over my breast really .. I pointed to the \" lump\" she put the wand on it, the machine took the photo and she picked up the wand and went to the armpit and took a photo of that. My concern is me not showing her the right spot bc I was rushed and so I'm worried I didn't show her the lump I am actually concerned about . So I was just wondering if when she took the photo of the spot I showed her does it take a large photo of pretty much the whole top of the breast or that one small little area I pointed to. I worry so bad I know I'm probably annoying !",
