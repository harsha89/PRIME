However while I was feeling for it, I felt another lump father down - it isn't exactly under the arm, but it's not quite as far down as the breast if that makes sense. It's pretty deep in and very slippery and movable. I had a mammo and ultrasound yesterday. Now today they called and want additional mammo pictures on Friday. I went to the chiropractor meanwhile, and he said that it feels to him like a solid cyst, but of course to have it checked. That he has one on his neck, and that it doesn't seem attached to anything. I can't get anyone to tell me why I have to go back for additional views and I'm trying not to freak out. I know it's in an awkward place, but the tech seems to have felt that we got the area pretty well. After the mammo, I had an ultrasound done to see if it was a fluid filled cyst; I guess not, otherwise they wouldn't want another mammo, right? I'm afraid - and just wondering what will happen moving ahead (biopsy, etc?) I just found my first underarm, mobil lump in the same way - shaving nick. What was the final result of your tests?",
