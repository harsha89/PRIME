    "Content": "Hi all, I had a double biopsy back in the beginning of February. I had a \u0093mass\u0094 removed from under the nipple in the left breast. Before hand, I literally woke up on morning in severe pain. My breast was flaming red, puckered, dented, a whole size bigger, the nipple and areola was stiff. My GYN put me on antibiotics for a couple of months. When that didn\u0092t change anything, she sent me for an ultrasound and a mass showed. Because the antibiotics didn\u0092t help matters, she feared \u0093Inflammatory Carcinoma\u0094 She sent me to a surgical oncologist. She, by looking at me, didn\u0092t feel that was the case. However, she wanted to do a \u0093slide\u0094 but I was in way too much pain to let her squeeze my nipple so she did it on the right and fluid came out. I never had pain in the right breast so I was confused as to why that happened. Anyway, she sent the slide off for results and it came back showing \u0093Papillary cells\u0094 and her nurse called with the results and informed me I needed to be scheduled for a \u0093incisional biopsy of both breasts\u0094 This was in December. It took until February to have the biopsy only because the head radiologist at the hospital who performed my ultrasound \u0093got on the doctors A**\u0094 for putting me off so long. So, I go in for the biopsies. I have the lump removed from the left breast. This left a 5cm deep whole that needed packed by home care nurse for the next 2 weeks. In the process of that, I landed in the ER due to infection and incorrect packing! Also, she biopsied the right breast by taking out half of my milk ducts to look for papillary carcinoma. I am clear on both. Unfortunately, while in the ER for the infection in the left breast (5 days after surgery) they noticed 2 pea sized lumps on the underside of my breast and I almost came off the table when they pushed on them. They are still there and are still just as painful! The surgeon felt it was no big deal but ordered another ultrasound. The head radiologist performed the ultrasound again. By this point we are on a first named basis! She insisted on a breast MRI. This was March. I had to go back to see her AGAIN for another ultrasound that my surgeon ordered and the Radiologist Doctor asked \u0093why haven\u0092t you gone for the MRI I suggested?\u0094 \u0093Because the surgeon felt it wasn\u0092t necessary!\u0094 Well, keeping with her MO, she got on the phone with her and I was scheduled for the very next week! I had my MRI and nothing showed. However, we are now into July and I am still experiencing pain. This doctor of mine proceeds to tell me it\u0092s \u0093hormonal\u0094 and I have a low threshold to pain! I still have 2 lumps in my breast where the milk ducts were removed that are so painful, I can\u0092t lay on my stomach. When I am sleeping, sharp shooting pain wakes me from a sound sleep. I ache all the time. The only relief is warm wet wash clothes and a heat pack. Both breast hurt still. The right nipple is numb to sensation, but I can feel pain. I feel like I am walking around all day with someone \u0093pinching my nipples!\u0094 It can get excruciating! I am also a diabetic and figured maybe I was just extra slow in healing. But this doctor of mine made me feel like I am an A**!!! How in the world can my right breast all of the sudden be \u0093tender breast syndrom or hormonal\u0094 when I never had pain in it Pre-Surgery! How does laying face down on a hard chiropractor\u0092s table leave me in severe pain for the next 48 hours!! I can\u0092t have any pressure put on my breasts still!!! Has anyone experienced long term PAIN after these types of biopsies?",
