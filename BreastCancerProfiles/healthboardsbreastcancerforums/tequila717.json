    "Content": "My grandmother was recently getting radiation treatments however her last treatment was in July. Today i took her to the doctors only to find that the radiations caused burns on the outside of her vagina and on her butt. Since she couldnt see the burns she just thought it was a UT but we found that they are infected now and doctors not sure what would be best to heal the infected wounds because she has already tried all over the counter creams somebody please help",
