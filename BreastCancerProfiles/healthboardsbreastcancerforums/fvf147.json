      "Content": "Hello! I'm glad I found this forum. Some history on myself... I am 35 yrs old, married w/ two children and I have a family history of breast cancer. My Mom got breast cancer when she was about 50, she let it go too long before she got checked and she died after it got into her lungs at the age of 59. It was stage 4 when she finally went to the dr and she only received treatment the last 5 yrs of her life. It was in her bones as well as both breasts when she was finally dx. And it never moved to any other organs until a year before she died it moved into her lung. Chemo and radiation was able to keep it at bay for awhile, but then stopped working. I have been having my mammos since I was 30. They've all been good till this year. I had one done last week and they called me back this week for a follow up, for what she said on the phone were \"changes\". So today I went back in for the additional scans and an ultrasound. It was the worst 40 minutes of my life! She finally came back in and said the radiologist felt like everything looked benign but for me to come back in 6 months to make sure. And she said I was free to go. But I was like, \"Hey wait a minute, what was it that was found?\" I had heard her talking during the ultrasound to another tech in the room about 2 different \"its\" one at 12:00 and another at 11:00 (right breast). And I had heard them both say they looked the same size and something about lymph node. So She said yes they were both lymph nodes but the dr felt like they were benign. I guess I was hesitating about leaving and she said that my dr would get all the information and if I wasn't comfortable with waiting the 6 months I could talk it over with him. I believe she said they were both really small, but I don't know the exact size. I've done my self exams and I have never felt anything and I had a breast exam with my papsmear a week before the original mammogram, and she said everything felt fine. I've read on this board and on others that lymph nodes can be nothing at all, infection for some reason, and also cancer. I just don't know if I should feel confident in waiting the 6 months, what do you all think? And also since there was 2 of them and not just one, would that be worse than if there were just 1? I'm just full of anxiety and I realize the news could have been worse but it could have been better too. I would love to hear from you all, thanks for \"listening\".",

      "Content": "Yes, they were in the breast itself not the underarm area. But like I said it was fibroadenomas not lymph nodes, I'm sure your's will be a cyst or adenoma too. I have fibrous breasts and they do get really tender about midway of my cycle to about a few days before my period starts, it varies month to month, but some months I cringe when I get an elbow or something from my 5 yr old.",

      "Content": "Hello Vicki, I just wanted to let you know not to worry, it's probably nothing. Most lumps found turn out to be benign. It's good that you are getting it checked out, the waiting is the hardest I know, but it will give you peace of mind and soon you'll be able to look back on it and be glad it's over. My 2 lumps turned out to be fibroadenomas. I ended up seeing a breast surgeon, my gyn 2x, having 3 diagnostic mammos and 2 different ultrasounds over a period of 6 months time... and when the breast surgeon assured me that both he and the radiologist felt they were completely benign fibroadenomas, I said to him with confusion \"what about the lymph nodes\" and he said \"who told you that, it's no where in any of the radiologists reports\" and I told him the technician who did my ultrasound told me twice that's what it \"probably\" was, she even told me after speaking with the radiologist that he felt it was probably lymph nodes. And the breast surgeon was very angry at this, he said \"this is the reason why they (techs) are told to keep their mouths shut\", he apologized for the confusion and anxiety that I'd been feeling for the past 6 months and said she should've never told me that, because that's not what they were/are. That was last November... I just had my regular mammogram yesterday (one year after the start of all this) and the radiologist came into my little dressing room himself and told me everything was fine, there were no changes at all from last November's or last June's mammograms. So now I can go back to yearly mammos. Please let us know how your appointment goes and hang in there. I know the waiting in those little rooms for someone to come tell you something is so hard... take a friend with you if that would help you! I was so nervous and anxious that I wouldn't have been able to read so I hesitate say take a book or anything, unless you think that will help the time pass. Hang in there, you're doing the right thing by getting it checked, you'll be on the other side of this soon! Important Side Note to Everyone: Make sure your dr/breast surgeon always look at the actual mammograms/ultrasounds themselves rather than just reading the radiologist reports, if your surgeon is doing the latter you are just getting an opinion of an opinion.",
