      "Content": "Hello I'm 25 yrs old and I have pain under my left breast where the iron of a bra would be that is (the below part of the cup). I don't know how to explain it... it doesn't hurt if I don't touch it.. but it hurts when I lay down and rest my head on my left hand (like you'd be watching TV for instance) which makes my breast as if stretching and hence, the pain. I touch where it hurts and I don't see it as a lump ... it's as if the bone (if any?).. I don't weigh much (53 kilos) so it's easier to see if there's anything like lump I guess? any idea what it could be?",

      "Content": "oh Linda, thank you so much for the detailed reply - much appreciated!! alright, the thing is I did have my period after the day I had the pain that made me post the thread.. now the pain is gone. I might need to check if next month again during my period it'll hurt. But I know it's best to have the peace of mind after checking out with a doctor. I might need to add that for few months now, though my period starts right on time but it's nothing compared to before. If I bleeded, say, 10 cups before now it's barely 2 cups! Does that say anything? I also have to add, I'm passing tru the most nervous stage of my life as I'm unemployed and really worried about the future. I am home most of the time and that's driving me to depression though I'm a cheerful person by nature. In any event, I wish you all the best!! I hope you break the history of your family tree! Thank you once again! I might see a doc next month maybe.. but will keep you posted!",

Why wait till it becomes WORSE then treat yourself. I am not sure if I got it right but if you should see a doctor to prescribe pain meds, then see one (or even two - just to compare the treatments suggested). I hope you find a solution to this asap!!! i really hate this thing that we, females, have to face with breasts! - CANCER!!!!! I have pain under my left breast (where the iron of a bra would rest that is). If I don't touch it, it doesn't hurt though i know there's something there. It's not a lump and there's the same thing under my right breast but it doesn't hurt there. So, i don't know what it could be.. I am lost too... it's been few months this has come to my notice.. I feel it msotly when I lay down and rest my head on my left hand (like u'd be watching TV for instance) but will definitely have it checked out if it stays there. the mere thought of what could be worse scares me!! Take care!! Hope someone out there will be helpful...",
