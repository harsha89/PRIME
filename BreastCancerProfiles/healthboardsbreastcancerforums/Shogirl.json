      "Content": "I would be afraid now for myself not to continue having mammograms. I already have had breast cancer. If I were to decide now to stop them, it could grow back again and be worse. I don't like having to take the radiation each year, but in my case i just don't know what else to do. If I hadn't had the mammogram to begin with my cancer would not have been found, especially being as small as it was. What would you do if you were in my shoes. I am trying like heck to eat properly but still need help. I know my diet needs to be more varied.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago, i have dense breast. This does not mean you're going to get breast cancer because you also have dense breast; it's normal to have them be dense when you are as young as you are. I'm in my 50's and am one of the strange women who still have dense breast, there's really nothing i can do. It makes me worry more, because I get afraid the mammogram will miss something. mammograms aren't 100% accurate for anyone though. Best of luck to you, you are so young to have had to go through what you already have. Try not to worry too much with the breast, hopefully things will be fine for you. How are you doing now?",

      "Content": "6 years ago i was diagnosed with breast cancer. I had a lumpectomy, radiation and took Tamoxifen. Now in viewing my reports, I see it says on each report that I have extremely dense breast. This scares the hell out of me. Now in reviewing these reports, it seems to me perhaps I should have had a masectomy. I wanted to keep my breast, and like that I still have them, but it really was never pointed out to me how it said extremely dense. I'm in my mid 50's already, so I don't understand why at this late age they are still so dense. I took birth control pills for 6 years due to heavy bleeding. Did taking the birth control pills cause them to be even more dense; I feel taking them sure increased my chances for the breast cancer. I have my first digital mammo last year, but I had to request it. My doctors have a very good reputation, but they sure didn't suggest digital. I'm wondering if I need other further test due to the density. I'm a nervous wreck about having my annual mammogram, I always have to wait for about a week to even get the results. With what I've now read about extremely dense breast, it doesn't look good. I could be told the mammo is fine, but there could be more hiding in there. Anyone else on here have extremely dense breast. I read something on the internet today saying a woman has five times more of a chance of getting breast cancer due to this. I also see it says I have aytpical hyperplasia. I'm extremely depressed and have very high anxiety.",

      "Content": "I take it you are one of the ones who hasn't been diagnosed with cancer. I was, and I took the radiation. There are too many different types and grades of cancer, and each has to be treated differently. I don't see where you claim the survival rate is the same if you do something versus nothing. That statement makes no since; there is plenty of evidence to prove differently. I received some advice from another non-cancer person this week claiming I should never have another mammogram. A mammogram is what found my early cancer in the first place. I just advised her not to ever have one again then, I will decide what I'm personally going to do. Many women who went years without having a mammogram find their cancers much more advanced then mine. Mammograms and all treatments are not 100%, but it sure beats doing nothing. I never listen to people who have never had cancer. I'll listen to them once they have it, then they can tell me what they don't believe in. It's so easy for people without having cancer to say what they would do, or only throw out doom and gloom to try to make people more scared. \\ deleted",
