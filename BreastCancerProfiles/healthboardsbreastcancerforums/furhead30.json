    "Content": "Hello, I had the wire and surgery done last week to removed some cluster microcalcifcations. Good news from the doctor came two days ago that the tissue came back fine, however my doctor said they are not sure they got it all out. All my mamo's showed alot more calcifications and clusters. So at this point I am not sure what they will do next? I have a follow up next week and my doctor said she will discuss everything but its driving me crazy. She did say I will have to have another mamo done in the next two weeks to make sure there are none still in my left breast. My question is what if they did not remove all of them will they have to do the surgery all over again?? A few weeks before that I had two cysts in the same breast the clusters where found biopsyed and those came back non cancerous. If anyhow has some input on my situation and has been through something like this please can you help me with some details on what will be next? Thanks",
