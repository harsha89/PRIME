It's always best to get any breast lumps checked out quickly, but most of the time they actually turn out to be non cancerous lumps of different types so try not to worry too much until you see your doc. Cysts etc will usually feel hard and will be painful and you may need to have them drained to get the fluid out, so make an appointment with your doctor and go from there but the odds are very good that it's something quite harmless. ps. I had something very similar in my early 20s, it was in a similar spot to where yours is and it was painful and I had it removed, but it turned out it was just a largish cyst. I wasn't too worried because the doc said by looking at the mammogram it didn't look like cancer anyway",

But there are a lot of different lumps that can occur in the breast and if it feels large and painful, it may be a cyst or abscess for example. But it needs to be checked it asap and treated no matter what it is. I just wouldn't jump to conclusions it's cancer until you've had it checked out",
