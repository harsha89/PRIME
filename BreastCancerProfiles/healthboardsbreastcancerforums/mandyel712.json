    "Content": "HI, My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer about 5 years ago. She had a lumpectomy and radiation and has been fine ever since. At her latest oncologist appointment her blood tests showed elevated liver enzymes. Our family is, of course, freaking out and worrying about the worst. What is the most likely cause of this? She is going for a CT scan today, but i am so worried I cannot wait for the results. She has no symptoms of anything and has been going to all of her normal appointments every 6 months plus been on Tamoxifen. Any feedback would be greatly greatly appreciated.",
