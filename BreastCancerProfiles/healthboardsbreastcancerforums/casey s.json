      "Content": "Hi, my mother had breast cancer stage 3, four years ago, Then a year ago it came back as metasasized cancer to her liver and bone. She has undergone radiation and chemo for the last year, as well as taking chinese meds and naturalpathic herbs. If anyone is going through chemo they should look into this bottle called \"CHEMO SUPPORT\" it is chinese herbs that realy helped her and some other people with the side affects of chemo!! Now she is taking only naturalpathic care, the oncologist says they have done as much as possible. Vitamin C injections, Shark cartilage and this new Gingseng medication is what she is taking know, on top of all the other vitamins and herbs they give her. We hope we can prolong her life and give her some quality of life with no pain. Her eyes are realy yellow (liver) and she gets crazy night sweats. We hear alot of peoples ideas of mind over body so we will try some hypnosis healing . Unfortunatly my mother has always been a negative person. Please be careful when you have had breast cancer to not tramatize your body afterward. Meaning, the more I learn about cancer the more it seems like they are such clever little devils. Just keep your body mind and soul as healthy, enviornmently clean, and stress free as possible. Always stay positive, every human body will react differently to different treatments, do your research. Their was a lady who had stomach cancer and the oncologist said you have only a few weeks. It has been 6 years and she is still here!!!! I",
