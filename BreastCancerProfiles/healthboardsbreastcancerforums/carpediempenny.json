    "Content": "HI, I am sorry to hear about your pain and discomfort. It is no fun at all. I had 27 nodes removed on the right side and a port put in on the left side two weeks ago. I am not doing too bad. I have some pulling on the scar and the back side of my arm is numb and almost a burning sensation. I had drain in for a week because of the removal of the nodes and after that came out I felt a lot better. I had to shower with my bra on and or some contraption to hold the drain tube and bulb. I was a nervous wreck every time I showered. This whole process is so uncomfortable. Just take it one day at a time. I know it is hard. I am no where near the end and I am mad, frustrated, scared, extremely tired etc. Take time for yourself, this is our time to pamper and spoil ourselves even though it doesn't feel that way. Our health is most important at this time. Good luck, hugs for you too, Penny",
