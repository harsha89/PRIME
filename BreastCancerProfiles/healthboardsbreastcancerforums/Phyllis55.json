      "Content": "All of us hear can feel you fear of waiting for the final results. This is something to be concerned about. You must not let the fear of the outcome consume you though. Sounds like in your case the worst case senerio for you would be what you are already doing, have the suspisious nodes removed. So if they do show up with a few of the cancer cells you are ahead of the game by already haveing them out of your body. I have a half sister who has twice now had the pre cancer nodes removed from her breast. I was having colonoscopy done every couple of years and haveing pre cancer polps removed. So I thought I was safe. During the last five years there was some very devesating family turmoil happening and I neglected to have the colonoscopy done for five years and the same with mamogram, I am fibrocystic so it is hard to tell anything with home breast exams. Then one day I noticed the inverted nipple and the doctors got me all the test done withing days, there was no saving of my breast at that point. So feel good you are staying on top of your care and getting things taken care of in the earlyiest stage possible. Will send good thoughts to you and your family that things turn out well for you.
