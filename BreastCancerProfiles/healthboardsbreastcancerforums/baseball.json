      "Content": "I have not been tested for the gene. They just told me it was a benign lymph node and not to worry. I'm going to see what a breast center Doctor has to say. I do have a lot of cousins, 2 great Aunts and my Mom that have had BC. My 39 year old cousin died from BC after fighting for 5 years. When she first went to the doctor with a lump they told her it was nothing but they didn't do any test on her. They did not do a biopsy on me. I've had mammograms and a U-sound. Thank you for posting! I glad to hear yours hasn't changed. Liz",

      "Content": "I have recently developed a couple benign breast cysts. I'm 45 and drink too much coffee so I'm not really surprised. I have been on Lexapro for three years (successfully - 5mg) and wonder if there is any correlation. Has anyone else noticed cysts forming since they started taking Lexapro? And has anyone formerly on Lexapro with breast cysts noticed any change since they quit? Thanks everyone... this is a great forum... have a great day! :",
