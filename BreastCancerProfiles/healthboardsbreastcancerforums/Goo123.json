    "Content": "Good Luck. I just turned 50 too and found out I ADH too. Do you just have to have more mammograms? What is your treatment? I have to speak with a surgeon, followup to the biopsy next week. Very curious. I've read, and there is a slightly higher chance, but I probably could loss about 30 lbs, exercise to help it appears. Any thoughts appreciated",
