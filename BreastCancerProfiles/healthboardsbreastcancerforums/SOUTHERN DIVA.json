      "Content": "I am 42 with history of fibrocystic disease in breast,also have saline implants under muscle.No strong history of breast cancer. For the last month,I have had very bad pain inupper outer quadrant of left breast. I have tried vitamins,heat,etc.. I saw a new dr. today,he said he felt \"subtle lumps\" under edge of implants that would be made worse through normal monthly hormonal changes and the edge of implant would press directly on it resulting in pain.He assured me it was not cancer.I am still worried even though last mammo was 4 months ago and was fine. I actually had 2 in the same year.This was actually the 5th dr. I have seen in a year who says this does not feel like \"anything to worry about\".I am really not a hyperchondriac,just a worried female! Can drs really distinguish between fibrocystic disease and cancer? Thanks anyone.Please help!",

I am just worried about a lump I have found in my very low pelvic area,it is on the left side about 2 inches from the groin in the pubic area.I am absolutely terrified that the 2cmsmall cysts\" they saw on an ultrasound has turned into \"something bad\".I just saw my gyno about 4 weeks ago and he said everything felt normal. My husband,who knows I worry about everything says my ovaries are not \"way down their\" anyway. Is he right,I am worried half to death.",
