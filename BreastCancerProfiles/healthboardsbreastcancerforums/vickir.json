      "Content": "Thanks so much for your reply. It sounds like you have been through a lot. I am glad everything turned out well for you. My breast seem to always be sore because of the fibrocystic problem so when I felt the cyst I wasn't that concerned. When my doctor said today it was a lymph node I was immediately terrified. Were your's in your breast and not the under the arm?",

The ultra sound techs at our breast diagnostic center will not tell you anything. The radiologist has to come in and explain everything. Thanks again and I will keep you posted.",

      "Content": "I went into my OB-GYN's office today because I found a lump/cyst in my breast. She says it feels like a lymph node and it is under my nipple. I have fibrocystic breast disease and have always had cyst so thought it was that. I go in tomorrow for an ultrasound. I am very worried and concerned. Anyone have any calming advice? Thanks. Vicki",
