      "Content": "You have done the right thing and so has your doctor. Seeing a physician first is the best thing to do. Research in the meantime is excellent. Don't keep yourself in the dark. Know your body. Notice when something's not normal, but try not to go to the darkest places in your mind. Someone who responds with a suggestion for a diagnosis has appointed themselves an expert of something they are not qualified to be. Yes, I can give you my opinion, but you are wisest to let a doctor's ideas swim in your head before others guess. You're worth more than a guess. For example, what you said at first sounded like a bruise, but it's hard to bruise a breast and see the mark. If the mark changes, it's not a bruise. I can't know what an exam or tests will conclude. So ignore the guesses and stick to the facts. Facts give you peace of mind. Guesses make you worry or avoid getting proper treatment.",

      "Content": "I'm quite late in responding, but I'd be interested to know how you're doing. How did your visit go? For those responding because of having similar symptoms, I'd tell Anxiousmind first to visit a doctor, which she did. Also, it's obvious she did research. That's a plus. Know your body and what to look for. Regardless, if you have a symptom, see a doctor. An office exam can tell a doctor quite a bit. Tests tell even more. Making your own diagnosis will not give you peace of mind, even if you're a doctor. Do what Anxiousmind did. She knows her risk factors and symptoms, and made and appointment. Make the appointment first. But know your body. You have more to tell your doctor if you do.",

      "Content": "It is very inappropriate for a breast clinic to postpone issues as if they are a common cold. Since your appointment has passed, I would like to know that something better has come of your visit. You deserve the best care, thorough exams and answers and peace of mind. It is always your right to search for and find a doctor who is spot on regarding the meeting of your needs, including answering questions and giving you proper explanations. Many women do, in fact, have 'lumpy' tissue or harmless cysts in their breasts. Until a doctor sits with you to calm your fears, search until you are satisfied. See a different consultant whenever you wish.",

      "Content": "The first reply is your assurance. Whenever you have something going on, no matter what your own diagnosis, it's best to see a doctor. Feeling for a lump will not cause a dangerous issue. Ask any woman who has had a mammogram, if a breast wasn't resilient, they wouldn't mash it either. Muscles in the chest wall can be pulled like any other muscle and can be painful. But, always, instead of trying to narrow down the possibilities, see a doctor and, if you feel you'll forget, write down a list of things you'd like to tell or ask. No one should tell you their own experience in hopes it will help you make your own decision regarding the matter. Everyone and every breast issue is different. Your issue is within you, no one else.",

Since it has been a while since you posted, I hope everything is ok, Jose. To any other guy checking this thread, any unusual lump or otherwise questionable site should be examined by a doctor. It will ease your mind and you'll rest easier knowing what is happening. You can also get treatment. Don't allow your mind to go to the worst case scenario. Not everything means cancer. And just because you're a man, you do have a breast, but it is a man's breast. There is no shame in seeing a doctor.",
