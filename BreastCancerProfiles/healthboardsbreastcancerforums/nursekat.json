    "Content": "I was wondering if you ladies could help me talk about my worries. Have you ever heard of somebody with a negative lump biopsy that developed a malignancy? I had a lump biopsied three years ago - then it was one small pea sized lump and now I have two, much larger lumps and general lumpiness around them. I went to a doctor a year ago to have it rechecked and he wouldn't even do another ultrasound - I'm 26 now and he said I was too young and if the biopsy was negative, then the ultrasound would just be a waste of money and he would just take it out if I wanted. I didn't go back to him, and haven't gone to try another doctor - I was too scared I would get the same response. My new job's insurance doesn't kick in for a couple of months and I'm finding it hard to wait - I'm starting to worry about it more and want to get it figured out! I just didn't know if something that was originally considered benign could change or if maybe biopsies aren't 100% accurate.",
