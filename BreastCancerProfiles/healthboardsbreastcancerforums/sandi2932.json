      "Content": "I had a mammogram two weeks ago taken in a mobile unit at my workplace. I got a call back yesterday telling me they wanted to take an additional x-ray of my right breast and I think they said maybe a sonagram (sp). I had shingles three months ago and still have faint scars from it. Could they show up on a mammogram?",
