    "Content": "I hope someone can help me. I have breast implants and my doctor found a lump in my breast that is questionable. I am having a mammography and a sonogram done in a couple of days. The thing is I am so afraid that the implant will break. Can anyone give me any advice for things to be careful of during the procedure for the mammogram? Thanks.",
