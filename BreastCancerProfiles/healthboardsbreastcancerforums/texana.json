    "Content": "Hi. I'm new to this forum but not new to bc. Please be aware that bc has different varieties. Most cases are ductal, then there's lobular, inflammatory, and more. I apparently had a surgeon who didn't know this. Mine was lobular and didnt' get diagnosed. Ductal has a distinct lump which can be felt. First, I hope you're just poking yourself in the breastbone to the point that it's sore. That is far preferable to bc. I'd recommend you look in the Susan Love Breast Book and read the section where all the different kinds of bc are described. If something on the list resonates with you, I'd recommend you get tested and make sure you get a doctor that knows about whatever kind of bc you suspect. and btw, my bc did not hurt at all.",
