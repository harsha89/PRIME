      "Content": "this has been going on for about a year now... when my breasts are tightly squeezed around the nipple area, a dark green / blue discharge comes from the right nipple and a dark brown from the left... depending on which one you are squeezing. i have been to doctors, and am told i do not have any form of breast cancer. but... no answers as to what causes this. the colours are apparently abnormal, and everything i have read points to cancer... anyone have any ideas?",

      "Content": "i had a general exam and an ultra sound... that's it! and i had to chase after the specialist to even get any results... where they told me NOTHING and that it was nothing.. \"probably just an irritation\" i have my nipples pierced, which i forgot to mention, so i thought it could be caused from this, although i've never really heard of it... i guess it's definitely time to look into a different doctor... at the moment, it's really nothing.. you have to REALLY squeeze to get anything to come out, but it is a fair amount when you actually do (covers whole top of nipple) - i have absolutely no pain... i just want to be sure it isnt the \"start\" of anything... thanks... xox",
