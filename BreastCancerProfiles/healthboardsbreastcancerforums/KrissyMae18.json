    "Content": "I am just wondering if anyone out there has had any instances where their breast has tingling sensations but it turned out to be nothing? I have been having these sensations for a few months now. No drainage, no pain, no discoloration, nothing. Just sporatic tingling that lasts only a second. I went in to my GP yesterday for a full breast exam and she found absolutely nothing. I am having a partial mammogram tomorrow to be safe, but has anyone else out there had this? I had a partial Hysterectomy 3 years ago and wondered if it was a weird quirky thing.... or if I should be worried since Breast cancer runs in both sides of my family",
