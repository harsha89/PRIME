    "Content": "Hi there all....Can sore breasts be cause of an infection..or is this breast cancer? They have been feeling like they are less sore ..but I am still worried..there are no lumps ..and I check often for them ..but I am still scared..They did have clear discharge ..when they where really sore a few days ago and squeezed them..which I shouldn't have done.I am sure just squeezing them hard enough would have caused that.There are still alittle sore and under my arm alittle sore ..I am wondering is this a systom of cancer? Thanks in advance.",
