      "Content": "THANK YOU Terri for replying. Beginning to think `no- response' meant not good. Sharing helps alot to know what to do. Had no breast injury, nothing. Last yrs. concern was a few days of dark-brwn then nothing. Now it's daily-burgandy `gd-description'! I guess I just wait for a regular mammo on 10/4, or call to order a special type mammo? Did a lab do ultra or your Dr. ofc? A friend did all the right things for 8 yrs & told fibrocystic acts the same. She had mammo's ea. 6mo. & died from breast cancer. Guess that explains anxiety. The films you had, were they the mammo or ultra-sound pictures? Read somewhere they inject dye somewhere & then do pictures. Did you have that? Anyway, I'll stay in touch & good luck on the 16th. Bless your big heart!",

      "Content": "Terri, yes appt. is Sat. They wk. 1/2 day @ center. I did call back & got more aggressive. They finally did change my mammo-code from basic to diagnostic-films. Why on earth should we have to yell to get looked at? Guess baby-steps make ya' feel like you've accomplished something. Thanks to you, I sleep better. Still may take 3 weeks for results but getting the nerves outside & knowing someone cared to write is a very big help. I'll write when I hear something. Big Hug! Thank you.",

      "Content": "Terri, Thanks for your concern. Had Mammo on 4th. The radiologist was great. Extra films taken + a breast smear attempted several times on a pad-stick? It's a strip w/ 4 color pads. Fluid dripped on 1st yellow pad then wait 1 min. If turns any shade of green, blood in duct is present. Wrong day for test! Slt. change but not enough. Gave me a few to test at hm. when most symptomatic. Then I call Dr. to see if radiologist can work me in to see which duct the blood is from. Could be just duct injury. So far, nothings happened beyond slt. strip change. So far my reg. doc is also zip! I just called today & mammo results `were reported' to her. Nurse says files are 3 stacks deep on desk & may be a month to get to! Docs busy delivering babies. This is Breast Cancer Awareness Month! Where do they get off? I explained, this was not just baseline. I'm waiting like others & out of trying. Was told `if ya' had something, we'd call ya!' If they lost me, would they also call? I'm probably fine & just the usual fibrocystic. I've found most Az. MD's suck! After 8 yrs. of suffering & called a nut, I went to Calif. to a simple GP for a simple CT. 4 surgeries later the tumor was gone in my skull. Yes, it `was' all in my head. Now I wait. Thanks again & stay out of Dodge!",

Sometimes they can't think out of their box! Let's cross our Boobies that all turns out great. I'll be thinkin' about ya' & we can compare results later. You're a very special person. Big Hug!",

      "Content": "Hi Terri, I'm sooo happy for you. Really glad you got good news & good care. So far, I'm being treated like an old-lady alarmist! Dr's ofc. said stress does strange symtoms when you get old!(55!) I made 1 call to ask abt `smear' & now I'm old? Guess I wait till my standard mammo 10/4 & see. You helped alot being a good listener. You & hubby can go celebrate! I'll write after I get some info. I will think positive.",

      "Content": "Woke few days ago & noticed stain on Rt. side of PJ's. Rt. nipple had dried blood. Showered & ck'd for lumps & found nothing. Then lightly pressed & dark-red blood came out. Doesn't leak but blood expresses easily. I called Gyn-ofc. to see if they could move up Mammo appt sooner than Oct.4th. Said no control of lab scheduling. It was OK @ your ck-up in July! Don't worry. Well this isn't alittle & never bled before. Is this something to put off weeks? Should a Dr. test the blood for cells? This is pretty scary. Appreciate any input.",
