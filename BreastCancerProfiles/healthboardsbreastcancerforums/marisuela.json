      "Content": "Not very original, I know, but I have this small pea sized lump in my left breast and it's kind of freaking me out. I have breast cancer history on both sides of my family, skin cancer on both sides, and a few other types also on both sides... and did I mention this is freaking me out? It's just under the skin, and it's visible like a zit, but with no head or anything. It doesn't hurt at all, and it moves with the skin. It's been there for at least two weeks and hasn't changed in size at all.... unless MAYBE it got a teensy bit smaller, which makes me feel slightly less freaked out, but it's hard to say. No other symptoms at all, except I'm really tired... but that might be from the nights I've spent worrying about this... I've looked up breast cancer symptoms, lumps, cysts, bumps, etc... but nothing really fits. Help? Please?",

      "Content": "Thanks. I plan on seeing a doctor, but I have to wait 2 weeks for the appointment with the GP so that I can get a referral to the specialist, which usually takes another week, and then another few weeks before I can get an appointment to the specialist. In the meantime, I'd really like to know if anyone has any ideas or experiences or reassurances or thoughts of, \"nice knowing ya,\" or whatever so I might have a clue as to what this could be. Does breast cancer usually show up as a tiny little lump IN the skin? Please, anything will help. I've been feeling like my days are numbered ever since my Dad passed away a few years ago from skin cancer, and now with this new lump, I know I am WAY overdoing it with the \"must spend as much time as I can with my kids and husband\" mentality! I think I'm driving them crazy, but I can't help it. Everyone I know who has ever had cancer of any kind has died. To me, it's a death sentence (sorry if that offends anyone, and I know that plenty of people have been cured of cancer.... just not anyone I know). Anyway, still freaking out....",
