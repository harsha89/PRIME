    "Content": "I would also recommend checking your breasts and demanding to be tested if you see or feel anything suspcious. I found a lump in my breast, was told it was nothing because I'm too young..blah..blah..blah. But i had good dr.'s that sent me for an ultrasound and then a surgeon. It turned out to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma (breast cancer). I was only 28. It seems to be happening to more and more younger women. Be your own advocate. I'm now 30 yrs old and feel great. God Bless Us All.",
