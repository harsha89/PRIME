      "Content": "The mamo results did come in the mail today and they were negative for cancer. They said I could call the drs office on Monday if I needed to hear anymore about the test. This still doesn't explain the pain I have and by the way it has gotton less in frequency. They did say I might want to have an ultrasound since mamo's don't catch everything. Thanks for listening. And any advice is welcomed.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply. I go back to see the obgyn on the 28th and I'll ask him about a ultrasound then. He couldn't give a complete exam(you know what I mean) the other day because I just can't lay down on my back yet. So he said maybe by then he could and on the 29th is the check-up for the fusion. It did seem like my breast calm down somewhat but as of yesterday the same hurting and burning feeling. Guess it could be associated with how I was positioned during the spinal fusion during surgery. Maybe I'll have answers soon.",

      "Content": "I have been having severe right breast pain for about 1 full week now. It seems to sometimes come from my armpit to my right breast and down through it sometimes toward the nipple. I can sometimes find this tender spot upon self-exam, but most to the pain comes when my arm rubs against my right breast OR it just starts shooting pains thoughout it seems. Thanks for any help you might offer. Could this be some type of breast cancer?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I did go to the dr. today. I had a mammogram immediately after the office exam. He told me he would call me with the results. He also gave me some hormone med and told me not to take them until I hear the results of the mammogram. I'm 40 y/o and yes this isn't just soreness it has been real pain even when my right arm just brushes against my right breast. Still only the right breast. Again, thanks for your reply. Hopefully I will know more by tommorow.",

      "Content": "I had my mammogram yesterday and should have got the results today, but haven't heard yet. Guess no news is good news! My doctor said he felt some thickness upon examination and wanted me to go have the mammogram. He also said that I could have just pulled a muscle during my spinal fusion 1 1/2 weeks ago or the way I was laying on the table during surgery. Guess it will be Monday sometime before I know anything definate now. Thanks for your advice and hope all is well with you guys.",
