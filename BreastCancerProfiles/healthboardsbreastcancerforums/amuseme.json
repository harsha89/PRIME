This recent sct scan showed a 10mm nodule on my right breast. The next thing they did was a 3d mamogram and ultra sound. Now im scheduled for a pet scan on Feb 1 to see where we go from there. I survived the lung cancer being 6 months since surgery and now i must battle breast cancer. Have you dr. Preformed these test and follow up. Best of luck to you‚ù§.",
