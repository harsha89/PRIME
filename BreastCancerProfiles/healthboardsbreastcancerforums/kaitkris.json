      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm waiting for biopsy results. I had a small lump in my left breast and had it removed last weekend. I still don't know othe results and was told Monday to come to the doctor's office and they will tell me the results. The nurse told me that the lab was doing \"specialized staining\" so it was taking longer. The whole thing has made me very anxious. Is there still a chance that the results will be benign, if they are having to do extra tests on it? Or do you think it is definitely something cancerous? The waiting is the hardest part, I think. Thanks and God bless you.",

      "Content": "Thank you for your kind words. I found out that the lump was cancerous and I have to have more surgery on Friday so they can check lymph nodes and make sure it didn't spread anywhere else. It is good to finally know, now I'm dealing with the emotions of knowing. This is quite a journey. It is encouraging to read about those who have been through the journey and are doing fine now. I'm trusting God to bring me through. Take care and thanks again.",
