      "Content": "Dear Phoebe: I am 38 and have all ready had the very same scare you are now experiencing. In my case, they did the ultrasound immediately following mammogram. Turns out it was a harmless cyst, which is probably the case with you. Most of the time breast cancer is asymptomatic, in other words...no pain. So, believe it or not the fact that it is sore is a good sign. Get the ultrasound for peace of mind and then once you get the good news you can move on. Caffiene irritates breast tissue, so in the meantime ease of the caffiene and try some evening primrose...I have found that or vitamin E to be very helpful with breast pain. Good Luck, let me know how it goes! Reze",

      "Content": "I once had a swollen lymph node in my arm pit! It was so big you could see it plain as day. Naturally it terrified me, but come to find out 30 minutes with a heating pad was all I needed to make it go away....for good! Hope it's something just as simple for both of you ladies. God Bless, Reze",
