      "Content": "Hi, They discovered 2 tiny cysts (fluid filled) about 6 months ago (mainly when I went complaining about pain) and the doc said it was common and normal and nothing to worry about. In the last 2 months the pain has become many fold worse (all the time) and I definitely feel these cysts have become bigger and the cysts were found only in the right breast and none in the left.. sometimes when the pain happens both pain and I still don't feel cysts in the left one. 4 months ago they also discovered a cyst on the ovary. I am having follow up ultrasounds for the breast and the ovary in the next week but am very worried and can't stop worrying as to what's going on with these cysts and whether these developments are related and might have a common cause. I have had thyroid issues in the last 2 years but right now I do not need thyroid medication but do have a little positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Of course the ovary cyst could be a functional one but I think it may not be coz I feel very mild pain sometimes in that area several times a day. It could be a muscle pain or something else I don't know .. (I do carry my toddler some) Any advice would be very welcome.",

      "Content": "Grazia, Thanks for the reply. Apparently the pain (sometimes symmetrically) in both Bs is through the month and not significantly more towards the period.. (it used to be different i.e painful and sore very close to the period about 2.5 years ago and with th onset of the period it would vanish) .. after the baby that has changed. Can estrogen dominance be tested and is there a treatment for it ? Thanks",
