      "Content": "I'm 47 yr old woman and just had a MRI Breast done. Dont understand there are a lot of things going on. The doctor tells me just to follow up in a yr. Should I seek a second opionion? Thank you. Please read below the findings: TECHNIQUE: Axial pre- and dynamic post-contrast T1-weighted fat saturation sequences were performed as well as sagittal T2, axial T2 fat saturation, body coil coronal STIR and coronal postcontrast T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. 3-D and 2-D reconstructions were performed. The images were evaluated with CADstream software. FINDINGS: The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense. Corresponding to the mammographic asymmetry in the far posterior central left breast, approximately 14 cm from the nipple, a 1 cm area of asymmetric tissue does not demonstrate abnormal enhancement. This area demonstrates concave margins and is morphologically similar in appearance to normal appearing glandular tissue. In the far upper-outer left breast, 16 cm from the nipple, 2 morphologically normal appearing lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged, each measuring 9 mm. They demonstrate normal fatty hila. Scattered throughout the central left breast, 4 tiny foci of stippled enhancement measuring 1 to 2 mm are nonspecific but may represent small foci of adenosis or fibrocystic change. For foci of this size, enhancement kinetic features may not be useful. These are asymmetric in number as compared to the right breast. These foci are best seen on image 55, 46, 90 and 116 on the cad angiomap. Tiny scattered hyperintense T1 foci less than 5 mm in diameter seen in both breasts are consistent with normal appearing scattered glandular elements. Additionally, subcentimeter nonenhancing T2 hyperintense foci less than 5 mm in diameter seen in the left greater than right breast are consistent with small cysts. At least 2 these are seen in the 2:00 position in the left breast, which likely correspond to the ultrasound findings of cysts. No suspicious masses, architectural distortion, skin thickening or nipple retraction is identified. A lobular focus of enhancement in the inferior sternum which is T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, demonstrates avid enhancement. It measures 21 x 7 x 13 mm and contains internal punctate foci of T1 and T2 hypointensity. A very distended gallbladder is seen on some of the coronal images, without evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. On the coronal T2 images, a vertical tubular structure just posterior to the gallbladder likely represents the inferior vena cava. IMPRESSION: BI-RADS 3 : Probably benign, recommend 12 month follow-up breast magnetic resonance imaging, concurrent with annual mammogram. 1. The area of mammographic abnormality in the far posterior central left breast 14 cm from the nipple likely represents normal asymmetric glandular tissue. 2. Tiny foci of stippled enhancement in the central left breast measuring 1 to 2 mm, are asymmetric in number when compared to the right breast. While these may represent small foci of adenosis or fibrocystic change, these findings are nonspecific. Given the asymmetry compared to the right side, follow-up breast magnetic resonance imaging is recommended to evaluate for stability or change of the small enhancing foci. 3. Intensely enhancing lower sternal lesion measuring 21 x 7 x 13 mm, does not have MR characteristics consistent with a hemangioma. Internal punctate foci of hyperintensity suggest possible internal calcification suggestive of an enchondroma. Recommend CT of the sternum for further evaluation, to evaluate for classic features of enchondroma, versus a more aggressive process.",

      "Content": "Yes my doctor wants me to get the CT to double check everything. So just very worry about this whole sitution since I do have HX Breast cancer in my family (Grandma and her sister). It is scary.... Thank you for your responce I feel a little better now Happy Holidays!",
