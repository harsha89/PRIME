      "Content": "Hi~~ Thanks for the responses! I'm very glad to hear there is a benign possibility for this. I've heard about the papilloma, but back when I had the bloody discharge about 5 years ago, my mammogram and ultrasound didn't show anything. The bleeding stopped, so I just went on with my regular mammograms, and they always came out ok. I had two since then. My last one was about 16 months ago, I was a little late going in when this happened. I just think it's weird, even if it was something benign 5 years ago, why wouldn't I bleed for 5 years, and then suddenly again now? Even if it was a papilloma, or some other benign thing, those don't just go away on their own, right? My main concern, from reading things on the internet, is that the type of bleeding I'm having is consistent with DCIS, and that is curable if caught in time. I'm worried we weren't aggressive enough with this 5 years ago, and now it's invasive. The only thing making me feel a little better is my 3 clear mammos since the original incidence. You said your surgeon said it was a papilloma, did he see it on any test, or just surmise this? When I went to my surgeon 5 years ago, he just kind of said these things are usually benign, and said I had taken enough tests. I hope he was right! I'll let you know how things go on Monday...thanks for the reassurance!!",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks for the response! Again, I'm a little confused though. I do know, of course, unfortunately, that not everything shows up on Mammo or US. Wouldn't that be great? I know someday there will be a test that determines what is going on, but for now, things aren't perfect. But...what I'm confused about is if it's called INVASIVE ductal carcinoma, doesn't that imply that the cancer has invaded the breast tissue, and now is not confined to the ducts anymore? That is why when it is confined to the ducts, it's called Ductal Carcinoma In Situ...but Invasive ductal carcinoma should show up on a mammo (hopefully) since it has now invaded normal breast tissue. If it's confined to the ducts, that shouldn't be too scary to anyone (except for the natural fear we have of cancer) because it is confined to the ducts, and once it's taken out, there's about a 100% cure rate. I read an article recently, in fact, that studied DCIS, and it was found that when women died of something unrelated to breast cancer, and were having autopsies for whatever other reason, DCIS was found in a large percentage of cases, that hadn't invaded the breast. This led the study to conclude that DCIS is fairly common within the normal population, and some women live their whole lives without even knowing they have it, and it causes them no problems. I guess what I'm saying is that we are limited to the tests we have, and even the doctors have to rely on common sense and statistics. That is a scary story that Tulsa wrote, but statistically, it's rare. MOST of the time, bloody nipple discharge seems to be related to a benign process, and since she had a normal Mammo and US, I think the doctor was probably correct in assuming she was fine. It's easy to read stories on here and get scared, because of course, things like that happen. But, in the big picture, the Medical Community can't send most women out for tons of testing, since it's expensive, impractical, and usually results in nothing. Also, as my surgeon 5 years ago said, they mostly end up chasing their tails, and finding nothing. Unfortunately, that leaves some people with stories such as this. In my case, I'm going to be sure to follow-up..given my history 5 years ago. I'm going to go to my Surgeon, and hope there is some test I can take to further reassure me. However, I'm honestly not sure there is, short of surgery. Which, if I'm not bleeding at the moment, I don't think they would even do. The Ductogram is impossible for me, because I don't bleed very much (it's usually just spots on my bedclothes) and also because of my inverted nipple. I guess an MRI might be good. If I can do it! Anyway, it's interesting to write about, and think about. It's very frustrating that as women, we don't have better tests, and more reliable ways of detecting a very common cancer. Even after going in for my Mammogram, it still seems very barbaric they way they do it. It seems by now there should be something better. Well, hopefully for our daughters!! Again, thanks for all the advice and responses! It's so hard, because knowledge is power, but we are limited by insufficient testing, and doctors who are also limited, and have to rely on statistics. We just have to do our best, I guess. It doesn't help to come on here and get scared, we can only hope we've done enough for our families and trust our doctors. And...keep vigilant about our own health and keep current on tests. My GYN said the only way to be completely sure you don't have cancer is to do a mastectomy (he was being tongue-in-cheek of course)...but he was making a point. We can never know for sure. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hi all, I haven't had much time yet to read over the boards, and plan on doing that tonight, when I can sit and spend some time getting to know Healthboards. In the meantime, I thought I would post a fast question. About 5 years ago, I experienced some bloody nipple discharge, from only one breast, and it was spontaneous. I went to my GYN, who ordered a mammo and US. Both of those came out ok. At that point, I went for an MRI, but wasn't able to complete it because of feeling panicky in there. After that, my GYN sent me to a surgeon, who told me that my problem was probably of a benign nature, he examined me, and was comfortable with my tests coming out ok, and the bleeding had ceased. The bleeding probably lasted less than a week or so. Fast forward 5 years later...I've had no bleeding in that time, and 2 more normal mammos. (So, three total normal mammos since the first bleeding started, and one normal US). I am due for my yearly, and just about to go in, when I noticed some small drops of blood on my nightclothes this weekend. It didn't last too long...I had some spontaneous bleeding for that one day, and now it seems to have stopped again. I went in today to my GYN, who expectedely ordered the usual diagnostic mammogram and US...which is scheduled for Monday. I was just wondering if anyone would have any idea at all at what would cause bleeding 5 years ago for a short time, have it completely stop for 5 whole years (almost) and then happen again. I'm worried that we didn't treat this aggressively enough 5 years ago, it might have been DCIS, and now it's invasive. That is my worry..any thoughts? Thanks so much!!",

      "Content": "Hi~~ Yea, it's weird you should say that, because I was just thinking about it...my discharge is always only on my bedclothes, or 'stuck' in my nipple in the morning. I never see it coming out spontaneously, or very rarely see it on my regular clothes during the day. When I very first noticed this discharge, I noticed a bit of dried blood around my nipple at night when I went to change into my bedclothes, but it usually is just in the morning when I wake up. 5 years ago, when I very first experienced this, the symptoms were very similar, except for one time when I was walking around the house, and the discharge was coming out in drops spontaneously, and I wasn't wearing a bra, and I kept getting blood spots on my top. That only happened that one time though, and again, every other time was noticed in the morning on my bed clothes. I also feel like strange things happen to me. I always get the weirdest symptoms~~that nobody around me (family or friends) have ever gotten. Scary things! My Mom is 75 years old, and has never once had anything like this. My Grandmother lived to 104, and also never had anything out of the ordinary. Just the usual things, that everyone gets...like arthritis or whatever. I haven't had any more discharge today other than this morning (typical scenaraio) but I'm still going to make an appt with the Surgeon, because I don't want to miss anything. I have a feeling it won't go anywhere, though. I read where they don't like to do Ductograms unless there is a strong suspicion of cancer, because it can be painful, and usually leads to nothing. Anyway, good luck, and it sure helps to come on here and talk to other people experiencing the same thing! Talk to you soon!",

      "Content": "OK~~so that last response IS scary, especially since I was feeling so much better about having a clear mammo and US today! I thought that was a good thing, but I guess it can miss something? You had said that the mammo showed some \"things\" that weren't the tumor...I was wondering what you meant by this. Were you bleeding alot and persistently? I still plan on going to an appt with the surgeon I saw previously for this. I have to think it's good news, though, that my mammo and US came out ok, and that my bleeding has stopped, at least for now. I had this same symptom 5 years ago, and it only lasted a week or so, and stopped completely after that. This time it did about the same thing. I do want to be safe, though, and not put anything off. I guess the thing I'm confused about is how you could have INVASIVE ductal carcinoma, and not have that show up on a mammo or US. I know that Ductal Carcinoma in situ sometimes does not show up (although it USUALLY will show up as calcifications) but if it's invasive, why wouldn't that show up? I thought that is the entire reason for a mammogram. Is this a mistake, like something that hopefully doesn't happen very often, or does invasive ductal carcinoma not usually show up on a mammo? I had a diagnostic mammo today, where they do several different views. At this point, like I said, I'm going to the surgeon, but the doctor looking at my tests said a ductogram would be good, if I were bleeding at the time. However, not only has my bleeding stopped, but it's hard to find out where it's coming from, as I have an inverted nipple. So, I will pursue this as much as possible, but I do have to trust my doctors at some point. I'm hoping this kind of story is out of the norm...that hopefully we can feel comfortable having clear mammos and ultrasounds and reassurance from our regular docs and surgeons. What else can we do??",

      "Content": "Hi all, No...it's not that you scared me, it's just this roller coaster of emotions. I had been waiting and waiting for my Mammo and US, and the day finally came, and then I went through all the stress of doing the tests while you're waiting for results, and then when the doctor said there was nothing suspicious, I was just so relieved!! Then, that same day, I saw that post on here. So, it's just frustrating to feel good for a couple hours, and then come back down again. Also, I was feeling pretty good after the clear Mammo and US on Monday, but here it is Thursday, and I have some discharge again. They said to go in for a Ductogram if the discharge happens again, and I'm going to call about that today, but it's not like the discharge is happening right now...I just woke up with some stuck in my nipple (I have an inverted nipple there). Either way, I'm going to follow-up with my Surgeon, and go from there. It's just scary, cause I thought it was good news that my Mammo and US were ok. Also, with the bleeding having stopped until today, I thought that was also a good sign also. I had hit my breast accidentally about a week before the bleeding, and I thought that also might be the reason for the bleeding, but now I guess not. It's amazing how you can feel good, and then suddenly now get that knot in your stomach again. I'm so nervous again, since I had let some of that go, and here it comes back again. It was stressful to see the discharge again this morning. Thanks for all the info!!",
