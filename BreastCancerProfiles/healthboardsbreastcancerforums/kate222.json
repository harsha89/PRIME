      "Content": "I had my annual mammogram, I have never had anything show up on my mammograms. I was called and I need a second mammogram, I realize being 54yrs.old I am at the age a lot of people are diagnosed with breast cancer so I am very scared about the second mammogram. My question is. I had chest surgery last summer, could what they are seeing on my mammogram be scar tissue from my surgery? Any ideas will be appreciated, thanks",
