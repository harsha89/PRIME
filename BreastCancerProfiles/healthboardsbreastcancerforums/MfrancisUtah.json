      "Content": "Dr. Robert Kuski from Scottsdale, Arizona invented this treatment. I highly recommend him. I had this treatment one year ago and chose this method because I was searching for a safer way to deliver radiation near the left chest wall without fear of radiating my heart muscle. I traveled over 1500 miles to go to this clinic. This is pain free, ingenious and quick method compared to other radiation methods I researched. I would be interested in hearing why you are interested in this procedure so I could respond more directly since you are a male. The jury is still out as to being more effective, but I was told by Dr. Kuski himself that it is equally effective treatment.",

      "Content": "After my SAVI radiation in October, I got an infection at the point of the entry in my left breast, not while I was under doctor care. Their is redness in the area where treatment was delivered. I have a small blood clot that doesn't seem to go away, but it could be a result of the initial surgery to remove the tumor. I have a lot of energy and continued my normal affairs right away. Let me know how things go with your Mom today. I am sending happy thoughts her way. Is she in Arizona?",
