      "Content": "My breast tumor was only .6cm and I was node negative when I had my lumpectomy 2 months ago. I had the Oncotype DX and just received my results back and score was 35. If number is 31 or over, a person is high risk for breast recurrence. Now instead of radiation I will have to have both chemo as well as radiation. Has anyone else had this test and it came back high risk? What did you end up doing? This test is so new I don't have anyone to talk to about my situation. Thank you for any advice.",

      "Content": "I've been taking Femara for 2 years and take a bone density test annually and have significant bone loss especially in lumbar spine. I cannot take Fosamax or Boniva, etc because of chest pain. Take my calcium and Vit D and have been checked recently for Vit D deficiency and it is in normal range. Should I stop taking Femara before I get osteoporosis which I am just .3 points away or risk a fracture. I also have severe wrist and trigger finger pain and body stiffness, muscle and joint pain and fatigue. I also am high risk for BC recurrence even tho my tumor was only .6cm and no positive lymph nodes and took 4 rounds of Chemo and 33 of radiation. What should I do?",
