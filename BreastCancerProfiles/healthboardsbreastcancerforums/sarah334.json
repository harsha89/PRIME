This cancer usually is very deadly and it comes on very suddenly. My Mother has this type of BC, and so far she survived 8 years; howver it is suspected that it is back due to her blood tests. Usually it is classified at stage 3B. Most of the time there is no lump, just swelling and a red rash. Sometimes there is a very large lump that appears overnight. This type of BC has 2 types, one is estrogen positive and one is genetic based. For more info. you can look up Inflammatory BC on the internet and read about it.",

      "Content": "Hi, not sure what I'm doing as this is my first message on here but hope this is right! My Mum has IBC which she first became aware of in January of this year, since then it has been a rollercoaster of partial removal, then full mastectomy and now the cancer has spread to both her bones and liver. Can anyone give me advice on anything to do with this terrible disease and more importantly, can she survive long term when carrying such a lethal illness?Many Thanks, Sarah",
