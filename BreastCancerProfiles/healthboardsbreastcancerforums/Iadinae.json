      "Content": "Anyone have experience with this? I have had the bruise on my left breast around the 2:00 area since July. Finally got the nerve to go to the dr and am having a mammogram and US tomorrow afternoon. From what I have read, I shouldn't worry because it is painful. There is a small lump under the bruised area though which is concerning me. I'll know soon enough what is going on.. just wanted to see if anyone else had experience with it. TIA.",
