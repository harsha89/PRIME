      "Content": "hi everyone. this is my first time posting on this board. i have had fibrocystic breasts for about 3 years now ( i am 27 years old). it all started when i found an area of thickening in my left breast about 3 years ago. went to the gyno and they said it was normal breast tissue but reffered me to a breast surgeon just to be sure. the breast surgeon said the same thing and sent me for an ultrasound. the left breast showed nothing and they did find a cyst in the right breast (i couldn't even feel it). they wanted to do another ultrasound in 6 months to see if there were any changes. shortly after that i got pregnant and i still had the ultrasound performed. it again showed nothing in the left breat and this time it showed 2 benign masses in the right breast. at that time, since i was pregnant they said to return in 1 year for a follow up ultrasound b/c when you are pregnant the breasts go thru alot of changes, etc. well it is now 1 and 1/2 years later and i am scheduled for the next ultrasound in 1 month and a visit with the breast surgeon. i am very nervous because i can feel lumps in both breasts and i am scared of what they will find on the ultrasound this time. also... i have definetly felt a lumpy area in my left breast for 2+ years now, but nothing shows up on ultrasound... and i can't feel anything in the right breast and something always shows up there!! has anyone had an experience with feeling lumps and nothing showing up on ultrasounds?? this whole ordeal causes me alot of stress and i wish that never would have found the lumps anyway! thanks to all!",

      "Content": "yes, it is very frustrating! i, too, can't tell a \"normal\" lump from what would be an \"abnormal\" lump during a breast self exam. hopefully the doctors know what they are feeling for when they examine us... i always wonder how they can tell a normal lump from abnormal.... the breast surgeon i see says that many many women have lumpy breasts... sometimes it feels like a bag full of m-n-m's... and it is his job to tell the difference between a normal lump and abnormal. i guess that is what they went to school for, so hopefully they are right! best wishes to you!",
