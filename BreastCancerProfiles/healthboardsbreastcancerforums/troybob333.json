      "Content": "I'm getting really worried about my breasts. My better judgement tells me it's nothing and I'm making a big deal out of nothing but I thought I would get somebody else's opinion before going to a doctor and making a fool out of myself. A bit of history, my breast have always been large even though I have always been thin. I was down to 150 pounds at one time and am 6'3\" (depression from bipolar and not wanting to eat) and still my breasts were about the same size as before and stick out predomenently. I didn't think too much of it but several years ago I was feeling around and felt several painless lumps in both breasts. I didn't think too much of that either thinking maybe it was somehow pockets of hardened fat or something because men don't get breast cancer (I know they do now but I know it is very rare) Over the last few years though there have been larger lumps developing, two in my left breast the size of walnuts. I at times will also have a small clear discharge from my nipples. If I squeeze the nipple a little hard the discharge will always come out but there are times when I do nothing and it does. Recently I've noticed a lot more lumps in both filling both breasts and my breasts have gotten noticeably larger though I have put on some weight from taking zyprexa. Could it just be a side effect from medications for bipolar disorder? I've been on a lot of differnt meds though and I don't think that's it. I told my parents about it just a bit ago and my dad actually laughed at me. (I am 22 now but with the bipolar disorder I am still with my parents) I had my dad feel my breast and he said it was just muscle tissue but I didn't think muscles grew in seperate lumps though some feel to be connected. The thing is I lost my job and don't have any insurance though I am trying to get medicare and my parents won't pay for a doctor visit and I have no money at all. I actually owe over $46,000 in medical bills right now from inpatient stays from my bipolar disorder type 1. Any advise would be appreciated. Are there any clinics I could go to in north east Indiana? I really have no idea what to do and I feel so embarrassed about it. What do I do?",
