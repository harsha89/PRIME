    "Content": "I feel the radiologist wants a re-take for a clearer image. I wouldn't worry either at this point. I know, easier said than done. I had a full hysterectomy in 1996, have been on Estratest HS daily ever since, and then premarin cream 3x a week for the past 2 yrs. I understand your concerns. I've discussed this in depth with my dr. We've decided to keep the hormorne therapy going at this point. Good luck",
