    "Content": "I went for my routine mammogram in January. I received a call that I needed to return for a spot compression. While there for the spot compression they also performed an ultrasound. My gyn called with results, and said I needed to see a surgeon for a biopsy. In consultation with the surgeon, he said that the ultrasound is really not a good diagnostic tool, and that the mammogram/spot compression are much better. It is the ultrasound that was the cause of alarm for the gyn. I was told that the spot compression had not been read yet. The surgeon recommended an ultrasound guided needle biopsy. The day before the scheduled biopsy, the gyn called and said the spot compression showed nothing to be concerned about, so there was no reason for the biopsy. It was cancelled. That was 3 weeks ago. Yesterday the surgeon's office called and said that they want to see me right away. I have an appointment tomorrow. In your experience, is the ultrasound enough to go on for a biopsy when the spot compression shows nothing? Any idea what is going on here? I'm confused, to say the least. Worried, for sure. Any insight?",
