It is about the size of a pea. Has anyone ever heard of this at her age? I am making an appointment with her doctor tomorrow so I'll advise more. I guess since she's 48lbs it is easy to feel and definiately not on the right. Anyone else experience this? Thanks! Suz I remember back when I was 8-10 years old. I had the same thing. My mother grew quite concerned because it just didn't seem 'normal' to her. It WAS just the start of my breasts developing. My daughter did the same thing. It is quite common for one side to start before the other. It did feel like a lump, and it was VERY sore and tender to touch. A trip to the dr. is always a good idea if you are not sure, but I would not worry myself (or her) silly in the mean time. This is fairly normal.",
