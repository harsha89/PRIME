    "Content": "Several times for some reason with an ex boyfriend after we had a particularly rough night of sex a few days later I'd find more... gobbstopper (the candy?) sized lumps (just one at a time) just above or to the left of my clitorous. Finally after many instances I asked my doctor and he told me sometimes liquid just builds up and you get a small cist that will leak back out. It's not uncommon from the sound of it - but Ping pong ball sized sounds pretty large.... Mine - I could kind of press on and it'd hurt but I could tell there was liquid. They were slightly painful but would go away after about a week. I don't know if any of this will help - but that's the closest I've seen/experienced/heard in regard to your post.",
