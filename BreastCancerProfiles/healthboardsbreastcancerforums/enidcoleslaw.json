    "Content": "Hey, just read your post, and I've had similar pain. Right under my left breast when I wear an underwire bra, it's like a sharp stabbing pain. I wonder what the connection is, because the pain goes away a few minutes after I remove the bra. I dont think it is cancer related, but maybe there is something else wrong with underwire bras?",
