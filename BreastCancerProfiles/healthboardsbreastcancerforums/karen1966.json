    "Content": "Unfortunately yes I have gone thru that. Only I found a lump but was told by my gyn that it was probably a cyst cuz I have fibrocystic breasts(I drink coffee). He sent me to get a mammo and was told 2 days later it was cancer. Good news is that my doctor and I neither one ignored it and it was caught before spreading to the lymph nodes and my survival chances are excellent. I was 35 when diagnosed 2 years ago. The chemo was awful but i survived and the radiation and surgery was relatively easy. My husband still loved me even though I had no hair and was too tired for sex. So good things can come from horrible news. Hang in there and it wil be ok. Just don't ignore symptoms cuz they won't go away and may get worse.",
