    "Content": "Nothing to do with cancer (I hope) but no replies in Womens Health........ I have suffered this three times in the last 17 months, a total nightmare -and twice have had to have I+D surgery, last surgery was April. Started up again last week and caught it early and tiny but still very painful so it was aspirated. I am allergic (actually allergic, not just sensitive) to a good few antibiotics so my treatment options are becoming a bit limited, as the ones that CAN be prescribed do not seem to have any effect Does any one have any experience of duct excision, as I was told this may be a possibility? I'm not sure how many more times I will have to have this nightmare though, before anything is done.",
