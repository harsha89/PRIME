      "Content": "Has anyone hear prior to diagnosis had a burning pain through out your breast? My left breast has been bothering me for over a year. It is much \"lumpier than my right\". It used to seem like it was worse right around my period but now its like that VERY often. It just feels like a burning sensation that radiates through my nipple to the rest of my breast. Also, this is going to sound very weird but sometimes that same breast changes shape then goes back to normal. I dont even know how to explain it....? I want the dr to order an MRI to be safe. What do you guys think? Am I over reacting? Drs wont really listen to me because I am 24. Thanks, Heather",
