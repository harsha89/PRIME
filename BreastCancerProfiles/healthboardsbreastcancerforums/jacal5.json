      "Content": "That's great news! I learned a lot from your story, so if I am ever sent to a breast surgeon I won't automatically think the worst, and from here on you can research info on how to keep your risk down, I tried to give you a few tips from what I've read to get you started. A few more: don't eat grapefruit (some studies suggest it can cause breast cancer, I even threw out my skin cream containing grapefruit oil), drink pure grape juice (it can cut your risk 65%)! God Bless You and Your Family!",

      "Content": "One of the posts I read here was from a woman with estrogen-receptor breast cancer, and I also read here that a poster said breast cancer is an epidemic now. I wouldn't be surprised if our soy laced food supply is causing an increase in estrogen-receptor breast cancer, especially in post-menopausal women. Stay away from soy and all processed food containing any soy by-products. Some states like New York have mandated that restaurants not use trans-fats, so they are cooking with soy oil instead! Try to eat healthy prepared meals at home and buy organic product whenever you can. There have been studies linking grapefruit to breast cancer, so try to stay away from that too! Another thing, stay away from cosmetics, soaps, creams, etc. with lots of harmful chemicals in them. The only body cream I use is called 100% Pure made from fruit oils, and I use coconut cooking oil on my dry skin, and i buy a natural deodorant soap with baking soda, and I use pure organic Castile soap in my bath. I cringe when I see young girls and women in the stores buying creams and soaps made with harmful chemicals. Propylene glycol is harmful to put on the skin, it can cause kidney and liver abnormalities, yet it's contained in all boxed cake mixes like Duncan Hines, Pillsbury, etc. I was shocked to learn this and will never eat cake from a mix again unless it is an organic brand like Arrowhead Mills, but you still have to be careful and stay away from soy ingredients or eat them seldom, even in organic products.",

      "Content": "A little background on me, I've had negative mammograms, the last one was two years ago, I have some benign cysts and dense breasts, I'm 57, with no family history, except two first cousins with breast cancer in their 30's and 40's on maternal and paternal side of the family, both were treated several years ago and are fine today. I have repetitive strain injury in my right arm, herniated disks in my neck, so I have chronic pain since my injury ten years ago. A few weeks ago my right shoulder started hurting like I injured it. I went to the doc and got shoulder x-rays and one x-ray showed a calcification in my breast. The doc told me the calcification could be causing all my shoulder pain and told me to follow up. Everything I have read stated that calcifications can only be seen on mammograms, so now I am wondering if the doc was correct about the calcification. I was also thinking if the calcification was big enough to be seen on a regular x-ray, it must be the bigger macro kind and not dangerous. Anyway, with all these new guidelines about getting mammograms every three years, and the new information regarding women are in danger of breast cancer from the radiation from mammograms (about 8 out of 1,000 women will get breast cancer from the mammogram) I am hesitant to go for one. I'm really upset that the doctor's have downplayed the cancer danger from mammograms for years, and now all of a sudden, women are at cancer risk from mammograms! Additionally, two of my closest friends had calcifications, both were biopsied, and both were cancer free. I read that the biopsies cause trauma to the breast, which leads to scar tissue, which leads to even more calcification, which leads to more frequent mammograms, and even cancer! It's like your damned if you do and damned if you don't. Bottom line is I'm afraid to go for the mammogram and be exposed to the radiation, and I'm afraid if the radiologist sees a calcification I will told to be biopsied, and I don't want to do that either. My best friend thinks since I don't want to be biopsied anyway, why go, she's only had one mammogram in her entire life (she's 57), and said she would rather take her chances that she doesn't have cancer, than get cancer from the mammogram. What's a woman to do?",

      "Content": "I posted misinformation regarding digital mammography not giving off radiation, sorry! I did read digital mammography gives off 50% less radiation than film mammography, but different web-sites post contradictory information. I had a film mammography yesterday, and as soon as I got home there was a voice mail from my doc asking for a return call. I was very surprised and scared because the technician told me that there were no changes from my films of two years ago, and it was a good sign. I thought the tech reexamined the films and found changes and called my doc. It turns out my doctor told me since I have dense breasts I should have a sonogram, but there is no emergency or hurry. When I called the medical facility for another appointment, they told me sonograms are being done as routine now. I did research and read that film mammograms may not pick up breast tumors in my dense breasts like a sonogram could. The article also stated sonograms will pick up cancer in 33 woman out of 5,000 who had normal mammograms. My neighbor just had a biopsy for calcifications and is awaiting the results. I just read that biopsy's can cause additional calcifications and scar tissue. In addition, I read that sonograms generate many false positives. I'm sort of leery about going for the sonogram in case a false positive would make my doctor perform a biopsy for nothing. I just read that a nuclear breast test should be performed before a biopsy, but my neighbor was never offered one, she was told a biopsy was the best way to determine what caused her calcification. I think if I was told the sonogram showed something suspicious I would insist on the nuclear test before I had a biopsy.",
