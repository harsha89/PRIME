      "Content": "I think when they call you back for a ultrasound, it's because they suspect a breast cyst. The ultrasound passes through them because they are liquid and with the mammogram, they can't tell for sure. I have had to have a ultrasound everytime I've had a mammogram and it's always turned out to be cysts. It's scary, but try not to worry to much.",

      "Content": "I would definitely get a mammogram. I have problems with breast cysts also. They have always shown up on the mammogram and then they take a closer look at them with an ultrasound. Mine have always shown on ultrasound too. It probably is nothing but I would find a doctor who is willing to find out what is going on for your peace of mind. Good luck!",

      "Content": "I too have had breast cysts off and on for the last 3 years. I would definitely have a mammogram. The radiologist told me that the cysts don't hurt anything, but there is always the possibility of it hiding something else underneath it. I just had a conversation with my doctor on Monday about what to do when I find cysts. He told me that the thing to remember about cancer is that the lump would grow fast. With a cyst, it's probably painful and is not going to grow fast. He said if I can feel it getting smaller, it's nothing to worry about. I hope this is helpful.",

      "Content": "It may be just a cyst that goes away after your peroid. If you are close to that time of the month, you can probably wait a few weeks and see if it goes away. If it doesn't go away though, make sure you have it checked out. I have had cysts many times. Sometimes they go away on there own, but not always. Good luck to you and keep us up to date.",
