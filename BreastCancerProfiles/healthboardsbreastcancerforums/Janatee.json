      "Content": "Hello All. I had a breast biopsy in 2002. During the procedure, the doc removed the pin point cyst. All came back clear. Anyway, for years after, ever once in awhile, I get a pulling feeling, and a very slight tenderness in the area where the biopsy was taken. GYN said this is SCAR TISSURE, that has formed due to the removal of the cyst. It comes and goes now and then, but when I have that feeling, of course I get scared.: Has anyone out there experienced this same feeling, and have you been told this is SCAR TISSUE? I get my mamo's every year, and after the biopsy, I had them every 6 months for 3 years... I really pray, that one day this fight we fight against Breast Cancer, and any Cancer will be treated and a thing of the past. We can only PRAY. Thanks for listening..",

      "Content": "Hello All.... Has anyone else, who has had a breast biopsy done, experienced tenderness and soreness.. My biopsy was done in 2002. All was fine, thank God.... Not really what you would call PAIN, but just that you know its there when you touch your breast, or remove your bra!! I was told by my MD, GYNO, and a few other people that this is due to scarr tissue in the breast when they removed the cyst. Has anyone else been told this, and if so please write to tell me about it. Sometimes, its not even there, but around my period, wow!!! It hurts worse then ever. After my period comes then there is some reduction in that feeling... I am 51 years old, and waiting for this wonderful joy of woman hood, to end... Its been a long ride, and scarry at times. I have always gotten my mamos each and every year, sometimes two in a year, due to calcification of the left breast. Hope to hear from any other ladies out there who could just ease my mind a little more. Thanks for listening, I guess we are all in this together!!! Janatee",
