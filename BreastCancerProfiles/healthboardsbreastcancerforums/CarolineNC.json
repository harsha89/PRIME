Interesting that even with double mast you still have to take it. I see a surgeon next week to have the ADH area removed. Its all a bit overwhelming. Such big decisions. I might reply again after I know more. Thanks again, for sharing your experience.",

I have also lost a sister to BC and a 2nd sister had it as well but is 15 years post diagnosis. It is very scary - quite the wake up call. The good news with ADH is that we are finding it so so early. I keep telling myself that. I have not had my procedure yet, I meet with the anesthesiologist tomorrow and my surgery is next Friday. I'm coming down with a cold so I hope that won't end up pushing the date out. I want to get this over with! When I met with the surgeon, he did confirm what you are saying. He said that 25% of people will have DCIS (non-invasive) and 11% may have invasive cancer. I like to think in terms of the reverse percentages. 75% that I won't have DCIS and 89% that I won't have the invasive kind. The surgeon was great, he took alot of time to explain everything - I hope yours will as well. I will post here how things go. There are one or two other blogs here that we seem to have posted to more than this one. I'll continue to post here as I go through this! Let us know when your appt is and let us know how it goes. This board has been a God-send!",

The MRI sounds like the way to go. PF, sorry your situation is so messy in a way, more tests, more xrays, more TIME. I swear that's the hardest part in some ways. It's like why couldn't they have performed those mammos yesterday while they had you there. Its like the Dr. didn't read your chart til you were in their office. Maybe that is the reality of how things work. I'll keep ya'll posted as to how Friday goes. I'm more nervous about what my results will be than the actual procedure. I bravely say right now...",

I was very nauseous from the anesthesia. My recommendation to anyone about to go through this is to make sure they give you a prescription for nausea as well in case you need it. Not everyone does. But other than that, from the surgery itself, I only feel a dull ache at the incision site - its not bad at all. I took one pain pill yesterday and none at all today. I do feel tired though. I'll be back at work tomorrow. Now the next wait begins as it will be 5-7 days before I have the results. I'll keep you posted. What's next for you? Let is know when you have your 2nd opinion/MRI, etc.",

      "Content": "Hi Virginia, I'm very similar to you, I had a lumpectomy for DCIS followed by radiation. I completed my rad treatments on 8/11. I was terrified to start them - and I did mine in the prone position so I could avoid my lungs as much as possible - I have pretty severe asthma. For me the treatments went pretty darn well. I continued to ride my horse in the heat and humidity during it. I started to get a sunburn after about 10-14 treatments and didn't feel tired until the last week and for a couple of weeks afterwards. You will definitely want to apply lotion - I used Aloe Vera Gel and Lindi products. Many people talked about success using emu oil from Montana. Sounds strange I know but many swear by it. The treatments are so quick - totally painless - just the inconvenience of having to drive there every day for 6 weeks. I met some wonderful women there going through it together was nice - having people to see and talk to that are going through it. I'm happy to share my experience or answer any questions... Now that i'm almost a month out - my skin is pretty much back to normal. I plan to start taking Tamoxifen in October. I'm not looking forward to that but it seems silly not to do everything I can. I hope your simulation went well today. It just feels to odd and scary to be going through it. I know it is a tough time emotionally - so hang in there!!",

They tell you this isn't cancer, and I'm extremely thankful for that - but they sure seem to treat you like it is. I do have family history with BC. Has anyone out there also been diagnosed with this and what has your experience been like? Did you get a 2nd opinion? Did you opt to find out about your genetic marker? What is the impact of that on insurance and changing jobs? Did you decide to take tamoxifen or an even more radical approach? Just wondering if anyone has any wisdom/experience to share.

I have found other message boards that talk about how painful the procedure is and I'm scared. People seem to have a good experience or a terrible one. Has anyone had the procedure and can give feedback? Was thinking of asking my GP for something I could take prior. As I have thought about it, it seems since the microcalcifications are so so small and can't be felt that this is the only way. The radiologist mentioned that he thought they would remove them all during the procedure. Still it is terrifying news. I have 2 sisters that have had BC. Trying not to think about it. Sitting in those waiting rooms is tough. My hat is off to all of you who have gone before. You just don't quite realize until it's you sitting in that chair in the waiting room... The other thing i learned is that you shouldn't take ibuprofen or aspirin prior to your diagnostic mammogram. If you do, you have to wait 5 days before they will schedule your biopsy. I had never heard of this. Wish the radiology group had mentioned it. All this waiting, I would rather know - but then life could change forever.... Thanks for listening!",

Yes, they did place a titanium marker in me at the end of the stereotactic procedure. From what I've been reading they'll have to give me a wire also at the time of the open biopsy to guide the surgeon. So maybe, look on the bright side, you are having one procedure and they will get to the bottom of it - the open biopsy is more definitive - instead of possibly having to have two procedures. Like you, I saw the xrays and I had three tiny grains of sand. I bet you will go through all of this just to learn everything is benign. Try to remain positive - remember the statistic is 80-85% are benign. Have they rescheduled you quickly so you don't have to wait?? My consultation is next Tuesday.

Its like we get these other diagnoses, that we are thankful are benign,but make us feel like we aren't free and clear of worry anymore. I think you are smart to follow up with a breast specialist. Better to know all that you can and given that what they have found is so so early - I bet they'll just monitor you. I'm scheduled for an excisional biopsy on 4/23, I'll let you know how it goes. I hate the thought of being uneven too. Keep us posted.",

First of all, remember that even with all that you mention, the odds are still in your favor that results will come back benign! Try to focus on that. But I know its more like preparing for the worst and hoping for the best - especially when you are wide awake at 2am thinking about it! I also understand your questions. It would be nice to hear from women who have had lumpectomies and those who have even had mastectomies to tell us how they coped with the changes and feel about themselves afterwards. I have a sister that had a mastectomy and reconstruction and she is doing fine. Had no trouble dating and even got married again over 60. I had a stereotactic biopsy which came back with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and I'm now supposed to have an open excisional biopsy next. My appt with the surgeon to discuss it all is tomorrow. While ADH is not cancer, it greatly ups my risk of getting it in the future. That, and from reading the internet, I guess the excisional biopsy can come back with different results, so that scares me. Even if it is just ADH, it looks like they will suggest tamoxifen, and some women even opt for mastectomy. So, I guess I will find out more when I meet the surgeon, and after that set of results comes back. More waiting! Let us know when you get your results.",

      "Content": "Hi Sarasota, I don't know about tamoxifen yet. What the surgeon said is that nationally, 41% of people with ADH stereotactic biopsy results - will find they have DCIS after the next step - excisional biopsy. Though his practice's average here in NC is 25%. 11% will find they have invasive breast cancer! So, I'm waiting for the excisional biopsy results. Then we talk next steps. So I\"m a little down as I thought I was more 'out of the woods' than this. I try to dwell on the positive chances - that I have 75% of chance just ADH, and 90% chance not the other. Time will tell... Like you, trying to put it out of my mind for a month.",

As part of the procedure, they first insert a wire to tell the surgeon where to go - completely painless, then as soon as they start your IV - that's about all you remember.. you just wake up and its over. The only issue I had was that I was very nauseous and had a headache all day yesterday. I would suggest to anyone having the excision biopsy, to have their doctor write a prescription for pain meds AND nausea medicine... just in case you need it. We called in a precription late last night and after I took that I was fine. I basically slept all day and night, I was groggy all day yesterday too, but this morning I feel great. I don't really even feel the incision and I'm not taking any pain meds at all!!! Now just the wait for 5-7 days to hear the results. Thanks for checking on me. You guys are friends now Its so good we all have each other here.",

I'm so sorry that you are having to wait so long. The waiting is the hardest part. I'm doing well. Kind of in a lull where I can have a week or two of blissful denial before more treatment starts Have gathered alot of information, my genetics tests were good I don't have the BRCA 1/2 gene and I have also met with the radiologist/oncologist - to learn about that. Still trying to work out a 2nd opinion at Duke. But likely will start radiation in mid-June. I still have that little voice that is saying, should you just do a double mastectomy an be done with all this? Let us know how you are doing!!",

      "Content": "I asked the same question... and the answer was no! If it is DCIS or worse, they go back in again and take a wider margin. I guess there is some chance that the next biopsy would have clear margins, but his answer was they go back in again. They know where to go because the stereotactic procedure left a marker. They'll insert a wire prior to the start of surgery so he knows where to go and will take a biopsy the size of a quarter or so - and remember I had three grains of sand (that's what the micro calcs looked like) that the stereotactic procedure took out.. I was confused, because on my mammogram you see nothing at all. He said you can't always see and feel breast cancer. Chances are I'm ok, but it was all a bit unsettling. I'm right with you on all that you said and questioned earlier.",

Not saying anything derogatory about your doctors, but maybe someone who has had to do thousands of these, could help.
