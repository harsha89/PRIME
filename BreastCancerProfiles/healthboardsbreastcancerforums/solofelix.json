Thanks for the reply jane, I go to the clinic on Fri next. I'll report back after. Solofelix.",

      "Content": "Hi jane, Just to let you know I had the full works at the Breast-Clinic this morning. The staff were so kind and helpful. Examined by the Specialist, Mammogram and Ultra-sound. Delighted to report everything is good, no problems at all. Would like to point out to anyone reading this, any change in your breasts get it looked at immediately and don't be afraid, Its well worth peace of mind and the earlier the diagnoses the better chance you have.

      "Content": "My Dr. has referred me to a Breast Cancer Clinic. Has anyone else had this issue. One of my Nipples has disappeared. My Dr says there are No lumps and she examined me well. I don't know how long it has been invisible, I do examine my breasts but often without looking in a mirror. Should I be worried. My Dr didn't seem unduly worried and said \"Lets get this Looked at\" I am in agreement with her but have not heard of this problem before. Thanks for any answers. Solofelix.",
