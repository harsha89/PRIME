I appreciate you're taking the time to explain to me what they're saying from the point of view of someone who has (unfortunately) also received a similar report. And you're right, between now and Friday and probably long after this will be pounding in my head, so thanks for understanding about that also. I truly hope they take the MLO view, find nothing, and send me on my way. Anything after that is going to be agonizingly long to wait for. But thank you for letting me know about your experience and I will certainly keep you posted. Hugs to you.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your kind words and support. I went yesterday morning. I was pretty much in a numb haze the whole time, the receptionist and nurse even asked me a few times if I was okay. As soon as he came in to the exam room, the doctor waved the ultrasound on both breasts (first one, then the other.) He must have went over the left breast (the 'problem' one) several times, hoovering over what I can only assume something that caught his eye. I was watching his every facial movement. \"Normal, normal, normal. Nada, nada, nada,\" he said. \"You dodged a bullet.\" He asked me to get dressed, wipe the lube off, and wait for the nurse in the other room, who soon came to give me a mammogram. She was extremely meticulous and no-nonsense, even making sure my feet were pointed in a certain direction, and gave me a lead apron to wrap around my waist before I approached the machine. (something the previous radiologist didn't do.) She asked me to go back to the dressing room to wait. Still relieved about the 'nada nada nada' from the doctor, I waited. Several times I heard him pass my door and tell another woman in the waiting room \"All normal, go home.\" Always followed with a nervous burst of laughter and 'thank you!' Then the nurse came back in and said the doctor wanted a few more films of my left breast. That's when I lost it. Somehow she maneuvered me back to the room. Mostly it was a blur, but I do remember her taking photos at slightly different angles than before. Then I waited again. Then she came back and said the doctor wanted to see me to talk about my results. I am dead, I said to myself. The short walk down the hall to his office was like walking to a tomb. A tomb covered with radiographic images that had my name on them that said LEFT BREAST LEFT BREAST LEFT BREAST. \"You're fine. Go home. Have a good weekend,\" the doctor said, special magnifying glasses still perched on his forehead. I sat there, numb. \"What, I can't call you into my office to give you good news? Trust me, I'm neurotic. You're probably my 200,000th exam. This is what I specialize in, dense breasts. If I even thought there was something wrong I'd be holding a needle in my hand right now.\" (He does, indeed, know his stuff by all accounts. He's a recognized and respected national authority on dense breasts. I Googled him beforehand.) \"C'mere, I want to show you something.\" He pointed to the old films, the ones taken from the mammography truck, and his. The ones from the mammography truck looked like a cloudy night sky. The ones he took looked like a country sky filled with bright stars. I had no idea what the bright stars meant but I guess they were supposed to be there. \"We haven't used that technology in this office in 15 years,\" he said of the old films. \"Terrible.\" I thanked him again, dabbed the tears from my eyes, and looked up at the building before I left. I imagined a bright light of healing and comfort for all who would be there that day, especially those who did not get such good news. Then I went to a nearby church, lit a candle, and fell to my knees in thanks. I prayed for all of you, too. Please forgive me, I won't be writing on this board again. I can't think about this anymore. This week has been filled with hellish anticipation and I have to get this out of my head. Of course everyone's experience will be different, but the one thing I (personally) took away from this: if you use a mobile mammogram van or other community-based program, please make sure they have up-to-date equipment. If you don't have the luxury of going to a breast specialist like I did for back-up--try. Really try. Borrow the money if you must. If you have what is deemed 'dense breasts' by the preliminary radiologist thank them for alerting you to that and try to find someone who specializes in examing dense breasts. If your initial radiologist sends you a letter saying 'dense breasts' and 'suggest further testing' see if your insurance will pay for you to get a more sensitive test. Especially if you have a family history of breast cancer. Thanks again for keeping me in your thoughts and prayers, and for your kind and sensitives responses. I hope the recount of my experience helps.",

      "Content": "Hi jellebeans and eddysmom1, I've been reading your threads/correspondence today and I was encouraged by your positive outlooks and of course delighted everything turned out well for you guys. I myself am currently going out of my friggin mind, obsessing, depression, could hardly get out of bed today. Long story short, I received a dreaded 'call-back' after my annual mammo on 10/25/10; they wanted to 'explain' my results (which I had not received yet.) I asked them to fax the report and this is what it said: \"There are two focal nodular asymmetries in the left breast on the craniocaudal view. Spot compressions are suggested. If they persist, then a mediolateral view and ultrasound are suggested. There is no evidence of microcalcification. The right breast parenchyma is unremarkable.\" Of course I started to freak out, and of course the nurse gave me the old \"95 percent of the time benign\" jazz, but I am already being treated for OCD and this is pushing me over the edge. I have also dealt with 'abnormal' Pap smears before and sometimes I have nightmares so vivid that a doctor is telling me I have cancer I wake up shaking. Please, if someone has had a similar report, what happened? My mammogram last year (almost one year to the day) came out benign II but the radiologist went on about how 'extremely dense' my breasts were and how that raises the possibility of false negatives, etc. I did make an appointment with a breast specialist for this coming Friday morning and I am having all of my films from previous years sent. This facility was highly recommended by a close family friend who has had to live with the anxiety of lumpy breasts and cysts for decades. But I can't live the rest of my life going into a tailspin of depression and obsession every time a test comes back less than 'all clear.' My house is a mess, I don't eat, I lay in bed in a daze, pop sleeping pills. I am already planning my funeral and regretting all of the things I never had a chance to do. I was even starting (for the first time in my life) to think about having a baby (yes, I know, I'm 42, but according to home fertility tests and own body I'm still 'open for business.') Then I feel worse for being so depressed because I know there are women who ARE struggling bravely with confirmed disease or perhaps have circumed to it and I should be grateful for my life. Please, if anyone has had a similar callback/report like this let me know.",

      "Content": "Thank you, Brenda. In spite of the reassurances, I am getting more and more nervous. I have barely gotten out of bed in the last two days, nausea, no sleep. If they say ANYTHING other than 'you're fine' tomorrow I don't know what I will do. No more tests, no more 'just to be sure.' With all the chances that mammograms and MRIs are \"most likely\" to be false positives or find 'nothing' I am wondering the benefit vs. agony of going through these tests. Their usefulness, especially with dense breasts, seems negilable. I told my signifigant other I am seriously considering chopping off this f*cking left breast right now and he advised against it. I must say he's been supportive. Thanks again to all for your thoughts/prayers. I need them.",
