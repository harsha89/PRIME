    "Content": "From puberty to menopause I had the colon cramping and diarrhea with my periods that you describe. I don't think it's normal, for no one else I knew ever had this, and my gynecologists were all unable to account for it. Now I am in my 60's and have monoclonal gammopathy which is a precurser stage to the deadly multiple myeloma cancer. Recently there has been some research that indicates that 35% of people who have multiple myeloma have antibodies to gliadin just like people with celiac disease. It is now being postulated by many that multiple myeloma is due to longstanding untreated celiac disease. I've discovered that I have many of the symptoms and findings of celiac disease which not only affects the colon, but other body systems as well. I'm scheduled to have testing for celiac disease the day after tomorrow! You guys need all to do some serious reading about celiac disease.",
