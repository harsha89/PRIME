    "Content": "I had a conization done in 1996 at the age of 35. I was very frightened of actually having cancer. This biopsy (the conization) is both diagnostic and curative. The biopsy taken will be pathologically examined to make sure the margins are clear. If so, then you just have to have frequent pap smears for a while. Everything turned out well for me. The doctor took a lot of tissue to be on the safe side (I was not worried about having more children). I do have scar tissue now which makes paps painful but I can live with that. I go every 9 months now to get checked out but no cancer. Good luck to you.",
