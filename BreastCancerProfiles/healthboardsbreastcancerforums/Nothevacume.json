    "Content": "Ok My left boob is always sore, like if I hug someone and they come in contact w/ my left brest like above it the chest part it feels bruised. This has happned like for about 2-3 years now, even if I lay down on my stomach its uncomfortable. I went to the dr. a year ago and had her look at it, she said it was normal, and I had an ultrasound done on it to, and that was normale, so what is it? Am i just a whimp that gets hurt easily or what?",
