    "Content": "hi i work for a large diagnostic clinic and we usually will do a needle biopsy (if the Dr feels it necessary) at the same time as the ultrasound with the patient's consent. If you are really getting worried about the lapse in time - let your dr know and get him/her to call where you are going for tests to get you in sooner... hope this has helped all the best",
