    "Content": "I am late reading this, just found these boards tonight, but a good friend and co worker of mine had this same several years ago. I really hope and pray your friend will be ok, but from the experience I've seen through my friend, her luck wasn't that good at all. She had breast cancer, had both removed, was in remission for 3 years when it came back in her lungs, they started her treatments back immediately. Within 3 or 4 mos, it was in her lymph nodes, then liver, then eventually showed up on her brain. She lost alot of weight, looked like a small child near the end. Her time was cut very short and we lost her within a year of it showing back up in her lungs. I pray God will be with your friend and others with this horrible disease! We know that she was ready and that she is home with God now. I know everyone is different though and hopefully through the help of prayers and the good Lord, she will do fine with her treatments and will recover! My thoughts and prayers are with you all!",
