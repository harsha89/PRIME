    "Content": "Hi - I'm new here... I'm a girl who is going on 30 years old... for the past couple weeks my left nipple and close around it has been itching a lot... not ALL the time - but on and off pretty regularly....at least every hour. I don't see anything unusual there and I don't feel any lumps and there is no discharge or anything. I've never had a nipple itch constantly like this before... has anyone had this happen before? I've looked all over the Internet and in Medical books and all I've come back with is \"it's a sign of cancer\" or \"Paget's Disease\"... I'm pretty worried... is there anything it could be besides something horrible like cancer? Any info would be appreciated...",
