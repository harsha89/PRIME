I am now wondering about the correlation between the two... does anyone know the name of the drug tho.. I cant remember . Thank you so much. Lisa Interesting that this drug causes cancer. I, too, took this drug in 1982 and was diagnosed with State 2B breast cancer (triple negative) in 2006, had first recurrence in 2008 and again in the last week. I will begin PARP trial soon. I don't remember the name of the drug either but think we should check into this. Is your cancer triple negative by chance? I will research to see if we can figure out what the drug was. Thanks for posting the question",
