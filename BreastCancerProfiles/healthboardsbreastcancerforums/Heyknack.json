    "Content": "I too can relate. My regular doctor found a right breast lump 2 years ago during my annual breast/pap exam. After mammograms and referral to a surgeon eventually, a year had passed and I had a biopsy last year. It came back as fibrous tissue. But now I can actually feel the lump now, and it feels decently sized, so I went for a recheck today. The surgeon also agreed, did another ultrasound and did 3 or 4 more biopsies. Then he examined my left breast and feels some lumps over there too! Ugh! I can't take it! So I have to go back next week for my left breast, and he may biopsy that one as well. I hope I just have lumpy breasts, lol, but I'm still nervous just the same, especially when the surgeon said he felt nervous about my right breast. You don't ever want to hear your doc say that! Good luck all.",
