      "Content": "I was marked by the dr. using a black, permanent marker (like a sharpie) to mark where they were going to cut me for the biopsy. Well, they did not remove the marker prior to dressing the wound. So, as the wound healed, the skin grew over the black marker. I am now permanently marked with a round, black mark on my breast! I am only 37 and still THOUGHT my breasts were worth looking at-no longer!!! I am considering suing. I want this removed! I have been told to use baking soda with a little bit of water to try to draw out the color and also antibiotics. Nothing has worked as this was deep into the wound when I was closed with tapes and didn't see the problem for about a week. Morons!!!",

      "Content": "Half of my breast was completely purple, green and yellow. It is totally normal as they use a gun-like pressure to cut out (biopsy) tissues for testing. It happened to me for sure, and I also was sore. The one abnormal thing that happened to me is that they used a black permanent marker to mark the incision spot and when they closed me, they didn't wash off the black as I was bleeding. So, essentially I WAS TATTOOED WITH A PERMANENT BLACK MARK ON MY BREAST! I have been told to use antibiotic and also baking soda to try to pull the color out! I am permanently stuck with a round, black mark on my breast! I am so angry (this occurred about 6 weeks ago or more) that I am considering a malpractice suit! Can you imagine?",
