      "Content": "Hi all, I got a call from my doctor yesterday. I need to have the biopsy. The radiologist is still uncertain about the density's showing plus I have clustered calc's. I'll call tomorrow and get an appt. set up for that. I'm still not worried.....even if it's cancer (in the early stages) I can receive good treatments and live a long and happy life. Others have done so.",

I have stage 2 cancer, had a double mast and now going through chemo. Honestly the waiting is the worst, but you guys look like you will be just fine. I am so happy for you both, ask a lot of questions and get a great support group. I will pray for you guys. Anytime you need to vent or talk I would be glad to listen. JoJo Hi JoJo: Sorry it took so long to get back on this board....I babysat my grandbaby this wkend and my mom is here visiting, too. I will be going tomorrow for the stererotatic (sp?) biopsy. I don't know if there will be ultrasound with it. I've been looking at images of the mammotone table and it's kind of scary. Really, I'm more afraid of the procedure than the results. I have glaucoma, also and last Oct. had to have eye surgery to make a tiny hole in my eye for the fluid to drain off the eyeball. They used twilight sleep and before the surgery I was so upset and scared. I guess if I can get thru that kind of surgery I will do alright on the biopsy table. Stay tuned.......More soon. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi decgirl. I called today to set up the appt for the biopsy. I was able to get it for next Thursday at 9am. They said to not take any asprin products and if I wanted to take a relaxer pill I can take it on my own...that they do not give anything. They do make it sound like a piece of cake tho'. Thankfully, the girl that's going to perform this biopsy....I know her as we both work a the local hospital. She in radiology and me in Purchasing dept. And, good luck to you also. I realize the waiting and wondering is hard. For me, I want the whole truth. I get into trouble \"more\" when I try to read between the lines or try to guess. My active mind keeps on a wonderin' around. Let's keep eachother posted, okay! Sleep good tonight.",

The doctor's order says, \"focal asymmetric density in inner left breast on 1/07 & 2/07 with calcifiations\". Plus, I do feel a lump right at that spot. I'm not worried, I don't think,but I have been playing our different scenarios in my head. I want to prepare my mind for whatever comes my way. My dad had lymphoma and died when I was only 13yrs. old. I am now 58yr old. My aunt on dad's side had breast cancer and in fact, there are many aunts and uncles that have had cancer. Even on mom's side of family there has been cancer. I will come back and let you know what the radiologist has to say about the latest mammo.",

      "Content": "Hi Lynn, I loved your note. This board, although it deals with cancer, is alot of fun. I think so anyway. I am going to being take 1 Xanax 30min. before procedure as they said the hardest part is laying so very still on that table. Yuck. My husband will be taking me. I talked to my GYN this a.m. and told him the biopsy will be nx thursday and he said he would probably have the results on Monday. That's pretty fast I think!!! As for you: Please keep me informed. I will and have already sent up a prayer for you and all the ladies on this board. You mentioned they told you, Stage 0. The xray tech said that if they do find cancer cells in me it would most likely be Stage 0. I never heard of that before but sounds pretty good. I'm off work today and doing errands, getting my nails done and then I'm going to pick up mom and get her out of her very hot house. She does not have central air but we do. Bye for now & hope to hear from you soon, also. \"Marilyn\"",

      "Content": "Today I had the stereotatic biopsy of my left breast. The most pain I felt when they first squeezed the breast between the 2 mammo plates. Then,that table was so unforgiving. They did try and get me as relaxed & comfy as they could so I just had to bare up and looked at my grandbaby's pix. Plus, I was pretty relaxed from the Xanax I had taken earlier. But even still I found myself tensing up. I did not really feel pain but did feel like something was going on down under the table. I'm home now and not really pain but tenderness. Well, I hope that you are doing well. Keep in touch.",

      "Content": "Hello, I'm new to this board. On my last mammo in January they called me bck for a magnified view due to calc's and density. They could not find the area 'cause when they brought down the xray plate the pressure was moving the concerned area to another part of the breast. The radiologist wrote in his report to come back in 4 months for another mammo and \"recommend close followup\". So, weeks have gone by and it's April now. I go back in July. Anyway, after not doing self exams in several years now I started to check my breast in question during my shower. I felt something right in the area they were trying to get the picture on. I do not check it every day but at least every couple weeks. It seems to have changed in shape. I do feel okay tho' to wait until the July mammo. Any thoughts........",
