    "Content": "My mom had the same burning and soreness in her right breast. She had a mammograph last Nov. and they told her it was calcifaction. she has to go back in Jan '06. She is afraid that her bp med caused the calcifaction. She takes verapamil and i looked it up, it said it could cause breast cancer. My mom will wait to see the doctor and hopefully ask questions.",
