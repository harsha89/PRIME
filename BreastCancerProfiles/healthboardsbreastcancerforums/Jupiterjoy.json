      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am a 46 year old mother of two. A few months ago I had a lump in my right breast, that was painful, but it went away. Doctor said it was nothing of concern. Now, the same breast has some clear discharge (just the one breast). It was first discovered during the mammogram, but occasionally I feel a little (very little). My mammo was normal, but my breast tissue is dense and was told they are hard to read. My doctor told me not to worry about it. Does this sound okay or should I be having any further tests? On the Susan B Komen site, it says that discharge isn't bad unless it is from one breast, clear and comes out without pressure! thanks, any info or similar experiences would help.",

      "Content": "Hello all, I had a mammogram today and there was yellowish discharge from one breast. The technician seemed concerned which is making me really concerned. I am 46, no problem on previous images. A few months ago I did have a painful breast lump, but my doctor said it was nothing and it went away in a few days. Does this sound normal?",
