      "Content": "manicpanic I am the queen of dense breast tissue. I have also had a precancerous mass removed from my breast. I go to a comprehensive breast clinic and I have my mammograms completed and read by the radiologist before I leave. If there are any additional views that are needed (which is always the case because of dense breast tissue), than those views are done. Following my mammogram appointment, I have an appointment with the nurse practioner to go over the results. I might suggest that you request a Breast MRI. I will tell you that Breast MRI's have many false positive readings because they can cut through the dense tissue, so do not get concerned if after you get an MRI that you are called back for a biopsy. It is very common. Once the location has a baseline MRI than they know what is normal for you and what is a \"new\" finding. Go to your appointment with questions in hand. Great move making the appointment with the breast specialist, they have seen it all. I will be thinking of you on Friday, please let me know how you do.",

      "Content": "Hi Loralie I was diagnosed with ADH in March 2003. I had a rt breast lumpectomy and was prescribed tamoxafin. You need to wait and see what the pathology report says before you consider tamoxafin. If your pathology report says that the tumor is estrogen or progestrone positive, than that is the reason to take tamoxafin. Tamoxafin stops the production of estrogen and progestrone. If you tumor is not ER or PR positive than taking tamoxafin will not help. I took tamoxafin for only 9 months, however, I had a bad reaction to the medication and had to stop. It also turns out that at some point I suffered a stroke, so I should not have been prescriped the medication in the first place. There is a strong family history of breast cancer on both side of my family. I actually did ask to have a bilateral mastectomy done. My surgeon and others have look at me as though I have two heads. I will keep asking, however, as I have been told numerous times, \"because you have had a diagnoses of ADH does not mean that you will get breast cancer. It does raise you risk \"slightly\", but not enough to warrant a double mastectomy.\" I do remember being scared and shocked because I had a small child at home (she is now 14 years old). I am even more scared because the only thing that the medical community can do for me is careful watching. I now have an MRI and Mammogram every year and I see the Nurse Practioner every year. I have my mammogram scheduled for next month (January) along with an appointment with the NP. My MRI is going to be scheduled in August. This way, I am having some type of imaging every six months. (just had my MRI in August,that is why is will be scheduled for next august). You are your best defense, push your surgeon to come up with a plan that you are comfortable with, not just the comfort of the surgeon. You also need to be aware of any changes that may develop and be pro active in getting these changes checked out. If you have any questions, there are many people on this board who are a great source of information and comfort. Good luck with you two appoitments and please come back and let me know how you did.",

You have a history, so any radiologist is not going to take any chances. Because of your young age your breast are naturally dense which make is hard to see any real problems (having dense breast makes looking for any abnormality similiar to looking for a needle in a haystack). The diagnostic mammogram is when the radiologist is present and will direct the tech on exactly what views they want taken. An u/s helps to determine if the density has fluid contained it which makes a good case that the density is really a cyst. Another alternative for you would be to have a Breast MRI. The Breast MRI is able to better visualize the tissue in patients who have dense breast. The only pitfall to Breast MRI is that it is very sensitive and there are alot of false positives. I too have very dense breast and have Breast MRI's done every year. My thought on false positives is that I would rather have some false positives than having anything missed.

This type of cyst is common in women and is benign. In terms of having an ultasound vs a mammogram, because of your age, your breast are still most likely very dense, so seeing anything on a mammogram would be very difficult. I think that the next possible step in the process would be to do a Breast MRI. This type of test is able to cut through the dense tissue. It also has a very high false positive result because it is so senstitive. I know that it is tough waiting until Monday, however, look on the bright side, you mentioned that on of your doctors is going to be out of town until December 1, however your other doctor is going to see you on Monday, so you will certainly get your results then. If the wait is really killing you, go back to the hospital or clinic where you had your ultasound done and request a copy of the report. You can read the report over the weekend and have all of your questions ready to ask this doctor on Monday.

I played the 6 month wait time and really kept a close eye for any changes. Well, I felt some changes after about 5 1/2 months, so when I return to the breast surgeon, who again was not very impressed, I insisted that a biopsy be done. He was not happy but did agree to perform the procedure. It turned out that my non existing thickness was in fact a pre-cancerous mass that was removed. I took tamoxafin for 9 months, however, I had to stop taking the medication because of some serious side effects. In terms of having a breast MRI. Yes there are quite a few false positives and also an increase of biopsies. My first Breast MRI led to 3 MRI guided biopsies. Thank heavens they all came back negative. I also have a large fibroadedoma that is being watched. Typically fibroadedoma are benign, what they watch for is if they suddenly begin to grow. Linteck--it is also stanard practice to have a follow-up Breast MRI in 6 months after having a Breast MRI guided biopsy. Having a Breast MRI is a personal choice. I chose to get the MRI because at the time I had a young child at home who I really would like to watch grow, get married and have children. I still have that child--she will be 13 next month. Still am enjoying watching her grow, I am just not happy with the pre-teen-teen years. I also really lost some faith in the medical world when I had to fight to have what I knew was a mass removed and biopsied. We have all these options available to us, however, for some reason, some doctors are hesitant to use them. The bottom line is do what feels right to you. If is concerns you, than fight to get answers until you are satisfied. Looksee and Lintek Good luck and let us know how you both do.",

It means that the MRI sees something that looks suspicious enough for a radiologist to suggest a biopsy. A Breast MRI sometimes picks up an abdomality before it can be pick up on a mammogram. The results are read by how much enhancement a lesion has. They will time how long the contrast takes to absorb into a lesion. The contrast also highlights the look and shape of the lesion. Depending on who you talk to, some breast surgeons are not to keen on ordering this test because they feel that women end up having unnecessary biopsies. Other breast surgeons think that this is the best test in the world. For me, a mammogram only gives a limited amount of imformation because I have such dense breast tissue, which as a radiologist would tell you is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Breast abnormalcies on mammograms show up as white, which happens to be also how dense breast tissue shows up. A Breast MRI can cut through the dense tissue and give a better view. But like I said it is very sensitive and normal abnormalties can look like questionable abnormalities. So a radiologist will do a needle biopsy to suck out the area of tissue and send it onto pathology to have it tested. The good thing about this type of biopsy is because these lesions are small and the radiologist is able to get the whole lesion out. Some women, like myself have no problems with being better safe than sorry. I hope I have explained false positives a little better. Good luck on the 11th and let me know how you did.",

You doctor may order an ultasound to see if this is in fact a cyst and whether this cyst is a simple cyst (all liquid) or a complex cyst (part liquid part solid).

Again, the surgeon could not feel it, he only mentioned that yes he could feel a small difference in the tissue thickness but since everything came back normal he was not worried and felt that waiting 3 months to see if anything changed was in order. Well I played the game and when I returned in 3 months I told him that I felt that it had in fact grown and I thought that I could feel a second one right beside the first one. He was stilll not impressed, however, I insisted that it be surgically removed. This was done a month later and the pathology was atypical hyperplasia-a precancerous condition. So if you feel that the lump has changed in size and it concerns you than insist that it be removed and biopsied. All breast cancers do not show up on mammo's.

Because your tumors where estrogen positive, it is recommended that you take this medication for the next five years to help decrease your chances of reoccurred. I took tamoxifin for only 9 months and had to stop because I experienced a rare but serious side effect of tamoxifin. If it were not for the fact that I developed severe muscle weakness and an irregular heart rate, I would still be taking this medication no matter how uncomfortable it made me feel. For the muscle aches, I just took extra strength tylenol or liquid advil gel caps. The muscle aches are because the medication tends to increase your calcium levels. I also was very nausea for which I always had peppermints in my pocket and I would just pop them in my mouth. I also gain weight for which I am still trying to shed. For the muscle cramps, drink some tonic water, it contains quinone (sp) which works great on muscle cramps. For the night sweats and hot flashes, well you were going to get those eventually, so even if you choose to stop the medication, you are still going to have to suffer the night sweats and hot flashes for another ten years. There is nothing out there except close supervision for me now which does scare me because I am now a single mother of a 14 year old girl. So after such a long response to your question, Yes I think you should remain taking the Tamoxifin, you have already had two tumors removed and been giving a second change. I can tell you that the alternative is not something I think you even want to consider entertaining. While it is always a great idea to maintain that healthy lifestyle for which my sister-in-law chose and lost, there are medications out there to help you to continue winning the battle and the hospitals in the City of Boston are one of the best places for you to be to receive those therapies.

I also believe that the women taking tamoxifen either had a lumpectomy with radiation or they had a single mastectomy. Where you had a bilateral mastectomy, maybe you could obtain a second opinion from another oncologist at a different hospital as to how taken tamoxifen benefits you and the odds of occurrence. There are so many cancer centers to choose from--one of which you may already being treated at, but try Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana Farber works in conjunction with Brigham and Womens, Tufts Medical Center and my least favorite is MGH. (I just think they do not treat their patients very well.) Depending on where you live, you can also travel out to Worcester and go to UMASS Medical. No bike riding today--weather is crummy--naturally the sun is back to shine on Monday but is does sound like a great weather week ahead. Brenda",

By the sound of your report, I would think that because you have a family history of breast ca and they see something a little different, than they are going to investigate it. I would have thought that they would request some additional views to see if they can identify it better. They are doing the u/s to see if it possibley is a cyst. If you have a copy of your report, check at the bottom of the report it shoud say BIRAD with a number 1,2,3,4. The number will usually tell you how concerned they really are. BIRAD 2 or 3 means low probability, but needs follow-up. My other thought is that they have scheduled your u/s \"sometime in the future\". I think if they were really concerned, than that u/s would be done alot sooner. I hope this information helps.",

In his mind there is really no need to get immediate treatment. He needs to understand that a doctor can only assume that he was successful in removing all of the cancer, however, you must explain to him that cells are able to roam free undetected and that there is a good chance that if your mother does not receive Radiation Treatment sooner verses later that she risks having those undected cells begin growing and producing into cancer cells again. The Radiation Treatment is to help reduce the risk of a reoccurance. He needs to again sit down with the Radiation Oncologist and asks all the questions he has and make sure he understands the answers. Your mother also needs to begin being a little more forceful on her wishes, which you fail to mention what those wishes are. Does she in fact want to postpone treatment, is she afraid of rocking the boat with her husband or does she want to continue the treatments without interruption? Unfortuately, you can only counsel but you must accept what the outcome it because your parents are adults. Your mother must have your father's support and this is really her battle to fight with her husband. If you continue to disagree with your father, he will just possibly shut you out and you really do not want that. Give them both some time and hopefully the two of them will come to a decision that is right for them. Good Luck and keep us inform-I hope you mother feels better soon.",

Sometimes if you watch these lumps for a couple of months you will notice that they in fact change.

I have been told that if you watch your intake of caffeine, than this will help reduce the lumpness of your breasts. I also have lumps in both breast with a family history of breast ca. In March 2005 after insisting on having the mass removed (which turned out to be two masses), my pathology came back as atypical hyperlasia (estrogen positive). This type of pathology is considered pre-cancerous and does in fact put you in a SLIGHTY greater catagory of getting breast ca.

Try cutting down on your caffaine use because that can cause breast pain in patients with fibrocystic breast. Get the mammogram so that you have a record, also bargain that if you do the mammogram than you want the doctor to also order a breast MRI. A breast MRI gets a clear picture of breast tissue. The pitfall to Breast MRI is the rate of false positives. You should have both a mammogram and Breast MRI every year. This will help eliminate the frustrations of what really is going on. I thought you had a surgeon that actually took a sample of the fluid and sent it out to be tested? Did you get those results back yet? With the pain, does the breast feel really warm? Is there any possibility that you may have an infection of one of your milk ducts? Just some more thoughts for you to ponder!",

(if that is permitted in south wales). I understand what your doctor is trying to see. Because you still get a period even though you have had a procedure, you are still producing estrogen and he is trying to see if the lump gets bigger or smaller with your cycle. When I was 26 my doctor felt a lump and he had me return at different intervals to see if he could detect any changes. All was find then, but I myself felt a lumb when I was 45 and after having a negative mammogram, my ob/gyn insisted that I be seen at the breast center because of my family history. I had to demand that the lumb be removed, which the surgeon did once he got an opening in his schedule. (6 weeks later). This lump was benign, however I was diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia which is a precurser to breast cancer, so it was a good thing that I am pushy if you know what I mean. So Demand and be really pushy and tell the doctor that you wish to be referred to a breast clinic. You are the patient and you are the ultimate final decision on your health.

The tumor was listed as estrogen receptor positive so it was recommend that I begin Tamoxafin. I have a very strong family history of breast cancer so it put me in a higher risk group. After doing alot of research and speaking with my Primary Care Doctor and my OB/GYN both who's opinions I have always respected, I began taking the medication. Unfortunately, I became very sick in December 2005 with symptoms of a stroke. It took at least 6 weeks and many specialist later before it was determined that I was having a reaction to the tamoxafin. Since coming off of the medication, I have begun to feel better however to this day I still suffer with some of the ill effects. Tamoxafin is a chemo type drug and should be taking only after great thought. I now have regular mammograms every year along with a Breast MRI. I also get a copy of my reports and read and compare them from year to year. It is a personal choice on what you should do. My decision was made because I had a young daughter. I felt that I needed to due everything in my power to hopefully ward off getting breast cancer. Now that I can not take tamoxafin, I feel that the next best thing for me is my annual mammogram and Breast MRI's. Talk to your doctor to see what other medications may be out there that you can take if you choose to not take tamoxafin. You can also request a yearly Breast MRI to go along with your mammogram.",

I have also had Brain, Neck and Knee MRI's, all with contrast and never had any problems or bad feelings. Breast MRI's are really a great imaging tool to help with the diagnoses of breast ca's, it also is great to diagnose benign breast issues. The downside is the greater chance of a false positive result because the MRI is so sensitive that it picks up everything. I do not think you have to worry about heavy metals going into your body.",

You could have heard a pin drop waiting for the techs to return to tell us all that we were all fine and to come back in a year. Well after waiting for about 20 mins, a nun (catholic hospital) walked into the waiting room to ask how we all were feeling, well she did not even get a word out of her mouth before she had four women with faces as white as ghosts staring back at her. I have no idea how any of us did not end up in the cardiac intensive care unit that evening.

I think you qualify for a BIRAD 3 when you have some pathology that requires the next radiologist who reads your films to look extra hard for any changes. I have micro calcifications and also a good size fibroadenoma. I also had one lumpectomy for a mass that came back with atypical cells and two mri breast biopsies that came back negative. My rule of thumb when it come to breast health is \"what makes you comfortable\" If you are comfortable with a 6 month wait, than wait the 6 months. If not, than either insist on the biopsy or get a second opinion. Do you like this surgeon and feel comfortable with his/her advice? Do you live in Quincy MA?",

The need for the repeat is to tell if this new finding is real or an artifact on the film. The radiologist wants the one view repeated to see if the density is still there and the spot film is to cone down to the area and compress it to see if they can identify it. Do not be surprised if they also request an ultrasound of the area, this will let them know if the density is solid or liquid. Good luck with the repeat exam and let me know how you do. Brenda",

Septation is the wall of the cysts is a little thick. You may want to see if you can get referred to a Breast Care Clinic. You can find alot of these clinic in Large Teaching Hospitals. The Breast Surgeons in these clinic mainly just do Breast Surgery and they are more up to date on the latest advances and treatments for Breast Disease. This way you have a Breast Surgeon who will personally look at your present mammogram and ultasound studies and than will make a recommendation on whether he/she would like to see you sooner than six months. They also may be able to put your mind at ease because they should be able to answer all of your questions. Go to this appointment with a list of your concerns and questions. I hope my answers helped. Brenda",

Not only does it elevate your liver enyzmes but it also will elevate your chololestrol and your calcium level. When I was taking tamoxafin my body was always aching. I later found out that the soreness was due to the elevated calcium. My cholestrol went as high as 297. Once I stopped taking this medication my cholestrol went down to 197 in 9 months. I suffer from some very usual complications with Tamoxafin and had to stop taking it. I have discussed all these issues with my oncologist who said that my assumptions were incorrect, however, strange as it may seem, once coming off tamoxafin my levels have all returned to normal. I also experieced some very rare complications with this medication--I experienced muscle weakness and developed a heart arrythmia. These are both rare side effects. Tamoxafin is still a very good drug and it has help alot of women. My oncologist did say that her younger patients seemed to have more problems with the medication than her older patients. I hope this answers your question Have a Happy New Year",

If the radiologist can see the suspicious lesion on the MRI and this lesion is accessiable, than they can do the needle biopsies while you are in the MRI machine. This needle biopsies also sucks the whole lesion out, so even if you do have a positive pathology finding, sometimes that is all that is needed. If they want to do a Breast MRI and you are successful in getting it approved--do the Breast MRI, I had to beg my surgeon to order one because he really does not like the MRI's I gave you the reason for the dislike of MRI's in my earlier post to you.

Well, I would march right down to that doctors office and demand my records--all of the lab, radiology, pathology reports and the letters the doctor has sent off to the various doctors, especially the one sent to the oncologist that you are schedule to see. I would also inform the person at this Breast Center that you are less than happy with a doctor who would have a letter sent to a patient to let them know that the next step in the process is to see an oncologist without discussing in person or over the phone the reason for such a referral. If you are going to a Breast Care Center that is within a hospital, than I would also contact the Patient Care Representative and report this very poor patient care issue and insist that this individual report back to you by phone and letter explaining the steps that have been taken to insure that no other patient that is treated at the Breast Care Center received such substandard care. In terms of you being released from your nursing program at school, well, I would suggest that the you document in writing exactly what the dean of this program threaten you with and I would immediately schedule an appointment with the Dean of Students. By kicking you out of your program of studies without making accommadations for your illness is not exactly legal and could get the college into some serious liability issues. It is also none of the programs directors business as to what your medical condition is. She just needs to address if you are at risk of failing your program of studies. If you are able to maintain a passing grade for your program of studies than she should not be interferring. Have you spoken with your professors concerning your current situation? I know that you have been plugging away for 5 years for this degree, is there anyway that you can take this semester off to get the needed medical treatment? The other option is, can any of your classes be done on line or will some of your professor permit you to submit your assignments or papers via e-mail? I also vote on a tape recorder. It is hard to have prepared questions because you have no idea why you are seeing the doctor, which is why you must obtain your records from this other very unprofessional doctor before you have your appointment.

      "Content": "Hi Liss, I actually was in the process of responding to your post when I lost it last week, so hopefully my response will find its way this time. I am just now three and a half weeks post double mastectomy with bilateral sentinel node biopsies with tissue expanders. Having a Mastectomy is a very drastic step; however sometimes it is the only step. I came to my decision after many long hours, weeks and months of careful thought and consultation with myself, friends and trusted medical doctors. I also did the forbidden thing, I did research the internet and found a lot of studies from the National Institutes of Health, Sloan Kettering, Mayo Clinic. I am the type who really needs to research everything. I also had a real personal reason for my decision to have a double mastectomy. I am now a single mother of a teen. My husband was killed two years ago and this year has been an extremely difficult year for my daughter. I felt that she and I both needed a swift and final conclusion to this journey. Like yourself I have had several biopsies since 2005 on both breast. My risk factors were History of ADH, strong family history (my sister died 7 months after my husband), very dense breast tissue. This year I notice a change on the appearance of my left breast. I had my usual negative mammogram, but my ultrasound showed multiple papilloma lesions within my nipple areolar region. My original surgeon was hesitant to perform the required excisional biopsy because that would not answer the question on benign or malignant on the other lesions. She did not really know if my pathology was a good enough reason to perform excisional biopsies on all of the lesions which would required her taking about 3/4 of my breast. So she decided to take the wait and see attitude. A wait and see attitude may be good for her, but for me, I really needed to know whether there was cancer present within these lesions. This is where I started my journey of advocating for myself. You need to obtain all the information about your condition. Whether that information comes from the internet, friends, family or trusted medical personal. My resources where the studies I read, having a serious and honest conversation with my primary care doctor and searching out a new breast surgeon for a second opinion. My primary care was very honest with me and told me that I really only had one option available and that was to have the mastectomy. He felt that was the only guarantee of getting all the pathology that was present. I than had a consultation with a new breast surgeon. This surgeon took the time to listen to me, she than explained the reasons behind why she felt that the mastectomy was my best option. When I told her that if I where going to have a mastectomy than I wanted both breast removed because I was only going to go through this ordeal once since I have had issues in both breast in the past and by removing one breast was not going to really reduce my breast cancer risk factor for the second breast. I am telling you all this information because having a mastectomy or a double mastectomy is not only a very drastic step but it is also a very personal decision. This decision can only be made by you. You need to understand how you would feel without one breast, you need to decide do I want to have reconstruction with an implant or tissue taken from my abdomen (good way to get a tummy tuck that will be paid for by health insurance) or am I comfortable with wearing a bra with a prosthetic breast implant. It is easy for doctors to recommend a mastectomy, however they do not have to live with the future physical and mental scars. I think the key to my decision was having confidence that my breast surgeon and plastic surgeon had my best interest in mind. That my daughter was comfortable with my decision and that she understood why I was making this decision. I also had the support of my family even though all members did not agree. But most of all, I was comfortable with what I believed to be the right decision for me and I think that is the most important...the decision has to be right for you! I am sorry this post ended up being very long, but I hope it helps in some small way. Please let me know how you are doing. Please feel free to private message if that is better for you",

Insurance company could care what your age is and the lack of useful information that a mammogram would contain, they only follow their set guidelines for granting approvals for Breast MRI's. Breast MRI for you is actually a very good option because the MRI is far more sensitive to dense breast. The down fall to having a Breast MRI is that they tend to have a lot of false positive results. My first MRI resulted in my having 3 suspicious areas biopsied. So do not get overly anxious if your report come back that they want to repeat the MRI in six months. My attitute is better safe then sorry. They can do as many biopsies as they need as long as they investigate every questionable lesion they detect. Extra Strength Liquid Advil Gel Caps work best for me and my new found prescription pain medication is Toradol. This medication does not cause you to fall asleep.",

The other suggestion I have is to seek out some legal advice, maybe with the threat of legal action, maybe this plastic surgeon will get his head out of the clouds and redo the procedure to correct his error. You can also report him to your state medical board. Having a complain on a public record will hurt this doctor's practice and again he may be willing to correct the error if you did not report him. Just some suggestions. Keep you chin up, this is a great board to help you through some tough times.

      "Content": "Well, I agree with the previous poster and I say that because I had the same problem. I could feel the lump, felt it everyday when I took a shower. Primary Care could not feel it, never mentioned it to my ob/gyn, however, I did mention it when I went for my mammogram. Had the usual mammo views and than I had an ultasound done and report was negative. The radiologist did mention that I could feel the lump, but nothing was showing up. Well my ob/gyn takes no chances so he insisted that I be seen in the Breast Clinic immediately. (strong family history of bc) Surgeon mentioned that he felt a small thickness however, he was not concerned and wanted to wait six months. I played the six months game, lump was still there and I felt that it was beginning to change in size and I also thought that I could feel a smaller lump developing beside the larger one. The surgeon still was not concerned. At this point, I insisted that a biopsy be performed. Since the surgeon could not feel the lump, he could not do a needle biopsy, so he had to bring me into the OR and do an open biopsy. Well, there in fact was a mass and a second one growing right beside it. The surgeon ended up doing a lumpectomy because of the size and when the pathology came back a week later it showed that I had atypical hyperplasia located in three different locations within that mass. The mass was typed at estrogen positive so I was referred to an oncologist who put me on tamoxafin. I took this medication for 9 months but had to stop because of some severe side effects. So get a referral from you gyn doctor for an appointment with a breast surgeon. If you can feel it than you know it is there. Tell this doctor that you no longer want it there and to please remove it. Some of these doctors are concerned because you will have a scar and I guess some women do not like scars on their breasts. I told my surgeon that I was not using my breasts for employment, however, I am a mother to a young child who I would like to see her through school, watch her walk down the aisle and hopefully help her care for my grandchildren. Insist on a biopsy and do not stop until you get what you want!!! Let us know how you do.",

      "Content": "Wow, what a harsh nurse. I would request to see the radiation oncologist to discuss this rash and to inquire if there is any other type of remedy you could try. I am sure the rash is from the radiation treatments. Maybe it is time to reposition you. Do let a professional medical provider get a way with such a curt remark. Request another opinion and in your case another nurse.",

I lived in Southwestern Florida for 4 1/2 years(Ft Myers) and I worked in the medical profession down there and I witnessed some very poor care from both doctors and nurses. I will ask around here if anyone has experienced a similiar radiation reaction and what type of cream they used.",
