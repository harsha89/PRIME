I have no health insurance or I would be in and out of doctors offices. Does anyone else have these lumps under their armpits. Thanks for reading. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!! Dawn Hi Dawn you may not get my response because this kind of an old thread, but I have similar lumps under both armpits. I also haven't been feeling well. My Chiropractor said that my lymph glands were congested and showed me how to massage them. Do an internet search for more details on how to keep your lymph glands from getting congested with toxins. Just to brief you here is what I do. I start under my breast and massage or push upward toward my side and up along the sides of my breast and then in above my breast. Also between my breast I massage upward toward my upper chest. I use lotion or you can use oil. He recommended I do this daily for 1 minute or so. Also I read on the net to drink tons of distilled water, like 12 cups per day with one lemon per day. I've gotten a major headache from doing this because I'm moving all these toxins through my body. I just started last week, but my lumps have gone way down even after the first day of doing this. I'm also going to a lymphatic massage therapist tomorrow to speed up the process and learn other places I need to massage. I would also recommend seeing a Ob/Gyn to rule out anything serious.",
