    "Content": "I had double mastectomy about a year ago. I had reconstruction but that is a long process. The mastectomy was in Dec 07, ovaries removed in January, Tissue expanders in March ( weekly saline injections for several months), silicone implants in August, nipples in November 08, and I am still waiting for tatooing. It is a long process. I did not miss much work. Two weeks for Douple masectectomy, One week for Tissue expanders, a couple of days when ovaries removed. I am pleased with the results but all this is very emotional and overwhelming.",
