I have it in both breasts which might be a problem I don't know, it is clear or white - so I guess it could be a hormonal problem. I don't want to have it anymore. I feel like a freak. I am sorry to hear about your problems, the gray or green has to be infection right, should you be put on some antibiotics or have the cyst removed?",

      "Content": "I guess it is normal for some of us then, but what that doctor did to you was not cool and was horrible. Doctors, most of them, don't have any idea what they are doing. It is so hard to find someone that really cares about you and what is going on in your body. Do they just want to make as much money as they can in a day. They haven't even asked me to get a mammogram yet just to be safe. Why wouldn't they do as much as they can for you? Some of the ones I have seen has made me anxious to go to other doctors. Then they all say you seem anxious. Yes, you make me that way. Iwish you the best of luck. Don't quit until you get the answers you are looking for. I am sorry to hear about your breast cancer. Could this be a sign of that to come? I don't know. We all need to stick together I know that. No one else understands and looks at you like you have two heads.",
