    "Content": "I am a 22 year old male, and have been having pain in the left side of the pectoral(breast). It hurts mainly when i touch it and sometimes when i breath. I feel somesort of a lump around the nipple area. It is not noticeable. Its been hurting for about a few weeks. Does anyone have any idea what this can be. I am a smoker, and realize that might be a possibilty but any other input would be greatly appreciated. When there is a lump and it is cancerous is it supposed to hurt at all.. Thank you Danny",
