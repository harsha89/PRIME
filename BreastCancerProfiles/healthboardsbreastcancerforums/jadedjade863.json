    "Content": "I am a 30 year old mother of two. I have a spontaneous nipple inversion of my left breast, leakage (without breast feeding-leaking has lasted 6 years) the leakage is a milky color, my nipples feel \"itchy\" as I can best describe it. I have a heavy feeling in my breast but no distingishable lumps. I have had 4 mammograms and 2 ultrasounds and no masses or defects in the milk ducts are seen. I have had 2 maternal aunts diagnosed with breast cancer. Last doctor suggested a tumor on my Pituitary gland which would explain the leakage and headaches. Thoughts?",
