    "Content": "I am new to all of this. A lump was discovered in my left breast at my annual pap and breast exam on the 21st of October and now I am seven days late for my period. There is a very good possibility that I am pregnant. Had unprotected intercourse with my bf several times in October. I am supposed to have a mammogram and ultrasound on the Nov. 15. Does anyone now if cancer can disrupt your monthly cycle? I have been very regular up until now. Totally freaking out about everything. Please help me out here. Trinity",
