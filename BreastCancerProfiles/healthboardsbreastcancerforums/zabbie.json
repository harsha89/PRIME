    "Content": "Hi, I am not sure if I am writing in the right forum as I have nevr done this before...but here it goes... I felt some hard areas in my breast and it got worse during my period, after, it got a little better but was still there. I had an ultra sound which came up normal and a mammogram which showed an area of concern. This is what the mammogram report said: \"There is a right axillary nodes. The left axilla is free of nodes. A cluster of coarse calcifications are in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. The cluster configuration is somewhat concerning. Needle localiztion/biopsy is advised for further evaluation. The parenchyma of the left breast is normal, with almost equal amounts ofglandular tissues and fatty tissues.There is no skin thickening, prominent vessels or microcalcifications.\" we do not have breast specialists etc. I went to a surgeon who examined me and felt a small lump. I had a surgical biopsy yesterday. The surgeon said that he removed the lump and some surrounding tissue. Both the lump and tissue had a gritty feeling from the calcification. I pressed the surgeon to give me some percentages and he said about 60 percent it is not cancer. While this is somewhat reassuring, I am still freaking out! I will not get the results till next Friday, maybe Monday as they send the sample to the USA. I am trying to stay positive and hold on to that other 40 percent that is in my favour (though I do understand that it is not a guarantee). What I wanted to know is what other conditions can cause a lump with calcification? Any info you could give me would be hugely appreciated. Thanks",
