      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am a new poster here. I am 37 years old, and here is a brief rundown of my story: On My 25th at my annual exam my gyno found a mass in my right breast. He sent me for a mammo and ultrasound. It feels to be about the size of a small marble, and I didn't know it was there. The mammo didn't show anything, but the report stated my breast tissue is very dense and could easily hide a small lesion. The ultrasound did show a mass. I went back to the doc this past Tuesday for a recheck and to go over the test results. He wanted to see if the mass changed at all during different hormonal cycles. It's hasn't. He said the ultrasound showed it wasn't a cyst, and that it has \"undefined margins\". He is sending me to a surgeon, and I go next Tuesday for a consult. My doc did say not to wait on this, to NOT have a \"wait and see approach\". Should I request a total lumpectomy, or would a simply biopsy do? Which is best in your opinion? Needless to say I am fearing the worst. My Mom died of cancer at age 56, but it didn't originate in her breast, but in her lungs. By the time they found her cancer it was pretty much everywhere. Her sister (my Aunt) had breast cancer in both breasts back in the 70's and had a double mastectomy. She is still alive and kicking in her late 60's. I have one aunt as well as a cousin on my father's side that also have had breast cancer. I know no one here is a doctor, but I was wondering if anyone has any opinions on what you think the chances are that it may be cancer? I am really trying not to think the worst, but I also am preparing myself for what it may be. In any event, thanks for listening to my story. This has certainly shaken me up quite a bit. You ladies are truly inspiring. ~Jill",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, First of all I wanted to thank you all for replying to my post, as the advice and support was very much appreciated. I did go visit the surgeon today and he agreed the lump needs to come out. While he really doesn't suspect it to be cancerous, he said it would be better to know for sure by totally removing the mass to see what we are dealing with. Best of luck to everyone, and thanks again.........",
