    "Content": "In September my son was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma. His treatment ended in January and didn't get all the cancer. He is now getting more chemo and needs a bone transplant. They are saying a half match (mom or dad) is working better so we are waiting on our test results. In the mean time I noticed a lump in my breast. Same breast that my nipple had \" died\" some time during all this. I am now reading more and think it is more like dented in jus below the lump. At the time I didn't think it was anything. But after some weight low I notice the lump now. It isn't moveable and it is firm and almost feels like it is rippled? I have also had some sharp pains through to my nipple. My last child was born in 2009,I'm 37 . Has anyone experienced this?",
