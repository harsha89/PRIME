      "Content": "Hello, I went to the doctor yesterday about the pain in my left breast. He and the nurse found another cyst under my nipple. I have to go in Thursday for another mammo and ultrasound. I have lost 10 pounds in the last 2 months and weigh 106 now. Do you think that since I lost the weight (some in the breasts) that these cysts are going to be more noticable? I am really scared about this because I never have felt pain there before.",

      "Content": "Pippin, Just got back from the mammogram. They did 5 views and I am so sore. They couldn't find anything so they didn't do the ultrasound. I am very relieved, but wonder where the cyst the doctor and nurse felt on Monday go? Thanks for your support! I pray everything turns out for you too. Good luck tommorrow with your appointment. BTW, is your username Pippin have anything to do with Lord of the Rings?",

      "Content": "Hello, I am new to this board, but have been posting on the Thyroid Board for quite some time. I am 47 and have 3 children. At my last mammogram in December they called me back because there a suspicious area on the left breast. I had another mammo and also an ultrasound. The doctor said they were normal cysts. Well, I have never have been able to feel them. In just the last few days I noticed that I have a little pain in the left breast behind the nipple. Today was the worst, when I touch it it hurts a lot. I called my doctor's office and they want me to come in on Monday. I am due for my period next week. This has me frightened because I have never had any trouble before. Does anyone have anything to offer as far as your expertise? Thanks for any responses.",

      "Content": "Hi Gemini, My doctor did request an ultrasound but the radiologist said that since the mammogram was ok they didn't need to do an ultrasound. I am still having some pain in the left side. When I do certain movements, exercise or bend over I can feel it. I am going to call the doctor's office today and find out what might be going on. I did receive the letter from the office stating that the mammogram was good. I have a friend who is a nurse and said that it possibly could be mamalgia (something like that). I just find this very unnerving to be having this problem since it is the first time for me. When I exercise it is worse, I even use a good sports bra. Ugh.",

      "Content": "Well, I didn't have to call the doctor's office, they called me. The nurse said I could either come in the office in 4 weeks or see a specialist. I told her I was still having pain with movement and she said I had better go see the specialist. She did say the mammo was negative, but wanted the specialist to look at the mammo from December also. I asked about the ultrasound and she said that the specialist would be able to help me. Now I am a little scared. Seems like I have been on a roller coaster ride for the last 7 years!",
