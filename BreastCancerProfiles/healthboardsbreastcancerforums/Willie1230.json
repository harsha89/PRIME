    "Content": "Hello! This is my first time posting on this forum, or well any forum. This has been an ongoing issue for nearly a year now. Gradually becoming worse, until now. It now seems the only thing I can focus on. It started roughly a year ago. I came down with the flu, and I started feeling what seemed like a \"sickness\" in my left breast. That's the best way for me to describe it. I noticed a small tubular lump close to but not under my armpit. Tender to touch. This feeling lasted a few months, until I was able to get into my gynecologist. She basically dismissed it, telling me I drank too much caffeine. (I drink an average of three cups of coffee a week) The feeling went away for a short while. Coming back about two months ago. Now, the pain feels like it's a deep bone pain. It extends to my back, between my shoulder blades and then below my collar bone. I can also feel a tingling down my left arm. My breast will often itch and I can feel a tingle in the nipple. There are also times when I can feel my heart start to race. I do not have any redness or any noticeable changes to the appearance of my breast. Just the movable lump and pain. Just for the record, I am 24 and healthy. I recently moved to I am searching for a new doctor close to our home here. In the mean time, I am open to suggestions on what may be causing the severe discomfort. Thank you!",
