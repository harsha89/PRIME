    "Content": "Hey everyone, I'm just looking for help and reasurrance i suppose! Last week i noticed my left breast felt a little tender so decided to examine it. As i did so i found a smallish lump in the left upper quadrant of my breast so i booked a doctors appointment straight away. The doctor examined both my breast and confirmed a lump and he has now referred me to the Breast Clinic (I now have the appointment for this on Monday 11th Sept 06). I'm 33 and have no children, this tenderness is non-cyclical and some days it feels worse than others!! I'm kind of reasurring myself that because its fairly painlful its unlikely to be cancer.....................I would really appreciate your honest views on this...............have any of you that have now been diagnosed with cancer had a painful lump or did this just turn out to be a cyst!! Any help and advise would truly be appreciated, please be totally honest with me. Thank you in advance.............. Sarah",
