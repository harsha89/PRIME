      "Content": "Hi Bev and everyone else. First off, having dense breast tissue is fairly normal. It makes it harder for mammos to be read and it is a good sign when the radiologist takes more pictures just to be certain all is well. I would not worry about it yet and I also would not hesitate to call your doctor on the phone and ask him the results of the first test prior to the second one. That way, you can educate yourself prior to going to have the test done which may allow you to ask some questions of the radiologist performing it. I want to tell what happened to me. Mainly because I worry about other ladies. Because, I was a person who always listened to the docs and never questioned anything. But this one time my gut instincts told me I needed to research which led to my questioning them, which actually may have saved my life. We are our own best advocates. I began yearly mammos at 40. When I turned 45 and went for my mamo I too received a letter stating they needed to take more pics, giving me absolutely no information on why. I called my doctor who told me that they saw some calcifications on the film but that it was nothing to worry about they just needed more intense pics because I had dense breast tissue. I looked up calcifcations online and read all about them so when I went for more films two weeks later and was told, \"everything looks benign come back in 6 months\", I got scared because what I read told me with regard to calcifications there is absolutely no way to tell if they are the benign kind or the malignant kind. So I questioned the radiologist and one word led to another where they finally said, look lady the only way to assure you it is not cancerous is to do a biopsy and we are not recommending that at this time. I was scared to death but I was more angry that they were not going to take that extra step to ease my mind. I cannot tell you how angry I was actually. I contacted Johns Hopkins told them what happened and what I was told and withing 9 days Hopkins had done mamos, sonograms and a biopsy and I found out I had invasive ductal carcinoma, a very aggressive form of breast cancer. It was very very small, only 9 mm at the time. Within less than one month of being told to wait 6 months and come back I had a lumpectomy, then a resection 2 weeks later and 42 days of radiation. I was very lucky because my histology was the worst. her2neu 3+, progesterone negative, estrogen negative and I also had extensive dcis which was grade 3 (bad stuff). Fortunately, NO LYMPH NODES were affected ... it was caught extremely early. Had I listened to the first guy, that prognosis would have been much much worse due to the aggressiveness of my particular cancer. So, being insistent, being uncooperative even, paid off for me. My doctor was shocked when I called him and told him guess what I have breast cancer. He was going by the first rad report. I am telling you all this because it is VERY IMPORTANT that we take our health care into our own hands ... we must LISTEN to our gut and do what we feel is necessary, get a second opinion and a third if necessary. Please do this for yourselves. I still am angry, can you tell? Because I often wonder how many poor old souls are being told to come back in 6 months that actually have breast cancer.",

      "Content": "Just my opinion .... if you have a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer than I feel mammo's at young ages would be logical. My daughter is 21 and they won't give her one but in my family I'm the first with a female cancer. I have no family history. The way it is usually judged and works is that now that I've had the cancer and was dx at age 45, my daughter would qualify to start getting her mammo's at age 35 (10 years prior to my dx.) Mammograms most definitely save lives and any woman who does not get them done is playing Russian Roulette with their own life. I did not have a lump, no pain, no indication at all that anything was wrong. I shudder when thinking about what would have happened if I had not gotten the mammogram.",
