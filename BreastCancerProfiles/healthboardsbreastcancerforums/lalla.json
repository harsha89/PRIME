    "Content": "I don't think I can go your route but I have some of the same issues. I am 31 years old, my cancer is invasive and estrogen positive. My doctors want me to have chemo and enter a trial for herceptin. Additionally they want me to take tamoxifen. This is very upsetting due to my age. My husband and I will have our 1 year anniversary in September and we were trying to get pregnant when I was diagnosed. Is waiting 6 years before I get pregnant my only option? I have research to do but could use anyone's opinion. Haven't talked to too many people with experience. Any help would be great! Lalla",
