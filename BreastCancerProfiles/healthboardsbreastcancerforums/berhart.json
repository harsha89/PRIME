    "Content": "Hi: Just a word about changes in the skin color or texture on the breast. You should definitely bring anything of this nature to the attention of your doctor. I don't think the skin looking paler is a problem, but if you ever observe a reddening of the skin, or a dimpling on the surface of the skin, these can be danger signals! From personal experience I can tell you that an orange-red coloration to the skin can be a tell-tale of Inflamatory Breast Cancer (IBC). This type of breast cancer does NOT have a lump associated with it!! It is a very aggressive cancer which has usually matastasized before it is even diagnosed. The prognosis is poor. So, to be on the safe side, let your doctor be the one who decides whether it is a problem. Best wishes!!",
