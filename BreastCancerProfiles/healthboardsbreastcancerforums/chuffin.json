      "Content": "[SIZE=4][COLOR=DarkRed][FONT=Comic Sans MS] I am 48 and on hormones, among other meds, and had my yearly mammo done on 12/16/03. I got a letter in the mail a couple of days ago saying there was a questionable area that needed to re-evaluated. Of course, I am worried, but understand this is common. All the doctor's office would say is that according to the report they got, it was on the left breast at 11:00. Ironically, this is an area that is painful and sometimes has a tingling sensation.. I'm going in for a sonogram next week, but just wondered what others' experiences were with this? Thanks so much for any words of wisdom or advice!!",

My further testing showed that there was nothing abnormal. So yes it is quite common. My question to myself is not whether or not I'll get breast cancer but when. I am at such a high risk. Good luck to you and let me know how the test went. Thanks for your reply and I certainly wish you all the best. I will hope and pray that you will beat the odds. I have known women who had lots in the family, but never got it, and then others who had none in the family who did, so you just never know. It is a scary thing to live with, but you have to just live each day at a time. I will definitely let you know how mine comes out and again, thanks for sharing your experiences.. All the best.",
