      "Content": "Hi I had a mastectomy on my left breast with immediate reconstruction (with implant) including nipple, sentinel node biopsy and a reduction to my right breast. I had the operation on a Tuesday and on the next Monday I had the last drain removed. At the time I thought I was doing relatively well... but when I look back I was a little impatient. In the end I took about three weeks off work and then worked from home as I felt like it (I was quite lucky). I was out and about after the last drain came out but I wasn't really 'onto' it enough to work. If you want to know more just let me know.",

      "Content": "Hi... Just my experience on this one. If you would feel more comfortable getting an MRI then go and get one, its another tool that they will use along with the Mammogram and an ultrasound to make a diagnosis. I had my general yearly appointment last October. The mammogram showed a cluster of calcifications in my left breast which apparently is an indicator for DCIS. I then had an ultra sound but this showed absolutely nothing. I had additional mammograms to double check the breast. From this they decided I would need a biopsy. So I had a sterotactic biopsy, as the calcifications couldn't been seen via ultrasound the needle was guided by xray and computer. From there the diagnosis was DCIS but they were unsure of how much was there. The mammogram indicated 5cm and the biospsy a little more so they sent me for a MRI to see if that could give more information. The results of the MRI showed 8cm. For me that meant I had to have a mastectomy. So off came the left breast. Once the path results of my breast came back it showed 19cm... A very big difference from what the could see using 3 different diagnostic tools. None of them is perfect when used on their own, they add value when used in conjunction with each other... and sadly even then it seems they don't 'see' everything. Like I said if you want the MRI and can afford it go for it but its not a pefect tool either. Good luck. Lisa",

      "Content": "Hi... I agree with the previous poster. I had been having yearly mammograms as I had very lumpy and dense breast tissue. In 2008 they found some microcalcifications that hadn't been there the previous year, I had a biopsy a few days later and that showed I had DCIS, since then I have had a mastectomy and radiation treatment, all good though. I do recommend that you have the biopsy... peace of mine or early treatment has to win out.",

      "Content": "Hi... now I don't want to scare you or anything because I'm sure that they know more than I but the first time I had a cluster of calcifications show up in my mammogram I was given a biopsy and diagnosed with DCIS. This was in October last year. I've since had a mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and radiation. Of course this is just my story and we are all very different and I don't know of any other peoples stories with calcifications, only my own. And there maybe more than one type of calcification... like I said I only know what I went through and what I was told at the time. I really really don't want to scare you or anything but I think that I would push for a biopsy or discuss the option of it with them further... Good luck x",
