      "Content": "Essentially, \"No.\" The images that I was able to pull up indicate a rather protruberant \"breast\" which may be consistend with late-stage development. I am suggesting that the lump, or \"bud\", is something that appears (in it's earliest stages) and a bump beneath the nipple. Since I don't seem to be answering your need, have you seen a doctor about this?",

      "Content": "Men can get breast cancer (3% is the latest CDC findings). There is a condition called \"gynecomastia\" which is simply a nodule or lump that appears behing the nipple of the breast, beneath the skin. SOme surgeons will want to remove it in order to biopsy the nodule. In order to diagnose the nodule, a man will have to undergo a mammorgram and, usually,an ultrasound. These are not painful though only slightly embarassing. Generally, by the nature of the cells, it's shape, etc a radiologist can suggest a diagnosis but it is up to the patient and the surgeon to develop a plan of care. I have had two of these nodules. The first one, on the right breast, was surgically removed (it's an out-patient procedure) and was benign. That was four years ago. I discovered another, this time on the left side, and underwent the mammorgram and ultrasound. However, this time, I've decided to wait three months before undergoing another procedure. By the way, gynecomastias tend to be fairly tender to the touch and may cause a slight discomfort when palpated. Whatever you decide to do, you should do it under the advice of a physician. Remember, these lumps are not usually cancerous. They can be caused by hormones, marijuana use, steroid use, or just as a natural (thought slightly different) course of maturing. NO, not everyone gets them.",
