    "Content": "Hi, I am new here to this forum and I am totally scared. I had an ultrasound of my breast today as I have been having increasing pain in left breast. It started back in January right after my husband passed away and I thought at first it was costochondritis as I have fibromyalgia, but it is getting more intense and I had a mammogram which came back fine but I have dense breasts and I am a 66 year old way past postmenopausal status and have never been on any kind of hormones. My doctor didn't even want to schedule me for an ultrasound but I insisted. Of course I am from a rural area that the tech does the ultrasound and then the radiologist reads it and then the doctor gets it which in turn takes about 5 days. I am leaving for the beach on Sunday so I don't know whether to call his office for results or wait until I come back. I will be a nervous wreck and also still in pain. I do not want to ruin the vacation for my son and his family. What should I do? Do 66 year old ladies get benign cysts in their breasts? I thought I was over that stage. Please advise if you can. Thank you",
