I think my doc said that the radiologist should go over the test info with me while I am there. That would be nice! I will let you all know when I know!!! Thanks, Chrissy",

      "Content": "Hi there!! I am new to this forum but not to this board. I post in other areas. This morning while doing a breast exam I noticed a small lump that was not present the last time I did an exam a few weeks ago. I am almost 38 years old and had a hysterectomy 3 years ago in december. I was left with one working ovary, but I do take a very low dose of Premarin because about a year or so after the hysterectomy I started to have severe breast tenderness and since taking the hormones it is much better. The lump is small and does not feel like the rest of the breast tissue. It also feels like it is a funky shape and it is somewhat firm. I am a bit scared but not freaked out or anything. I know that it could be a few other things than cancer. Over the last few weeks I have noticed that both of my arm pits have been sore. I don't really know if this means anything or not. At this time I am not that active because I was in a car accident in July of this year and I have an ongoing problem with my neck that is still persisting even after some treatments. So I can not think of any reason for the underarms to be so sore. Can the lump and armpit sorness be realted???? I was wondering what others felt when they first felt a lump and what they did about it??? I would think the best thing to do would be to call my Gyno and make an appointment ASAP. Please any info or advice would be great. Thanks Chrissy",
