    "Content": "My Mother went through pretty intensive chemo about 8 months ago. She has stage IV lung cancer. She's 64. The only side effect she had was some minor fatigue and of course the hair loss. They would give her anti-nausea drugs along with her chemo medicene, and she would also take a pill (sorry, can't remember it's name) when she got home. She never felt sick to her stomach and attributed it to the drugs she got for that. She even gained weight! She lost about 75% of her hair, and it is now grown in enough that she no longer wears headscarves or a wig. Her chemo lasted about 6 months. Her best friend is a hospice nurse and also works with cancer doctors. She says that the advancements in chemo have helped a lot with the negative side effects. Hopefully your experience will be as good as hers (if having chemo can ever be described as a good experience! ) . She was very frightened about it, and she may have to do it again, but she's not scared of it anymore. I also have a coworker/friend who went through chemo when she was 17 -which was about 15 years ago. It worked, she's been cancer free ever since. She lost all her hair on head, but none of her eyebrows, nose, ear or body hair. She said she would get nauseous for about a day after chemo, but was fine after that until the next session. If you haven't already, I would contact your local American Cancer Society. They set my mother up with a lot of goodies. She went to something I hear they hold in most cities - \"Feeling good, Looking Better\" (I think it's called - my mom always jokingly called it \"Sick and Pretty\") and gave her a chemo-kit filled with special shampoos, lotions and really nice makeup from brands like Estee Lauder and such. They also show you how to use eyebrow pencils, things like that so you can battle the outer-physical effects of the chemo. They also tell you what kind of shampoos and toothbrushes to get because you usually need to get special kinds. Good luck! I hope it goes well!!",
