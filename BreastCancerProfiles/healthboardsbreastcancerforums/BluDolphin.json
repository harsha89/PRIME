      "Content": "I've been having itchiness, burning, and an irritated erect left nipple too. It seems like it's always the left nipple everyone complains about? How strange? I've been doing alot of surfing for information and all I keep coming up with is the Paget's Disease. If anyone finds out any other information that doesn't have to do with that disease, please share! I am a little worried. If it continues to bother me through the weekend, then I will call Monday and make an appt. with my doctor. It is a great comfort to know that I can come here. This place is very helpful!",
