      "Content": "I had my first baby 19 months ago and started breastfeeding right away. Two days after giving birth, I woke up with breast engorgement - my breasts felt swollen, painful and very lumpy. By the next day, hot showers, massage and similar treatments made them go back to normal, except for one lump that never went away. I continued breastfeeding, pumping, massaging while the baby is nursing, but it was still there six months later. I went for an ultrasound, which couldn't show much because my breasts were full of milk. The ultrasound was repeated three times within the next few months with the same result. Then I finally went to a surgeon who decided to poke the lump with a needle and that came clear. The lump stayed there and didn't change in size. I stopped breastfeeding when my baby was 14 months, about five months ago. About a week after I completely stopped nursing, I noticed that that lump was gone, or so I thought. It became a lot softer, or perhaps not so close to the surface, but then I realized that it's still there. I went to the doctor who sent me for another ultrasound. The technician didn't see anything but when the doctor at the ultrasound came in, she had a better look and said she wondered if what she can see are little calcium deposits so she sent me for a mammogram (my fist one ever, and I'm 31) right away to be sure. I was told the mammogram is clear and I'm free to go. My family doctor thinks this is just a milk scar or something of the kind, but I don't have a peace of mind knowing that this is still there. I constantly worry that it could turn into something. Somehow, I would think that having both an ultrasound and a mammogram that are clear (not the mention the biopsy that was done a year ago, although I was still breastfeeding at the time) would leave me with nothing to worry about, but I keep researching the Internet for similar problems and no one ever responds to these women saying they're OK just because the tests they've had showed nothing. My question is, how concerned should I really be? Part of the lump feels kind of rubbery and one part feels grainy. I'm thinking of going back to my GP and asking to see a surgeon for another biopsy. I'm also one of those people who are so terrified of cancer that it's interferring with their daily life. There is no cancer family history other than a great grandma who I think had breast cancer and esophageal cancer. Please help. Any advice would be much appreciated! Thanks.",
