      "Content": "Hi everyone. I'm new to the breast cancer board. I have a new problem and am hoping some vets have some answers for me. I have been having pain in the left side of my chest for about a month. It only happened when I ran, so I just walked instead. After a month, it started scaring me because my family history of heart disease is major. I went to my doctor last Thursday and he decided to run everything he could think of. Full blood workup, ekg, and a chest xray. I run daily, so figured it would all be fine. Blood work was fine, ekg was fine, and xrays looked fine. He called me today though. Said he's had my xrays for the last 3 days trying to figure out the best course. He says I have a calcified lymph node in my armpit (the ones right next to the breast). He doesn't know how to go from here. We decided together (with me not knowing anything about calcified lymph nodes) to re-xray in 1 month. Is this the right way to go? Should I have a biopsy? A mammogram? I'm dealing with tmj, arthritis, a thyroid condition, and tendonitis already. I don't want to overreact, but I don't want to screw up either. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",
