I recently had my annual mammogram and got the following report: Mass or abnormal density: A new density in the left breast on the oblique view superiorly measuring 6 x 7 mm is 6.7 cm from the nipple. It is not definitely seen on the craniocaudal view. Rest of the fibroglandular tissue of both breasts shows no significant change. A new density present in the left breast on the craniocaudal view in the lateral aspect 5.1 cm from the nipple measuring 5 x 4 mm. It is not definitely seen on the oblique view. No spiculated lesions, abnormal calcifications or architectural distortion are seen in either breast. Overall Impression: New density in the left breast on the oblique view and another in the left breast on the craniocaudal view. Recommend coned down compression views and ultrasound of the left breast and 90 degree lateral view. Birads score 0 What does this mean? I am worried.",
