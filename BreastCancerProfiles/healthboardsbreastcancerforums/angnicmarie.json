      "Content": "Hi! I was 25 when I was diagnosed with stage 3c uterine cancer. I completed 11wks external radiation with 2 cycles of Cispatin and Steroids. I then did internal and then did 6 rounds of Taxol with Carboplatin (chemos) along with steroids. I'm not going to lie to you, I was very very sick. But just when I thought I couldn't take anymore, I'd start to feel a little better, just in time for the next chemo. ahhahah Anyways, different people handle chemo in different ways. Some rarely feel bad. It just depends on what type and your physical health and so on. I was very healthy, and I think thats why I survived my strenuous cycle of treatments. Sucking on candy helped me alot. And I couldn't let my stomache get empty or I'd get sick (mainly due to the steroids). But, it's been 10 mos since my last treatment, and I feel wonderful, I still get a little tired, but it was all worth it. Take care and good luck. Nicole",

      "Content": "HI! I'm just curious....about this...because...and I don't want to scare you. I am 26 and last March I was diagnosed with stage 3c uterine cancer. I was under the constant care of my gynecologist. Everytime he said I was normal and that was it. I had cysts on my ovaries and all...one got to be lemon sized. Well, needless to say, after being so miserable with gas and back pain and abdomen pain...I finally had enough and demanded my doctor do laprascopy. Well, he disagreed and suggested an ultrasound...so we did that...and thats when a football sized tumor was found connected to my pelvic sidewall and had engulped my right ovary and tube and covered my uterus. So that was it. After the first surgery, which was removal of the tumor (thought at the time to be a benign teratoma) my gas problems disappeared. But it was after the lab results came in...that started my real journey. Please dig farther into this...request...a uterine biopsy...just to be sure...because you never know. Take care. Luv Nicole",
