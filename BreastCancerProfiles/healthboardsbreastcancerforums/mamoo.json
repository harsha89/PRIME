    "Content": "Hi! Just a short question. I have been called back many times for repeat mammograms. In July the report came back that there are two new 5mm oval nodules involving both breast. Level III. Went back to my dr. last week and he suggested that instead of a follow up mammo we do a Bi-lateral MRI of the breast. Is this a common thing? Going tommorw for the MRI and just wondering what to expect.",
