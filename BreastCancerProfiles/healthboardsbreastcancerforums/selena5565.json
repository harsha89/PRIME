      "Content": "Hello, I posted a question regarding flaxseed previously but did not get a large response. My girlfriend told me about flaxseed and its preventative effects on breast cancer according to a few medical studies. I did my own research and found that for cancer, the part of the flaxseed that is important are the lignans and not the oil component. I did most of my research on the web at the National Library of Medicine website (www.pubmed.com). You can type in any key words such as \"flaxseed lignans cancer\" and you will see a considerable list of medical studies. Apparently flaxseed has been known for a while but studies show that it is the Lignan component and not the oils that seem to be effective as an aniti-tumor agent. The studies seem very promising and I am taking flaxseed lignans. I must say that it is early but I do feel better with more energy- I believe that this can have great potential from the science behind it. Studies are being done on its effectiveness on other hormone related cancers as well. Some of the studies I have listed below. I hope this helps. I would like to know your thoughts. ~selena Thompson LU. Experimental studies on lignans and cancer. Baillieres Clin Endocrin Metab. 12:691-705, 1998. Thompson LU, et al.

      "Content": "Hi, yes I have seen her research and advice. Though I think for what you are looking for, it is the flaxseed lignans that are the most important. This seems to have the most scientific research behind it and I am sure that the doctor would agree as well. The oils of the flaxseed have not been shown to have the potency on tumor cells as the lignans. This is according to the research I have conducted at the National Library of Medicine website. take care!",
