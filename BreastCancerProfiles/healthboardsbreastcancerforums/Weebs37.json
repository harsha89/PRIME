      "Content": "I have been doing some research on the internet about calcified tumors. My brother-in-law has a very large calcified tumor beneath his breast bone and the two lymph nodes beside it are enlarged and calcified. I have heard and read that calcified tumors are \"usually\" benign(noncancerous). In his case, if it's not cancerous, then they should look at the possibility of having TB. If his TB test comes back negative, they should still treat him for TB anyway. We hasn't had his biopsy yet, but we shall see soon. Let us know what you find out. But I would think calcified would be a good sign. I could be wrong. Weebs",
