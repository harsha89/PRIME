    "Content": "I guess I scared everyone with my first post. I am mad, only because the surgeon blew me off. He just read my report and felt the lump under my areola with a mass that extends outward as if my duct is enlarged. The not so good surgeon tells me it is regular breast tissue. Funny my other breast doesn't feel the like that. I then point out the lymph nodes on my other breast and which I am told is cysts. Is cysts usually located on the very side ( outer portion) of the breast? Has anyone gone through this with clear nipple discharge? Or when lymph nodes are seen on the ultrasound. Like I said with my previous post both the mammo. and US were clear other than the lymphnodes being visible on the right breast. Am i going crazy? Can a biopsy be done with out a lump being visible on the above mentioned? Cheryl",
