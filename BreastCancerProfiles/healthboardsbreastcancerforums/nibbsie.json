I will offer my opinion--I once did the \"watch and wait\" routine, and, believe me when I tell you this, but every day of those 6 long months, I worried about the cluster of calcifications in my breast, all day and night. At the end of the six months, nothing had really changed in the mammo, but I couldn't bear going through another day wondering and had the biopsy. It was benign, and I was so happy and relieved that it was over. It is not an easy time. Perhaps they can do a simple needle biopsy under the mammo. I had 2 done this year, and I had the results in an hour. Good luck, sweetie! I am here if you have any further questions.",

I developed the symptoms that you are experiencing on the Tamoxifen which she felt, was due to too much estrogen being blocked. She then switched me to tamoxifen. I did not experience that side effect with tamoxifen. The bottom line of what I am explaining is that you have to talk to your doctor who prescribed the medication and tell her what you are feeling. There are other estrogen blockers that may not give you that side effect. Good luck!",

But I had many of them clustered together. The radiologist thought we should wait and see if there was any change in 6months. My doctor thought it was safe to wait also and see. I went along with their opinion. But I worried about was under that cluster--how about the ones they couldn't see? I worried that maybe a change was taking place during that time, and, if I had acted sooner, it could still have been benign. Those were the thoughts that went around and around in my mind. After 6 months, they were the same. I could have watched and waited another 6 months, but I couldn't take the stress of it anymore, so I opted to have it removed. I didn't want to wait to hear the words, \"Well, it has changed. Now it has to be biopsied.\" A biopsy done in the mammo dept. is easy and fast. It does not require general anesthesia. I have had them done under a mammo, ultrasound, and even an MRI machine. The radiologist injects the area with a local anesthesia, and then takes a sample out of the area. I had two done this past Feb. Unfortunately, mine came out with abnormal cells, and I then had to have a surgical biopsy (benign). Please keep me posted, and good luck to you!",

I think because of my LCIS diagnosis and your diagnosis, they take extra precautions when we have our mammographies. I think that what may have appeared on your mammogram looked like a cyst on the ultrasound. Your doctor will have the reports and he will go over them with you. Believe me---if it looked like anything had the potential of being malignant, you would be headed for a biopsy, and not waiting for a year. Talk to your doctor, and then go out to celebrate!!!

      "Content": "Hi Harmoney, To begin with your doctor has to order the MRI. Then you have to find out if your insurance will cover it. Many do not cover it. From what I understand, MRIs are very sensitive and pick up any little piece of \"junk\" that is in your breast. Let me tell you my experience. Three years ago, I had had a mammo and and ultrasound. Both were negative. Because of my history, the radiologist recommended a baseline MRI. My insurance co. approved it. I had the MRI and it showed a small area of \"junk.\" That is what my doctor called it. No one knew what it was so I had a biopsy under the MRI. The pathology showed cells that were so abnormal that they were on the verge of turning malignant. The pathologist was afraid that some of the cells may not have been removed and that they may have turned malignant so I had a surgical lumpectomy. My pathology for that was a benign papilloma. I have to believe that the MRI saved me because those cells would have been malignant by the time I had my next mammo. I also believe that they must have gotten all the cells in the first biopsy. My doctor does not commit himself and says \"who knows what would happen. Maybe they would just stay abnormal and benign, or they could have turned malignant.\" So I don't know if my story helps or not. You have to trust your doctor and let him decide if he feels you should have one. If he does, make sure you go to a place that has a wide MRI where you go in feet first. My first one was a head in first and it was scary. The other one when I had the biopsy was done in a hospital, and I went in feet first--it made so much of a difference. Please keep me posted and good luck!",

The doctor who did the biopsy explained that it is important to have a wide surgical excision done because it is crucial that all the atypical cells are removed. Atypical cells can turn malignant even though they are in the benign stage now. You would not want to leave any of those cells in there. The surgeon will do a wide excision-which means that he will cut out the area until he gets a clean margin. In my case--the cells in the biopsy were highly atypical which meant that they were on the verge of changing over to malignant. The doctor was afraid that possibly a few cells could have turned. The final biopsy on the wide excision was totally benign--they had gotten most of the cells in the stereotatic!! I hope that you turn out the same. Please write to me if you have any questions!!

In 2006 I had microcalcifications that I had a Stero biopsy that was benign. Every year since I have had a normal mamogram. This year it showed new, clustered microcalcifications. The radiologist said they looked different. They are very small even with the magnifying glass. He said that there was a 70-75% that they were normal but if it was something this would be what I would want because it was small and slow. He said I didn't have to make up my mind then about the biopsy (but he didn't say how long I could wait) but I made an appointment to have it done right away. What do you think my chances are since he said they were different? If I have to have a lumpectomy what is invloved? Could this be early stage breast cancer and is there usually a good outcome to it? Thank you so much for your response. Sweetpea HI Sweetpea, I know what it is like to be nervous and upset by a mamogram. I have had biopsies for clustered microcalcifications quite a few times, and, fortunately, have turned out to be papillomas which are benign. My LCIS diagnosis was an incidental finding that occurred during one of these surgeries. My atypical hyperplasia was found on an MRI and not seen on a mamo or a sonogram. Did the radiologist tell you what was different about these calcifications? Is it that the numbers have increased in the cluster? A good sign is that he is not rushing you to have them removed. One time, I was told to come back in 6 months to see if there was a change. Those 6 months were so difficult for me because I worried day and night about what was going on. When I went back for a mamo then, the radiologist wanted a biopsy done because the numbers had increased even more. That one was also a papilloma. How I wished I had had it done 6 months earlier because it would have saved me so much anxiety!! You are doing the right thing having it done now and not putting it off. I wish you good luck. If you have any questions, please write me! I am sending you good thoughts for a great outcome!",

Hi, I have had this procedure done at least 3 times. Are you having it done under a mamo, ultrasound, or MRI? I have had it done under a mamo and MRI, and I think the procedure is the same for all of them. You are sitting in a chair. They locate the area that needs to be biopsied. The numb the area, and then the radiologist inserts a very thin wire into it to identify the spot for the surgeon. The wire is so thin that you can't feel it once it is inserted. Then they wheel you up to the operating room. The surgery is about an hour long, from the start to finish. You then go recovery for a short time. They wake you up, and as soon as you feel ok, you go home. Remember to ask the surgeon how the area looked, what does he think--questions like that--he can give you an indication, but not a precise answer. I was never in much pain. I think one time I took 2 tylenols, but that was it. I got my results about 2 days later. Good luck to you!",

I gained weight, had headaches, and terrible joint pain. I then was switched to Tamoxifen mainly because American Cancer said it was the choice drug for LCIS. I have to tell you, I had no side effects. In fact, I was sad to have to go off it when my 5 years were up! It is thought that taking these drugs after 5 years increases the breast cancer risk rather than decreasing it!

      "Content": "Try putting warm, wet compresses on it about 3 times a day. Wet a wash cloth with warm water, wring it out, and lay it on top of the area. When it gets cool, wring it out with more warm water. Do that for about twenty minutes. This helps the bacteria to come to a head and drain. Once it starts to drain, continue the soaks and wash the area with an antibacterial soap like Dial etc., to keep it clean. It is important that you wash your hands before and after doing the soaks and keeping the area as clean as possible. If you don't see an improvement then you need to see a doctor. I hope that this helps.",

But what I can share with you is the anxiety and apprehension that you are going through. This experience is so hard. I see that you are having the surgery tomorrow. Having had quite a few biopsies, I have learned to ask the surgeon after the surgery for his/her opinion. They can usually tell you their gut feeling from what they saw and felt during the operation. Please don't be afraid. The surgery is not hard. I have had wire localization done first in the radiology department. Then you go on to the operating room where you are given an IV with medication which puts you to sleep. The whole thing takes about one hour. As soon as you are fully awake, you go home. I had minimal pain and only took tylenol. I did have to wear a pressure bra for a week. The worse part of the whole thing is the stress and anxiety ahead of time. For some reason, I felt better after the surgery because the thing was out of my body. Please write me back if you have any questions. I wish you luck, and I will say a prayer for you! Good luck, sweetie! Carm",

I hope this time goes quickly for you. Try to keep yourself busy. There was always a weekend involved when I was waiting for biopsy results. For some reason, I was calmer because I knew that no one would be calling me with results on the weekend so I didn't need to stress out each time the phone rang! Take care of yourself, sweetie. I am thinking of you and saying prayers! Love to you! Carm",

      "Content": "Hi! Last year, I had a similar experience as you. I had a small area show up on a breast MRI that was not seen on a mammography or ultrasound. I had a stereotactic biopsy done under the MRI which showed severe atypia-cells that were benign, but were about to turn malignant. The radiologist called me and told me that I needed a wide excision breast biopsy as soon as possible to make sure that all the cells had been removed. She also called my breast surgeon and told him the same thing. I had the surgery, and, thankfully, the area was also benign. I think the radiologist wants to make sure all the abnormal cells have been removed and that you have wide, clean margins to insure that none of the cells have been left . Any cells that could be left in that area that are different could eventually turn to cancer. I would also suggest that you speak to your breast surgeon about the estrogen replacement. Because of previous diagnosis of atypical cells and LCIS, I took tamoxifen for 5 years. Tamoxifen is an estrogen blocker. In some women, breast cancer is fueled by estrogen, and taking an estrogen replacement is not good. You need to get advice about that. I want to tell you that the surgery was not bad. It was same day--I was in the hospital for a total of about 8 hours. I had very little pain and only needed a tylenol for discomfort!! I wish you luck, and if you have any questions, please ask!! Good luck, sweetie-you will be fine!",

Two years ago, I had a surgical biopsy of a suspicious area in my breast, which, thankfully, was benign. My breast surgeon told me that the pathology showed a marked decrease in the LCIS, which he felt was due to the 5 years of tamoxifen. In my case, the tamoxifen did its job!! Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Hi! About a year ago, I had an tiny suspicious area show up on a breast MRI that wasn't seen on a mammo or ultrasound. I had a biopsy under the MRI machine which showed severe atypia with cells that could potentially turn malignant at any time. Because the radiologist was unsure that all the cell were removed, I was advised to have a wide cut surgical biopsy to make sure all the cells were gone. I did that, and, thankfully, my results were benign. What I want to tell you, is that about 10 years ago, I had an area of calcifications that appeared to be benign, but because they were numerous in number, the area was questionable. I chose the 6 months wait and see instead of the surgical biopsy. During those 6 long months, I worried day and night each and every day. When I went for the mammo, the area was unchanged, but I chose to have the surgical biopsy just for my peace of mind. It turned out to be a papilloma which was a benign condition. The surgery was easy. I had to wear a bra day and night for a week. I couldn't take a shower for 2 days. I had very little discomfort-took only tylenol for pain. For your own peace of mind, do the surgery. If you have any questions, please ask me, and I will help you in any way I can. Good luck, sweetie!",
