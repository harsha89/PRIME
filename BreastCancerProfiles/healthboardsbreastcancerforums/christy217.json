    "Content": "Hi everyone, I generally post on the colon and rectal cancer threads, because I have colon cancer, I am newly 29, and they think that they have caught this at Stage I. I have surgery scheduled next Monday, to have my entire large colon removed, as this is definitely genetic-my mom died 8 years ago of it. Enough back ground info, this is my question, I just went and had a pap done and breast exam, I thought I was only a year out from my last one, but it's been since 5/04 that I haven't had one, I had issues before with having what I thought was a cyst on my left breast about 2 years ago, the ultrasound came back fine. When I went in last week, the 15th, the doc told me that she felt lumps in both of my breasts and that they were very dense-my age is to blame for that, she said the mammo will probably be inconclusive, but she wanted me to get a diagnostic mammo done because of the colon cancer I currently have. I have a mammo scheduled for this Thursday. I have read online that dense breasts makes cancer very hard to diagnose because of the density of the tissue. Has anyone else had this type of problem? I don't have any nipple discharge, a few weeks ago, my areolas went from a light brown to a bright pink on both breasts for a few days. I was getting iron intravenously for anemia, caused by the colon ca, so I didn't think anything of it, in fact, I just thought of it now and didn't mention it to her when I saw her. I had some tenderness around the bottom areola on the left breasts when she was examining me. Do you guys think I should be worried? Do you know anything about dense breasts? I am anxious here, I can't deal with two cancers at the same time. TIA everyone",
