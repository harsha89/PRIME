      "Content": "I had a mammogram two weeks ago. I got called to come back in because something about the compression of the muscle and tissue on both the left and the right side made it hard for them to distinguish whether I may have a problem or not. I spoke to my family dr. about this and he said that he doesn't think it is anything to worry about. He said a lot of times this is the type of call back you get if the pictures were unclear or they just want to compare something to be sure to rule something out. Ever since the call now I feel a lump on the left side. It seems to feel a little like a small rubbery thing. It moves around all over the place. Now I am scared. Has anyone gone through this?? Please respond. Thanks! Barb",

      "Content": "Hi! Thanks for replying to my post. It was a screening mammogram. The lady that did the mammogram had someone check to be sure they were okay before I left. She told me they were okay and I left. The lady that called back said that it says something about the compression of the muscle and tissue made something difficult. They didn't say anything about a cyst or fibroadenoma that I think I have on the left side. What do you think? Barb",

      "Content": "Thank you! I went back on this past Friday. After an hour and a half, they were able to tell me that I am okay and do not have cancer. Ugh! I am very thankful but boy did they scare me. They did another set of pictures and made me wait about 15 min. They kept seeing something against my breast bone but couldn't get close enough to rule anything out. Did more pictures still couldn't see after waiting another 15min. Then they called me in and did an ultrasound. They found a fibroadenoma. They had to discuss it with the doctor to be sure I was okay so another 15 min or so. Finally, they made do another compression set of pictures with a metal sensor stuck to the spot where the fibro. is. to see if it matched up. Luckily it did and they released me and said I am fine. I will go back in six months to see if it grows or not. I know that the waiting is very scary. More than likely you will drive yourself crazy. I would call them and ask if you can be put on a list to get the next available cancellation appt. That is what I did and I am so glad I did. I will keep you in my prayers too! Please post when you get some answers. Barb",

I dreaded it and expected the worst. I only really had about two uncomfortable days and the rest was nothing. I didn't take more than Tylenol once I was home. Good luck to you!! Barb",
