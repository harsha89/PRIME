    "Content": "Candice, I am almost the same age as you - I too will be 23 in a few months. Just to reassure you I get lumps in my breasts as well - mine have been confirmed as cysts by my doctor. I would, however, strongly advise you get a second opinion. I had a very good friend of my own age who did get breast cancer. Fortunately, it was discovered early so she is now clear of it. I advise you get a mammogram as soon as possible. Good luck, Rachael",
