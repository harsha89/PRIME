      "Content": "Discharge from nipples can be normal or abnormal...it just depends on the condition. Pregnancy, of course is the most normal, but regular hormonal changes can cause changes in breast discharge. You do not say your age or menopausal status, but it would not be out of line to ask your ob/gyn to take a look and/or sample for analysis. I have recently been diagnosed very unexpectedly with breast cancer...so I have spent the last couple of weeks learning everything I can about the disease and symptoms. They are so varied it is incredible. As women we need to not only do our monthly breast exams, but note any changes that are unusual in our breasts. So much in our breasts are controlled by hormonal response that recognizing some of these changes can be difficult, but I urge you and other women that if you notice any changes to please get a full work up. My cancer did not show up on mammogram at all. Ultrasound of the mass (I could feel a lump) showed it as a cyst. Only because it was biopsied were they able to realize that it was breast cancer...the surgeon was almost as surprised as I was by what was found. My personal advices...which I know is based on my personal experience...is that if you are uncomfortable with a change to see your physician. The cost of the office visit is well worth your piece of mind.",

      "Content": "I believe a \"structure change\" is an apparent size change in the various internal components on previous mammograms. This could be caused by a change in compression or a million other things. While I would not be scared to death, it is something that you do want to have repeated to rule out any temporary changes due to variances like pressure. Being upset will not help, but I know it is a natural reaction. Stay calm and focused so you can be relaxed when the do the follow up mammogram and get a nice clear picture. I hope everything goes well for you. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "A shock is a pretty mild way of pinning my reaction too. I feel like I got sucker punched...there was just no way that I thought in my circumstances that this could even become cancer. I guess like a lot of women who have no breast cancer history, I felt I was pretty safe...according to some of the things I have read lately something like 70% of the new cases of breast cancer are being diagnosed in women with NO family history of the disease. As women, I think we are all compassionate toward others even if we don't know them well when they get breast cancer. The problem is that as women, we are not as educated about the disease as we should be. This is such a complicated , and as my case proves at times illogical, disease that it is going to take more than Avon putting film of the latest breast walks on commercials. And pamphlets in the docs office don't even get picked up and looked at until cancer touches our lives and by then it can be too late. Looking at it personally now, I wish that I had started receiving information in elementary school at the same time that they started telling us about our periods. My daughter just took HS health class and while they discussed HIV and sexual dysfunction, breast cancer was not on the topic list. Don't mean to vent on you...but I am still in the \"angry\" phase now. Unfortunately, I think that if I had been better educated I might have made better choices so I am focusing a great deal of my frustration on the fact that I did not have better information...it is out there I know now, but if I can push just one more person to get that information for themselves I might be able to save them from what I am going thru now. That is my short-term goal...educate just a few people and hopefully they will push someone else to learn more too. No one person can save the world, but if I can help just one person catch it sooner...that will make my struggle worth it.",

      "Content": "I had a breast cyst removed yesterday. After surgery, the doc spoke to my husband and gave him the impression that this was not a cyst, but cancer. My cancer risk assessment (done prior to surgery) is only .4%, no lump showed on the mammogram, and an ultrasound showed no blood supply to the fluid filled cyst. My questions are as this...isn't cancer solid? That is what makes it show up on the mammogram. Doesn't a tumor (cancer, which is uncontrolled cell growth) require a blood supply so that it can grow? How can cancer be visibly identified from fluid? Anyone ever heard of a cyst actually being cancerous? Did my husband jump to all the wrong conclusions? He admittedly does not understand medical things and even less about \"women's\" medical stuff. The surgeon came out and spoke to me right after the surgery, so I was not as sharp as I should have been, but I don't remember the words cancer or tumor any place in the discussion. I now have to wait until I can reach the surgeon in the office, and while yesterday I just assumed my husband misunderstood, it is starting to prey on my mind that maybe I was the one mistaken. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Unfortunately, hubby was right. Yesterday I had a sentinel node biopsy. The entire cluster had to be removed because it was cancerous as well. Bone scan is scheduled for monday...PET scan to follow shortly to see if it has further invaded soft tissue and probably a gallium scan to check the rest of the lymphnodes. The cancer was also \"wrapped around\" the 3 primary sensory nerves of the arm as well. 2 nerves were completely removed and the surgeon \"scraped\" all the cancer from the last one since I am left handed and this is my left side. In 5 days my \"cyst\" has gone from a premenopausal irritation to a survival rate that is not very promising even with debilitating radiation and chemotherapy. All of this with an overall cancer risk assessment of .4% (average woman has a risk factor of 11%), no previous symptoms or family history, less than 2 months since the lump appeared and I am not even 40 yet. Needless to say, I am not feeling very optimistic at this point. All that to say that women really need to be aware that if a doc tells you it is \"just a cyst\" don't take his word for it. Get your butt to a surgeon ASAP!!!!!!! I don't know how much of a difference it would have made in my case, but I truly wish that when I first started having \"cyst pain\" a year and a half ago with no palpable lump my doc would have sent me in for extensive testing.",

      "Content": "GET TO THE DOC NOW!!!!!!! I found a cyst in my breast in the end of December. Went to the family doc right away. My family has no history of breast cancer on either side, but just to be sure he ordered a mammogram. The cyst did not show on the mammogram, so an ultrasound was done to confirm what it was. The ultrasound showed a fluid filled cyst with no blood supply, but just to be sure I was sent to a surgeon to have the cyst drained. I had biopsy surgery on Feb. 14th. The cyst WAS CANCER. My total cancer risk was assessed at .4%--less than a half percent of ever getting breast cancer in my life but now I do have it. I had an additional biopsy of the lymphnodes to see if the cancer had spread. 9 of the 10 nodes removed were already cancerous. I am now stage IIIa with an invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Everyone assured me that cysts do not become cancerous, but they are WRONG. I am not even 40 yet and am looking at the next 2 years of chemo and radiation to stop this disease from killing me. Please EVERYONE spread the word that CYSTS CAN AND DO BECOME CANCER!!!!! I don't want to scare you, but I would much rather that you be scared and then relieved instead of devastated as I have become. Please, please, please, check this out ASAP. Get a mammogram and an ultrasound and go to a reputable surgeon for biospy...it could save your life.",

      "Content": "Just a note, \"feel\" is really subjective. In my particular case, the cancer started near the chest wall...by the time I felt it the tumor was already over an inch in diameter. Larger breasted women will have a harder time feeling the growth since there can be much more normal breast tissue to cushion the area. According to my doctors best estimate, in less than 3 months the tumor grew and infected over half the lymphnodes in the area...I still do not know if it has progressed to anywhere else in my body. This also resulted in him having to remove 2 primary nerves in my arm....so nothing to fool around with. Ladies, it does not matter when you had your last mammogram, if you feel a lump at anytime go in and get it checked. Insurance will cover the second mammogram and other follow up diagnostic testing if it is because of the detection of a lump or mass. Sorry, but it is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry.",

      "Content": "I would get another doctor. 3 months is just too long to wait with any lump. A biopsy...either whole or needle...can be done with very little fuss. That is the ONLY way to be sure what you are dealing with. I hate to sound like an alarmist about this issue (of breast cysts) but I was completley blind-sided by my diagnosis of breast cancer...even the surgeon was surprised by how quickly the tumor had grown, but to my feel...and believe me I checked it once a week from the time I found it...the growth was not apparent. Only now am I learning how much damage this disease can do so quickly. Ladies it is your body...be proactive and get testing to know FOR SURE that what you are dealing with is only a cyst. Mammograms and ultrasounds are not enough...both tests told me I had a cyst, but in reality it was a very aggressive cancer. Learn to know your body...if you have \"lumpy\" breasts, then take the time to get used to exactly what your breasts, lumps and all, normally feel like. And the old wives tale that cysts hurt and cancer doesn't....FORGET IT! I had breast pain, that is what made me do the check...I was rubbing the area because it was painful...that is how I found the lump in the first place.",

      "Content": "Since no one knows what was on the films but the radiologist it would be unfair for anyone to speculate about what was found on them. I can tell you from personal experience that cysts can be cancerous. The only way to know for sure what is there is to have a biopsy done. Again, I am talking from personal experience here since I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer...but everyone saw only cysts on the ultrasound and a biopsy was done \"just to be one the safe side\". Call your doctor Monday morning...if the films have already been read he can find out what the report states even if the \"formal\" report has not been typed out yet. Find a reputable surgeon and have a full mass biopsy done...this is done under general anesthesia and does leave a scar...but it is the best possible way to fully rule out cancer. My personal belief, and my surgeon concurred, is that by doing a \"needle biopsy\" you are opening yourself up to spreading possible cancer cells thru out your body via the blood stream. Needle type biopsy will also take longer to get results and if the surgeon is not happy with the results you will have to have a full mass excision anyway...this will just lengthen the amount of time that you are upset and worrying...possibly for nothing. In my case I had breast pain that I just associated with early menopause and like you I had no way to describe it really well. I now know it was were cancer had enmeshed my lymphnodes and was pressing on nerves that was causing the pain and discomfort. If it will easy your mind however, breast cancer is usually not painful and gives little or no indication until a lump can be felt...which is why you should have your mammogram every year even though you feel fine. A side note ladies...my cancer did not show on a mammogram however, only as a cyst on the ultrasound. If you have the opportunity I would suggest that women have at least an ultrasound (generally a statement of \"breast pain\" will let your insurance pay for this) and if possible an MRI of the breasts and chest wall (this is however a very expensive test and you may have difficulty getting insurance to cover it on a yearly basis) since either of these tests give additional clear views of the breast tissue and in the case of the MRI a VERY good picture of exactly what is in the breast. Try to stay calm and give your doc a call. If he does not like something about your films then by all means do not \"wait and see\" for a few months if there are any changes. Make an appointment with the surgeon for a breast mass excision and then you will know what is going on in relatively short order...then you can move forward with your life. Good Luck!",
