      "Content": "Yes, that's my understanding. Inflammatory Breast Cancer should only show up in one breast. I saw a cancer specialist (the speed to which they got me in was a little frightening in itself!) and she told me she thought I had periductular mastitis. I didn't even know mastitis can affect women who aren't breast feeding, but it can. She said it could take a few months to heal, but compared to the alternative, I'll take it. I still have to have some imaging tests to confirm it's not cancer, but the doctor has seen many cancers and really felt this was not the case. Thank God!",

      "Content": "That's what I have. It started with an abscess or boil. I thought it was a normal boil and I should just wait it out. I had it for about three weeks when the area around it started to get very red and swollen. I was ready to go to the doctor, but peeled some dry skin off the top of the lump and the abscess burst. I thought, well at least that's over with. Two days later it was still ouzing stuff and the area around it was still red, so I went into the doctor's office. She told me it was an abscess with cellulitis and that if didn't get better I would be going in to the hospital. She also said as soon as the infection cleared, I would have to have a mammogram. I had no idea that there was a cancer that could do this, but now that I've read about it, I find it's the worst type breast cancer you can get. I'm really freaked out. I go back in today, and it really hasn't gotten better (it hasn't gotten worse either). I'm not so worried about going in to the hospital, I am worried about the possibility of the cancer. Has anyone out there got inflamatory breast cancer, and would you tell me your story?",
