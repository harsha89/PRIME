      "Content": "I\u0092m a 60 year old white female. All the following breast problems started just after Thanksgiving 2012 and seems to be getting worse daily \u0096 I had a mammogram two weeks ago (no lumps) and now my doctor has referred me to a breast specialist. My left breast feels heavy, swollen, sometimes feels warm inside, feeling of cramping and my nipple can be very itchy. Under my breast, when I pull my arms up over my head, a small dimple appears. I don\u0092t have pain but my breast always aches and feels heavy. Within the last couple weeks I have noticed my right breast has started having the same problems, also with dimples under my breasts my left breast., I also feel a pull from my breast to my armpit and from my breast up to my shoulder blade. I worry about breast cancer - on my mother's side several female cousins have had breast cancer, however, my mammogram showed no masses or lumps.",
