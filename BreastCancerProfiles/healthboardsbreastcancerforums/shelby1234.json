    "Content": "You are not the only one with fears of cancer, i too always feared uterine cancer because i had to great grandmoms that died of it at a very young age and i heard horror stories about it, but you have to realize with breat cancer you can do your own exams once a month and also we have so many early detection screenings now that if someone gets it, it really can be treated in most cases. I would just suggest for you to do your exams and try to relax alittle. God Bless",
