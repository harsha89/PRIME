      "Content": "Hello, I'm hoping someone can help ease my mind...even a little bit right now. I'm 43, have never had children, have large D-sized breasts and have always had yearly mammograms without problems. Today I received a call from my GYN's office asking to set up an appointment for an Ultrasound. I asked \"Why, is something wrong?\", and the caller said that my doctor recommended an Ultrasound because I have dense breast tissue. I asked if this is common procedure for dense breasts, and she replied \"Yes\". I asked if I should be worried, and she said that she was just a secretary, and asked if I'd like to speak to a nurse. I guess I was just in shock and felt as if I was overreacting, so I said \"No\", and arranged an appointment. Now it's 8:00 pm and I've been looking up dense breast tissue, and I'm not liking what I see. In fact, I'm getting very anxious and upset. I just called my doctor's office, and the after-hours voice message said that \"If this is an emergency, press 4\", and I hung up. I wish I had talked to a nurse earlier today, because now I have a lot of questions, uncertainty and fear. The day of my Mammogram, I was due for my period the next day. Prior to that day, my breasts had been swollen and tender all week. This was the first time that a Mammogram actually hurt, but I just considered it to be PMS. If any one has any advice or experience with dense breast tissue, I would truly appreciate any words of advice or reassurance. Is this just a precautionary procedure? Please help. Thank you!",

Only thing they say that with dense breast tissue, it is hard to read mammograms and they can see better with the ultrasound, I wish the ultrasound was the only test to get done, since it is painless. Mammograms are very painful for me. Word to the wise, do not go if you have your period or about to get it that will make it worse. Schedule your appointment 1 week after, it gives them a more accurate reading for mammogram. Good luck, sure you will be fine. I am in the same boat about the dense breasts. Thank you very much, Babygirl!!! I talked to my girlfriend last night, and she basically said the same thing. She also has dense breasts, was worried about having to have an ultrasound, said it was painless, and that every thing was fine and that I would be fine too. I will never again have my mammogram right before my period!! My gut has been telling me over and over that it is the reason why my breasts were so dense that day. I will also insist on an ultrasound, in addition to my annual mammogram, from now on!!! Thank you again!! I feel so much better!!",

Thank you for your advice and reassurance Rosequartz!!!! I'm living and learning a lot here, and then I'll be passing on all of this important information!!! I have never even heard about DBT nor how it could mask abnormalitities. I just wanted to add that I received a letter from my GYN today stating that my mammogram was normal, and also that it demonstrated that I have dense breast tissue, which could hide small abnormalities, and I might benefit from supplementary screening tests, which can include a breast ultrasound screening or a breast MRI examination, or both, depending on my individual risk factors. Boy, I really wish I had received this informative letter BEFORE I received the shocking telephone call!!! Right now I'm just feeling grateful and realize that life throws you curve balls once in a while, most likely to shake you up, teach you a lesson, and hopefully help you to appreciate your life more. This has been a real wake up call for me!!",

I truly appreciate your taking the time to share your experience with DBT. I can't believe how afraid and nervous I was and now since asking for advice on HB, I'm completely calm. I can't thank every one enough!! Thank you!!!!",
