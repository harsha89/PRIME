    "Content": "My mother was diagnosed as having breast cancer stage 2. Two lumps in her breasts and one lump in the lymph node. Treatment suggested is removal of the lumps by surgery followed by about 6 weeks of radiation treatment. The cost in Singapore for this treatment is 40000 US$. We are considering whether we should get the treatment done in India - Chennai. - What would be costs for something similar in India? - What would be the quality of medical treatment in India?",
