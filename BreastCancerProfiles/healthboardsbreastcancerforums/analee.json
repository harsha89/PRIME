      "Content": "i've never been so scared in my life. I'm 22 years old and two years ago i found small lump in my left breast. i've never done anything about it. the lump is still there, it's still the same size (it's the size of a dime). everything i've read makes it seem like i have a cancerous lump. it's always in the same place kinda stuck towards my chest area, it doesn't hurt at all. and i feel just fine all the time. no one in my family has ever had breast cancer. how likely is it that it's not cancerous?!! it's scared to not know but at the same time i'm so afraid to learn that it's something so bad you know.",
