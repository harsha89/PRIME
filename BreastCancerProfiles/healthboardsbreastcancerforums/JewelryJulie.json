      "Content": "Thanks. I also spoke with some women I work with who are older and they have had this before. I guess having so many cancer deaths in my family and so young freaks me out. I will have to wait nearly a month to get the results too as I can't get in for testing for a couple of weeks due to work demand. I just keep saying \"everything will be ok\" and then I will believe it at some point. Thanks for adding the response about the lady who keeps getting them. I guess since I just had a biopsy only 8 months ago, I thought I would be ok for at least a couple of years, but I guess not. To those who have been diagnosed and are treating: How frightening this must be for you. I wish you good health.",

I just had a cousin die of cancer at 44. I don't care what they think! I am not going down without a fight!!",

      "Content": "I have not yet been diagnosed with cancer. Just wanted to set that straight. However, I had a scare last year and had a biopsy of a tumor that turned out to be benign. (I still have this tumor.) I now have a new patch of \"lump\" that was discovered this am by my dr. I come from a family full of cancer (not breast, but every other type) and once someone has it in my fam, they die prior to being 50. (I am 38) I know I shouldn't worry as my last result came out ok, but my dr. seemed worried. How many lumps can one get that are merely lumps? What are early signs of breast cancer other than a lump? Thanks and best wishes.",

They said all is well. Also, my first lump hasn't changed in size or shape so I was happy about that too. Thanks for your support. It means a lot. Julie",

      "Content": "A couple of other considerations: I am unsure of your age, but it could deal with your menstrual cycle/hormones if you still have your ovaries. Another could be costocondroitis. This is essentially rib pain that feels like breast pain. I have experienced both types and now that I don't get my periods, I only have pain due to rib cartilage inflammation. My condition is closely associated with costocondroitis, it is called Tieze's Syndrome, which is inflammation of the connective tissue of the rib bones. It hurts bad. It also causes me to have trouble breathing due to my lungs being sort of constricted. I hope you get well soon.",

So, I didn't even need a biopsy just had a mamo and ultrasound and sent home ok. See? I kept worrying down to a minimum and it was ok. If it wasn't ok, at least I didn't have a week of anxiety before-so try not to freak out. I appreciate your caring. Best wishes, Julie",
