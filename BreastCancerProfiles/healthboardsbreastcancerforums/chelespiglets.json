    "Content": "Hello I am asking this for my mother, She has been on HRT for over 12+ years and they found during her mamagram a complex cyst 9mm in size. She is having it removed on the 11 the of this month. Question: Can a complex cyst be cancer? Or most of them non- cancer? They can not feel it when they check her, but it shows up in all the tests. Her last mam was normal. She is very worried, as am I. I truly in my heart do not feel this is cancer, but I want to know what the odds are that a complex cyst is cancer. Thanks for all you read and respond. Blessings Chele' ------------------ Good Bless our Troops",
