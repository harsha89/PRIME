    "Content": "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I started Arimidex today (adjuvant therapy for stage 1 breast cancer), which definitely depletes bone (it virtually eliminates estrogen). So, I am 57, osteopenia and osteoporisis diagnosis last fall, and I am starting Ezorb in the new few days--as soon as it arrives. I want to participate in a discussion on this topic. Has anyone been on Arimidex or other aromatase inhibitors and used Ezorb? Other products successfully? I have to take Arimidex for 5 years. Thanks. Annie17",
