      "Content": "I just had my first screening mammogram at age 41 and got a letter back from the radiology center 4 days after the mammogram stating that due to \"overlapping densities or other technical problems\" I must have another X-ray on my left breast. I have scheduled that for this Tuesday (5/25). These form letters (they must send them to patients by law I learned from the technician - otherwise they would only send the full report to the doctor and ignore the patient, I imagine) seem to be way too general to tell us anything. And it has been more than 1 week and I have not heard from my doctor's office where they should have gotten the full report by now. And I don't want to call them until the results of this next X-ray come in. But it is awful to wait, not knowing much and worrying! Can I assume my right breast looked OK? And are overlapping densities likely to be due to an abnormality? Or just lots of dense breast tissue? Thanks, Bev",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your information! I am glad to hear that sometimes needing a second look does not mean a problem is present and also that breast cancer can be caught in time with screenings. It does seem we have to take our health into our own hands and keep pushing and asking questions, like I will when I call my doctor to find out what the mammogram report says before I have my second set of X-rays tomorrow. Does anyone inist on seeing or getting copies of the mammograms or full reports? I would like to but don't know how to go about asking to see my records. Thanks, Bev",

      "Content": "Hello, I just want you to know that a lot of us are thinking about you and hope we can help in some way. [B] 1. Tiny nodular density - is that a lump...I can't feel it. /[B] This density area may be too small or be buried too deeply to feel. [B] 2. The last mammogram was (I am bad) five years ago. With it being so long can that be the reason that it has changed from the last mammogram?/[B] Don't be mad at yourself for waiting so long. Many tumors (if it even is one), benign and malignant, can grow extremely quickly. Sometimes a month or so is all it takes to go from nothing to a lump that can be detected and even felt. [B] 3. Found out I lost my insurance....any suggestions. I emailed the Breast Cancer network. Never got any reply back...but I read that they help abused and low income. What if you are neither...I am not high income either. Does this mean I have to ignore the situation...you and I both know that no insurance...no medical attention. Any suggestions?/[B] Keep searching resources like that one - I have known others who got help. They may take a while to get back to you. I will search for you as well. Ask your doctor, too - there may be free clinics near you. But don't let a lack of insurance stop you from getting care. I hope this turns out to be nothing. Let us know how you are doing. Bev",
