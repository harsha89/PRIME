    "Content": "Yes I have started the FO/CC (Flaxseed Oil-Cottage cheese) about 2 weeks ago. You can't go wrong with this, it is of great benefit to anyone, even people who don't have cancer. It supposedly works on any cancer, not just breast cancer. The two ingredients work synergistically, they have to be mixed well and eaten every day. For people with active cancer, the dosis is 2/3 of a cup low fat (1% or 2%) organic cottage cheese, make sure it is the type without preservatives and without growth hormones, I get mine at Wholefoods. Mix this with 6 tblspoons High Lignan Flaxseed Oil. The maintenance dosis is 1/3 or 1/2 cup CC with 2 tblsp. Oil. It tastes odd in the beginning, but it grows on you, once it is thoroughly mixed you can add berries, bananas, sprouts or anything. It is also very filling, if you eat it for breakfast, it will carry you thru to about 3 or 4pm.",
