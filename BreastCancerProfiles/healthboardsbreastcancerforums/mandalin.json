    "Content": "I have exactly the same problem starr92! i have been having pain in my left breast for the past week or so and recently found a small hard lump in it. I havent gone to the dr. for it yet so i'm very scared and worried about it. i also have pain under my arm! Also, my left breast feels slightly swollen and almost like there is a gel-like mass inside. i'm definitely not sleeping or eating either! i'm also scared to go to the dr. about it and what he might say. good luck with everything.",
