My ob/gyn aspirated it 3 times since then, sent out to lab, all ok but it still comes back! I made them aware of it for my mammogram last year, as a precaution, I have to go every 3 months for ultrasound of it. Now 6 months since there is no change. I too worry, I have my checkup in 1 month see what the doctor wants to do. I am told it is harmless cyst, very frustrating it keeps coming back. I would keep on top of it with the doctor & if they say keep getting it checked do so, it is a nuisance but better safe than sorry. I understand your worry with having a family history.",

I wish my dr. would send me for one, I just had my annual mammogram and had to go back for more pics in my left breast, they also did ultrasound and went over and over like you. They are puzzled, not sure what they see?? They claim they see something that was not there a yr ago, but I physically feel a tiny lump in the area in question. Instead of a MRI they are making me get a biopsy to see if it is benign or malignant. This scares the hell out of me. I have to wait till end of month to see a breast specialist. I hope she has some answers for me that the radiologist did not. Post when you get some answers next week. I pray it is nothing serious for you.

I worried but all was ok. Only thing they say that with dense breast tissue, it is hard to read mammograms and they can see better with the ultrasound, I wish the ultrasound was the only test to get done, since it is painless. Mammograms are very painful for me. Word to the wise, do not go if you have your period or about to get it that will make it worse. Schedule your appointment 1 week after, it gives them a more accurate reading for mammogram. Good luck, sure you will be fine. I am in the same boat about the dense breasts.",

I had a needle core biopsy yesterday, they numb you, you do feel pressure, I guess it took 10 - 15 minutes. Not bad. I get white coat syndrome so after the procedure I felt queasy, normal for me, I get like that after a blood test as well. My area in question was a different location that I thought. Spot with tiny cyst, she said was not of concern, another area was. So that worried me more. You go home with mini ice packs to put on and off for 30 minutes and put bandaid on the spot too. I didn't do ice after a few hours, I felt it put too much pressure on the area and hurt. I had some pain rest of day and they make you sleep in a bra for a night. Not sure if they do all the same stuff in Australia, but they also put a clip (marker) in the spot where biopsy was done for future reference. I should have my results by friday afternoon.

I will keep you posted, it helps talking to someone going thru this. To Meg: I was told it is a BENIGN condition called sclerosing adenosis. Condition that causes extra tissue to develop, it can make a mammogram look like exaggerated or distorted tissue, making it difficult to distinguish from breast cancer.

      "Content": "I am going through the same thing. I am 42, had my annual mammogram back in May and I have calcifications as well. I have a cyst that was aspirated a few times and it keeps coming back but sent to the lab and all ok. So this is the first time I ever heard \"calcifications\", I am told to go back in 6 months (Nov) for a follow-up mammogram. I am trying not to think or worry about it. Neither the mammogram place or my doctor seem concerned. They mentioned they are just checking for stability which I think they are doing for you as well. Keeping fingers crossed all ok for the both of us.",
