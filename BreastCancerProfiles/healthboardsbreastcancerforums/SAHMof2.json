      "Content": "Just wanted to give ya'll an update on my repeat Mammogram & ultrasound that I had to have today. And to thank leea for her support. HOpe I spelled that right. lol . I have to admit I was soo nervous! They had my mammogram pics from last week up on the board and I could see what they were talking about. there was a place that was easy to see. The tech did more mammogram pics and used a smaller \"paddle\" and squished the snot outta me. didn't really Hurt so much as uncomfortable. I asked her if what they found might be fibrocystic? and she said Well there is definetly something there boy that scared me! and made me pray even harder. Then I had to go back to the room and wait for them to come get me for the ultrasound. Seemed like forever! Thank God the ultrasound tech was so sweet and for a little bit couldn't even find what the Dr had been concerned about. Then found it. She kept saying that it looked \"Fatty\" to her. She finished and the Dr came in. she was really nice too. She took a look and told me that the place looked \"Smooth\" and was a Fibro-adenoma. or something like that. Anyway it is a cyst. She said that she wasn't worried about it. Apparently it was there Last year when I got my first baseline mammogram! but that breast center apparently wasn't concerned! She said she could see it on the old films and it didn't look like it had grown. She told me that if I was worried that they could do a Needle biopsy or wait for 6 months to come backin. Since she wasn't worried I opted to wait. I go back in in 6 months. Right after my birthday. I can't tell you what an incredible blessing I got today. I honestly feel like a huge weight is lifted off my head and shoulders. Thanks again for everything!!",

I went for my 2nd mammogram (first was a baseline) last year and they found a lump that concerned them. they had me come back in and they did Another mammogram and an Ultrasound. They found by the U/S that it was a Fibroanoma (sp) Begign thank God. In fact it was there at my First mammogram my baseline but that breast center never told me it was there. It is so deep that I can't feel it. The Dr told me that if I was concerned they could do a biopsy but she felt sure it was normal.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone i'm shelly. I'm 40 yrs old and I had a baseline mammogram last year with normal results. I had a mammogram tuesday and got a Call from the Breast Center yesterday saying that the Dr had seen \"Something small\" on my results and wants me to come back in next Tuesday to have another mammogram of my right breast and an Ultrasound. I'm beyond scared I don't have a family history of breast Cancer which i Know doesn't make me any safer from not getting it. I do have Fibrocystic breasts and i'm praying with all my heart that That is what the Dr saw. Does anyone have any encouraging words for me? I'd appreciate any and all prayers too. Thanks",

It was actually there 2 years ago when I had my first ever mammogram (baseline) but That breast center never said a word about it. He did say that If I wanted they could biopsy it but he wasn't concerned. SHould I be?",

Scared the crud outta me when I got the call to come back from more mammogram pics and an U/S. the Dr told me that it had Actually been there the year before on my baseline mammogram but That clinic didn't tell me about it. So I had to go back today for a re-check. The Dr told me that it had Not grown, Praise God! but I still needed to be checked every 6 months for a year to make sure it wasn't growing. Does that sound right? Does anyone have any experience with an Adenoma? Thanks",
