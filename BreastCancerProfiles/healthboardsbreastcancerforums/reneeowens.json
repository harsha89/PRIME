    "Content": "I also have calcifications. As I understand the statistics, at least 80% of the time, calcifications are benign. Many, many women have calcifications in their breasts and these are normal. It's when the calcifications are grouped in a cluster or they change that there is more concern. Mine have been stable for the three years that I have been having mammograms. Generally I have a bilateral mammogram once a year, then 6 months later have a diagnostic mammogram (magnified views) on the side with calcifications.",
