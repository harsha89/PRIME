    "Content": "I will start by saying that I dont necissarily think this is cancer but I am sure you guys here have seen many questions and different breast conditions posted on this board i was hoping someone could give some idea on what this might be. About 3 or 4 days ago I noticed a lump on the lower left side of my left breast. It was red so i thought it was a pimple so i have been putting ice and heat on it several times a day to see if if it would draw the fluid to the surface. Well of course it has not. Last night it was puffy all around the spot but that has seemed to gone down but it is a patch of redness looks almost like a burn. I have had shooting pains in my left breast for about a year and also my lymph nodes primarily on the left armpit get sore and painful like i did push ups lasts for a few days and goes away but always comes back in a couple weeks. A couple times it has happend on the right. I mentioned the pain to my dr and she did a manual breast exam and said she see nothing to worry about but the area wasnt swollen at the time either. I am 27 years old and have had a hysterectomy with ovaries left. I am not breastfeeding and I am not finding anything regarding my symptoms. I will see a Dr this afternoon but until then i would appreciate any info. Thanks =)",
