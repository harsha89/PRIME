      "Content": "Thanks for all the info everyone - it was very helpful. For MargyP - I notice you live in the UK? I am also British and I've lived in Greece for the past ten years. Here the health system is private so you basically pay for whatever you want. The doctors say that if you have a history of Breast cancer inthe family or if you have very large, lumpy breasts you should have a yearly mammogram after the age of 30. The same with smear tests, after 30 it should be one a year. I'm coming to the UK for a summer holiday and was wondering if I could get a mammogram done while I'm back home. If you say I should be over 65 then I've obviously got no chance! What do you reckon?",

      "Content": "Hi everyone This is my first post under 'cancer' I usually write under 'infertility' as I'm trying to get get pregnant. But I wanted to ask about breast cancer too - I have a history of breast cancer in my family, both my grandmothers have had one brest removed. All the women in my family are very heavy breasted including myself. About a month ago I noticed a milky substance leaking from both breasts - the doc said this was normal and I was probably high in 'lactose'. However, tests proved otherwise and the milky, pus-like substance is still there. My breasts are not painful and I dont think I have a lump (my breasts are so lumpy I dont know if I could detect an abnormal one or not). I just wondered if anyone else had experience of 'leaky boobs' and what it meant. Thanks, Nicky P.S. I know I should go for a mammogram (I'm 34 yrs old and never had one) but I'm scared of what that invloves too!",

      "Content": "About the diarrhea/period thing. I also have very bad diarrhea every month and my doctor (and several friends) have said that this is due to water retension - nothing else. I also had surgery to remove a large cyst on my ovaries over 2 years ago, but ever since then I have extremely heavy, painful periods. Along with the diarrhea cramps, as you can imagine, each month is hell. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about, but then, I'm not a dictor so it's always worth getting every little thing checked out. Had I spoken to my doctor a lot earlier, my cyst could've been removed without surgery so my advice to you now is always double check EVERYTHING!! Best of luck Nicky",
