    "Content": "Hello Friends, A couple of weeks ago I had a core needle biopsy for what several doctors told me was definitely a fibroadenoma, which is a benign mass. Much to the surprise of my doctors, the mass is not a fibroadenoma. The mass has mucin in it, and could either be a bad milk duct (I'm postmenopausal), or mucinous carcinoma. I will be having an \"Open biopsy\" this Thursday. They will be removing the rest of the mass and will make a determination as to whether it's benign, or cancer. This is all new to me. I would appreciate any information you could provide on what to expect after an open biopsy, as well as information on mucinous carcinoma. Thanks to all. Pegala",
