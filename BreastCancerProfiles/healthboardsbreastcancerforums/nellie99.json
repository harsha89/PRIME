      "Content": "Thanks Kalie. Yes, my implants are saline. I have made an appointment for a physical since my doctor has been hounding me about it anyway, and I've now had a three week long period (maybe that's why the lump was tender). I am 37 and haven't had a physical in 10 years, which is very stupid on my part. I just hate them, but then I think of how selfish it is not to have one because I have four kids and a husband who depend on me. At any rate, I go in on the 30th. You say that you had breast cancer. Was it caught early? I hope everything is going well for you:-) Nellie",

      "Content": "I have implants that are located under the muscle, and about a month or two ago, I found a hard lump in the outer side of my left breast. I've just blown it off and have never asked my doc about it because we are dealing with other health issues at the moment, and I never gave it much thought. However, I thought about it now because it is a little tender tonight. I guess I have just assumed it has something to do with the shell of the implant or something. Has anyone else detected a lump with implants? Thanks",

      "Content": "I have a swollen node located right outside the left breast area. I have had it for 5 months now, and thought I should just mention it to my doctor before I start the school year. I don't get too worked up about lymph nodes because I have a child who has had two reactive nodes removed. I thought my doctor would pretty much go the same route as we have gone with my son in the past - antibiotics and send me on my way. Unfortunately, he said he wants it out right away, and he got me an appointment with a surgeon within 4 days. Now I'm a little nervous and wishing I had never even brought it up. Has anyone here had a swollen node located in that area? How did it turn out?",

      "Content": "mindyp, I teach English at an alternative school, grades 9 through 12. We have workshops next week and start school the following week. I can't wait to get back into the swing of things. I had my appointment today. I really liked the surgeon. She did an exam, but she seemed to miss the biggest lymph node. She was way up in the armpit, and my node is quite a bit lower. However, there are also two that are swollen up higher that I didn't even know about. I didn't say anything because I will have a mammogram on Tuesday and see her after that anyway. She talked about doing a core biopsy or totally removing the biggest node, but I asked if we could just leave them alone if my mammogram came out clean. I really hate to mess with my lymph nodes if I don't have to. She said that if the mammo was fine, and I chose not to have any type of surgery or biopsy, she would need to see me every two months to monitor them. I can handle that. I guess now I just wait to see how the mammogram comes out. Do you know right away if they see something, or do I just wait for a phone call. I have never had one before, so I guess I don't know what to expect. My regular doctor did do a CBC and some liver tests and everything came back fine, so I am feeling pretty good about things. My biggest concern was having my nodes removed and having to worry about arm swelling. I'll keep you posted on things, and I would really like to hear how things go for you as well.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reply, MindyP. I am 41 and have never had a mammogram. I am a little bothered that I was sent straight to a surgeon. I meet with her tomorrow, so I guess I will wait to see what she says. Other than the swollen node, I have no remarkable or unusual symptoms. I saw my doctor about 4 months ago for some major ascites, like 20 pounds worth - yuck. All I wanted was some strong diuretics since OTC ones wouldn't work, but he refused to give me a prescription until I had an echo and a ct scan. They had to repeat the scan because they couldn't get a clear picture through all the fluid, but in the end, everything came back fine. Other than that, I haven't been to a doctor for about 3 or 4 years. I guess I was just a little surprised that we didn't go a \"watch and wait/antibiotic\" route with this lymph node. I hope everything goes well for you.",

      "Content": "mindyp, I had my mammo yesterday, and it wasn't near as bad as I thought it would be. Not that I'm skilled in reading films, but they had them hanging up on the screen, and I didn't see any foreign blobs of any sort, so I am pretty confident I will get the \"all clear\". I did hear them say that there were some calcifications, but I'm not worried about those. I drink coffee and Diet Coke from the time I get up until the time I go to bed, and I hear caffeine is the culprit when it comes to most calcifications. I am hoping my doc and the surgeon will now take the \"watch and wait\" approach with my glands. I will let you know when I hear anything. Hope all is well with you!",
