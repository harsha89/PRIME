      "Content": "Last November, while nursing my son, I discovered a lump in my left breast. It felt like and was the size of a small grape. I check every month and boom there it was. I immediately went to the OB and had a breast ultrasound. The results were it was an enlarged lymph node. I saw a surgeon too just to be sure and he agreed too that it was just a lymph node. Well, six months have passed - the lump would shrink and grow (no bigger than when I originally discovered it ) but now it hurts. My armpit and upper arm are sore too. I made an appointment for next month with my OB for a follow up. I have had a lot of medical issues this year...most recently the passing of my first and hopefully last kidney stone, a neurological work-up for facial and limb tingling (the doctors say its just stress/TMJ/anxiety). Had two MRIs (brain & Cspine) and numerous blood test checking for auto-immune and clotting disorders - everything was normal, except for my SED rate which when last checked was 37 (normal is 20). My SED rate has always been on the high side (30's) but neither my PCP or neuro is concerned about it. I have no history of Breast cancer in my family. However I have had Basal cell carcinoma/skin cancer on my face in Aug 2002. The dermatologist equated BCC with a pimple as far as skin cancers go, but to me I still had cancer and I'm afraid it will come back somewhere else. Everytime I have a pain I immediately think \"Oh no - its a tumor!\" I started therapy at my PCP's suggestion to deal with it, but its hard to separate a \"fear\" from a legitimate health concern. Has anyone else experienced this with their breast/health? What did you do?",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm a 37 yr old mom of two (4 yr and 19 mo). Just went to the ob/gyn on Tuesday. Dr. ordered baseline mammogram since breasts have changed (fibrocystic changes) since pregnancies. I think he ordered it more for my peace of mind. Anyway, I've read that if you have fibrocystic breasts that mammogram isn't the best - that ultrasound is better. Anyone else heard this? The imaging center explained that they do a mammogram first and if they find anything, then they do an ultrasound of the suspicous area. I had a breast ultrasound last Nov. because I found a lump - it ended up being a lymph node. My first mammo is scheduled for July 19. Any input from those with experience would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi. It could be a lymph node. That happened to me last Nov. I was nursing my son and discovered a soft grape sized lump in my left breast. Because I was still nursing and have fibrocystic breasts, I had an ultrasound - the radiologist told me it was just a lymph node. It has shrunk and grown (no bigger than originally felt) over the months. It hurts from time to time (does now). I'm going in for a follow up next month to check it out again. If it is any comfort, the doctor told me that if it hurts its likely not malignant. It could be hormonal. The surgeon's see this stuff all the time. I'm sure they will be able to give you a definative answer. I know what you mean about not being able to sleep or eat. I felt the same way too when I was waiting to get my ultrasound. The waiting is the worst. But the stress and worry take their toll too. Look at it this way, you're taking the proper steps to find out what's going on. Try not to freak out - I know its hard to do when you're worried. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I just had my first diagnostic mammogram this past Tuesday. After 4 hours, during which I received 2 mammos and 2 ultrasounds I was told by the head of mammagraphy of a major and well respected Los Angeles hospital that there was nothing to worry about. I had 4 benign looking lymph nodes in my left breast. I was instructed to return in 3 months for another ultrasound to their check size - the largest was 5mm and to come back at 6 months for another mammogram of the left breast. My OB/Gyn, who sent me for the mammo in the first place, called my yesterday and agreed I show do the follow up. I asked him, if they are just lymph nodes, why all the follow up. He said they're being overly cautious. I asked him if a lump that appeared to be a lymph node on imaging could indeed be a cancer. He didn't really answer me but suggested I follow up with a surgeon for a second opinion. I'll be seeing the head of the Breast Center at the same hospital next month. I would rather be safe than sorry, but I am afraid I could be opening Pandora's box if I start screwing around with normal lymphnodes. Has anyone been told its just a lymph node only to find out later it was cancer? I first discovered this lump in NOv 2004. I had an ultrasound and surgical consult then - the findings - just a lymphnode. During the mammo, it was discovered that the lump(lymphnode) I felt was actually 2 lymph nodes close together and that there were another 2 lymphnodes that I could not feel higher up on the same breast. I want to do the right thing. Should I demand a biopsy? What is the best sampling method for a suspected lymphnode? Any information/input would be appreciated. Thanks.",
