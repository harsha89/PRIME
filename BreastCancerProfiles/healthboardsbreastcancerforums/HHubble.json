    "Content": "I have been on Arimidex with monthly zolodex shots for 3 years now. I do get bone ache (and thankfully it's just an ache, not that terrible). I was amazed to find that taking a daily calcium with vitamin D tablet works wonders for me. It takes a couple of weeks before I see an improvement, and if I stop taking them I start to feel the ache again after a couple of weeks. This may not help with your severe bone pain but it may be work a try.",
