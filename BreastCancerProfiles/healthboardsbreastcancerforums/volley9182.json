    "Content": "about 3 weeks ago i got the red spot of my breast. i didn't think anything of it, just thinking that it was a spinder or some kind of bug bit. Then like 2 more weeks had past and it didn't go away. in the back of my mind i think that it might be cancer, because i tan and everthing, but not really worried about it. The wierd thing is that i am only 18 and i think that i am to young to develope a tumor or anyhting. I showed my mom and she didn't seem concerned either. But the spot peels, but never regains it color, always stays red, and never goes away. it kinda feels like a pea. does anyone think i should go and get this looked at. Has anyone heard of anything liek this before. Please help. I am just looking for some answers. thanks kelly",
