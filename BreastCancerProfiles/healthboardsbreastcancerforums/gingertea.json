      "Content": "I'm 54 and also peri-menopausal. (STILL!) Three months ago I found a lump in my right breast. My breasts are very dense and lumpy, but on self examination this one felt different. I saw my primary doctor and she had me make appointments for a diagnostic mammo, ultrasound, and referred me to a breast surgeon. I talked to the radiologist after the exams and he said the area where I felt the lump was thickening of the breast. The ultrasound showed another very small lump, probably a cyst. On my left breast they took several xrays because they found a spot of calcifications. He said everything was probably benign and I should be re-examined in 6 months. Sound familiar? Both he and my primary doctor encouraged me to keep the appointment with the breast surgeon because they thought she would be a better judge, being she was used to seeing patients with breast lumps. She did another ultrasound on the right breast and measured the lump, and looked at what was probably a cyst and measured that. She wanted to see me in three months, (not 6) which turns out to be this Wednesday. In the meantime a pea-sized lump has turned up on my left breast.....luckily she has an ultrasound in her office and will be able to look at that, so I don't have to wait forever. I know the radiologist is perfectly competent, but I feel more secure having the surgeon take care of things because it's more of a one on one approach. My mother also had breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and lived for 5+ years cancer free. Unfortunately, she then developed lung, brain and liver cancer and did not survive. Her doctors say the cancer was not related, but I question that....she never had radiation or chemo after the breast surgery. Because you have a family history, you might want to consult with a breast surgeon. Your primary care doctor can give you a referral. I felt better after the appointment.....mostly because if I do have to have a biopsy, or lump removed, I'm familiar with the doctor.",

      "Content": "I had my regular mammogram on Tuesday 3/19 and my doctor called me the same evening to tell me the radiologist wanted me to come in so he could get a magnified view. I've had an area of calcifications for several years, but after checking them out the first time, I haven't had them questioned since. Also my doctor found some thickening tissue on the same side. That's also something I've had checked out before on the other breast and it was no more than thickening tissue..normal for me. Am I right in thinking microcalcifications cannot be found with a normal breast exam, only detected with mammogram? I'm thinking the calcifications and the thickening must be two different things, and the radiologist didn't say anything about thickening. I do self checking exams and the area did not seem thick to me. Felt like the same old ropey feeling tissue I always have. If the calcifications look the same thru magnification will that rule out a biopsy? My mother had breast cancer, so I appreciate that they question any abnormalities. What I don't want to do is have unnecessary radiation to keep checking out the same old problem.",

      "Content": "A bulky uterus can mean alot of things......not necessarily cancer. It could be that the endometrial lining is building up for your next menstrual cycle. With my first transvaginal ultrasound they found a bulky uterus and a mass, so they said to come back after my cycle. After my cycle, the ultrasound showed the mass and bulkiness were gone. They figured the mass had been a blood clot and passed with the rest of the uterine buildup. The second ultrasound was clearer and found fibroids and ovarian cysts. The third ultrasound showed one cyst had ruptured and another growing. So, I am going to have another ultrasound in a few weeks. Things in that area change from month to month, so it's best to watch it, before trying anything drastic. Cysts are more common in women of childbearing years, and disappear lots of the time. They are a little more concerned when a woman is menopausal. I am just beginning to have irregular cycles (I'm over 50), so they are just watching the cysts for now. It's so nerve-racking, never getting a firm diagnosis....just another test. Good luck, I hope everything turns out fine.",

      "Content": "I found a lump last November and got in immediately for a mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram didn't show anything......the ultrasound showed a prominent ridge and also 2 cysts. (I hadn't felt the cysts.) My GP wanted me to see a breast surgeon. I saw the breast surgeon, she felt the problem area, did another ultrasound and said we could wait 3 months and have a re-check. Things were about the same at that visit so I had a repeat mammo/ultrasound three months later. (6 months by now) That mammo/ultrasound showed one of the cysts disappeared and the ridge was 'stable', so they didn't do a biopsy. I go back in 6 months for another mammo, so obviously they aren't too worried about the length of time. My Mother had breast cancer, so I know they are watching closely. The surgeon said MOST cancers grow slowly. I don't know whether the mammo diagnostic place is equipped to do a biopsy with the ultrasound.......the breast surgeon would have done it in her office if it was needed. Hope this helps....good luck to you!",

A couple of weeks ago, I found a lump in my right breast....it felt totally different from any of the other 'lumps'. I saw my doctor today and she wanted me scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound, and wanted me to see a surgeon. Luckily I was able to get all the appointments within three weeks. (My doctor was hoping for 2 weeks.) I guess nothing happens all at once. They will use the mammogram and ultrasound for evaluation, but no treatment is done until you have a consult with the surgeon. If your regular doctor performs surgeries, I imagine you would stay with that doctor. Mine does not do surgeries. That is as much of your question I can answer. I don't know anything about the diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound, or anything about biopsys or needle aspirations. I guess the type of lump they find, determines the outcome. Mine is about 4-5 centimeters and firm, but it moves around a little and is not fixed. I would love to have some info on what can be expected at each visit. If anyone has any answers, I'd be glad to read them, too. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "My mom was diligent with her mammograms and clinical breast exams. Even so, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. She lived past the 5 year mark and was considered cured. Unfortunately a few years later she developed cancer that spread quickly...lung, brain & liver and did not survive. My sister and I have mammograms and clinical breast exams every year and also do self examination. This year the radiologist saw microcalcifications in my sister's breast and called her back for another look. They ordered a biopsy and it came back positive. It is the same type of cancer my mom had. It's in a milk duct so neither she or her doctor ever felt any type of lump. Luckily, it showed up on the mammo. I've been recalled more than once for microcalcifications. Last year I was called back for a diagnostic mammo because of the darn things. This year my report came back normal, no call back, no problem! I had a doctors appt today just to discuss my blood panel. I mentioned my sister developed cancer, the same type as my mom's and both my doctor and the radiologist she contacted agreed that I needed to have an MRI even tho my mammo I had a month ago was normal. Has anybody else dealt with this? Is an MRI overkill, or should I just go and get it over with? By the way, none of us has been tested for BRAC1 or 2. Thanks for any thoughts on this. I have a few days to think about it.",

Even though it is in an early stage she will be having radiation therapy after the surgery. Did your surgeon mention radiation? It could be that removal of any lump is called a lumpectomy. I'm no doctor, but I thought an excisional biopsy was when the lump was removed and sent to pathology for testing. I think my bigger concern right now would be why your surgeon is evasive in answering your questions. You have every right to know exactly what is happening with your body!",

Why is it that our doctor's feel comfortable waiting?....Their patients sure aren't comfortable being left in the dark.

I did read somewhere that when someone discovers a lump in the breast big enough to be felt, it more than likely has been there 8-9 years.

      "Content": "I had my diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound last week. The lump I found on the right breast is a solid mass and the radiologist classified it as probably benign. The ultrasound detected it and found it to be solid. It measured 7 x 4 x 5 mm, and could be felt by all the techs. Strangely enough it didn't show on the mammogram. Probably because I have dense breasts to begin with. They found a small cluster of 3 microcalcifications on my left breast, and took several pictures of those. The radiologist also classified those as probably benign, so both abnormalities are classified as Bi-Rad 3's. The radiologist wants a re-check in 6 months. My regular doctor wants me to keep the appointment to see the surgeon, and let her make the final determination. Is it usual to follow-up with a surgeon after getting a probably benign diagnosis? Has anybody on this board had to have a biopsy or surgery with a probably benign diagnosis? My mammogram less than a year ago was clear, so these are new abnormalities. My Mother had breast cancer at age 58, so I wonder if they are just being cautious? I am a big wimp when it comes to needles, so the thought of a biopsy gives me the creeps.
