    "Content": "Four months ago I found a large lump in my breast and had a ultrasound done and doctor did a biopsy but could get no fluid out to biopsy. Now four months later I went for another biopsy and the cysts has shrunk but there is something inside the lump growing and it could be a tumor (there guessing). My doctor is sending me to a surgeon to have it removed but I am scared to death!!! I don't know what to expect! Can they do that in the office or is that a hospilization surgery?? Please help! I just turned 30 nov.8 and have a 7&10 year old children. My grandmother went in 35 years ago to have a lump removed and woke up with no breast! That is really scary! If it cancer go ahead and take the darn breast I don't care because I need to be here for my kide, breast or no breast! I think it is the not knowing I am scared of. Please, anyone who has had a lump removed please let me know your experience and what to expect. I would really appreciate it! Thank you!",
