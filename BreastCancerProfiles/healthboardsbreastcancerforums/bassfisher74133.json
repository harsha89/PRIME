      "Content": "So I started having this odd burning pain on my right pectorial (feels like a bad sunburn) followed by very sensitive right nipple then under my right arm (armpit to ribs area) it feels like a deep bruise followed by upper shoulder blade back pain, my wife looked at it last night and the right pectorial is noticeably swollen... wife is due to give birth in a few weeks to our second child... with me being the breadwinner of the family this has us all very concerned. Does anyone have any thoughts? Wifes said the right nipple does not feel like the left at all so yeah I'm worried. We are scheduled to go to the doc later this week but later this week does not help me sleep at night any input would be much appreciated",
