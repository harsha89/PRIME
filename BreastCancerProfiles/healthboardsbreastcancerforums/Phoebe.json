      "Content": "It seems so strange posting on this board! I had a mammogram on 9/9/03 and had not had one in probably 2-3 yrs. The call from the Breast Clinic said that they saw a questionable area in one breast. They wanted to do an Ultra Sound, but said they leave it up to me. They are waiting on my older films to arrive from Atlanta that did not go off in time and still have not arrived to compare. I am frightened! I have had a spot in this same area of this breast to be sore for many years, but now I am 52. Things change as you get older, so I am thinking that the area that once may have been totally benign could now not be so. I have no insurance and am looking for a job. So getting the Ultra Sound may be impossible, and if treatment were needed I couldn't afford that either. I'd like to know your thoughts re the mammogram and the changes hat can occur with age even if totally benign. They said nothing specific, but I plan to call them tomorrow since I gave it a couple of days for the films to get here. Phoebe",

      "Content": "Thank you for responding. I was able to get the mammogram in the first place because I saw an ad on TV regarding a grant to be used for m'grams for women of a certain age range. I qualified for that and spoke with the nurse today who did my breast exam and scheduled my mammogram. She told me that she still had not received the report, but the same program would cover the US if the Breast Clinic suggested it. The tech at the Breast Clinic where I had it done is who mentioned the US. I will contact them tomorrow and see about scheduling one. Maybe it is nothing, but I am glad to know that the US is available. Atlanta never did get the films here, and it's been 2 weeks since they were sent. Thank you again for responding, and I will keep you posted. Phoebe Addendum 9/25- I have an US scheduled for tomorrow. I am scared and very alone!

      "Content": "I just got back from my US. They did two more mammogram views afterward and said it was a lymph node. I could see the tiny white spots in it. I have to repeat it in 6 months. Lo and behold! My films from Atlanta finally arrived this same day so the doc could compare. That sore place has been there for many years, but this is the first time anyone has ever mentioned it. Seems like someone at some point would have told me there was a lymph node there. Then I could have told the tech this time. My Uncle's partner was my Gyn for many years. Thank you all so much for your support and for sharing your stories. Phoebe",
