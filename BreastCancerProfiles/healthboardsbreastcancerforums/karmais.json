      "Content": "Hi all I've posted on other boards about my own health concerns. I'm on this board now to maybe get some info to help my grandmother. Apparently she has had a mammogram and has been told the lump she has must be removed by lumpectomy. Dr apparently told her that if she doesn't \"it\" will spread to her liver and she will die painfully. Grandmother is now saying she refuses to have any kind of surgery and if she had a gun she would use it on herself. My questions are these: Should she have had a fine needle biopsy before a lumpectomy is recommended? That's what they did to me (I was 31 though, not 89). Wouldn't a fine needle biopsy show clearly if a lumpectomy is needed? And also, what will the rest of her life be like if she does nothing? Her Dr says \"painful and sick\" is he right? He said stuff about \"it\" going to the liver and then ....whatever. She is very difficult to talk to. Last time she had invasive surgery (when she was 80) she told us all that she had had a hysterectomy and she had not. She had keyhole surgery and they removed an ovary and did a D&C. However, she really believes she had that hysterectomy and so I have to nod and pretend to believe it. Just like I'm doing now. Which is why I can't belive a Dr would recommend a lumpectomy and a general anesthetic on an 89 year old woman without first doing a fine needle biopsy. Or could it be that the mammogram was just \"really conclusive\" and so the Drs know what they are talking about?",

      "Content": "I also wanted to thank you for the advice about me being an advocate for my grandmother. Unfortunately, even though I am a professional working woman and almost 40 years old, to her I am and will always be a child. She doesn't care how many university degrees I've got, to her I'm still \"just a girl\". So no, she absolutely refuses to even *listen* to me about anything kwim? I am going to visit her (she lives in another city) in about 12 days so maybe she will talk to me then.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all your replies. Here is an update for you. My Grandmother saw her Dr this week. My mother gently encouraged her to go back and at least *discuss* treatments. Dr then referred Grandmother to the breast cancer surgeon. The breast cancer surgeon has said that he does not want to do surgery due to my grandmother's age. He has written her a prescription for Armidex. Grandmother will have a cone biopsy next week (can someone tell me the difference between a cone biopsy and a fine needle - I've had a fine needle and it was only slightly painful) and then I suppose her Drs will know more. I have read about Armidex on the net and on this board. I just didn't want my grandmother to do *nothing* at all. My thinking is that if it is a late stage cancer doing nothing and just waiting and having no medical support (which was what my grandmother orginally was going to do) would be more than painful for *her*.At least if she's seeing this breast cancer Dr he will supposedly know about the medications that can help or at least make her more comfortable. Y'know, she has never had a pap smear or a breast exam *in her life*. I don't know how she managed to get away with that for so long. My Dr practically wrestles me to her table every year and makes me have my exams. Thanks guys.",
