      "Content": "I think the previous post was in response to the person who responded to me, but I will give an update. Since mammogram, sonogram, attempted ductograms, blood work, and slides did not show anything, I was sent to a breast surgeon. She thought it could be duct ecstasia or intraductal pappiloma, but my symptoms did not really fit perfectly with either one. I was told to not do any squeezing on the nipples for a while, that perhaps all the exams and things had made the situation worse. I am to see the surgeon again in about 6 weeks and see if the discharge is still there or has completely stopped. It still seems strange to me. But I do not plan to ignore it. Thanks to those who offered responses.",

      "Content": "Just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on what you would do if you were in my situation. I started having nipple discharge quite suddenly 2 weeks ago -- clear on one side, bloody or dark on other side. Have seen GYN who took slide sample and did blood work for hormone levels. Have done diagnostic mammograms and sonograms -- no masses or suspicious areas were seen. Tried to do bilateral ductograms yesterday without success. In the meantime, the secretions have diminished to almost nothing... but still there. I'll probably get a call from my GYN about the slide sample and to find out if he has any additional ideas. I'm 65 and have never had anything like this before. If you were me, would you ask for any additional tests or consultations? Or just wait and see? Thanks in advance.",

Is it safe to leave them alone after getting a diagnosis? I think that IP is going to be my diagnosis and I'm wondering if it is safe to ignore, at least for a while. Thanks.",

If you will look at the many others posts on this board and do other online research, I think you will that your situation is very, very common. Since this is your first mammo, they do not have anything previous to compare it with, so being cautious and thorough is what you want. I do know about spending a long weekend with worries that something might be wrong. For me, it helped to do research and to find that the chances of something being wrong were very slim! Best wishes. I'm sending up a prayer for you.",

However, I see patient comments on several places online which describe terrible pain. Can anyone share your experience? Do they do anything in the way of local anesthetic? Am I going to feel like driving home afterward? Thanks.",

      "Content": "Didn't get any replies on this, so I'll share a little of my experience. They did use a topical numbing agent and hot compresses to prepare me. The radiologist tried 3 times on each side to insert the needle/catheter thing into a duct. Unfortunately, he was unsuccessful and we were forced to give up. The pain level was bearable. It kind of reminded me of times in the past when they were trying to find a blood vein and couldn't. It was not bad enough to keep me from doing it again if necessary. I can't report on pain level if they had been able to inject the dye. That might be a whole 'nother story. Posting a different question now that I hope to have some response to. Thanks again.",
