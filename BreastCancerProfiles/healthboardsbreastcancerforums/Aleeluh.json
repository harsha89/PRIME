    "Content": "Hi everyone this is my first time on these boards, im in need of some advice. I have found a reddish/sometimes purple/black place on the under part of my breast it has been there for about 4months. I went and saw a doctor three months or so ago, she said \"its a bruise you prob hit it on something, if it doesn't go away in a week or so call me..I knew I hadn't hit it on anything but she is the doctor not me\"<== she didn't seem to worried. The place didn't go away in a week , so I decided to give it a few more days and it never disappeared, so I called her again.. the same doctor was suppose to make me an appointment with a specialist for something else and still hasn't, all and all she just doesn't seem to care. I have recently been looking for a new doctor. =( The place hasn't went away in four months so it is not a bruise. maybe some of you can give me some information or input, it really has me worried. Thanks in advance everyone.",
