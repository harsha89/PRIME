    "Content": "A little history ...about 4 years ago I found a pea size lump in my right breast, closer to the underarm area. While, at my gyno I mentioned it and she sent me for a mamogram. They read the results there and said everything was fine, from what I can remember it was fibroid or something of the sort. My doctor got the results and reitterated to me, nothing to worry about. .......Forward to 2 years ago, when I noticed a hard mass, again on the right breast, kind of next to the pea size lump but running towards the nipple. I asked my gyno at this time and he felt and stated there was nothing to worry about, I had already had the mammogram and that I was \"too young to worry about such things\" ........Now yesterday, I went to the gyno for my yearly, I ended up seeing the woman in the practice and when she felt my right breast her face went wierd, and she asked if I do \"self breast examinations\" ...when I told her that yes, I do and that I was aware I had a lump ...blah blah ....she said she wanted me to go for a breast ultrasound right away. What does \"thick breast tissue\" mean? I am so scared !!!",
