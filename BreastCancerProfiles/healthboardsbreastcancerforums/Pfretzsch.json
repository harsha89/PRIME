      "Content": "Caroline - I like your plan to get a second opinion at Duke. Sunshine - The MRI sounds like a good move. They can apparently tell a lot. For me it is more waiting, at least for a little while. The surgeon said that the pathology reports jive with what was seen on the mammogram but then we are left with the missing calcification in the biopsy specimen. She said that a calcification could have been picked up but than have gotten washed away. So I am supposed to get a comprehensive mammogram on my right boob and they are going to look to see if there are any calcification missing and they are going to check where the titanium marker was left - whether it was left at the site that was to be biopsied. If this doesn't pan out, then I have to go for an excisional biopsy. This is adding up to as lot of radiation exposure and bucks over a fleck of calcium.",

It is also my understanding that the anesthesiologist is the ruler when it comes to his or her specialty. A doctor can have a preference but it is your health situation and the surgery that determine what is used. I understand that nowadays, an anesthesiologist administers the drugs initially and then a certified nurse anesthetist takes over from there. However, the anesthesiologist must be in the area in case something happens. I would definitely call the hospital where you would be going for the procedure, tell them what you will be having done, and perhaps they can hook you up with someone from the very team that would be assisting. Nurse anesthetists are quite informed and take a lot of pride in their work.",

      "Content": "Illinois Gal, What you may not realize is that there were a bunch of us that were experiencing the same journey for quite some time. I believe it mostly started with mammograms that showed microcalcifications. A couple of these ladies started the journey in mid February, I started mine in early March. And what we also had in common is that it was taking forever to find out what it was all about. Waiting for biopsies, waiting for results, waiting for appts with surgeons, and even more biopsies and mammograms and then more appts with surgeons. A couple of us had biopsy that either didn't suceed in obtaining tissue or it wasn't exactly the right tissue. Or the biopsy didn't tell the entire tale and there was still more to be found out. I think at least two or three of us still don't have an answer. We were all hoping and praying that the group of us would get lucky. We are all saddened by this news but I for one just have to rejoice that it was an early catch. I plan on following all of our stories and continuing to take comfort in not feeling alone with my 2-month saga. So our gratefulness is not a minimization of a BC diagnosis, but rather trying to stay strong and continue this difficult journey together. Welcome to the boards! This is a great group of people!

She apologized for not being able to be there for me with regard to my breast issues like she would have wanted to, but she gave me a great gift. One of my biggest fears in life was getting cancer and having no one there to be supportive. But over these last three months, I had to take care of myself but my parents were still there, but it was sort of like being alone with my health issues because my dad was wrapped up with taking care of my mom. So I did learn that I could emotionally handle serious health issues myself and that there are people out there - including on this board - that can provide the support that I need.

I had a mammogram with a 1-cm lump which is enough of a worry in itself but I also have microcalcification and heterogenous something or other. I got the ultrasound-guided core biopsy on Thursday and they said I would get the news in three days. I am scared and alternate between trying to be ready for whatever results I hear and terrified crying. It seems that the results are not always cancer vs. no cancer. And some of the results still need to be treated by excision or they need to be watched and could turn into something bad. I am single and wish I had a significant other who doesn't care about breasts, but that is not my situation. Breasts are not that important to me but relationships are and I am afraid if I end up being one-breasted or grossly lop-sided (my smaller breast is the one with the problem) someone will think I am freakish. And I don't want all kinds of surgery just to please someone in the future. It helps knowing that I am not the only one going through this but the reality is that whatever the results I probably am going to have to continue dealing with this and I am pretty stressed out.
