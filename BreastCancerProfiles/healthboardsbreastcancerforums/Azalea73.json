    "Content": "Can anyone help my friend who is in much discomfort. She believes this is caused by muscle pulling against scar tissue. She is very depressed and living on her own means she thinks a great deal - making the problem worse. She feels like she is being pulled down on one side and this effects her walking and balance. Doctors send her to various specialists and pain clinics, and cortisone injections seem to help a little. Has anyone any advice or suggestions. Would acpuncture or massage help? She is looking to me to find some solution to her problems by coming onto the web. ANY IDEAS WOULD BE MOST WELCOME tHANK YOU",
