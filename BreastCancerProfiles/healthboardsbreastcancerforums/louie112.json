    "Content": "i have just noticed sveral reddish browinish bluish spots on my labia m ajora. they were not there a few months go. they are varrying in size from a pin head to an eraser tip. I am very frightened because lately my clitoris has been itchy however there is nothing there that I can see. that is why i was looking to see if something was there. i donot gt regular paps as I have not been sexually active for 20 years. yes i know this is a bad thing. Anyone with similar situation?",
