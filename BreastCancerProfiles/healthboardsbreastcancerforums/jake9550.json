    "Content": "bella i am not sure if that is normal to feel them in that place like that or not, but since you have had nodes removed before i would call doc and have them check, i have done alot of reading on womans cancers ect... and vulva cancer is very rare opposed to the other kind, i only ever knew of one person to have that type of cancer and i have been in the healthfeild for awhile. I also know that we have nodes all over our bodies and sometimes they get bigger for whatever reasons but i am sure you are fine just give yr gyn a call and keep us posted. God bless",
