      "Content": "Hi, I had my yearly mammogram last September and got a call back that they needed more images on my right breast. I went in a week later for more pictures and they said that there were 2 areas of microcalcifications. They recommended that I come back in 6 months for another mammogram. So yesterday was my 6 month follow up. They took several pictures and then the tech said that she was going to go show them to the doctor. Usually she is only gone about 5 minutes but this time she was gone for almost a half an hour. She knocked on the door and this time both her and the doctor came in. The doctor said that the microcalcifications had not changed but that he was going to write down on the report that they were indeterminent. He said that I might want to talk to my doctor about getting a biospy if I was \"worried\"...if not, just come back in another 6 months. Huh? I don't know if he wasn't allowed to tell me what to do or if a diagnosis of indeterminent means that I have to decide what to do. So I have a call into my doctor's office to get some more information about all of this. The receptionist told me that she would try getting the lab report today and have him call me back. What kind of craziness is this? How am I suppose to know what to do next? Do I insist on getting a biopy or do I wait for 6 months? Any thoughts? Thanks, Mstic1",
