      "Content": "I found a lump in my right breast when I was 24. The doctor told me that I was too young to have a mammogram (it wouldn't show up properly). He sent me for an ultrasound. They found the lump, and I had my choice to wait and watch, removal, or aspiration. I opted for the aspiration, and was told everything was alright. Well, here it is 4 years later, and it's back. YUCK! I would definately ask the doc if you could get something done about it. If anything, for peace of mind!",

      "Content": "I don't know if all docs are like this, but I was told that mammograms were'nt that great for women under 30. I found a lump in my right breast when I was 25, and my doc ordered an ultrasound, because younger women's breasts are naturally more lumpier, and it's harder to find specific lumps on a mammogram. My grandmother passed away of breast cancer at an early age. They didn't find it until it had spread way too far. She had no sign or symptom. No aches or pains. Have they checked you for heartburn? My husband gets pain in his chest that runs into his shoulders, and turns out he just get really bad indegestion. You say you are on a military base. PUSH to be seen and heard until the top docs tell you to shut up and color. I'm military also. Tell them you want to change your PCM because you're not happy with that person. Then if the next doc doesn't take your concers seriously, go to what's called \"patient advocacy\". Trust me...I've been there, done that! Best of luck to you!",
