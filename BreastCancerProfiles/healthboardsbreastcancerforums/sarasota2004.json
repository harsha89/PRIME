      "Content": "I'm sooo happy to hear you do not have cancer! What a relief for you! That is wonderful that part of it all is over! Good luck with the rest of your procedure and stay on top of it. I'm so scared for tomorrow. My emotions have drained me and I feel so weak. This has taken its toll on me and my husband is nervous for my mental health :-( I know it's no use to worry and dwell but I can't help not knowing. I'm driving myself crazy with fear. The doctor says 80 to 85% of biopsies are benign. But what % comes out from the 80% to be a form of \"pre-cancer or high risk changes\"? They never tell you that? Is there such thing as benign only, end of story? My doctor mentioned putting a \"metal clip\" on the site after the biopsy. As if... lots of times, the biopsy doesn't conclude at just that. I am praying I will get through this okay. I will keep in touch.",

      "Content": "Hi... I have an update and it's not very good. :-( The doctor attempted to do the stereotactic biopsy for over 3 hours and finally gave up. I didn\u2019t have it done. My suspicious area is in a difficult place to get to, the machine adjusting to the correct angle, my breasts are so small\u2026 they even tried putting my arm in the hole with the breast and rest my arm in a sling to get my breast positioned better\u2026over and over but were not able to get into a sufficient position for the biopsy. And when they finally thought they had a good position, either they couldn't see the calcifications from that angle... or my breasts were so packed like a pancake that it left no room for the needle to go in... not enough breast meat! This stinks! Now I have to have open surgery. Normally when you have breast surgery you have a lump\u2026 so they go in and remove it. Since I have extremely tiny microcalcifications\u2026 the only way you can see them is thru the xray\u2026 So now, I have to see a radiologist right before surgery so he can try and put in a wire to the tip of location, then when in surgery the surgeon will know where to take out\u2026 it\u2019s like a needle in a haystack. Dr. said my case is very challenging yet it\u2019s the only way. Can you believe these calcifications are so worrisome\u2026 The Dr. showed me the actual area of concern on the images and they are sooo tiny. Caroline... now that you are having surgery... did they put the metal clip in your breast so they know where to go? You now have a marker?",

I have to wait for this report to be sent to primary care... then I have to have the primary care choose a radiologist and surgeon and THEN I can call to have the consultation. So... maybe by end of this week I'll have more answers. I wish the biopsy worked. That would have been so easy. Now, I have to go in for surgery still not knowing what it is. This is a rollercoaster 2 weeks and I don't see me getting off for a while more. Thank you for checking in and for your thoughts. I'm glad you're moving along and your consultation is next week... very quick. Keep us posted. I will let you know when I find out my consult date.",

      "Content": "I am 38 years old. My first mammogram was last year. I had to go back for more pictures for a closer look. It was determined I had microcalcifications on left breast and when I met with the doctor on these findings she said... there were a lot of them which is a little concering. But they were round and had a benign apprearance. She said no concern. Case closed and see you next year. Well... here we are next year. Had the mammogram done, again, had to go again for a closer look on the same breast where the microcalcifications are. Met with a different doctor (in the same place). He told me there were a patch of them on top left breast that looked concerning. He can't categorize them as benign or malignant-looking and so had to put them in the undetermined bin. He said \"If you were my daughter or wife, I would want you to get a biopsy\". He recommended a stereotactic biopsy with a needle, etc. Then... I asked has the pictures/microcalcifacations spots changed since last year's pictures? He said not really. So I asked well then why wasn't this recommended last year to me? He said \"different doctor, different opinion\". If it's breast cancer... wow... a whole year without having the biopsy done? That seems very odd! I was never alluded to look into the same findings? So now the agonizing waiting for the appt... and then the worst... the results.",

Last year's doctor didn't even bring up this biopsy option. Will keep you posted.",

      "Content": "Hi Mstic1 I am going through something very similar. I am 38 years old. Last year was my first baseline mammogram... got the call back for more views. The doctor said microcalcifications on the left breast but upon viewing closer, they appear round and benign-like... so suggested to just come back annually. Well... this year, again, call back and more views on same area. Different doctor viewed the images... and he said inderterminate and biopsy recommended! The first thing I asked was if there was a change to them since last year? He said no. So I asked why didn't the other doctor last year suggest biopsy? He said \"Different doctor, different opinion. If you were my wife or daughter, I would want you to get the biopsy\". Then he said, you don't have to.. and we can followup in 6 months...? But at this point, I didn't like his report...so I am going for the biopsy. I have my consultation this Thursday. So basically, I think in your situation... they just can't ABSOLUTELY CONFIRM that your calcifications are benign... they may be clustered (which is worrisome), too fuzzy, can't see the actual shape/form of them, etc. That puts them in an \"I don't know\" bin... and you can do as you want with that. Good luck!!!",

There are a lot of people that are too afraid to face this... and they don't follow through on issues and those could turn out bad.

What about avoiding surgery and take the wait and see approach as they don't look too concerning to me... ??????? I told her what the radiologist said \"if you were my daughter or wife, i'd want you to get the biopsy\"... She understood when I mentioned that... she realized that I must want to see this through to the end. So then she said... I really want to try and avoid full surgery... would you let me take your films to our radiologist and have them look at them and see if they may want to try the stereotactic biopsy on you? I said that would be fine. I would love to avoid full surgery if I could. She said she'd have her radiologist review my films and they will either say they'll try or not. It will take another week for that decision to be made! So...in one week I will either make an appt. to try for another stereotactic biopsy OR make an appt. with this surgeon again for the full surgery consultation. So... I wait again... Are you scheduled for surgery on the 24th???",

When I went to the breast specialist they said my breasts are too dense for a mammogram so they gave me an ultrasound. Immediately they told me it was a cyst.... it was filled with liquid, no solid mass, no branching. And that was that. About a month or so later it started shrinking. I would go with the ultrasound and if they tell you it's a cyst... I would leave it at that. If the ultrasound shows any kind of solidness... next step would most likely be a biopsy.",

Why would you have to take that if you DON'T have cancer? You are only at a small percentage higher risk of cancer.... but only a small risk...is that of enough warrant to take that drug?? Women who have a relative have BC or test positive for BC gene or have been exposed to radiation in past... they are at even higher risk... when does it stop? You know what is weird... I read that since stereotactic biopsies have become widely used as an easier and less costly way to diagnose... breast cancer has been diagnosed so much more... and some of those diagnosis (especially DCIS and non-cancer hyperplasia) may indeed never ever progress to anything further... but since YOU KNOW you have it... these surgeries and removals and procedures are going up the ying yang! Also... if you were to autopsy every woman who ever died (of other causes)... more and more would actually have breast cancer... but it would never progress. Tell this to a woman and she'd still probably opt for surgery JUST to be reassured... I know I would. But it's interesting to learn that it may not be that uncommon!",

      "Content": "I had my baseline mammo a year ago... Additional views needed on clustered microcalcifications but doctor said they appeared benign in appearance and to come back in 1 year. This year, same thing... same microcalcifications viewed but different radiologist said they were so tiny, small, fuzzy, and can't tell... labeled them indeterminent and BiRad4 biopsy recommended...although his suspicions were low of cancer. Nothing changed from year ago... his opinion he said was just different. I had an attempted stereotactic 2 months ago but didn't work. Dense breasts, small breasts, calcifications are so hard to find. The next recommendation was excisional surgery biopsy. Met with surgeon. She suggested 6 month follow up? I said but radiologist suggested biopsy?! She asked if they could attempt another stereotactic to avoid surgery. I agreed. That stereotactic biopsy was today. Again, didn't take. Upon many twists/turns/squeezes... they couldn't find the microcalcifications on image because breasts are so small and dense. The only time you can really see them is during a regular diagnostic imaging mammogram. Radiologist suggested 6 month follow-up as she wasn't highly suspicious. But she did say if I wanted to see this through to the end, I would need surgery. I'm 38 years old. No breast cancer history. Yet every grandparent I have has died of another type of cancer. I need a couple days to think about what to do next. This is so hard. On the one hand their suspisions are low. But, they have seen this kind of thing turn up as cancer... at some times. There just isn't a guarantee. Every radiologist/dr I talk to says something different. First radiologist said 80% of biopsied calcifications turn up benign. Today this radiolgist said 90%. I just don't know what to do. I'll start by asking, if it were you... what would you do???",

      "Content": "Thanks Caroline... any news on your results yet from your excisional?? I spoke to another mom at my children's school today and told her my situation. Ironically, she had the same thing look of microcalcifications, but her result was DCIS. You just don't know???",

      "Content": "I have an update from this original post! And still... I don't know what to do??? I have had 2 attempted stereotactic biopsies that couldn't be done due to the fact the microcalcifications are too small/fuzzy and hard to find during certain positions when attempting the biopsy. Breasts are extremely small too. The surgeon told me the only thing next to do to know what this is would be excisional surgery. But she says she and her radiologist feel that the probability/suspicion for cancer is very low and would suggest a follow up mammogram 6 months from the first mammogram (which would be in 2 months) and see if it changes. (funny, that's not what the suggestion was before the failed biopsy attempt). She said cancer doesn't usually lull around and eventually makes changes. And if the next mammogram has any sort of change/growth it can have a better chance of a sucessful biopsy. To make matters more challenging, she said if I opted for the surgery I would have to have the radiologist insert a wire to the tip of the area prior to going under and based on the fact the stereotactics couldn't work, there is a possibility that again, the radiologist won't be able to wire to area and I will not be able to have the surgery! And if that is the case... I will never know what the heck this area is!! Unless...it grows more to see it!? She said she would never open a breast up to take anything out unless it is clearly and absolutely marked where...and that is a challenge in my case. She said the choice is mine and she would be fine with either... attempt the surgery or another mammo in August. I asked if it were her what would she do? She said personally she would mammo it in August to see if there is a change but again, if they were ever wrong... I could have had this taken care of at surgery. I don't know what to do!! I wish I could know if the radiologist will be able to wire it prior to surgery but she said that is impossible until the day of surgery. Looking for opinions....",
