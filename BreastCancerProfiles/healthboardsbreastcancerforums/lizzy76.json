      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I do have some cancer history in my family, mainly my aunt w/ breast cancer and my dad with prostate cancer. I don't know if that adds to my risk. Has anyone ever been afraid to go to the doctor because they're not sure if it's a lump or not? I mean, I'm pretty sure it's a lump but what if the doc doesn't think it? Then I'll feel like I'm a hypochondriac or something! I know to be better safe than sorry, but still.... Maybe I'll just watch it for a week or so and see what happens. THat certainly can't hurt...",

This \"scare\" prompted my two sisters to start doing self breast checks so that's great! And I found out that apparently my dad's dad had breast cancer.... yes, he was one of the few males who get breast cancer. I thought that was interesting...",

      "Content": "Well I decided to make an appointment to get this checked out. I see my doctor on Thursday - I'm so glad they could get me in so soon! I've done some research and it does seem that when lumps are painful they are not cancerous, although I have read about some that were painful and turned out to be cancerous. Linda, I was wondering about your post where you said they usually don't start mammograms until age 30.... did you mean age 40? Just curious because I'm 31. I have another question - my dad had prostate cancer and I was wondering if that would increase my chances of getting cancer? Even though his was a \"male\" cancer that I obviously cannot get...",
