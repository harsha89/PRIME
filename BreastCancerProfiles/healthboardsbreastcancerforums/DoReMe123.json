    "Content": "I've had this thing for a few months now. I thought it was just a pimple or agitated hair follicle, but it's only gotten larger and is filled with heavy/hard pus. Nearly every day, if squeezed, a portion of thinner pus will come out. Right now it feels swollen like scar tissue has built up around a cyst, and there's a pinhole in the top that allows me to see the harder pus down in it. :/ Gross, I know. Its about the size of a thumbnail. I wouldnt be concerned except for the fact that breast cancer runs rampant in my family. Also, I'm 21, so I know things can be much more aggressive for people that are younger. But I think I'm more worried about agitating it so much that it *does* turn cancerous rather than it being a tumor? Help? Should I call my gyn?",
