    "Content": "I realize that no one can make a decision for another person, but I'd like to hear your opinions on/experiences with lumpectomy and mastectomy. I have seen two Drs about my breast tumor (Stage I, combo of DCIS and invasive) and they have totally different opinions on how to treat it. Dr #1 is female and believes that saving the breast is no problem. She wants to perform another surgical procedure to clear a margin, and follow up with radiation and light chemo. She also wants me to stop taking birth control pills b/c of the hormones. Dr #2 is male and believes that b/c of my age (25 yrs old) the probability of recurrence is reason enough to remove the breast and perform a reconstruction -- no radiation following the mastectomy. He has no problem with the birth control pills. All I do is read and read and read, but I can't figure out what I should do. I read mastectomy does not reduce the chance of recurrence b/c 100% of the breast tissue is never removed, and then I've read that it does reduce the chances of it coming back significantly. I'm terrified I'm going to make the wrong choice. I'm not terribly worried about dying from this right now, I'm worried about it coming back in 10 yrs. Have Drs you've seen told you similar or different things? Any opinions?",
