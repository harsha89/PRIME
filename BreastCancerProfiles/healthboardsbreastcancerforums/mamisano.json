    "Content": "Please know that the CA-125 test is not always conclusive. My mother is an Ovarian Cancer survivor (6 years post diagnosis) and when she has had a reoccurance (twice), the CA-125 never showed signs. It was not until she had physical symptoms and CAT scans she was shown to come out of remission./ As far as Cysts go, my sister (27) just had a bout with a painful Cyst that burst. She neglected to go to the Hospital, and by the time she did they told her to just take some Motrin and the pain would go away. She needs to be especially carefull because of the family history.",
