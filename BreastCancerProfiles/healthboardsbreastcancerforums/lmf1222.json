      "Content": "I am seeing a surgeon in four days to schedule a needle localization biopsy because of microcalcifications. Does anyone know how doctors determine what type of biopsy is needed. After spending a lot of time on the internet (probably too much time!) I'm really confused about all the different types of biopsies. The one they've chosen for me seems pretty invasive. Maybe I should be thinking it's good to be aggressive, but then I start wondering WHY they want to be so aggressive! Thanks, Laura",

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply. I'm scheduled for Wednesday. The surgeon took a lot of time to show me my films. I have quite a few individual calcifications, many of which are large and therefore not suspicious. I have one small area where they are really close together. That's the area she'll remove. I'm fortunate to have not been very nervous throughout this waiting period. It's surprising since I usually am a BIG worrywart.......I'm realizing I worry much more about other people's business than my own!! Having information really helps put things in perspective....communticating with others who have gone through it, I think, is especially helpful. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Well, just one more day to wait. I had my biopsy done last Wednesday. The actual procedure was pretty straightforward...what I expected. Unfortunately, I had some big problems with my blood pressure and that complicated things from the start. My BP dropped to 80/50 and it took about 45 minutes to get it up to 108. (It's usually 120/70!) The anesthesiologist was really cautious and made me go to mammography on a stretcher! (I found out later from the nurses that he was retiring two days later and didn't want a bad result on his last week of work!) Anyway, thank goodness for the nurses who got me through the whole thing! Hopefully, my results will be ready tomorrow. I don't feel like I'm nervous, but I also can't sleep......hmmm, wonder why!!",
