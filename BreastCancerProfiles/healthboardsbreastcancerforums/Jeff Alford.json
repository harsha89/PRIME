    "Content": "An acquaintance learned today she has breast cancer. She is uninsured and unemployed. Her only income is from the rental of a room in her house. She does not know where or how she will get treatment. She says that she is ineligible for Medi-Cal because of her rental income. I am hoping someone who reads this will have some suggestion of where she can go to get free treatment. She lives in Santa Cruz County, California, which is within a couple of hours drive of San Francisco, and much closer to San Jose. Any suggestion of an agency or clinic will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",
