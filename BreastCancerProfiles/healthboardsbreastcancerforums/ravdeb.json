    "Content": "Get it checked out. There is a type of breast cancer called Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) that sometimes has symptoms of spots on the breast, redness, etc.. It's a difficult one to diagnose but worth seeing a specialist about it. I have breast cancer and though I don't have IBC, I've met women in my support group who do. It normally does not have a lump. Go to a Cancer Center or a place on your campus, but do have it checked. You will have peace of mind when you know what it is you have.",
