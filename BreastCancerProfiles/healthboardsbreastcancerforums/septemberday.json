    "Content": "Recently had lumpectomy for stage 1 breast cancer which will be followed by radiation and then five years of raloxifene. If any of you have taken this drug, I would be interested in how you did with it. I tend to get side effects from just about anything I take and am concerned that I wouldn't be able to take it and how that would affect risk of recurrence. Lymph nodes were negative and tumor less than pea sized. Thanks, Sharon",
