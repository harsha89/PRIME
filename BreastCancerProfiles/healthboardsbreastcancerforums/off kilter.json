    "Content": "Hope I can help you a little. My son age 7 was found to have calcifications in his testicles 2 years ago at age 5. While they told me not to worry, calcifications can be a sign that \" in the future\" cancer may develop. His risk is made higher by the fact my brothers had testiculer cancer in their late teens and my son had a undescended testicle. Because of the calcifications he has a pelvic MRI and ultrasounds done every year. They plan on biopsy's every three years or as warranted by changes in his calcifications. I was reassured calcifications them selves are usually benign and just warrant keeping an eye them. I think your Dr. is being very proactive in doing a biopsy and I know your worried, but at least you will know and if there is a problem you have caught it very,very,early good luck keep us posted.",
