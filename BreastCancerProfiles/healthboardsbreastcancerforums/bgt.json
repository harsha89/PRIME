    "Content": "I had bloody discharge from my left nipple a little over a year ago. I had a mammogram, a sonogram, and a ductogram. The ductogram showed a fill which means there was something in the duct. I had the duct surgically removed and the biopsy results indicated an intraductal papilloma which is a benigh grrowth in the duct. None of the tests was difficult. The surgery was outpatient. I had it on Thursday am and was back at work the following Monday. The scar is very hard to see and the appearance of my breast is as before. It's important to follow through with your physician on nipple discharge but accordining to my research over the Internet, only 10% of the cases of bloody discharge from a single nipple results in a diagnosis of cancer.",
