      "Content": "I'm 27 and last Thursday evening found a small, hard lump on the upper, outer quadrant of my right breast. My Mom is a survivor. She found out she had breast cancer when she was 42 (11 years ago) and although it had spread to a few of her lymph nodes, after a lumpectomy, radiation and chemo she is doing wonderfully. Naturally, given my family history which puts me at a higher risk, I have been been very vigilant with myself, and in fact had my baseline mammogram, and due to dense breasts (which my Mom also has) a baseline sonogram done 4 months ago. I will continue to get a mammogram and sonogram yearly from now on. I just started my cycle on Sunday night (4 days after finding the lump) so I am aware that it could be cycle related, although I've never had that occur before. The lump has not reduced in size since I started. My doctor saw me ASAP last Friday and recommended an ultrasound, which I had done yesterday. She said the lump measured about 1/2 centimeter in size and it moves slightly from side to side when palpated, which I know is usually a good sign. It doesn't move in all directions, just from side to side. Also, has anyone ever had a tech say anything positive or negative while undergoing an ultrasound? I could swear that I remember the tech in October, when I had my baseline done, say that everything looked fine, but of course my doctor would get back with me. This technician was very cheerful before and after the exam, but didn't say anything during it. She just measured and clicked on the keyboard. When she was walking me back to the waiting room, all she said was that my doctor would have the report in a day or two and she would get back with me. After my doctor telling me Friday that usually the techs are pretty good at saying \"oh it looks fine, but your doctor will call you\" the fact that she didn't say anything concerns me. I haven't gotten the u/s results yet and although I know *most* malignancies are lumps that don't move freely, I wanted to know what the chances are that a malignant tumor would move from side to side? My fiancee keeps telling me not to worry, but I'm sure you all can relate when I say that's hard to do! I'm hoping to get the results from the doctor tomorrow, and if it's a solid mass instead of a cyst, I will insist on a biopsy, just for my peace of mind if nothing else. (if you made it this far, sorry for the novel! )",

Thankfully she got a second opinion because it was cancer and it had already spread to a few of her nodes when they did her lumpectomy. I will keep you updated!

Also, because your other lump is on your elbow then that is not a swollen lymph node and is therefore unrelated to your breast lump. Rather, the one on your elbow is most likely a lipoma, which can easily be removed in a general surgeon's office. Your breast lump may be a cyst, which will be determined once you get your US results back. I'm happy to hear you are going in for a biopsy. All unknown lumps should be biopsied. Thanks! The lump on my elbow is gone, thankfully. Can't deal with more than one thing at a time! My u/s showed it was not a cyst, rather it's a 1 cm soft tissue mass. My biopsy (an excisional) is scheduled for Monday, and hopefully it will just come back a fibroid! I've been having some sharp pains in my right breast for the past few days (different from cyclical pain, which is more of an ache) so I'm thinking of calling my doc to see if they will do another u/s of both breasts (they just focused on the lump 3 weeks ago), or even an MRI, before my biopsy to make sure there are no other 'problem' areas that need to be examined.",

Mine is small and firm, moves slightly from side to side when pushed on and although it can be more difficult for me to find based on the position I'm in, I can still feel it and the size hasn't changed. For instance, when standing or lying somewhat on my left side, with my right arm above my head, it is easier for me to feel than it is if I'm lying flat on my back. I am guessing this might be because I'm large chested so gravity pulls everything downward when I'm lying flat It is impossible to tell the difference between a cancerous lump and a benign lump just by feel alone, although there are sometimes certain \"characteristics\" of cancerous lumps. All the reading I've done says that *most* cancerous lumps are firm, irregularly shaped, fixed in place. If you have a lump, no matter what you might think the cause, go to your doctor and get it checked out!",

I also read that most benign lumps are on the outside of the breast closer to armpit. I believe I feel two lumps, I don't think he noticed the second one. I know I shouldn't be getting worried yet, but it's kind of hard. My dad died of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 11 years ago, so the lymph node that's huge in my left armpit is freaky. I have had enlarged lymph nodes many times, but they always went away after a few days, this has been over two weeks. Trying to maintain, and knowing this two weeks is going to go by so slow.
