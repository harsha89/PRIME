    "Content": "Hi, I have a few questions hopefully someone will answer, I have a major lump in my right breast on the outer edge, I have seen my doc over this because it causes horrific pain, she thinks it's a cyst, I have had this for 3 years now and its twice the size it was!! But my main question is yesterday I was doing the once a month examination and in this huge painful lump I felt a small like hard as gravel, I am kinda nervous about this because on a Breast Cancer awareness thing I went to a few years back they had implants you could feel that were rigged with lumps and masses to feel for, the one thing they made you feel that was what docs are looking for were gravel hard lumps With my cyst problem [I think that is what the large painful lump is painful means not cancer?] If anyone can give some advice on the difference of the 2 lumps in the same area would be appreciated!!! Iam 33, had a hysterectomy 2 years ago, I am not nursing as my youngest is 10, am not on any kind of estrogen. Thank you",
