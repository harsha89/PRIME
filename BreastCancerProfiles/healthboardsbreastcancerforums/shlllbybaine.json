Thanks for your response and I will let you know how it goes Amy The doctors really say that when you do a breast exam it should be done the same time every month, whether its before or after your period just depends on when you start doing it, you could wait till next month or if its really bothering you i would have my doc check it....Most of the time i have always heard that woman get a lump before or during period and then it goes down and reappears again the next month, its really up to you on what you do as far as having it checked....... Take care, keep us posted!!",

I am a bit cancer-phobic (but then again who isn't) My grandfather died from cancer and my father has cancer now and just had major surgery to remove it. But I will follow up on it. I will check it again after my period and see if it is still there. If it is, I will go to my doctor. I know early detection is the best. Amy I think that would be best to do amy, my mother found a couple of lumps on her breast and she was freaking of course and it turned out to be fine, shes just very cyctic, and we are all cancer phobic, especially me.......I hope it all works out ok.... take care",
