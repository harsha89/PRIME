      "Content": "About three weeks ago I found a small lump in my right breast, it didn't hurt and from everything I read I thought it might be a cysts. It grew and then got smaller after my period. Again I thought it was a cyst. A few days ago my breast started to swell and became painful. My lymph nodes under my armpit are begining to swell. I'm concerned now that this is more than just a cyst and am wondering if this could be inflammatory breast cancer. I have a doctor's appointment in five days and hope this doesn't get worse. I am scared and am looking for what my next step should be. Could this be IBC or something else?",
