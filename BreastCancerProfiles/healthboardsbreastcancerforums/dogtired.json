I too am very small breasted and my dr. feels that another surgery will not leave me with much of a breast at all. Since they have to go in again for clear margins she said it is just easier to remove the entire breast and also a couple of lymph nodes that are showing up a bit enlarged on all MRI's and ctscans. We are leaning towards the skin sparring (?) surgery and having this stretching implant put in then having actual implants put in after about 4 months. The issue now is where to do the surgery. Seems that our insurance is not acceptable with any plastic surgeons in our area. My dr is leaning towards sending me to either UCLA, USC or Stanford. Funny my insurance is acceptable there. I should say my husband is in the military so finding an off base surgeon has not been an easy task. Right now it is another waiting game. I am just ready to get this over with. Prncess I'm so glad you had good results...and I wish you luck with further procedures!!!!",

My experience: In early 1999, when I was 43, my annual mammogram showed microcalcifications. I had a stereotactic biopsy which indicated DCIS. (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.) My husband and I decided on a lumpectomy because the recovery time would be shorter, I would still have sensation in the nipple, and it would cost a lot less than mastectomy/reconstruction. 4 days after surgery the news came: another surgery was needed to get clear margins. (This is very common, by the way.) Since the tumor was now upgraded to Stage 1, they were now concerned about lymph node involvement. They decided to do a sentinel node biopsy along with another lumpectomy. Fortunately the nodes came back negative, and they got clear margins the second time. I started radiation about a month after surgery and was put on tamoxifen, and that was it. My mammos have been good ever since and it's been 6 years. How I feel about it today: Since I am no longer facing the life-and-death reality of having cancer, I look at my poor little breast in the mirror and wish that I'd had the mastectomy and reconstruction after all. I am small-breasted to begin with (I was an A-cup) and having close to half of my breast removed created a bigger dent than I was led to believe. It is very difficult to shop for bras. My breast is still sore after all these years. I wanted to keep the sensitivity but didn't know it would be THIS sensitive. I can't handle a bear hug any more, at least not on that side. I have been thinking that NO sensation would be preferable to feeling this permanantly bruised, and at least I still would've had sensation in the other breast. Unfortunately, the option of having implants is gone now, since I've had radiation. Reconstruction can still be done, but it's far more involved, risky and expensive now than it would have been had I opted for it in the beginning. So it's not in my future. I am sorry that you're going through this, and believe me, I can relate. Remember that whichever decision you make, you will get through this. Good luck, sweetie. Keep us posted. Huge hugs to you Aleta145....I just wanted to point out if you're on tamoxifen keep a check on your uterus/endometrium.Problems could crop up down the road.More huge ((((hugs))))",

Mandalin- i know how scary this is but please go to your doc ASAP! The best thing to do is to get it checked out. This board is really great so if you have any questions please ask, and also let me know when you go! Twiggy thank you again for all the info and help you have been great! Enjoy the holiday weekend! Starr Starr92 just started reading your posts...great news!!! Fibroadenomas are usually very distinct on ultrasound but fibrocystic changes aren't. Fibroadenomas are very common in young women...and mammograms aren't really diagnostic due to dense breast tissue.If they couldn't see it on ultrasound it was probably fibrocystic changes...but regardless if you feel a lump and are in doubt take it out.I'm so happy for you..now you can enjoy the holidays.",

Also, my left breast feels slightly swollen and almost like there is a gel-like mass inside. i'm definitely not sleeping or eating either! i'm also scared to go to the dr. about it and what he might say. good luck with everything. Mandalin...I'm a universal mother figure...get it checked out..if you can feel it get an ultrasound....ultrasound is the best modality for palpable lumps. If the lump is sore...that's good.If the lump is in the axillary region(arm pit) it could be a lymph node...lymph nodes are normal and can sometimes become inflamed or it could be a cyst(fluid filled sac that's benign) but you need to check it out to be sure.Would you do that for me?",

This means, for example, that an area of fluid (cyst) and an area of normal breast tissue are easy to differentiate on an ultrasound image. However, ultrasound does not have good spatial resolution like mammography, and can't provide as much detail as a mammogram image. Ultrasound is also unable to image microcalcifications, tiny calcium deposits that are often the first indication of breast cancer. Mammography, on the other hand, is excellent at imaging calcifications. In my opinion, it's best to have the mammograms regularly and then US for follow up, in necessary cases. Well said smithn..ultrasound is NOT a screening procedure...ultrasound is a targeted procedure meaning if they see a nodule on the mammogram they will follow up with ultrasound to determine if the nodule is cystic,solid or a lymph node.Ultrasound alone is good for palpable lumps or women with a breast discharge.. it is excellent for viewing ducts...but it doesn't replace a mammogram for catching those microcalcs as smithn said.",

He just read my report and felt the lump under my areola with a mass that extends outward as if my duct is enlarged. The not so good surgeon tells me it is regular breast tissue. Funny my other breast doesn't feel the like that. I then point out the lymph nodes on my other breast and which I am told is cysts. Is cysts usually located on the very side ( outer portion) of the breast? Has anyone gone through this with clear nipple discharge? Or when lymph nodes are seen on the ultrasound. Like I said with my previous post both the mammo. and US were clear other than the lymphnodes being visible on the right breast. Am i going crazy? Can a biopsy be done with out a lump being visible on the above mentioned? Cheryl Cheryl Enlarged ducts should be visible on ultrasound.I'm confused about the lymph nodes/cysts which is it??? The majority of breast tissue is in the outer quadrant so it's more likely to have cysts/nodes there but you can also have them elsewhere. If you're having a persistant discharge from only one breast/duct you should have a ductogram to rule out a papilloma as well as blood work for hormones/pituitary. A biopsy can be done if you have a palpable lump. If it were me I would have blood work first to rule out hormone problems then go from there.If blood work is normal I would have the ductogram. Good luck to you and keep us updated.",
