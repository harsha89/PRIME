    "Content": "Cheryl--Your post could have been written by me--I'm the same age, had the same lumpectomey and radiation and have been taking Arimidex since Feb. I've talked to my doctor about all these problems especially the high blood pressure, when I've always had low b.p. and the weight gain, but he just says it's worry that's causing all these problems, not Arimidex. I am so confused about whether to continue taking this crap or quitting it and taking a big chance of the cancer coming back. I'm so depressed about all this and that makes me feel quilty because I should be happy the cancer hadn't spread. Boy, what a life!!!! Sylvia",
