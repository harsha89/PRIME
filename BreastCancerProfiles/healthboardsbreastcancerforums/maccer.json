    "Content": "Hi I found a lump on left breast near cleverege. I am seeing Breast Cancer consultant for I think a ultra sound on Tuesday at a Hospital for this. However in the last few days I keep getting a bit of discomfort on the breast and minor chest pain and my ribs feel painful, but not too touch. I am starting to get a little bit of pain on right breast opposite the lump now and lump feels uncomfortable after touching it. Also by evening I am drained and not finding it hard to breath just feels like it is more of an effort just to my ribs! I do have implants but I have been told these seem to be in shape no rupture or fold. Also I can tell the lump is not on implant (it is near it) and when touched does not feel attached to it. I am also now experiencing lower back pain to the left this is new.",
