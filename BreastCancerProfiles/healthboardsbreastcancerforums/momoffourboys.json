      "Content": "Hi I am 32 and breast feeding my 11 month old son. I have been having pain that feels like it is coming from my breast bone. Now I have burning around my breast. Also some pain around my underarm. I had a dermoid cyst and had an ovary removed last year. Also had surgery for hernated disc. I feel like I am going crazy and Hate to go to the dr. because it is always something. But I don't want to be stupid either. I feel like I am going crazy. Thanks for any help.",
