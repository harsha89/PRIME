    "Content": "I'm female, almost 28 years old & for the past maybe 2 weeks or so, I've had a pain in my chest. It's not in the actual breast, but it's near a bone - maybe my chest/breast bone (I'm not good with anatomy). It's not a horrible pain, more like a constant dull pain. Just wondering if I should be concerned. My last appt with my gyno was in December, and she did the normal breast exam & she said everything was fine. I'm also wondering what a breast lump feels like. My breasts feel lumpy in general, so I don't know what I'm looking for when I do the self exams. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
