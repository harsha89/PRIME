      "Content": "Rosemary is very knowledgeable. I agree. But I also feel that mammography with it's radiation directly to the breasts builds up in the tissues and causes the increase in breast cancer statistics we're experiencing. I also feel wearing tight wire bras stops the flow thru the lymph nodes. We have to combat the boxed and canned foods we eat. They just don't have much nutrients. We only need 3oz of beef per week. If we take Sprulina , which I do, we don't need Any beef. Which is great since cows are fed hormones to make them fatter. I'd love to be vegetarian but with a meat eating husband it would be very difficult. At least he likes seafood. At the very least, we should substitute fish for two or three dinners per week. My supplements are: 6 to 7 Spirulina tablets , 2,000mg of fish oils , aged garlic extract (Kyolic carries half a dozen formulations to choose from)and 3 coral calcium capsules. I am sixty one, have not had a cold or flu in fifteen years, rarely put on a bra and have never been near a mammogram. I avoid doctors. I do have some lower back problems but I know what causes them. I do not need glasses to drive , acc to my optometrist. My health problem involves a love affair with Kit Kat White Chocolate bars and Krispy Kreme donuts which I'm trying to end without hurting anyone Oh; and I started lifting six pound weights again in September.",

I took 800 iu's of Vitamin E for 3 weeks , they went away and never came back. I do not believe that a doctor exists on this planet who would not advise a woman to have a mammogram. It's required for them to say this. But I want to warn you: IF you do decide to go thru with it you need to know that you and your wife will probably be in for much more than you imagine. First, \"a\" mammogram is not ONE photo. They actually take more than ONE picture of each breast using Radiation. Since she has lumps, I would be very, very surprised if they didn't order further testing after seeing the films, possibly involving at least one BIOPSY. There are women who meekly agree to get multiple biopsies and are made to feel like a human pin cushion. After each biopsy ,they make you wait for days on end for the results. Now, depending on the doctor, if a lump comes back looking suspicious (could be cancer, could be nothing) they are obligated to cut it out. I just wanted you to know what you may be setting yourselves up for ; I think you should find out the statistics on having cancer of the breast in a woman as young as your wife and you'll find how low they are. Best of Luck and let us know what you decide.",

The term \"mammogram\" is kind of misleading since they take SEVERAL films of each breast per visit. This adds up. I had a lump I could feel 18 years ago. I took 800 mg of vitamin E and 2500mg of bee propolis for a few weeks and it went away. I never saw a doctor about it. They would have mammoe'd me and biopsied me and Lord knows what . I took care of it by myself. It never returned. I was in a lot of stress at the time. Dazed, anyone would be worried. Not saying it's justified; saying that it is a normal reaction to get a call from a doctor then to start worrying. Keep us posted, ok?",

      "Content": "Just one rad of radiation from a mammogram increases breast cancer risk one percent and is the equivalent of one year's natural aging. If a woman has yearly mammograms from age 55 to age 75, she will receive a minimum of 20 rads of radiation. For comparison, women who survived the atomic bomb blasts in Hiroshima or Nagasaki absorbed 35 rads. Though one large dose of radiation can be more harmful than many small doses, it's important to remember that damage from radiation is cumulative. It builds up! I had lumpy breasts at one point in my life. I went to a general practitioner. He said, \"don't call it 'disease.' It's a fibrocystic breast \"condition\" and he left them alone. The lumps disappeared at menopause. Suzanne Somers And her sister had faithful yearly mammos and both came down with cancer. Suzanne, after doing much research, discovered that repeat mammos were part of 'treatment' and she refused any more xrays. I'm not saying that her treatment is right; all I'm saying is she looks and feels fantastic. My best friend had one mammogram at 46; it was clear. Then at 48 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer then died at 50 from the \"treatment\" she received. I think she must have had every known side effect from each pill, each treatment, each surgery she got. In and out of hospitals the last 5 months of her \"life.\" I will Never have a mammogram, I\"m not worried in the least and I believe it's just a big con job to pay for the machines. My vitamin intake is obscene in it's proportions and expense. If I were to get breast cancer I'd have a lumpectomy, period. I advise every woman to do extensive studying on the latest findings regarding lumpectomies versus radical surgery. I'm sorry if I've offended anyone.",

      "Content": "Radiation from routine mammography poses significant cumulative risks of initiating and promoting breast cancer. Contrary to conventional assurances that radiation exposure from mammography is trivial\u0097 and similar to that from a chest X-ray or spending one week in Denver, about 1/ 1,000 of a rad (radiation-absorbed dose)\u0097 the routine practice of taking FOUR films for each breast results in some 1,000-fold greater exposure, 1 rad, focused on each breast rather than the entire chest. Thus, premenopausal women undergoing annual screening over a ten-year period are exposed to a total of about 10 rads for each breast!!! As emphasized some three decades ago, the premenopausal breast is highly SENSITIVE to radiation, each rad of exposure increasing breast cancer risk by 1 percent, resulting in a cumulative 10 percent increased risk over ten years of premenopausal screening, usually from ages 40 to 50; risks are even greater for \"baseline\" screening at younger ages, for which there is no evidence of any future relevance as baseline screenings are irrelevant as to future cancer risk since the premenopausal breast will change** a lot over the years to maturity. Furthermore, breast cancer risks from mammography are up to fourfold higher for the 1 to 2 percent of women who are silent carriers of the A-T (ataxia-telangiectasia) gene and thus highly sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation; by some estimates this accounts for up to 20 percent of all breast cancers annually in the United States. Cancer Risks from Breast Compression As early as 1928, physicians were warned to handle \"cancerous breasts with care\u0097 for fear of accidentally disseminating cells\" and spreading cancer. Nevertheless, mammography entails tight and often painful compression of the breast, particularly in premenopausal women. This may lead to distant and lethal spread of malignant cells by rupturing small blood vessels in or around small, as yet undetected breast cancers. Delays in Diagnostic Mammography As increasing numbers of premenopausal women are responding to the American Cancer Society's aggressively promoted screening, imaging centers are becoming flooded and overwhelmed. Resultingly, patients referred for diagnostic mammography are now experiencing potentially dangerous delays, up to several months, before they can be examined.",

As a woman\u0092s radiation doses increase so does her chance of getting breast cancer!! This type of breast-area radiation is common among women who have Hodgkin\u0092s disease, but they say that the benefits of such treatment outweigh the risks. The article adds to the evidence showing a correlation between radiation therapy and breast cancer. The American Cancer Society says that women who have had breast radiation treatment should start yearly mammograms at 30 instead of 40. But mammography for women in their 30s and 40s is controversial because radiation is a known cause** of breast cancer. Exposure builds up over a lifetime \u0096 many low doses may eventually add up to a dose high enough to cause** breast cancer.",
