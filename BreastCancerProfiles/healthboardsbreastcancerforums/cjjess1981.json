    "Content": "This afternoon I noticed that my left nipple has lost all feeling. There a slight bit of sensation on the top half, and absolutely none on the bottom. I've done a breast self exam and didn't notice anything, but I have very cystous breasts and it's hard to tell. My right nipple is completely normal. I'm 23, a bit overweight, but otherwise fairly healthy. I have a family history of breast cancer- my paternal grandmother died of it at 50. Needless to say, I'm worried. Does anyone if this is something to worry about? Thanks so much for your help.",
