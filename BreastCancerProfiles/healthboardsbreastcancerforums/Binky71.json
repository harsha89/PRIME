      "Content": "I had a mastectomy w/ lymph node dissection in December 2000 and I still have a lot of pain. My scar tissue is painful too. Some of the pain is probably nerve damage too. I have times where it itches but I cannot scratch it because I can't tell just exactly where it is and I cannot tell how hard I'm scratching it. It comes and goes. It's like the nerves are trying to work again and sends a shooting pain in the mastectomy, lymph node dissection site. Just the other day I found a \"lump\" that is very painful. It's probably scar tissue again. I see my onc Monday so I can wait. I'd had a chest CT not long ago and it came back clean, so I'm not worried that it's cancer. I know they say 2 years but how do they really know? Each person is going to react in their own way. As far as recurrance in a reconstructed breast, even the docs cannot say with 100% certainty that no recurrance is going to happen in a reconstructed breast, each person is different. I don't say that to undermine the docs but just because they haven't seen it doesn't mean that it doesn't happen. Sorry if I didn't help, but hopefully I did a little",

      "Content": "Hi, thank you for taking the time to respond. I'm not end stage just yet, it's moved into 3 lymph nodes so far. 2 on each side of my aorta and one in my neck. When I was diagnosed initially there was lymph node involvement, 9 of the 12 taken out from under my arm had cancer. I was in remission for just over a year when I found out that I had to go back on chemo. That's when we found the 2 on each side of the aorta. I'm just really very confused as to how my tumor markers could more than double in 4 months and I've been told to not worry about it. I've asked for bone scans and a mammogram and was actually told to not worry about those tests. Don't worry about getting a mammogram? I have breast cancer! I just don't know if my doctor is pulling for me anymore so if he's not, he has to go. I'm already planning to see a gynecologist for all of those tests. It's been a long time since I've done that anyway. I have colon cancer on both sides of my family too so I'll have to do that dreaded test too. It's time that I started taking control of some of this and taking that control away from my doctor. again, thanks for responding",

      "Content": "I had tumor markers done in february which were 34. 3 weeks ago I forced them to do tumor markers which were 77; I just found this out today after telling the nurse that I didn't understand why I wasn't getting results from tests. I'd been told that they would be done every 6 weeks and it was 4 months before they were done again. From what they are telling me, tumor markers are not really reliable for breast cancer. The tumor marker test they did is actually the test used for uterine cancer. I told my onc that I was confused by this test totally now so here's how he explained it to me, not word for word because I started getting into a panic. He said that cancer produces proteins in the bloodstream and with certain cancers the tumor markers could be used more to follow the progression of cancer. Since I do not have uterine cancer, and the CT scans are showing shrink in the lymph nodes he's not following the tumor markers, he's following pictures. If tumor marker tests aren't made for breast cancer, why do them? I'm totally confused by this. I'm really starting to lose faith here, in the doctor. Should I be considering a second opinion? My onc is not trying to cure me, he's told me that, he's just treating the cancer. I guess just trying to stop progression. Every time I think I've gotten everything straight, it changes. So every time I get to a certain level of acceptance in what's going on the rug flies out from under me. Thanks for reading, any thoughts are appreciated.. Brooke",
