      "Content": "I went through the same thoughts. I was 42 when I found a lump. It turned-out to be a very aggressive cancer, but I had found it early. It was not in my lymph nodes yet. I thought that meant that I wouldn'd need all that aggressive treatment, but I did. They told me that it was the best chance I had to beat it the first time around, and lower the risk of it returning. I tell people that I am a chemo survivor. But I'm not sorry I did it. And yes it is scary!",

      "Content": "I agree totally! People came out of the woodwork with herbs and potions and alternative treatments. I finally had to just shut them out and I went forward with proven scientific studies and medicines. I too believe in boosting your body with vitamins and supplements, and I am using one right now that has given me my energy, happiness, and hope back. But I am a nurse, and know that by doing both kinds of treatments, traditional asian and western medicine I am improving my chances of survival.",
