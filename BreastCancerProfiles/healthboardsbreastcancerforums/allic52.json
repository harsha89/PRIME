      "Content": "Hello out there, I have recently had a lumpectomy and lymph nodes removed and am now scheduled to have a mastectomy and reconsturction at the same time. The reconstruction option I have chosen and which my surgeon agrees is suitable for me is the saline implant. I would just like some views from anyone who has had this surgery. I am having the mastectomy and reconstruction done at the same time because I think it is better to get it over with and have one recovery period from both - am I being over optimistic - should I be considering one step at a time ie mastectomy first, then reconstruction after a few months? Am very confused - please tell me your experiences. Thanks allic52",
