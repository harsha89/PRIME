    "Content": "My mother had a lumpectomy last week on a small malignancy. They removed the sentinel lymph node and didn't see any malignant cells in the node. The surgeon believes he got all of the cells in the surgery. Yesterday they met with the oncologist who said she will need to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment, five days a week, but probably not chemo. Next week she sees the oncologist/radiologist who will be more specific. She also has a referral for a pet scan and a chest x-ray to be done prior to starting radiation. Here is my question, before getting her diagnosis, my parents sold their house and are building a new one, however it won't be finished until a few months from now. They also have a house in the caribbean and their plan was (again, prior to diagnosis) to go there while their home here is finished. Their home here is in the Adirondacks and is hour away from any site where she could get the radiation and therefore if she delays treatment until they get back in December they will be dealing with unpredicatable winter weather. My father is insisting that she can wait until the beginning of 2009 to get the radiation without risk. No one in the family supports this plan as we feel she should not delay treatment. However they are, for all purposes, temporarily homeless and he is unwilling to concede that the trip to the Islands should be scratched. If anyone out there can either reinforce the concern the family has about delaying treatment or offer any reason why it would be an OK thing to wait until January I would appreciate it. I feel like we're trying to convince my Dad of something and I am not sure if we're the ones being overly cautious. I really appreciate any replies to this question!!",
