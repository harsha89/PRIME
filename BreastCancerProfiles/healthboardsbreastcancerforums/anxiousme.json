    "Content": "I don't have an answer, but can relate to your frustration. This may sound stupid to everyone but I can't tell what is normal and not normal during my self breast exams. My breast have lumps and bumps everywhere. In fact, I have just noticed a sizable mass underneath my right breast. Went to doc and he is sending me in for a ultrasound/mammo. I'm scared to death. I have had 2 mammos before for feeling bumps and thickening of tissues. So far nothing has shown up. I'm nervous for the next one b/c this lump feels different to me, not hard, but different. I can remember getting lots of strangs bumps during pregnancy and after when I was breast feeding. By the way I'm 35. I hope neither one of us has something to worry about!",
