    "Content": "I had an ultrasound about a month ago to look at a lump that my doctor found in January. The report made no mention of the lump, so my doctor wasn't even sure if they found it or not. He has recommended that I have the lump removed and refered me to a surgeon. The surgeon won't see me until I have a mammogram. I am confused, because from what I've read, ultrasounds show more than mammograms....so why are they wanting a mammogram now? I am 27 and my doctor thought that maybe the radiologist was being somewhat dismissive because of my age. I'm just really tired of waiting to find out what this is...my mammogram is still over 2 weeks away. Will I know anything that day, or will it be another week or 2 before I find anything out? It really has me scared.",
