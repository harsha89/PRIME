    "Content": "I am 48 and have normal mammo's until 2000. I was in the midst of moving to another state, so when they called to tell me the film showed a \"shadow\" which they thought might be breast tissue overlapping the other. Needless to say I was frantic....movers were coming in a week, I had quit my job...etc. I went in and they took 2 more films, but it was still showing up, so they did do an ultrasound and aspirated it. Turned out to be a benign cyst. They numbed the area before they did the ultrasound and don't remember feeling much pain at all for the procedure. I live in Indiana and the hospitals now have a wonderful device called an Imagechecker, that reads mammo films and can find abnormalities that mammos can't. Everyone may want to start asking around their local clinics, hospitals and see if they have this available...could save many lives. Deb",
