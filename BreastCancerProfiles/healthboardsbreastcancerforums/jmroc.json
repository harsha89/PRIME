    "Content": "in just the past few days I have noticed that my right areola is twice the size of my right. My right breast is kind of achey around the areaola. I have never been pregnant, do not have periods (I take birth control pills constantly because of endometriosis), am 45, and am overweight, but otherwise am in very good health. I can't find anything on the internet about this, but am a little worred about IBC. Any advice? Thanks!",
