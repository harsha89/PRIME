      "Content": "WOW! I can not believe that so many doctors and facilities take women who have \"lumpy breasts\" so lightly!! I would think that each woman that came in with \"lumpy breasts\" that they would take every step to make sure that it was really nothing at all to cover their butts! No wonder malpractice insurance for these doctors are so high! Maybe someone is trying to tell them to really take time with their people and to get every possible test done to make sure they aren't in the line of fire of being sued! No wonder I have zero trust for doctors!!!!!",
