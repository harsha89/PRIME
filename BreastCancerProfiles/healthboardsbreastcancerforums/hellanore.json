      "Content": "I am her2+ also. Please be careful on the herceptin. My heart couldn't handle the drug, so I have been taken off of it after 3 months. Heart problems are a small percentage of the possible side effects and I don't have a pre-existing heart condition but my heart function dropped 30% in 3 months and didn't improve enough to continue treatment after being off of it for 2 months.",

      "Content": "Just wanted to let you know that I was treated with Herceptin after my regular chemo doses. At my first 3 month Herceptin checkup (MUGA scan) the doctors found that my heart function dropped 30%. Two more MUGA's with no Herceptin treatment (protocol) found that my heart function never returned to normal. So I was permanently taken off the Herceptin and can never have it again. Please make sure they do the follow up scans and that you understand that Herceptin comes with the Heart problem warning. Good luck and God Bless",
