    "Content": "Hey, brother. I had the same thing, and was freaking out. Turns out it's normally just a \"breast tissue\" ridge that most men have. Become aware of it makes it seem like a new growth. I agree that cancer almost NEVER strikes both sides at once, and MEN rarely get cancer. I had rather large breasts and actually went as far as having a bilateral breast tissue removal for gynecomastia, and had the tissue biopsied. Everything was fine, but that was WAY overkill. I am majorly paranoid about cancer of ANY type. A regular doc can take a quick feel and be pretty certain you are fine.",
