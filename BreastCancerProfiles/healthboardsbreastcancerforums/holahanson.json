    "Content": "My 78 year old grandmother was diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer this past May and has just finished 5 or 6 weeks of radiation (can't quite remember, but it was at least 5 weeks, 5 times a week). My grandfather passed away from lung cancer two weeks before she was diagnosed, and he died from septic shock from the chemotherapy they think, so my grandmother is terrified of taking chemo. She's already basically said no way to chemo, but the doctors also want her to take anastrozole (Arimidex) I think for 5 years? She is so hesitant to do anything and the list of side effects have scared her. At first she was going to say no to the medicine as well, but she asked me to research it for her before meeting with the doctor in a few weeks once her radiation has healed. I have no idea where to even start. Do you all have any stories you can share, info, etc? She is debating it because if the side effects are really strong she would rather just have 5 good years (or however many she has left) rather than take the medicine for 5 years and be miserable. She also, of course, does not want the cancer to come back. They removed the cancer and tested the nodes and they were free and clear, so it seems like they caught the cancer early, but they did tell her that her cancer type is quite aggressive. Any help would be appreciated; she is lost and we are as well!",
