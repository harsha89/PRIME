      "Content": "I had a MRI and a bone scan yesterday. It was my first MRI and I freaked out. I panicked when they moved me in the \"tunnel\". The technologist was very nice and she suggested a few things to make me feel better. I ended up laying on my stomach. This way I could look out the end of the tunnel and I felt fine. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or not but I could see the pity in the personnel's eyes after they took the pictures. They were fine before the test but I noticed a change after. Of course, it could be me as well. I've been having this pain under my arm for a week now. That could be what I call \"sympathy pain\". It could also be because I shovelled the driveway like a mad woman to vent my anger! I'm going to tell my kids this week-end. I feel that I can tell them now without falling apart. Thank you for answering my post. Every little bit helps!",

      "Content": "I'm 41 years old and I've just been diagnosed with breast cancer again. I had Stage II breast cancer 6 years ago. As far as surgeries and treatments, I think I had them all! I had a lumpectomy followed by a mastectomy. I had chemotherapy for 7 months, radiation for 5 weeks and hormone therapy ever since. I went to show and tell in my daughter's kindergarden class with my bald head and had a bright smile on my face. I felt very brave and confident thinking that the cancer was gone for good 3 years ago and had breast reconstruction with tissue from my abdomen. This surgery took 9 hours. But I was glad I did it. I've felt much better in my clothes. I then had a second plastic surgery to fix the other breast and I thought I was home free. Now there is this lump on my chest and the biopsie came back positive for cancer. I'm going through all the tests to find out where it's coming from. I guess there is a small chance that it's isolated but my doctor doesn't seem to think so. I am so stressed it's hard to function. I have 3 kids who need their mother and a great job. I'm afraid to tell people about the cancer because I don't want to cause them pain. I haven't told my parents yet because I know that I'll have to carry them through this and I don't think that I have the energy for it. Knowing that I am not alone might help me get through this.",

      "Content": "Well. I got good news from my doctors. I had to wait a whole month to get all the results and it's a local recurrence. There was never anyone so happy to have cancer in recent history! I guess the pain under my arm was mostly in my head... It's amazing what the mind can do. The tumor is self-contained! Oh! I still have to have surgery but I'll keep my tram flap. The surgeon will graph some skin from my thigh to cover the spot where the tumor is. And I'll still have 6 months of chemo. And maybe some radiation. Pretty much what I did 6 years ago. But I could do it before and I can do it again. I told my kids and my mother about the cancer before getting the results. You were right: I can't keep it all inside. Keep posting messages on this board: you are not alone.",
