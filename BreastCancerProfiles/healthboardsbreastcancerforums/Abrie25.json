I really hope everything turns out ok for you. I had a lump in a very similar area I could feel it right behind my nipple, but I was able to move it around (left Breast) way back in Feb. the doctors did so many tests that came back with nothing they kept saying oh youre too young, I doubt it can be anything. Fianlly when I went back for my 3 month check up on it again it had grown and the ultrasound did pick up some abnormal things. They ended up sending me to a speicalist which also did the core biopsy which was in october of this year, so long spread in between right? And unfortuantly it came back as breast cancer im 25 years old, no history of breast cancer, and healthy as can be. This was a complete shock, but you know what, we learn to deal with it becasue thats all we can do. It could be worse and many, many woman have to go through this unfortunate disease in their lifes. In the long run it makes us stronger. No matter what the results are you will be ok, and god will watch over you because he doesnt give us anything we can't handle. Regardless it seems like its small enough where if it is anything then can just remove it on time. In my case this was on going for 8 months so my tumor grew and now its about 5 cm and it hit 2 lymph nodes that we know of. The earlier you catch it the better. Please keep me update my prayers are with you and stay strong. QUOTE=TaeBoMama;3337982]Hi everyone, I've been reading the posts and have a lot of respect for the ladies here. Your strength is amazing. I admire you all. My whole experience has really enlightened me as to how many women are affected by breast cancer--and how scary it is! In early November, I visited my GYN for my yearly exam and nothing was felt. However, on November 16th I accidentally discovered a lump behind my nipple. I went back to the GYN and she still could not feel the lump. That's because she did not check the nipple area! Why not?! After I showed her where it was, she felt it. She told me it was nothing to worry about, but ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed an abnormal mass behind the nipple. I was then referred to a General Surgeon who recommended a Core Biopsy. He said he didn't recommend removal (unless it was cancerous) since the lump was in such a \"precarious\" location. I had the Biopsy on Dec. 4th and am waiting for the results. I'm posting here for a couple reasons: * Support from women who can relate is always helpful. * I also plan to update this thread once I receive the results (as this can help other women who may experience something similar). Thank you for reading! Shellie [/QUOTE] Ugh, what is in the air or food ?? I can't believe you are 25 and they found a cancerous cyst. Moreover, i can believe, sadly enough, that they didn't take you seriously at first. I'm glad you caught it before i got a chance to spread further. It's truly sad and depressing to hear these stories. I came here to gather info for my mom who is awaiting her second biopsy of a suspicious abnormal lump, but it is very small and hasn't spread so she has that on her side. I almost feel like we should start getting mammograms in our mid twenties, but even then will that prevent all of it? I heard a case not too long ago about an 18 yr old being diagnosed with breast cancer. You all have my best wishes and hopes for a happier, cancer free new yr.",
