    "Content": "Hi. I have an area on my breast bone about the size of a dime. No lump that I can feel, but it is painful, like a bruise. It is only painful in that area. It comes and goes, but has been becoming more bothersome recently. I noticed it a couple of weeks ago. I am 35..... is breast cancer painful? Wouldn't the first symptom be a lump?? Thanks in advance for any advice.",
