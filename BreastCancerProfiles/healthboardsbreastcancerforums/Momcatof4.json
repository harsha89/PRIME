I need to lose about 50 lbs so of course I have the armpit fat \"pads but my right side is much larger than the left. I was scratching the other day and noticed a kind of floating pea-size lump. Would that be a breast lump or lymph node? I go to the gyn next week. I am pretty sure I felt another one in the shower today. Also the area is sensitive to palpitation and sometimes sends an achy feeling down the underside of the arm. Anyone have this or know what it could be?",

I am almost 51, have 4 kids, and 20 yrs of breast issues such as benign lump removal, bloody discharge in 2006 (both on the left breast-breast with bloody discharge now), biopsy for fibrocystic-change on the right side 4 yrs ago. I had a mammo and diagnostic u/s on the right side in Kat April for two swollen nodes on the side. That breast dr didn't want to go invasive and biopsy. :/... So.....(sorry so long)...what can an MRI find or see that a mammo and u/s cannot?? Thanks , everyone...",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by twohands A couple of years ago, I was found to have atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) on a stereotactic biopsy in 2 areas. This is basically one step below having cancer as cells go through multiple changes of abnormality on their way to becoming cancerous. I was sent to a surgeon who said he needed to remove the 2 lesions as cancer is sometimes found mixed in with ADH. He said he wanted me to do a breast MRI prior to surgery as that's by far the the best way to detect small cancers which are often missed by mammograms and ultrasounds. Breast MRI's can also give some false positives. Unfortunately, my insurance wouldn't pay for the breast MRI in my case as I didn't meet their strict criteria - apparently, breast MRI's can cost from $3,000 - $5,000 (ouch!). My surgeon said I could pay for it myself if I wanted to, but I'm on disability and couldn't afford it. I had the surgery to have the 2 lesions removed and they thankfully found more ADH but no cancer. Thank you! This answered another question I had, too. I'm so glad no cancer was found!",
