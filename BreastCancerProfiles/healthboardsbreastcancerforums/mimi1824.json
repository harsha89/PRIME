      "Content": "Hi there, I also finished chemo 2 years ago Dec 2008 but lucky me, still no periods. Knocking on wood. I don't want it coming back. Also on Tamoxifen until May 2009, might be switching to the other meds. Will be getting my hormones checked. How old are you? I'll be 47 in March. I started my period at 11, so had my fair share . Take care.",

      "Content": "Hi, I had breast cancer 2 years ago but don't recall the codes, but do recall having something positive. Which I think is a good thing. I did have surgery, chemo, radiation and will be on tamoxifen for 5 years as a precaution. You are young so whatever the doctors recommend, you should do. As for getting pregnant, you probably can, is it safe only the doctors can answer that. Do you want to get pregnant? good luck",
