    "Content": "I am getting close to 39 years old and recently found a very hard lump in my left breast at about the 6:00 area. It is new and the only one I have ever had. I was sent for my first mammo, ultrasound and to a breast specialist.the mammo showed my breast to be extremely dense category 4. It showed some calcification but said \"not the malignant type\" the ultrasound said hypoechoic lobular mass with increased through transmission. I was given a birads 3..probable fibroadenoma. Specialist wanted follow up and ultrasounds every 3 months for a year. That was 2 months ago. I went back and made the decision for removal. He explained it would be a simple 20 min. procedure under local anesthesia. He then did another ultrasound and I left. The hospital called to confirm surgery get medical history etc. and said I was down for general anesthesia and an hour surgery. My questions are: **Is it very common to suddenly develop a fibroadenoma at my age with no history of them? I know they are common in teens and 20's **Is it likely at all of misdiagnosis based on ultrasound? **how common is general anesthesia used and is an hour about right ? I am pretty confident this is beingn. I have read everything and even compared ultrasound photos to what I saw on mine. It is still worrisome until he tells me for sure though. I guess just that even if they are common they are NOT common for me and it is just weird at nearly 40 it pops up. Any thoughts or experiences? Thanks!!",
