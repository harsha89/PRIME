      "Content": "Hi Sister - I've just about decided to stop watching the news entirely because it keeps throwing me into a panic. I heard recently that having one breast bigger than the other puts one at a higher risk ... what they didn't say is that just about every woman on earth has one breast bigger than the other! They also said that having dense breasts makes one high risk ... well, that's because dense breasts make lumps harder to find. I'm going to keep getting my mammograms every year, even though I'm not even 40 yet. Sure, it's a flawed tool because of the radiation and its inability to see through dense tissue, but it seems to be the best early detection tool we have available at the moment, and that seems to be the key to survival. Until they come up with something better, I'm going to keep going in.",

      "Content": "I think I have another fibroadenoma. If so, it's my 3rd one. I can't even feel a lump, really, but there's that familiar slippery-scooty sensation in the lower inner quadrant of my breast where there's not much breast tissue to speak of. No lump, but sort of a sensation of something clicking or sliding against my rib, if that makes any sense. And it's the exact same spot where I found Fibro #1 nine years ago, but on the unaffected breast. I've heard that can happen, which is kind of reassuring, and it seems to be extremely small ... but still, I can't just ignore it, can I? What if it's not a fibro this time? Here I go again ... exams, radiology, biopsy, scarring, time off work, having to explain to my boss why I need time off, telling my mom about the problem without freaking her out ... For what it's worth, I already have a diagnostic mammogram scheduled for next week. I went to the doctor last month for breast pain and general anxiety about the pain - finding Fibro #2 a year and a half ago had left me too freaked out to do my self exams, and the worry over what I might be missing was starting to affect my appetite. She found no new lumps, but ordered this mammogram just to be safe, I guess. So I scheduled it ... which made me feel braver about doing my self exams ... and I started with the breast that's always been \"safe\" ... and now I find this! I'm not all that worried about this one being cancer; in my mind, it's another fibro because it has the same feel (only too small to feel) and because I think I'm just prone to them. But I'm just so sick of worrying about my breasts all the time! I feel ike they are a couple of time bombs just waiting to go off, and I hate feeling that way about my \"girls.\" They're very dense, so from what I've read, mammograms miss a lot of stuff anyway. They've become painful and fibrocystic in recent years, making dangerous lumps hard to find. And it feels like I'm going to be running to the doctor in a panic every year for the rest of my life .. getting mammograms ... biopsies (needle and otherwise) ... wondering about every new change ... until finally something really turns out to be cancer. For the first time in my life, I understand what drives healthy women to get prophylatic mastectomies. I can't spend the rest of my life this way, and it doesn't look like I'll ever be using them to breastfeed anyway ... I'm not married, so no one besides me cares about them ... what's the point of keeping them? Yes, I know I'm overreacting ... Can anyone help me? Similar stories that turned out OK, pep talks, a kick in the pants ... whatever you have ...",

      "Content": "Thanks, CJ and Jewel! Just to clarify, I'm not really worried about the upcoming mammogram. The one I had a year and a half ago was almost painless, and was followed immediately by reassurance that I didn't have cancer, so it was almost a pleasant experience! The anxiety I've been feeling over all this is much worse than any mammogram could be, and it's time to put it to rest one way or another. At least for now ... until I find the next lump, or until this particular mammogram is far enough in the past that I can no longer say \"oh, but I just had a check, and everything was fine ... \" (assuming everything does turn out fine ... ) Jewel, you hit it right on the head when you said \"drama\" - that's how I feel too! My previous two episodes have turned out fine, and I have no real reason to think this one won't, but I do wish I could just go in once a year, get squashed, walk back out, and get a letter in the mail a week later saying everything looked good. I guess if I ever get to that stage I'd better remember not to take it for granted! CJ, thanks for sharing your story. It's wonderful and reassuring to hear someone say \"I was told the worst news ... and I'm still here.\" Makes me feel like I can face it too ... if I have to ...",

      "Content": "I thought I'd update, since it's the kind of story everyone likes best: a happy ending ... Everything went fine. No one could find my \"new lump\" - the nurse who did my ultrasound, the mammogram, the ultrasound technician, and the radiologist himself who finally came in and said \"Show me where this lump is.\" By that point I couldn't find it either because I was covered with that goopy slippery ultrasound gel! I've never been able to feel anything from the outside anyway, just a little friction on the inside when I poke around, and they concluded that it's some fibrocystic tissue rubbing against other fibrocystic tissue, or something like that. They said to call if anything changed, which I definitely will, but they didn't seem at all concerned. I feel much reassured. I would have liked a clear answer, even \"Oh ... looks like another fibroadenoma getting started over here... \" but insisting on a biopsy at this point would probably be overkill. Evidently there's nothing to biopsy!",

      "Content": "I think I have a breast dimple. I was standing in front of a mirror and noticed a little shadow. It only shows up when I put my arm down at my side and flex my pectoral muscles, and sometimes it's easier to spot than others - in fact, in some light I don't notice it at all. It's on my left breast, and looks like a little horizontal line near my armpit. I haven't been able to feel a lump, but maybe I just haven't checked carefully enough? I'm due for my annual mammogram, so I'm going to call and set it up and mention that although it's a routine mammogram, I do have a concern - maybe they'll get me in sooner. I'm trying not to panic. Meanwhile, is there any way that this could be within the realm of normal? I do have fibrocystic breasts that always get a little swollen and lumpy looking during my period, so I'll worry less if it's gone in a few days. I've also been working out a lot in the last month or so, so maybe the added muscle and decreased fat have made a bit of a difference in the terrain? I've never noticed it before, but as I said, in some light I don't even see it. Guess I'm just hoping someone will hop on here and say they had this same thing and it turned out OK ...",
