It wasn't painful except to have clothing touch me as I was ultra sensitive. I turned black, blue and green for a couple of weeks but it was ok. Actually, I have to say it was kind of nice to just stay in sweats and do a jigsaw puzzle instead of household chores. I saw the dr the other day. He said the breast is still hard around the nipple area. I told him I didn't realized how much it hurt until after the surgery was done and the pain was gone. He said there was probably some infection in there prior and the ducts were pulling the nipple in. My breast looks different but believe me I don't care! Hope that answered your questions.",

I spoke to his wife who handles the front office and I get the impression a punch biopsy will be done. It was suggested by a volunteer at a breast organization that I also get checked for Paget's as that can cause an inverted nipple. So far everyone has laughed that my HMO obgyn said it may be due to gaining weight and getting older. I could find that easier to accept if it were affecting both breasts.

I was scared but then told myself I want answers and maybe this is why I am so fatigued and sweaty. Anyway, dr took one look and made the comment that the nipple is definitely inverted and it is not normal to go from a regular looking nipple to inverted. However, he could not find anything. He said he wants me to have a mammogram because if there is something there it still may be too small to be picked up in an ultrasound. He said it definitely needs to be watched. He would have sent me over for the mammogram tomorrow but since I have kaiser I have to play the game their way and might have to go to one of their mobile units. Egad. I won't feel comfortable with their findings or lack of findings no matter what. I haven't heard of a nipple inversion being hereditary. But since you want to find out if mom or sis have it, just take a deep breath, tell them you are uncomfortable discussing it but you need a yes or a no. It's weird I could talk over anything and everything with my girlfriends but for some reason I cringed discussing things with my mom and sister too.",

The dr said the xray may pick it when as it may be too small for the ultrasound. I feel comfortable with his decision as my girlfriend's husband is a dr in another state and when she shared with him what was going on with me, he said I needed a mammogram. I really trust his expertise. No matter what at least the dr said it is something we will be watching as this isn't normal so I would hope I won't go longer that a few months at a time. Now the waiting is for the insurance to approve it. That can take awhile unless the dr made some calls himself. Good luck in talking to your mom and sister",

I didn't realized they have machines for natural vs implants. When I had implants they would carefully just pull the implant from the chest wall and take a lot of extra pictures. When I had them removed, UCLA wanted me to donate my unruptured implant so they could test it to see how much pressure it could take before rupturing. That told me alot. For all I know, the mammograms I had could have ruptured the one as it took 5 years to find out why I was so sick. What I don't understand is Kaiser will pay for the removal of both, when it would be easier for them to just replace the one implant. Then again, what makes sense doesn't mean much sometimes. Do you have any documentation or the package insert from the company who made the implant? If not contact them and ask them what their recommendations are as far as mammograms and if the rules weren't followed try presenting that to the review board. Good luck.",
