    "Content": "My son was giving my daughter-in-law a bear hug last year, when they found a lump(small) at the time. She had just had check up a few months earlier. By the time she seen doctor a few days later it was even bigger. It turned out to be cancer, she has lost both breast to this. She is now going through breast reconstruction. Don't put it off, go get checked. The doctor told us, the type of cancer she had, he had never seen it spread that fast. Not trying to scare you, but being safe is better than worrying about what it might or not be.",
