      "Content": "Hi Graywren Well, searching on the internet really hasn't helped. Someone said as long as there's no recurrence it's working. I just had blood work done and my white blood count is much lower than last year although normal. It dropped from 7 to 5.4 or something and I wondered if it was the medication. Guess all I can do is ask the doctor. Hope you are doing well. This bc is so scary for me. I will say for myself that life is definitely not the same!",
