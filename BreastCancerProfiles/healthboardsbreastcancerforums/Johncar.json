      "Content": "Hi Sue, I would recommend going to another clinic... perhaps a \"breast\" clinic for a second opinion. As a person who has experienced many health ailments, it is my opinion that you need to be an advocate for yourself and find someone who can alleviate your concerns. I would ask your general surgeon, your radiologist, or a 2nd opinion doc if you could have a biopsy. That way any questionable area can be diagnosed as okay or not and you can be treated for whatever you need to be treated for. I have chronic breast pain and it is NOT related to breast cancer.... which I can vouch for since I have had breast cancer. Please don't worry but do be checked until you don't HAVE to worry!",

      "Content": "Hi Susan, you might want to call the doc of the 2nd opinion office and ask if they would like you to have another ultrasound before you see them. They may even want the first results to compare the two. If you have that conversation before your appt you can have all of the slides forwarded to them so that your doc can be informed as possible for the appt. I'm very glad you are seeking a second opinion. Deb",
