    "Content": "i have a question. I am a male, 16 years of age going on 17 in 2 months. I have a farely large lump in my right chest right under my nipple. It makes my chest look awkward. The one with the lump in it looks like it has a lump in it. Also, it hurts when it gets touched. I often have to squeeze and play with it alot so i get used to the pain. I had it since i was 13. I thought it was cancer and last year i thought i would die and i lived without a care. but i recently found God and i just want to get rid of it. Do you have any idea what it might be?",
