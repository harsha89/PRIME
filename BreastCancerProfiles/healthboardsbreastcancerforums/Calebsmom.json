      "Content": "I have been having discharge from my breasts for almost 3 yrs, I haven't been told why. I never breast feed my son. I went to the Dr 2 weeks ago for my pap and told him that I was having discharge and now some pain. (They sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound in July for the discharge but they hospital would only do a mam. on one breast and no ultrasound...I'm assuming because I'm only 30) When the Dr was doing a breast check he pressed under both arm causing me alot of pain. He said that maybe I had an infection but that I needed get an ultrasound done. He also did blood test which like usual were normal. He never did give me any meds for the possible infection. I'm still having lots of pain and don't go in for the ultrasound until Tuesday. Any advice?",

      "Content": "I have researched it...very scary stuff. I haven't noticed any swelling or change in color. I had my ultrasound last night and all it showed was a cyst which they said was so small I probably couldn't even feel it. I told her yes I can. I am calling today to schedule another appointment with the Dr today to talk about it because I don't believe that having a cyst would cause pain in both breasts. I will ask about a specialist. Thanks! I don't believe its cancer either, but after 3 years you would think that somebody would be able to tell me something. I will check out the website also. Thanks for the reply!",

      "Content": "I had another ultrasound done last week because of a lump I found near my nipple. My Dr called me the next day and told me that I had some prominent ducts (I saw at least 3 during the ultrasound). She recommended that I go see a specialist. During the week I was trying to get the referral sent through correctly I found out that she was no longer working at that practice and they sent the referral through to a general surgeon not a breast specialist. I am assuming this is for a biopsy because the records that I picked up for my appointment on Monday say that I should get one, but written on the bottom it also says Adv surgery referred. Does anyone have any idea what that means? I am stressed and my husband keeps telling me its nothing to worry about but that doesn't make me feel any better.",
