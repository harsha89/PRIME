Hi Azcamm, Just wanted to say I know what you're going through about being concerned. You sound like you have a wonderful attitude. I admire your positivity. You're right, IF it is cancer (still hard for me to say), they've caught it early. I received my biopsy results Mon...Atypical cells, which means potential to become cancer cells. I have an appointment today to see surgeon for consultation to have small nodule removed so they can biopsy rest of it. I am terrified, even though I was told that if it is anything, they caught it early and cure rate is 95-98%. I've had nothing but anxiety. I try hard to think positive and have VERY supportive family and friends, but it is so hard. If this turns out to be cancer. I know I will beat it. I'm very strong, and have so much to live for. Good luck to you, and please let me know how everything goes with you. It helps me so much to be able to talk with others going through the same thing.",

I talked to my GYN this a.m. and told him the biopsy will be nx thursday and he said he would probably have the results on Monday. That's pretty fast I think!!! As for you: Please keep me informed. I will and have already sent up a prayer for you and all the ladies on this board. You mentioned they told you, Stage 0. The xray tech said that if they do find cancer cells in me it would most likely be Stage 0. I never heard of that before but sounds pretty good. I'm off work today and doing errands, getting my nails done and then I'm going to pick up mom and get her out of her very hot house. She does not have central air but we do. Bye for now & hope to hear from you soon, also. \"Marilyn\" Marilyn, Just got in from shopping,myself. I find keeping busy, and pampering myself keeps my mind off the other, so you're doing the right thing. As far as staying still during your biop, I'm sure you'll do fine. The day before mine, I had what's called a pre-biop, to make sure I could lay still that long. Are you having that? I had never heard of stage 0 neither, but it sounds great...lol Thank you so much for your continued support...It helps more than I can say Stay strong and have a great weekend...talk to u soon.....

Thankfully, the girl that's going to perform this biopsy....I know her as we both work a the local hospital. She in radiology and me in Purchasing dept. And, good luck to you also. I realize the waiting and wondering is hard. For me, I want the whole truth. I get into trouble \"more\" when I try to read between the lines or try to guess. My active mind keeps on a wonderin' around. Let's keep eachother posted, okay! Sleep good tonight. Hi AZcamm...so good to hear from you. BTW, please call me Lynn. Thanks for keeping me informed. Good luck on your bio Thursday. Although i know you're anxious, I'm sure you'll do fine. The waiting IS the hardest part. The actual procedure (mine was ultrasound guided biop), was a breeze. Yes, taking something to relax is a great suggestion. I took half (1/2 mm) xanax I have history of anxiety attacks, and although I really am a very positive person, surronded by wonderful and positive and supportive family and friends. Ever since i was called back for a follow up mammo, i've been a basket case. I've had mammos since 1989, all negative, and I was just so shocked and terrified. Everyone tried helping me feel better. I tend to over analyze anyway. Guess I was preparing for worse, hoping for best. Only had to wait 2 days for biopsy. Pure agony for me. Xanax helped so much. Had to wait 4 day ( through weekend) for biop results, 2 days later (yesterday) got in for consultation with surgeon. They all knew my anxiety was through the roof, and were great about getting me in quickly. Anyway, yesterday with the surgeon went great. I feel almost 100% better. Am starting to eat now and got a good night's sleep....finally..lol The surgeon said the odds were very much in my favor. 95% that it's nothing, and he refused to answer my questions about worse case scenario. Said I was getting way ahead of myself. Anyway, I feel sooooo much better, and already was told by pathologist(and read my report) Possible situ carcinoma.(stage 0) if anything. PLus she said it was small and found early. Anyway, I go on July 17th for out-patient surgery to have it removed, and biopsied. I'm sure I'll start being anxious again, waiting for results. Back to my xanax..lol I have good feelings now. I don't ever want to feel the way i've been these past almost 2 weeks. I have so much to live for, as I know you do, as well. My attitude is so much better. This has made me so much stronger, and really put things into perspective. I did myself no good having those panic attacks, making myself sick, especially since I have such a wonderful support group. That means everything. I hope you have alot of support ,as well. It was a blessing finding this online message board support, and having you to speak with. So sorry this is so long. Please feel free to talk my head off anytime...lol...I'm a Very good listener.. Good luck with everything......you are in my thoughts, and hope to hear from you soon. LYNN",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone............Been awhile since I posted here. Last week had 1 day surgery to have very small nodule(POSSIBLE DCIS) removed, which is noninvasive and very cureable (IF it even is DCIS), Surgeon said 95% that it's nothing. Last time I posted here was about month ago...I was freaking....since then I've done a complete 180. Got put on Lexapro, because my anxiety was through the roof. It has helped tremendously. I was also on klonopin, but only had to take that several times..don't even need that anymore. Go Thursday for results of surgical biopsy. While I was in recovery room, surgeon spoke with hubby and said everything went very well....and he was very confident results would be good. I am not very anxious about Thursday. I've even chosen to go alone. Even IF it is DCIS, I know I can abosultely handle that. I have the best support, family and friends. The reason I stopped posting was because we went on vacation (just had to get away), then I just got really busy. Met so many wonderful friends here, and got so much support and encouragement. Just want to thank every one. Love you all,you know who you are. Anyway I have a question. For about a week after surgery, right where they removed lump, I could feel some kind of fluid, it was real squishy, gel-like . I called dr. immediately, and he said it was normal.. It's gone now. Has anyone else ever experienced that? My breast also seems a little swollen, I swear it feels and looks like I had a small implant. It's already normally a tinee bit bigger than left one, but now it's noticably bigger. I'm sure the swelling will go down.....Ya'll take care and the best to every one of you. Hope to hear from some of you soon. LYNN",

Only the core was biopsied. They need to remove it to biopsy the rest. I am terrified. This past week, waiting for results has been AGONY. Chances are the remainder of nodule is benign or Atypical, which means potential to develope into cancer cells or pre-cancerous. Luckily, I do have the best support in world. Everyone is so positive. I would love to speak with someone who has gone through this exact situation, with good outcome, hopefully. Do not have history of bc, very healthy.",

You must not let the fear of the outcome consume you though. Sounds like in your case the worst case senerio for you would be what you are already doing, have the suspisious nodes removed. So if they do show up with a few of the cancer cells you are ahead of the game by already haveing them out of your body. I have a half sister who has twice now had the pre cancer nodes removed from her breast. I was having colonoscopy done every couple of years and haveing pre cancer polps removed. So I thought I was safe. During the last five years there was some very devesating family turmoil happening and I neglected to have the colonoscopy done for five years and the same with mamogram, I am fibrocystic so it is hard to tell anything with home breast exams. Then one day I noticed the inverted nipple and the doctors got me all the test done withing days, there was no saving of my breast at that point. So feel good you are staying on top of your care and getting things taken care of in the earlyiest stage possible. Will send good thoughts to you and your family that things turn out well for you. Phyllis Phyllis, Thank you for the very nice note. It helps more than you know. I do feel very blessed. After talking to surgeon on Thurs., I felt so much better. He said the odds were very much on my side that it's nothing. I started asking guestions about what if it is. He said he didn't even want to talk about that . I was getting way ahead of myself. He said 90- 95% that is is nothing. You are correct, IF it turns out to be anything, we caught it early and it is very small. My anxiety is the worse part. I know it doesn't help, and I really try, just sometimes it's very hard. With help of family and friends, I am working on it, and will get through it. I have never had any health issues in past, take very good care of myself. no risk factors, which is why I was so shocked. I, however, have history of anxiety/panic, and I know that's not healthy. My surgery is on 7-17. I hope you're doing well,and thank you so much for good thoughts. Lynn",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by Beppie1 Yes, it does seem to be a little different than my proceedure. They did the biopsy first and like you, said they got the original tumor out. But they wanted to schedule an MRI and the lupectomy to get any other cancerous areas around the original tumor and to get what they call \"clear margins\". That is why I am surprised they went right to the sentinel node testing. Usually this is done during the lupectomy. An Mri can detect very small possible cancers. It turned out I had a little activity in front of and behind the orignal tumor. So they took out a rectangular section and checked for clear margins. They did the snb while I was out for the lupect. and got the results immediatley. No node involvement. Now I am waiting to hear what is the next step. Usually radiation first and then one or both of the following; chemo/hormone therapy. Yes the tumor was cancer, but well differianted and Stage 1. Hope that helps. You might ask your doctor about an MRI and other diagnostic tools and whether he plans to do a lupectomy. Ask him about the clear margins. Thought when he removed lump, that was a lumpectomy...have 2 go have car serviced...running late...catch you later..need to talk w/u more",

      "Content": "Good Morning Ladies, Yesterday I received the results of excisional biopsy. On needle biop report it stated atypical cells...possible DCIS. 7-17 I had the lump removed for biopsy, hoping that since it said \"possible\", it would turn out ok, or at the very least be just DCIS(stage0-non-invasive). Well, yesterday i was told the lump they removed contained a very tiny bit of invasive cancer. On 8-7, Tues, they're going to do a sentinel node biopsy. Surgeon said I was T1, think he said that was lowest, since the cancerous are was so tiny and he got it all, it looked pretty good. (he also said that about the core biopsy report (DCIS), that it looked good. So you never know. I\"ve been so positive and upbeat during this entire ordeal, not really frightened until now. Not scared of procedure, but results. Cancer in nodes scare me, and especially if it's spread. Since I found lump, I've insisted on things happening pretty quickly, so hopfully it hasn't had time to even get in the nodes. Anyone experience anything similiar? Would love to talk with some of you ladies. This board has been very supportive. Thanks for listening. and good luk to all. ~LYNN~",
