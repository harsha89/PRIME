    "Content": "I had what sounds like exactly what you're describing about 18 months ago at 42. I found what felt like a stone (it was rock hard) just beneath the skin of my areola. It was about the size of a pea. They did a mammogram and an ultrasound and said they \"thought\" it was a fluid filled cyst. A month later I saw a surgeon who felt it should be removed. (I agreed!) The pathology on it said it was a benign cyst. Good luck, I hope everything turns out fine. Lisa in TN",
