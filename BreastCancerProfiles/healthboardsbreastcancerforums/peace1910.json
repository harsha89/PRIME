    "Content": "hi firepiper, those bright spots are most likely calcium deposits and nothing to worry about. but obviously the radiologist will know for sure....almost all women have some of those...they are more concerned with very tiny calcium deposits and those you probably would not have even noticed. rest your mind until you know for sure.....hope this helps...............peace",
