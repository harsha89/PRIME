    "Content": "Hi, I have a question about the blood test CA-125. For the past couple of months I had problems with cysts. I had a 6cm cyst that did go away on its own then a cluster of small cysts. Whether they are still there I don't know. My OB feels that the fact the cluster of small cysts which are 1cm in size should not cause any symptoms. I still get symptoms sometimes such as pain in my left side, gas, bloating, crapms, nausea, excetra. I was sent to a gastro specialist. The gastro Dr. is checking me for several things such as Celiac Disease, my Liver, Kidneys, Colon exctra... one of the blood tests he sent me for is CA-125. I know that test is for Ovarian Cancer. He never told me that he was looking for that, but when I saw that on my script I knew exactly what it was for. What I would like to know is what is a normal CA-125 count and what isn't normal. I had the test last week, so hoping for results this week. I don;t think I have anything to worry about. He deffinately thinks that I have IBS. But, I guess with the fact that I had the big cyst and then a cluster of small cysts, and I am 38 years old, and unfortunately cancer does run in my family,he is just being cautiuos. but I do not know anyone in my family that has or had Ovarian Cancer. But I can't say that I am not nervous because I am nervous. If anyone has any info on the CA-125, I would appriciate it. Thanks",
