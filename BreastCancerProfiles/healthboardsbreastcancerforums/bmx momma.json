      "Content": "I am 40 years old and found a pretty good sized hard lump in my right breast this past Saturday. It is about an inch long and a 1/2 inch wide. It is located about an inch above my nipple and it is not painful. I wouldn't have even known it was there if I didn't feel it. I do have green/gray discharge from both nipples, however it is only upon compression. I had a discharge (milky/yellow) about 2 years ago when they found calcifications in my left breast after finding an enlarged lymph node in my left armpit, and after several tests, ended up having a lumpectomy, although all cells were benign (pre-cancerous). They told me then that the discharge wasn't anything to worry about. I am concerned in the change in color of the discharge and obviously the hard lump. I have never had any hard lumps in my breasts before. I have dense breasts with liquid filled cysts though. They tell me that when I have my mammograms and ultrasounds. I had a complete hysterectomy at 30 years old, however I do have one ovary left. So, I'm not sure this has anything to do with a \"cycle.\" I have read a lot, more than I probably should have. I have an appointment with my breast oncologist for this Wednesday morning. Can anyone offer any insight on this to settle my nerves?",

      "Content": "Its hard to know whether it moves or not because it is all tissue and it moves. That is what is confusing, however I am going tomorrow morning to the breast oncologist and should know more then. Thank you so much for your response. It sounds like you or someone you know had a similar situation. Hope it all went well.",
