      "Content": "I'm 42 and I had my first mammogram on Monday. Yesterday the doctor called me but my cellphone had a dead battery so I didn't get the message till today. Turns out my mammogram failed and I have to have an ultra-sound. My Doc reassured me that he 'doesn't think' there's any problem, just very dense lumpy breasts that didn't scan properly, and from now on I have to have ultrasounds instead. I wasn't worried about it, but now I'm second-guessing myself. Should I be concerned? One of my mother's sisters has had breast cancer twice, but she's one of six. My mother has never even HAD a mammogram because she's a 'don't go to the doctor unless you're dying' type. I've always known I have very lumpy breasts - when my aunt first got her cancer I tried to check myself just in case and went to the doctor to get HIM to do it because I couldn't tell which lumps were supposed to be there, and he said it was normal in young women, so I didn't worry about it, and I only got a mammogram now because I'm over 40 and it seemed like time for a baseline.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the reassurance. I know it's just routine... but the thing that scares me more than anything else in the universe is cancer. I've known too many people who've never recovered... and the paranoid part of my brain said that maybe I'm taking after my aunt who had breast cancer in more ways than just being fat, dark-haired, and infertile... but that's just paranoia. Now I have to figure out where to go to get it done. The mammogram order came with a phone number to call, this is just a scribbled prescription.",
