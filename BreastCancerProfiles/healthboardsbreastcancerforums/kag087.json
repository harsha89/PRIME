      "Content": "Hi- Thank you for replying. What has happened since this is that we went to the breast surgeon who said that the ducts in her breast looked inflamed. He said he really didn't think it was anything but did a biopsy in the office. Well, the results came back \"inconclusive\". the surgeon told my Mom that he still thinks there is not a malignancy but because they couldn't get a clear reading he wants to perform a lumptecmy and just get rid of whatever is in there. So basically we are back to square one and waiting now until Dec. 14 for her procedure. The waiting is the worst part and still very scared, especially since we were told that this was most likely nothing. I guess it could still be nothing and even if it is , the surgeon said it is \"microscopic\" In a way I am glad that they are doing this procedure, but it is the unknown now that is so scary.",

My Mom on the other hand is going in the other direction, thinking she has Stage 4 incurable breast cancer which I highly doubt is the case. Tuesday can't come fast enough and I will keep you updated. Thanks again..",
