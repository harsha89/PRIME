    "Content": "I'm 18 years old and have the same symptoms on my right breast, and have been having them for the past few weeks. Since I'm away at college I haven't been able to talk to my mom or doctor about it yet. Also I'm not sure if I should even be worried. If anyone has any answers to what it is I'd love to know what's happening to me!",
