Damn aging! : ) How did it all work out?!!?",

Bras constrict and immobilize breasts, and inhibit the normal lymph flow. They cause the normal ligaments in breasts to atrophy (grow thin and weak) which means your breasts will sag MORE. Try camisoles/vests instead. You're on the right track! Maria ------------------ Breasts are for babies http://www.00b.com They can actually make them sag MORE? WOSERS! For years I used to have 36DDD breasts. I lost A LOT of weight and of course they \"fell\". Lately, they've seemed even worse. I also have been getting funny pains in my left breast only. I went to my Gyno and he said I'm too young for breast cancer since I'm only 22! He said that I do have fibrocystic breasts and that could be what I'm feeling. My pain is on the top of my left breast..I can feel a lump, and when I push on it it stings! Any sugggestions?!?!",
