    "Content": "At my last mammogram exam, the technician asked me if I wanted to continue to have a \"regular\" mammogram or if I wanted to try the new option that was available in the hospital (new piece of equipment) called: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Mammography. I was really torn, not having been told by my oncologist beforehand. I was told that the Tomosynthesis takes more accurate picture, 3-D visuals. However, since she also mentioned that it used a bit more radiation, I selected to have the regular mammogram. Since I had breast cancer 3 years ago, I was so upset after that encounter because I did not know if I had made the right decision & was frustrated that someone would not have told me sooner so I could ask my doctors. Question: has anyone tried the Tomosynthesis mammogram? Would you recommend it if there is a history of cancer? Are more hospitals in North America using these types of screening? ...I am going again in a few weeks and will need to decide. Thank you!",
