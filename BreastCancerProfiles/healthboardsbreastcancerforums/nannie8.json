    "Content": "Hi; I posted on here a few weeks ago after I went to my gynecologist -- I have a lump in the tissue beneath my collarbone. She told me to wait until I got my period to see if it went away, but it didn't, so I went today and she re-examined me and set me up for an appt. with a general surgeon. She also scheduled a diagnostic mammogram of the right breast area, but she isn't sure if they can capture that area very well on a mammogram since it's so high and right under the collarbone, so she's leaving it up to the surgeon to decide if that is feasible, or if he should just do a biopsy. She mentioned that she wants this looked at further because she does have a patient that had breast cancer in that area. The only other symptoms I've had are night sweats, which started about a month and a half ago. I'm fatigued a lot, but that's not unusual because I work very early in the morning and don't always sleep well. I'm a little freaked out; trying not to worry too much, but I was wondering if there was anyone out there that has had anything like this or knows someone that has...and what I should look for and expect at the surgeon. Thanks so much. Nan",
