    "Content": "Hello, I am scheduled to get an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy with placement of a titanium clip on Thursday. The lump is rather superficial on the upper quadrant of my breast. I am extremely sensitive to medicines and to feelings in my body. I'm concerned I will feel teh 4 mm clip (I feel the 6 mm breast lump now and found it myself). I am looking for as much feedback as I can get about the titanium clips. Do you feel them inside your body? Can they cause irritation/ allergic reaction? If you do feel them and ultimately want it removed is there a surgeon out there who would do it? I've heard stories of the clip gettting lost, has this happened to anyone? I would appreciate as much feedback as I can get. Would you mind including your age and how long you've had the clip? thanks again. Best Wishes, Emily",
