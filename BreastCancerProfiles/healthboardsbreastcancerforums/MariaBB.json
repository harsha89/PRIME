      "Content": "When I told my physician I had an inverted nipple she had me come in for a breast exam and mamogram. She seemed a bit cautious, but it turned out to be nothing. My doctor told me that an inverted nipple can be a symptom of breast cancer. The scab might be because an inverted nipple accumulates material on it and is hard to clean. I often get a filmy material on mine and have to be extra careful to keep it clean. I would have your grandmother checked out by her physician. It may be nothing, but it's best to be safe.",

I looked that up online and all the sites shouted, \"You Have Cancer!\" So I called my doctor and she said, \"Hmm. Does anybody in your family have Cancer?\" She ordered a series of tests - each was inconclusive and led to another. I was really anxious, but finally, after one of the tests they said I was OK.",

I do take meds for hypothyroidism though - maybe that's the connection (?) I'm 38 and have not had a period in almost 2 years. I had a breast exam at my doctors office, and two mamograms. They didn't see anything odd and didn't order a biopsy or any other tests. I just can't explain why it inverted. I knew this was one symptom of breast cancer, which is why I posted here. But with no other symptoms and passed tests I guess I'm OK. I'm just curious why it happened and which it would reverse itself.",

I thought I'd benefit from an ultrasound, thinking it was the more detailed test of the two. Still not 100% reassured, but a little less nervous. Thanks for your post, I wish you well with your mobile mamo. And I'll try to work up the courage to ask my mom or sis.",

I actually lost weight (about 60 lbs) before mine occured, but my doctor said that shouldn't have caused it. I'd be curious to know the results of your ultrasound, if you don't mind sharing. I had 2 mamos but no ultrasound because the mamos came up normal. I thought about asking my mother or sister if they had an inverted nipple, thinking it might be heredity. However, the topic seems too awkward and I've never worked up the courage to ask them.",

I had to go back for a second mamo (which added to my fears), but came back OK. I've since had regular breast exams with my MD and there has been no change. I asked her what the cause could be and she said she was unsure. (On an unrelated issue I lost 60 lbs and thought that may have been the cause, but my MD said that was unlikely.) We're keeping an eye on it, but as there appears to be no serious issues and no paid my MD thinks I'm fine. The nurse told me she had a retracted nipple and one day it just \"popped back out\". According to my MD, there is no fix other than surgery",

      "Content": "Mel, I found this online (below), do you have any of the other symptoms? I only ask because I just have the one. I'm a little concerned because I passesd the breast exam and 2 mamos with flying colors, yet my doctor didn't seem concerned or require any other follow up. I have no pain or other symptoms, but reading some of these posts makes me wonder if I should inquire about other tests. Since I only have the one symptom and my doc is unconcerned could it be nothing to worry about? Symptoms of IBC may include redness, swelling, and warmth in the breast, often without a lump. Skin may appear pink, reddish purple, or bruised and/or may have ridges or appear pitted, like the skin of an orange. Other symptoms include heaviness, burning, aching, increase in size, tenderness, or a nipple that is inverted. These symptoms may also be signs of other conditions such as infection, injury, or other types of cancer.",
