Is this something to be concered about too or is this just a pimple. No, no one in my family has a history of breast cancer and yes, I have been having alot of caffine lately. I think I should check it out...",

      "Content": "Recently I have discovered a lump but decided to have it check out after my period because I think the lump may be the result of my menstraul cycle. However, the lump is still there and my period ended yesterday. I was just wondering whats the time frame for it to fade away? Does the lump fade right after your period or will it take a few more days? I have been doing extensive research on breast lumps to ease my mind... So far, I have gathered that thin woman and woman will small breasts are able to detect the muscles in the breasts that is suppose to cover the ribs and sometimes can feel like layers of lumps. I THINK that my case can lean towards this because I am thin and I have very small breasts, approximately 30/32A. Do you think this is a possibility? The thing is that the lump on my left breast is definitely more distinguished and larger than my right one. It feels as if my right has a TINY lump, barely noticable. Once I fix things up with my health care profession, I will go and get an examination just to be on the safe side but it might take awhile. I cant help but worry and stress over this. I guess I kinda want some reassurence in the meantime... Thanks for listening to me ramble on. Please post your thoughts/suggestions! Thanks again!",
