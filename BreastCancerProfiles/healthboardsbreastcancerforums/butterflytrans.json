      "Content": "Whoever said that mammograms for women under 30 are not effective is absolutely right....in fact, mammograms for women under 50 are not recommended because there are too many false positive results. Why? Because a young woman's breast tissue is much more \"active\" than an older woman's. I know it is very unnerving, but your doctor is right...young women's breasts can be very lumpy bumpy which is consistent with the fact that your ovaries are still functional and your breasts are responding to the cyclic levels of estrogen in your blood. If you actually were to follow the lumps and bumps in your breast, you'd find that they will change in size and sensitivity based on where you are in your menstrual cycle.....another testament to the fact they are not cancer. The fact that this has been going on for two years is GREAT news. Why? Because you can pretty much rule out cancer being the cause of your pain.....if it was breast cancer, things would have come to a head much sooner. That said, it's important to get regular breast exams (and do self-breast exams) to be careful.",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by sawlogger I am having a lot of pain in my breast. I just had my yearly mammogram 4 months ago and everything looked fine. My breast is very sore and has been for about 2 months on and off. It started out like a stabbing pain that you get with a charley horse and now aches quite often and deep. There is no lump. I mentioned it to my dr. and she just said there is usually not pain if cancer. I will have to go back and have it checked, but don't know what can be causing it. Has anyone experienced this/ I am in my 50's. Thanks Your doctor is right that breast cancer is NORMALLY not painful, but there is an inflammatory variant of breast cancer which is painful....that said, there are other things that can cause breast pain. Believe it or not, even women not nursing are able to get mastitis. Quick question, are you on any medications at the moment?",

      "Content": "Optimal debulking refers to an surgical oncology procedure where, IF you have intraabdominal cancer, they go in, try to remove as much of it as they can from the site and from any areas as it has spread. Then, once they have done this, it's easier to target and kill any remaining cancer cells with either radiation or chemo. Other than having to pee a lot lately, have you had any symptoms like: feeling full faster when you're eating? fevers, chills or night sweats? increase in belching In terms of what mnemosyne said, I totally agree with (him/her?) that it sounds good to want to optimally debulk tumour so there's nothing left to the naked eye. The one reason that sometimes they don't remove tumours like this is because there is the risk of cutting across the tumour and spilling cells in to the blood stream and/or peritoneum which will actually promote speading of the cancer. The thing is, chemo will take care of the 1cm tumours and any cells that may be straying.",

Quote: <increase in belching> Yes, but I have an ulcer so I thought it was due to that. Same for the change in my eating habits. I thought it ras due to my ulcer Ahhh, yes, the belching can definitely be due to the ulcer as well. It's a pretty non-specific symptom. Quote: Again, thanks for the input. --Cheryl No problem!",
