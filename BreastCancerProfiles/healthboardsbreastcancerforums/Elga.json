Tomorrow will see doc ans ask about Elavil, and let you know. Jillery, Finnally the diziness left. Now I have to find a solution for the insomnia only. I would search more on boards before deciding to quit altogether, may people find solutions for their pains and I don't wan't to interfere with your decisions, but from what I read we should not stay withouth protection, just my opinion, I really don't know your diagnostic, good luck Elga",

With Femara, now on my 7th week, leg pains are tolerable, just noticable, nothing like Arimidex, hope that does not change. Maybe you could switch to Femara and see if like me they go away. Have a nice day, Elga",

This is so hard, I envy the ones that don't have to deal with all these secondary effects. Wish you well and that the leg pains won't be too strong so you can continue your treatment Elga",

      "Content": "Hello again, Unfortunatly yes we are on the same boat, I am also afraid of Aromasin because of the steroial effect, I cannot tolerate meds very well, so I'll stick it out with Femara. My experience was worst with Arimidex, the sore legs unbarable, I'll be switching my antidepressant at the end of the month because it might not help me it could be the reason for my dizyness. Hope we can both find a solution, have you thought about going to a pain clinic, I will be soon they could find a med that could help you with the side effects, from reading posts on another board many have found a solution this way. Yes I try to walk 3 times a week, should do more but lack of energy, have a nice day, and by the way I love New York to, sounds like the well know phrase, lol, good luck to you Elga",

If anyone has the same problem please let me know and also if this will ease up after a while on Femara. Thanks for your responses, and have a nice day, Elga",

      "Content": "hello cjammom, Well they where not cramps ( tamoxifen gives them), they happened late at night like 3 or 4 am, maybe because the tylenol I took before going to bed was weening off, they felt like strong stabbing in the lower part of the legs, from the knees to the anckles. They woke me up and I couldn't go back to sleep. Femara seems to do the same thing but not as strongly, very mild in comparison, hope you resolve your problem, Elga",

With Arimidex I had chills and leg pains. I switched to Femara the chills are gone and the leg pains are less. Still have to take Tylenol at bedtime but it's tolerable. Also I have to take Nexium for acid reflux. These medecines could help her, but Nexium, Elavil, Remeron and Femara are prescription drugs so she has to see her doctor. Good luck Elga",

About your sleepeness Jiezz did you try taking Femara at night. For me it's the opposite it has given me problem sleeping. Maybe my dizziness could come from hernias I have on some discs in the neck. After chemo I did not have them anymore. But at the same time I started Femara my neck pains started along with dizziness. Just a coincidence I guess, thanks and nice reading your posts, Elga",

      "Content": "Since my last post, I've met with surgeon, I should get operated between July 4th and 12th. Then go through 4 weeks of radiation.I cannot tell you how all this long waiting for exact diagnostic is having an effect on me.... I have a question, if I can make myself understandable, yesterday at the hopital I checked with the clerk who calls you to let you know your date of surgery and she told me that on my file I'm schedualed to have a harpoon put in my breast. I searched a little to know what this is, but with not much success. My doctor had told me he would take out sentinels nods and the cancerous calcifications and inject color in the breast. Never talked about harpoon. From what I read (only could find one or two places on internet that mentionned that word) it's a method of surgery. I was under the impression he was going to make an incision in the breast and take out the cancer calcif. On the other hand from the little I could find on the internet about harpoon it was not very clear but seemed to say it's a surgery done with help of monitor to guide the harpoon through an opening sort of like a laparascopie and at the same time taking out the tumor calcificartions again not really sure what it said. I wonder if this is safe, if they can find all the calcifications this way, and if it is the usual procedure.... all your comments would greatly be appreciated if any of you that reads this knows about procedures for removing calcifications, because I had a lump removed 20 years ago, not malignant but they did open my breast, thanks for your time and patience for reading such a long post.",

      "Content": "Robin,again so nice of you to answer my post, I have called the cancer society this morning, and got the answer I was looking for. It is a form of removal, where they put harpoon around the lump, before removing it, it is to localize it, and not as I previously thought to extract it. I fell reassure, because the clinics where closed for 4 days and I could not get my doctor and was worried about this form of procedure. Now that I understand better, I am more at peace. Have a nice day, and I will post again after surgery and final diagnostic........",
