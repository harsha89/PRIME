    "Content": "I noticed a lump on my right breast last month. My OBGYN sent me for a mammogram and ultra sound. The radiologist said that both breast were normal and that I have dense fibrous breast tissue. About a week after the mammogram I noticed some flaking of skin and itching on my right nipple. There is some clear and sticky discharge coming from that nipple, which is what is causing the skin flaking once this discharge dries. Should I contact my OBGYN again or get a second opinion? The lump is still there as well. I am 32 years old with no history of breast cancer in my family.",
