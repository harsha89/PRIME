    "Content": "You have had two first cousins with breast cancer in the past, please believe me that those two cases do form part of your family cancer history. I am very glad they are now fine but understand that the first 5 years since cancer was diagnosed are crucial and the patients are not to be considered cured but stable and follow ups are extremely important. I am sorry to hear you are in pain due to your past injury. I am sorry to say this but I don't see any connection between your right shoulder pain and possible breast calcifications, it is true I am not a doctor but I have been there and done that. I had a mammogram,the radiologist found microcalsifications and recommended a surgical biopsy. I finally had a radical mastectomy of my right breast. It has only been 6 days that I was operated and I am still in very much pain. It is true that microcalsifications can only be seen in a mammogram, but a very good mammography is needed and by an expert radiologist nothing on earth will ever replace a trained eye and the experience. I then had an appointment with my breast specialist, he told me that microcalsifications are like sand or dust but when they form clusters and depending on the patterns doctors get very suspicious that those clusters could be hiding a tumor specially if it is a lobular pattern. I was programmed for a surgical biopsy and a third of my right breast was removed and send for a pathology test. A few days later the results were back, as said the clusters were hiding a tumor and it was an: INVASIVE (infiltrating) MAMMARY CARCINOMA HISTOLOGICAL GRADE 2 [Elston & Ellis: 3/2/1] \u201cLobular type\u201d pT1C - Tumor size: 12,0mm. I was programmed for a mastectomy in 48 hours and so it was plus three lymph nodes were dissected. The total mammary gland and lymph nodes are now with the pathologist to verify if the cancer has spread elsewhere or not and what treatment will follow I suspect it will be chemotherapy + Tamoxifen. This has been my second primary cancer in 8 months without a metastasis and both cancers absolutely painless. Mammograms do generate some radiation which is passed on to the patient but not enough to cause cancer. You say \"8 our of 1,000 women will get BC from mammograms\" maybe so, but how many women will get BC because they did not get a mammogram to catch the cancer in due time? You now know my story and my experience. It is up to you to decide what to do, I certainly hope you will do what is best for you. Regards.",
