    "Content": "I have a jelly bean sized lump in my right breast. When I first discovered it 6 months ago, my doctor thought it may have been due to mastitis (as I had just weaned my son around that time). I did the appropriate treatment for mastitis and it did not go away or reduce the size of the lump. I went back for a follow up and my doctor had me do a mammogram and ultrasound of the breast. Both came back negative, however the technician who did the ultrasound said she could very distinctly feel the lump and I overheard her talking to the mammogram tech about how unusual it was for her to be able to feel it but not see anything. The radiologist advised that I keep an eye on it and see if it changed in size, and if I noticed anything different to schedule another appointment. I'm pretty sure that it is still the same size as it was 6 months ago, however I can feel another lump that is slightly smaller (maybe pea sized) about 5 centimeters away from the first one. Both are sensitive [painful] to touch. Is this common to breast cancer? I'm only 25 with no known history of breast cancer in my family. It seems unlikely, but I'm worried about the development of another lump.",
