      "Content": "Thank you Kim and Kalie. I am already conditioned to news not being well for I also have Myasthenia Gravis. That doesn't mean I am expecting bad news, I just know that I can handle whatever comes to me. She mentioned something about estrogen breast cancer for she was on HRT. Now I haven't been on HRT since my 40's which was 10 years ago. Mom and I don't have a good relationship at all. When my Dad was dying from colon cancer, she got mad at him and told him that she was going out and not coming back. She told him once that she was going to put him in a home and see how he liked living on what litte he gets. She is cruel but comes across as a real sweet person. LOL She says alot of things in emotion and she does no wrong. She has talked to each kid about the other and now they have all turned on me. It is the type of thing, you know too much, so let's get rid of you. I have tried calling her recently and my ex CIA brother called me and threatened me. So...I am doing this for myself and no other reason. The other is very sad, but the more I try to hande it, the worse it gets. Thank you all very much. Loretta",

      "Content": "Good Morning, My mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer about a month ago.She said she had the mastectomy and lymph nodes removed 3 days after diagnosis. She has the strongest most invasive of breast cancer that is very aggressive. With that info, I have scheduled an appt with our local cancer center to have the Braca 1 & 2 done. It is a 3 step procedure. The first visit, October 30th, is a 2 hour consult which I am thinking t is a psych type of checkup. Then the blood test and then the results. I have Myasthenia Gravis and have fought hard with this disease. almost died 5 times and always come back and get remission. I am not about ready to lose my life to breast cancer. Plus I am trying to avoid the actual cancer popping up on me and causing my disease to really flare. Mom is having chemo now and doing well. Any of you get dx via the Braca 1 & 2?",

      "Content": "I am not going to get the Braca done. For one thing, the Moffitt Cancer Center called me and Medicare/medicaid will not pay for it. I have to have cancer myself????!!!! But they were so wonderful and gave me to a genetic counselor. She told me the Braca is $2400.00 and I told her that I couldn't afford it. I told her about my Myasthenia Gravis and didn't want surprises to hit me. Well...she was a real sweetheart...she like did genetic counseling over the phone. She got my family history and she said she wouldn't even recommend the Braca for I don't have the family history. They look for breast cancer before menopause and/or ovarian cancer too. My mom's breast cancer wasn't a genetic she felt. I told her about her taking HRT and that is a possibility. Personally with her behavior toward my Dad and her disrespect toward this faithful daughter who has always been there, I think the Lord iss in charge of this one. I thank you very much for your responses. I certainly appreciate it. Loretta",
