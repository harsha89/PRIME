      "Content": "I just was at the dr for a diagnostic mamo and u/s and they found what appears to be a fibroadenoma in my left breast. It was not there on my mammo from last June. She said I should wait 6 months and redo the mammo and u/s. I feel like I would rather have the biopsy to know for certain that it is in fact benign. So my question is....anyone have the biopsy done and find out it is cancerous? Thanks in advance for your advice/input! cmarie",

      "Content": "Bonnie, First let me start by saying I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis....what and unbelievable story. I do hope that you go against the odds and fight hard!!!! You will be in my prayers! So please let me understand this correctly...you were diagnosed with a fibroadenoma in your breast and they watched it for 4 years and a biopsy showed it was benign? So did you end up having a cancerous tumor in your breast and it also spread to other parts of your body....is that correct? Or was the breast tumor still benign and the other cancer was not part of that at all? I am just in shock at your story! You have every right to be bitter and angry but never give up your fight and your will! If you don't feel like explaining or answering my questions I understand. All My Prayers, cmarie",
