    "Content": "My Mom has been on Arimidex for 2 years for Stage I Breast Cancer. She is walking like a 100 year old lady. She is in such pain. She now walks with a walker. She just stopped taking the medication 2 days ago. She sees her oncologist in 3 days. I hope her pain improves. I don't know if the medication has done irreversible damage.",
