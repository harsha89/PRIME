      "Content": "The reason he's not doing the biopsy for two weeks is I live in a small town and he only comes here once a week and won't be here next week. That has me a bit worried. I tried to move the lump because I read if they move they are most likely a cyst. It didn't move. It's on my left breast below the nipple and to the left an inch. I also read that most benign lumps are on the outside of the breast closer to armpit. I believe I feel two lumps, I don't think he noticed the second one. I know I shouldn't be getting worried yet, but it's kind of hard. My dad died of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma 11 years ago, so the lymph node that's huge in my left armpit is freaky. I have had enlarged lymph nodes many times, but they always went away after a few days, this has been over two weeks. Trying to maintain, and knowing this two weeks is going to go by so slow. Monday I am seeing an ENT because I am so hoarse (feels like a cotton ball constricting my throat), and I got over the flu a month ago. They are going to do a flexible largynscopy. Thanks for all your support, hugs, Blossom",

      "Content": "I found a lump in my breast last August and went for a mammogram & ultrasound that they said was normal.......well....the lump is bigger now and I have a hard lump near my skin under left arm. (lump in is in left breast). So in two weeks my surgeon is going in to do a biopsy of both lumps. I have been feeling really cruddy for quite a few months, although I though most of it was from some meds that were making me sick. I got the flu and it made me really, really ill. I just got over that and my throat is still messed up. Breast cancer runs in my family, my great-grandmother died of it, and my grandmother had a double mastectomy and went on to live another 30 yrs without chemo or radiation. I guess I am reaching out because I am so concerned about these lumps. Does anyone know what the odds are of them being benign? Any advice or help is appreciated. I am into herbs, have been for years, so am going to get some herbs for immune system building and cancer fighting. Blossom",

      "Content": "I did some reading and saw one website that said 9-46% of breast lumps are malignant, geez what a spread on percentages huh? Do you know where you found that website? I am reaching for straws I guess, I am so concerned over this lump in my armpit, not a good sign if it's malignant, it's probably spread already. Thanks for your hugs, and hugs back to you, and best wishes for your results. This is really scary stuff. I am 41, and am not ready to cash in my chips especially after surviving a horrific car accident 6 yrs ago that killed my late husband. I figured that if God wanted me, he would have taken me then, maybe I am wrong",

      "Content": "Thanks for the websites, I will definitely check them out. I understand pain all too well, just had spine fusion surgery last march, and have a badly herniated T7-8, can't work due to my disabilities I was hoping to get hardware out of my back this summer, but may not be able to now with all this lump stuff going on..... I am trying to rely on my faith in God that whatever is his will for me I accept. It's more the unknown I guess getting to me right now, I wish it wasn't 2 weeks out for the biopsy.

      "Content": "don't be disheartened sweetie if it doesn't show anything, mine didn't, and the X-ray doc came in and told me that I had prominent milk duct glands and just to keep an eye on it. I wish I had been more diligent with my self-breast exams. I had been so sick from meds then the flu I didn't do them like I should have, and when I had that ultrasound I really doubted that it was nothing because I could feel the lump and so could the U/S tech. Let me know what your results say. Hugs, Blossom",
