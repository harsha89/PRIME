    "Content": "I am a 28 year old female. I have a history of breast cancer from my fathers side of the family. I do not know my mothers family history. I found a lump under my left breast about two weeks ago. It's underneath my left breast, close to the chest wall, probably the size of a grape, maybe a little larger. It's firm, and unmovable when standing. I found it in the shower. The thing is, it seems to disappear when I lie down on my back. I can no longer feel it. I went to my gynecologist today (I'm a brand new patient), and he did a breast exam while I was lying down. He said he didn't feel much of anything and I shouldn't worry about it since I'm only 28. I made an appt for a second opinion though. I am just confused as to why it disappears when I lie down? Is this really just nothing and I'm overreacting? At my 2nd opinion how can I make them feel it, do I ask them to examine me while standing? My breasts are rather large and I would have to hold it up in order for the dr to feel it underneath. I just don't know what to to do or think.",
