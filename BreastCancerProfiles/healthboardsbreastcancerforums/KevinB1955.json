    "Content": "Greetings deenie, I've never heard anyone with breat cancer say that they had a \"clicking\" in their shoulder. I am a man, and do have clicking also. It is when I move my arm certains ways. It hurts when I rotate, but I read that if I tore my rotater cuff I'd would've felt it right away, thsi is something that \"just started.\" I was diagnosed with tendonitis in my 20's, but bursitis in my 30's, so I'm not usre what it it. All I know is Advil doesn't help, Tylenol doeas a little, and now glucosamine and condoiten seen to help a little too. Were you ever able to get your question answered?",
