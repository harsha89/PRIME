    "Content": "Hi - I'm new to this board and desperately seeking some information. I just received a call from my doctor's office saying my recent mammogram detected a \"mass in both breasts\", and they've scheduled me for an ultrasound next week. I'm scared to death! How will I make it to next week? I'm 50 years old and post-meno. No history of breast cancer in the family, not overweight, regular exerciser, and I've had three children. I don't know if any of that matters or not. Any words of advice?",
