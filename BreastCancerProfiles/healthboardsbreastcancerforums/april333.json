    "Content": "Hi, I'm new here and wanted to post my perplexing situation. I have an enlarged, non tender rib bone that is protruding from the left side of my chest. It is enlarged compared to the other side, and has grown over the past year. I am also a survivor of cervical cancer. Not that its related. I have had two cat scans done, and a bone scan, also have seen two onocologist, bc first one was a gyno(wrong type of doctor),so they sent me to a breast specialist. The gyno saw it and was concerned, the breast specialist said just a birth defect. I know better bc it wasnt there before, and more so now bc it keeps growing. Its noticeable, and very hard like bone. The cat scan just showed a lung nodule, and bone scan didnt show anything. My pcp tells me who knows maybe you rib is popped out more on that side. But why?? I also have had ongoing pain in the shoulder area and arm on that side. In addition to occasional bone pain in the arm, and left leg. I was told may be developing rhuematoid arthritis, and have been on pain killers and anti inflammitories scince then. I have had a high white blood count monocytes, but otherwise blood work is fine, as far as cbs, and sed rate, ra factor goes. I dont necessarily think that it is cancer, I just dont know what it is? Thought I would post to see if anyone had any ideas?? It would be nice to finally figure this thing out, in addition to the bone pain, ect..so that I dont have to wonder?? Thanks for listening.......april",
