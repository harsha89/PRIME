      "Content": "Hi Sharon, I made a late afternoon appt. with Radiology Center for Monday, July 30th to have the additional mammogram films & ultrasound. The scheduler informed me it is their practice is to have the Radiologist relay his findings personally to the me that very same day, since I am returning for follow-up tests after an initial abnormal mammogram. This is a good practice: patients are directly & immediately informed, versus waiting for family physician contact. I will keep you posted. Many thanks for listening & caring, Honey",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon, Great welcoming news: I am fine. What showed on the initial mammogram was not visible on the follow-up Compressed Mammogram & Ultrasound. Sooo relieved and grateful! The Radiologist's exact words were: \"good news, no suspicious abnormality found\". He said the Tech involved with original screening mammogram made note of 'spot compressions' viewed bilaterally...thus additional lateral films were recommended. Many thanks for your kindness in taking the time to read & respond to my posted frantic concerns. I will never take lightly the mammogram screening again...there will probably always be feelings of trepidation now as I await those annual screening results, etc. I noted in your posts that you HAD breast cancer. Are you doing ok now, Sharon...in complete & total remission? I sure hope so. How often do you have mammograms...are they just the regular mammograms or more detailed? I don't mean to be nosy, but now that I've had a peek into the anxiety that others may also experience...I feel a bit more accountable as to how I can perhaps support others, by increasing my knowledge for starters, etc. Many many thanks for your support & sharing your knowledge... Honey",

      "Content": "Greetings everyone, I am trying not to buy-into fear, but confess to not being quite successful with this endeavor & confess to definitely feeling very anxious! I arrived home from work today, to hear a message from the Radiology Center where I had my annual Mammogram 2 weeks ago. The message simply said that my family physician ordered some follow-up testing, and I was to return the call to set up these appointment. Now, I have to stew over the weekend...what is the reason for my physician to order more tests & what tests could possible be ordered? I believe that I shall call my family physician on Monday to speak with him of the above concerns. All my previous mammograms have been normal. In addition, I have even been thinking of getting a 2nd opinion Mammogram from a different provider, simply because the day that I had my mammogram: the Radiology Center computer system was down & all my private personal/medical history would have to be entered into the system later, when it was up-&-working. The Technician wrote down my responses to her questions & assured me that it would be entered into the computer before the day ended...and casually mentioned that she would have over 40 patient details to enter! Could it be possible that there may have been an error when entering the data, etc.? Does this sound logical to have a 2nd Mammogram taken...before going through with any further testing--which these tests may be even more expensive than the initial Mammogram...and maybe not really necessary, if there was a data-entry error mis-match, etc. All feedback would be appreciated, including the probable further additional tests. It might help allay my fears over the LONG weekend. Why didn't my family physician call & explain his concerns to me? Thank you, Honeywest",

      "Content": "Hello Sharon, Many thanks for your speedy response. I don't know what or where to begin first. I really appreciate your reassurance & listening ear: the statistics of the odds being my favor. Nor do I have any history of breast cancer in my family. I suppose trying to play phone-tag with my family physician should come first. He should have a written report/result, which I intend to get a copy. It concerns me that his office made no effort to inform me with the reason/necessity to order further testing, instead hearing this from the Radiology Center. Is this common practice amongst physicians to not inform their clients of need for further testing? Next, I need the reassurance that my mammogram films have my name embedded on them, not just an affixed label with my name, etc. Since the Radiology Center's computer system was down that day, & all my responses to the Tech's questions would need to be entered at a later time...it concerns me how/if their computer system is connected to the xray machine technology by being able to correctly embed identification on my mammogram at the time it was taken. Am I making sense? I have no idea on how I will be able to get this info...even see the film to allay my apprehension...since in past experience, office receptionist/staff have not always been the most helpful or willing to go the extra mile...not to mention the voice mail calls that never get returned. Many thanks for listening... Honey",

      "Content": "Greetings everyone, First item of the day was to call my family physician to learn WHY he ordered further testing beyond the initial Mammogram, & had to leave my agitated message on nurse's voice mail at the office location where Doc was supposedly working today. Imagine this, Doc had been contacted by Radiology Center 2 days afterwards of their recommendation to follow-up with another mammogram & ultrasound. But, Doc never responded, so Radiology Center made contact with him again, & he apparently agreed to their suggested plan-of-action, but failed to communicate with ME about my mammogram results. Now back to my having called the family physician's office today at 8am...I received no response. At 4pm, I tried the other office location, although he was not scheduled to be at this particular office today...& behold a real voice answered. She proceeded to inform me the Doc was on vacation, but was keenly aware of my dismay at not being informed of my mammogram results. The office nurse manager did find the results & printed a copy for me, which I now have in my possession...& was borderline apologetic for results never relayed to me. So, I will be looking for another family physician...one who doesn't fail to communicate vital information to his patients. Anyway, here are my 7-9-12 mammogram findings: \"Breast tissue is moderately dense. There is a new nodule noted lateral left breast CC projection far posteriorly. There are irregular asymmetries subareolar right breast in the CC projection and mid portion of the left breast MLO projections. There are benign-appearing calcifications bilaterally without suspicious clustering. No dominant mass or secondary signs of neoplasm otherwise noted. The skin & nipple shadows are normal. No axillary adenopathy.\" In my opinion, the 1st paragraph of results sounds like a foreign language, but descriptive of findings that seem possibly intimidating. The 2nd paragraph sounds more reassuring of nothing serious. Radiology Center stated two follow-up tests were ordered by family physician: another mammogram and ultrsound. Thanks for listening to my concerns...Honey",
