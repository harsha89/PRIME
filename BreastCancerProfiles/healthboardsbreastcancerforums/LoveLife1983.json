      "Content": "Thank you so much for asking . It means a lot x So I went to the hospital today and saw the specialist. She was very sweet but very vague... Couldn't get much out of her. She told me to come back tomorrow for a ultra sound and a core biopsy :/ After asking her what she thinks it was she said its more likely fibroadenoma but need further testing to make sure. I asked her if the fibroadenoma causes the \"dryness \" look on my skin and she said that's something we will discuss after my results ! Trying to be positive here At least o know I will have results by next week x And how about you? Have u made an appointment yet ? Hope you are ok. Pls try not to stress too much . I'm here hoping its a clear for both of us big hugs xx",

      "Content": "Hello emmababe, Hope you are doing well and not too stressed . Little update... I had my ultrasound and discovered that what I have is cysts and not lumps . They were very hard and easy to confuse with a hard mass . The radiologist said I didn't need to have a core biopsy ( yaaayyyy) What I had instead was fine needle aspiration ( to remove some of the liquid ) I think he removed some cells from some skin mass as I saw him scraping some samples into mini clear plates . He sent them off to a lab and I will meet my doctor next Thursday to discuss results x He said he's extremely confident I have nothing to worry about . So I am definitely more relieved x Maybe cysts cause skin to appear irregular and nipple sensitivity ... So please don't worry . Keep your hopes up! It could just be a large cyst . He said its extremely common and they can get very large . I had 2 lumps . They were quite hard and large . And they only hurt when I put pressure on them . He removed some fluid . I can still feel they are there but smaller now after the needle aspiration. Not sure if he left some fluid or maybe is scar tissue . Will ask my doctor in Thursday . I am hoping you get your app ASAP. It's funny you mention they might push you back because of your age ... My radiologist asked my age when I was laying in the ultrasound bed . When I said 29 , he said it was crucial info... He said that in the UK and States if u are 28 or younger and they discover cysts or fibro they won't do a needle aspiration or biopsy . Nothing would be sent to labs because of the age . I'll let you know my results . Keep me updated on how you are doing x Thinking of you Big hugs !! X",
