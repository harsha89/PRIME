    "Content": "Developed a lump in my left breast after a month of unusual breast tenderness. It was big during the week or so the tenderness was at its worst, but by the time I saw the obgyne, the tenderness subsided and the lump reduced in size. The doc could feel it too still and had me go to diagnostic mammo/ultrasound. All they found was fibrous changes...nothing they called alarming. I was referred to a surgeon who does breast surgery and has an ultrasound machine in his office. He showed me that it looked like a lipoma (well rounded, enclosed, easily compressible and goes back when pressure is removed) and that there was actually to of them. He is recommending waiting 3 mo to see if there is change and possible surgery to remove it (to officially diagnose and allow me to have more accurate future self exams). He said mammo missed it b/c the color of fat is the same in the lipoma as in the normal fat layer of the skin over the breast tissue. I checked the internet, and they wrote that a lipoma (benign) and a liposarcoma (malignant) are hard to differentiate if the sarcoma is a well differentiated tumor. Does anyone know if it's best not to wait? I'm concerned b/c I have a lymph node in the back/side of my neck that I attributed to my chronic sinusitis. Thanks!",
