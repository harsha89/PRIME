    "Content": "Hi! I am a 19-20y/o & I have had cysts in my breast. Along with fibroadenoma in my right and left breast. The right one was discovered earlier as it was about 19mm big. I went for ultrasounds and both the nurse who conducted the ultrasound and my doctor reassured me that it is just a benign fibroadenoma. Theyu did not do any other tests to verify it. about 1 to 2 months later, I feel a lump at my right underarm & I am feeling really worried that it has escalated to cancer. Can anyone please advice? In addition, my mum had breast cancer at her left breast when she was about 49y/o. :/ & I am really worried... Thank you to anyone that would please advice!",
