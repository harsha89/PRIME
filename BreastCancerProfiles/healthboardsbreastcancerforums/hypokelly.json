      "Content": "I just came back from docs after having a abdominal ultrasound,she said I had a cyst on ovary and a \"bulky\" uterus, but everything was fine she would just repeat the ultrasound in 2 months. What is a \"bulky uterus\"? I'm a premenapausal 39yr old,having health issues for 2yrs now.I recently became really concerned about ovarian cancer.",

      "Content": "thanks for replying Rowdy & Ginger, have not been on the computer for a while. Rowdy, hope your ultrasound goes well,I don't think you will get your results from the tech, you will probably have to see the doc again. I didn't get a transvaginal ultrasound (i was suppose to, but the tech said if we can't find anything she would do the trans,I kinda of wish they had done it for the simple reason things get missed) I started my period 2 days ago(hopefully it doesn't last as long as the last one)I have HUGE clots(sorry)very little bleeding...just clots is this normal?Could this be the cause of the \"bulky uterus\"?Is this the reason some women need a D&C?this clot business has been going on for quite a few months now. I don't know if any of this indicates ovarian cancer, but I do have alot of abdominal discomfort,bloating,tenderness during sex and bladder issues.",
