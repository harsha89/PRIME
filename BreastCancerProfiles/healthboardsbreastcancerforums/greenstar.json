    "Content": "I'm quite fair skinned and have a lot of freckles,however i noticed one on my breast(kind of on the underside)seems to have gotten bigger.Well maybe not so much bigger,but it seems like a lighter patch of brown is attached to the freckle making it look bigger.It's not raised or anything and it hasn't been exposed to the sun.I just find it strange that it got bigger.I'm 27 and my family has a history of cancer and though i feel it's not that serious i just thought i'd ask and see if anyone has had this happen to them.",
