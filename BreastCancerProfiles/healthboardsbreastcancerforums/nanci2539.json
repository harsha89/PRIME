    "Content": "I'm 61 ,post menopause and recently, I've had discomfort in my left breast. Not really a pain, more like a soreness. Sometimes the nipple area feels sore, almost like a rawness. My breast looks normal; there is no discharge or lumps that I can feel. When I was younger, I had a cystic disease but I thought that this went away once you reached menopause. I did have this happen about 25 years ago, very bad discomfort, etc, but nothing was found. It was just one of those things the doctor said. The discomfort now doesn't last all day but it's there. Any ideas? Would this be an indication that something serious is going on?",
