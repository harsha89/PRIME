      "Content": "Hello, I feel from time to time a sharp needle type of pain on my right breast. It goes and comes. Lately, I have been feeling it more frequently and today has been going on all day. The pain seems to come from very deep right below my right nipple. I have checked to see if I feel any lump, but nothing was felt. I had a mammogram last December 07 and about June 06, nothing showed. Do any of you know what can that be? I have an appointment with my OB on December 08. Do you think I should move it closer? thanks! t",

      "Content": "Thanks Twohands for replaying. I wish I would have read this post prior to my exam. I was up till 4 am looking for symptoms in the Internet. I was so scared. When I went to the office, I am not kidding, I almost fainted. I pray for all these women that are going through this. My test result was all good. I don't have anything. But when I got in the room, I saw my breast picture, It looked as if it had a lump right behind my nipple. She proceeded to explain why they had called me there. But at this point all I heard was an echo. She even had to bring water to me. You are right, many women have dense breast, sharp pain and let down milk feeling. But it does not necessary mean cancer. But I still need to ask my OB in next week appointment why I feel this. This nurse told me that I may be getting closer to menopause. We don't know. I feel a lot better in regards pain. Most of it must have been anticipation or over-reaction. The nurse also told me that if cancer is caught on time, there is a high chance of surviving, so all these ladies have a big shot to life. If I have any new news I will come back and post, so the ladies that are looking for information can find something in my post. Again, thanks for taking the time to post!! God bless you.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am 47. I just had a mammogram and it says I have dense breast and that I needed a sonogram, which I have the apt tomorrow. But since I have been stressing out, I did search myself in the internet. This search has me scared. For few months I have been feeling needle sharp pain in both breast... however, that has ended but I do feel that I have let down milk every day. My daughters are now 3 1/2 and 6 (I only breast-fed for 6 mo to both of them). I don't have any discharge (mild or anything), my breast don't seem different (redness, orange skin, etc), I don't feel any lump. But I DO feel this let down of milk. I have a hole in my stomach after finding out DCIS. Does any one have the same experience and have been diagnosed with DCIS or anything else? I have to add that I have had 6 mammograms and the last mammogram came with this findings (dense breasts). I am so scared it is not even funny.",
