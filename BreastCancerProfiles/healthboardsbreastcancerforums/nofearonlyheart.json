      "Content": "I'm worried about my mom having inflammatory breast cancer or any kind of breast cancer. She has a recently inverted nipple, a very hard mass, pitted skin, she says she has red and purple spot, and also her nipple has changed in color, she has itchiness. She is having a yellow discharge. She is also having pain. She had a mamogram 5 months ago and they said she had a suspicious lump but wanted her to come back in 6 months. It's only been 5. She has a mamogram and ultrasound Thursday aug. 24th. Those are a lot of symptoms to have! She is convinced it's breast cancer and I am too. What do you all think?",

Thanks very much for replying to me. I really hope for some reason it is just mastitis or something but she says her gut tells her it's cancer. I've been reading everything I can on it. My mom and I fight a lot and this past week of worrying has shown me how much I love her. But I can't imagine what she must be going through or anyone who has to go through breast cancer at all. I will definitely post back when we find out.",
