    "Content": "most definetaly have her get a mammogram if thats what the doctor said. like smithn said, \"fibrocystic breast disease is very common. So are breast cysts\". i have fibromyalgia which makes the front of the breast bone hurt alot as well. My mom is a breast cancer survivor and her brothers died of cancer too. But i also have fibrocystic breast disease (which is painful) and i have had numerous breast cysts aspirations, where one ended in having it surgerically removed. those are very painful as well , especially if you have FBD to begin with. doesnt matter the breast side. im small and still have lots of problems with it, in fact a slight flareup of my fibro has caused a slight flareup of FBD to where theyre pretty painful right now even to touch. but if shes never had a mammogram, have them do one, or if she doesnt want to, then an ultrasound can find cysts if thats what she has. jen",
