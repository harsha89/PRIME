    "Content": "My gosh.... Get it checked out! Your young, your male, but you can STILL get it! Good luck to you, we pay taxes for a reason...can you apply for aid of some sort? Are you able to work? My cousin is bi-polar, a couple years older than you, and lives in FL...but since he couldn't work full time (he is now, medications are helping after many years of trial and error) he received medicaid and his medical bills and hospitalizations were covered. My best friend, who is self employed and her husband as well, just got hand surgery covered due to lack of insurance. Talk to someone from the state about your options, but please, regardless of financial ability, don't wait to get checked...just in case! Please let us know how you are!",
