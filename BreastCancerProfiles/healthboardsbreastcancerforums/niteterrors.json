    "Content": "My MIL was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago and refused Western treatment and opted for homeopathic therapies. She has kept her son (my husband) in the dark for the most part as she does not want him to worry, but this past summer she'd mentioned that the tumor had gotten larger; however she did not indicate how large was \"larger\". This fall, she reported developing an abscess on her chest that was bleeding through the skin and required multiple bandage changes daily. She had lost weight, going from 145 to 99 lbs over the course of a year, yet had gained 15 lbs back this year. She was hospitalized on New Year's Eve for arm edema and put on blood thinners to reduce clotting; however, she reported that this will increase the bleeding through the breast at the abscess. She is hesitant to have the breast removed. She did tell my husband that mestatsis has set in (not sure what that means) and that the doctors are wanting to remove the affected breast. My question pertains to what stage she may be in. I've searched the Internet for progression but since I do not know the size of the tumor, I can't base the progression on that and I can't find anything about arm edema associated with NON treatment, nor bleeding through the skin/abscess. My MIL has been pacifying my husband and has told my husband that this is nothing serious, nor life threatening, but I have my doubts. Perhaps someone here can give me some information as to what stage she may be in based on these symptoms? And if she is possibly in end-stage, how much longer might she have? Thank you.",
