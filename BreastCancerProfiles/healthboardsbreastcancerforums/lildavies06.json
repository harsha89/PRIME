    "Content": "I have recently broke out in a red rash around both nipples, Patches all over back and a bit on my right shoulder. I don't find it to be itchy, but it is very irritating in the fact that it is visible. It also becomes much more noticeable after sport and fitness. Please help, as I have not been to a doctor yet, thought Id see what the community knows.",
