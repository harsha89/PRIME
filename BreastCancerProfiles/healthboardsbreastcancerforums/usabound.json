    "Content": "I just had a biopsy on the 20th of Sept. for \"suspicious\" clustered microcalcifications. I've done hours of research due to being scared, as breast cancer does run in the family. I am finally getting my results on Oct. 3rd....it's been a long wait....dr was out of town, another dr couldn't get me in, and this not knowing is making my mind wander uselessly....actually it's more like a runaway train... 24/7. These calcifications being \"suspicious\" doesnt necessarily mean that I have pre-cancer any more than the next person does it....? I really am not sure what I am asking for here, maybe just a \"everything will be alright\"...my husband isn't that comforting and my family has sort of brushed it off...but here I am with 5 days left before I know. Thanks for any information.",
