    "Content": "I had this done last week, along with a mammogram. The report states the following: Indication: Palpable abnormality in the left axillary tail region and the left axilla showed prominent benign appearing lymph nodes with large central echogenic fatty notch. The palpable lymph node measures 2.5 cm x 2.1 cm. some hypoechognecity seen, suggestive of reactive edema. Other prominent lymph nodes in this area have similar appearance. These findings could be suggestive of reactive lymphadenopathy. Followup recommended in 4 months with repeat ultrasound. Bi-rads category 3: Probably benign. I currently have smoldering myeloma, and a past history of melanoma (10 years ago). Also thryoid cancer (20 years ago). I am 46 y/o female. Also I have felt \"something\" under my left arm for three months, and as of right now it is a very \"heavy feeling\" under my left arm... Anyone else with similar experience?? Should I worry? I am not sure what to make of all this... thanks for listening...",
