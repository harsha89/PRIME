Both were in her armpit in the lymph nodes. The first time it manifested it through drainage in the lungs, and this time (yesterday diagnosis) it was a 2cm lump. Go visit your doctor, please...

The radiologist has a tough job--they are the final say as to whether something is or isn't wrong--and they have to be thorough! Be grateful for the time they spent! You may want to follow up with your doctor...let them know you are anxious for the results. They expect it. Keep calling if that makes you feel better. With my mother we were always proactive when finding out test results. Hope this helps, Keep us posted! We care! Karie",

Feeling there, I felt a movable lump--much like a swollen duct or something--right where I have pain (on the side of my breast. I went to the GP today and she felt it too. I have now been referred to the breast center and don't know how I will wait that long (a few weeks she said). Anxiety builds as my mother died of breast cancer on Jan 7. She fought long and hard for 6 years. If this is a cyst, is there anything I can do to help it reduce in size or go away? I don't know what to do. Please help, Girl",

I made a conscious decision to cut caffeine out of my diet--the weekend was a bit excessive--a large coffee, many non-decaf black teas, lots of chocolate, chocolate cookies, HobNobs (yum) and I thought it best to take the matter into my own hands! I had something (lump) before but by the time I got to the ultrasound it was GONE. Hopefully this is the same type of thing.

Cancer is generally not painful. Best to try to keep on top of it all if you are able! (In that you are only 36, you may try to get subsidized government healthcare?) Karie",

I lost my mother to metastatic breast cancer (to the brain...but also present in the bones, lungs and on the skin) in January, so I can truly sympathize with your situation. She was first diagnosed in November 1998, and the first time it returned it was in 2001...September 11th (and I lived in NYC at the time...another story). She fought hard and was on so many drugs/chemos: doxorubicin and cycolphosphamide (A/C), Navelbine, taxol, taxotere, femara, Aredia, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), morphine...I could go on and on. She also had radiation and spinal fusion surgery. She really suffered, but through it all it was up to our family to manage her medical care....and that is exactly what we did up until the very end. She survived substantially longer than she would have if we left it up to her doctor, and we are so grateful! Kudos to you for realizing this. Doctors have many hidden agendas (pharmaceutical kickbacks, too many patients, long hours, etc...). Know you are in my thoughts and prayers. I will keep looking to see how you're doing!",

She lived exactly that, in the hospital cancer ward. She was incredibly happy there (the few days she was cognascent) and her doctors were more than happy to keep her there in lieu of taking her home (which was not an option).
