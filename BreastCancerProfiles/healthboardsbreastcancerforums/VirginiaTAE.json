      "Content": "In another week, I will be starting 6 weeks of radiation following a lumpectomy for DCIS. Oncologist told me I may experience a sunburn-like rash and fatigue, after about 3 weeks. He said some of the radiation will hit the lung and ribs - it's unavoidable but usually causes no long-term problems. He said the ribs may be slightly more vunerable to fracture if I were in a car accident or fell heavily on them. He also said they will map the beam so it will not affect the heart. In fact, I go in tomorrow for the mapping. Has anyone completed similar radiation and, if so, what side effects did you experience? Were you also told of possible effects to ribs/lung? I worry about such radiation exposure to a portion of the lung and any long-term health problems that may result.",

My cancer was a very aggressive type so we were doing all treatments to be thorough. I was told the exact same things you were. And it's not bad. The mapping as you know by now, is a long appointment involving pinpoint tatoos and lying still for a long while. That was the worst part. The radiation treatment itself is only about 5 minutes if that daily. I went in early, around 7:30 or 8 am, took my treatment and then went to work...I'm a teacher so I'm busy every day and I handled it with no problem. Now 4 years after my radiation treatments, there have been no long term side effects. You will probably get a bit of a \"sunburn\", but ask for some free samples from your radio-oncologist for medicated lotion or get a prescription. It helps keep your skin from being too dry. Good Luck!!! JollyGirl - Are you or have you been on Tamoxifen or any of the other anti-estrogen drugs? I don't need chemo, but was wondering if the treatment regimen is different if you've had chemo, as you have. Thanks for the feedback on radiation effects. I've already started using a cream that the nurse gave me a sample of. It's pretty expensive to order - $28 for a 2 oz. tube, but she said her patients love it. Haven't noticed any problems with skin yet, but it's only been a week since I've started my treatments.",

I go back for my 6-month post-biopsies followup in November. My outlook is different since my mom died. I think I would just do double mastectomy with no radiation. But I am probably depressed. Pat Hi, Actually I'm just in the middle of getting my rad treatments. Just completed treatment #15 out of 33. Won't start on Tamoxifen until after radiation is done, probably start it sometime in early November. The only side effects I've noticed from the rad treatments are a slight reddening of the skin in certain areas, but nothing very noticeable or severe. I use a special cream that I ordered \"Jean's Cream\", twice a day, and this seems to be really helping. I've also had a bit of fatigue but not too bad and not even every day. When it comes on, I just nap for a couple of hours and that seems to take care of it. I am concerned about Tamoxifen, though. It has some annoying (e.g. night sweats) and some very scary side effects. Never suffered from hot flashes when I went through menopause and I sure hope I don't have the night sweats that so many seem to get with Tamoxifen. Of even greater concern is the risk for endometrial problems and/or blood clots. Medical oncologist also told me there is a slight, but increased, risk of developing cataracts. Yikes! Does anyone have any stats about what percentage of women develop these more serious side effects while on Tamoxifen? I sometimes wonder if the risk is worth it.",

Actually the Tamoxifen scares me more than the radiation. Some of the side effects are not good, but it seems only a small percentage of women have any serious problems while on it. Guess we should be thankful there are such drugs now to further reduce chances of reoccurrence.",

      "Content": "Just finished my first week of radiation. No problems at all. I also met with the oncologist on Thursday. He meets with all patients each Thursday to see how you are, check you out, etc. I asked him again about possible damage to ribs and lung and he patiently answered all of my questions. He even showed me how the radiation is being applied, per the slides from my CAT scan when they did the mapping. It's only a very small portion of the lung that is even included, as well as a part of the ribs on that side. But he said any lung damage should be minor and will not give me long-term problems. He said that the part of the ribs that is exposed may be a bit more vulnerable should I suffer any trauma to that area, but otherwise they will be fine. The staff at this center is wonderful. I got some samples of creams to use and was told to use them now, even before any symptoms might arise. CarolineNC- Have you had your first visit with your medical oncologist yet? I did and he wants me to have some pre-Tamoxifen blood work done. Has yours ordered the same tests? I'm thinking he wants them to establish a baseline and to make sure I'm otherwise in good health before starting Tamoxifen. I go back to see him in late October, just before the radiation treatments will be done. Once radiation is over, I will probably be starting on Tamoxifen.",

I will ask them about acceptable lotions to use, if and when I start to show skin side effects. Luckily, the location of my treatments is only about 7 minutes from my home. My treatments, too, will be in the prone position. Still, the oncologist said some rib/lung exposure is inevitable. They will do all that they can to minimize it. Afterwards, I too will be on Tamoxifen. Will be interested in hearing how you are coping with it.",

Keeping my fingers crossed that my side effects are minimal or non-existent. I have heard that people have a hard time with joint pain on the aromatase inhibitors. My oncologist told me that 10% of women have to stop taking them because of the pain and another 20% just suffer along with the pain. Of course, with Tamoxifen, you have to be monitored for endometrial thickening. And there is a small risk of blood clots and possible eye problems. But he told me those risks were less than 1% of women using Tamoxifen. Similar to those on birth control pills.",

As great as these hormonal suppressor drugs are, there certainly seem to be some worrying side effects from all of them. Makes you wonder if the risk is worth it? I suppose it is, as long as you're monitored closely while on them. I will start Tamoxifen sometime in late October, after my 6 weeks of radiation are done.",

Will be starting radiation in about 2 weeks, then I must determine what, if any, hormonal drug to take. My oncologist seems to be pushing Tamoxifen, though I'm not really sure why. It is confusing as all of the drugs have unpleasant side effects and some of the possible side effects are more than a bit scary. What are the pluses and minuses to Tamoxifen versus one of the aromatase inhibitors? Is one more effective than the other in dealing with a non-invasive cancer such as mine? Would love to hear from ladies who have been on these drugs - especially if you had any bad side effects. Did you stop one and start another? Did you stop altogether? Also, why are they prescribed for 5 years? Anyone have any idea why this is the usual protocol?",

Have appt. with medical oncologist in late October to discuss follow-on hormonal treatment with Tamoxifen. The medical oncologist requested that I have the following 3 blood tests done before my appointment: Complete Blood Count, Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and LDH (which tests for levels of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase). I can understand the need for the first two, but why the LDH test? In what little I can gather, elevated LDH indicates tissue damage in various parts of the body. Has anyone else had this test done after a breast cancer diagnosis?",
