      "Content": "Hi I felt a lump in my breast about a year ago...I was 34, and didnt think much of it...I didnt even really consider it a \"lump\" so to speak. I have very large breast and they are lumpy every day...this was a small pea size something or another, It was hard, noticable but it was small and not painful at all...so it was easy to ignore. Later on I couldnt find it??? Would a real lump go away or always be there? I went to my next GYNO exam, let the doctor do his regular breast exam and he felt nothing so I let it go at that. With October being Awareness month...I saw adds and shows left and right that prompted me to get serious about what I felt all that time ago...I had my next Gyno exam (this would be about a year later) I told the doctor that I thought I felt something one time, but later it was gone...he again did his exam, felt nothing, and told me to have a mamo just to be safe??? (because I am getting Older) I am going to have my first Mamogram, in two weeks (I have rescheduled it Twice) and now I am so scared that this may be breast cancer. I feel that I may have actually ignored something important. How long is too long to have a lump go from, curable, to incurable? Is a lump always a lump? does it grow? do they dissapear? How fast does it spead or grow? I hope I am worried over nothing...",

      "Content": "Well, I had my Mamogram a few weeks ago...I have heard nothing from the Lab so I guess all is well...I guess I can now put aside this obsession thinking that I have BC and accept that I \"must\" be healthy as far as that goes. (Thank God) and I am truly thankful....thanks for the kind words and advice. The thing that gets me is I felt a very definate, pea sized hard mass, how normal is that? If I can be sure that its nothing, I could easily let it go...they dont usually miss anything do they? Thanks",
