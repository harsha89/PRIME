      "Content": "First of all don't worry. See your gyno on Tues, have him/her check it, and give you a script for a mammo. Don't worry about the mammo, it's not any big deal. They don't hurt, maybe just feel a little uncomfortable for a minute. To me, a mammo is easier than a pap smear....LOL next step if it shows up on the mammo, would be an ultrasound. Very painless! It's a breeze! I've just had a mammo that found a lump, and an ultrasound and they told me it's a benign cyst. I have fibrocystic breasts, which means they have a lot of lumps, but they're not bad lumps. Maybe you have the same thing. What I'm trying to say is just follow up on it, go thru the tests, and hopefully it won't be anything to worry about and you can put your mind to rest. Even if it is something, you found it early, can get it out, and go on to LIVE your life! Don't worry! You're doing the right thing! It will be ok!",

I don't know if it makes that much difference in the US, but it might. Cysts change during your monthly cycle, they come and go. I'm sure everything will be fine. keep us posted",

I'm hoping it will be like before, I had to do this and when I did, they didn't see anything and that was the end of it. That was a few years ago. They said it was probably just a cyst that comes and goes.",
