      "Content": "I have 2 1/2 years left on med. My Morton's Neuropathy is in my feet; it started in my right foot- tingling sharp shooting pains. I had a lot of foot cramping(I don't know if that is related). I went everywhere to find out what was wrong and then finally I went to ortho dr. he said it was Morton's Neur. The sharp shooting pain left and I developed a pain deeper in my foot. The dr.said he sees this a lot in women that are being treated for cancer. It has to do with swollen tissue surounding the nerve. The nerve finally develops a small tumor. Seven months ago my left foot started the burning etc. thing and I am wondering if it will duplicate my right foot. I did receive steriod injections in my foot, hips, and end of spine. The knees should not be too bad. Some dr. give lidocaine first so the site is numb. I guess it sounds like I complain alot...I really am happy to be alive and have had an early diagnosis. I know many women experience worse....my mom had breast cancer in the 60's. I sure it was estrogen receptive; back then they gave women hysterectomies as part of treatment. She had a bad time and finally lost her battle with cancer at the age of 42. So we are truly blessed to have the treatment we have, but it sure is miserable sometimes, isn't it? I hope your injection goes well and you get some relief. When the shots work (sometimes they worked -sometimes not) it is wonderful!!! Take care. Teresa",

She didn't have any of my records, so I have an appt to see her in two weeks. I told her about my symptoms and she told me not to focus on them...she said :\"where the mind goes so goes the body.\" Hello!!! I think it is the opposite in my case; \"where my body goes, so goes my mind\". I love life and have always been active...she asked me if it was just the BC diagnosis that has thrown me. It might have for a while, but I got back on my feet, went to work and continued on until I couldn't do the heavy lifting(I had to push 400lb cart and lift heavy IV fluid boxes) I just couldn't do it anymore. It is a physical thing not a mind thing...anyway My nodes were neg ...and my cancer was small. I was lucky they found it so early. I was diagnosised with fibro about a year ago...I guess I was diagnosised, everyone ortho dr., rheu dr, and therapist said initially they felt like I had it. I have not followed up on the fibro, I have been dealing with feet and lower spine. I will address the fibro now because that is what is causing me a lot of problems. I'm going to go for now...I'm going to try to get my mind right so my body can follow. Funny, I still see myself much younger and quite surprised when I look into the mirror. The dr. said I shouldn't be talking about symptoms either, so next time we can talk about our pets. Teresa",

I have fibro as well - I haven't been treated for it. I have carpal tunnel as well, SI joint arth. and bone cyst, end of my spine is severly diseased, etc. I wonder if when we finish treatment some of these problems will improve? Surely the fibro and muscle problems. Are you taking anything for the osteo? Fosomax or Boniva? I know prior to starting the med you had a bone scan...how often do you get a bone scan? Once again thanks for the info...you don't know how much this has helped me. I have friends but no one to correspond with regarding BC.",

The numbness in my chest got better and the area under my arm, to this day(2 1/2yrs later)is still somewhat numb. At times the area under my arm is still painful, but nothing like in the beginning. It does get better!!!! I hope you get a good nite sleep tonite! One thing is sure, I am grateful you found this message board early on ...it will give you much needed support. I didn't realize I hadn't recovered until a couple of weeks ago. This board and my lovely friends have helped me heal! God Bless. Teresa PS JOJO be sure to eat enough protein (doesn't have to be meat,it can be nuts, seeds,ect.) and drink a lot of water. I hope you heal quickly! Teresa",

      "Content": "Ok, ok, I do remember you writing about the tram flap procedure. When I had my mast. I stayed overnite (they really didn't want me to but I insisted) and I left with two drains. The surgeon prescribed Keflex and I believe I took that for two weeks. I had home nurses come once a day to express the drains and dress my wound. I had staples, did you guys? So I think I got off to a good start. When I had the drains removed I had a little fluid build up but that went away over several months time. My drains were in a little longer because I still had quite a bit of fluid. Wasn't that fun have those @!*!?## things removed. I think that was the worst for me. My oldest daughter went with me and she fainted. The nurse and I were joking with her saying she was trying to steal my \"attention\". Now everyone was worried about her because she fainted and not me for having those drains yanked out. She was very embarrassed. If there is ever blood involved my girls are 'down for the count\". It was so sweet because she was trying to be brave and be there for me. Bless her heart. The plastic surgeon (tram flap) said that sometimes women will have a small area of skin that does heal exactly the way it should. He showed me pictures of several women. I didn't think it was bad at all. My daughter has a friend whose mom had the procedure and she had that same small area that didn't heal properly. The mom said she would do it all over again and was quite pleased with the results. The little green bouncing thing is shown after you click on [More]. I am so happy to hear about your vacation. It really helps to have fun to do in the near future. I am going to visit my middle daughter the second week in May. I can't wait! Have good evening! Teresa",

I can understand if you have a radical, but I have not. There was a lady that wrote a book on her dlb mast procedure and reconstruction. She had implants and personaly I like the way they look; I would just like to get rid of stubborn belly fat. My oldest daughter, 34, lives in Atlanta. I love to visit her. The last time I did we went to the Aquarium. That was an experience I will not forget. I have been to other Aquariums but none like this one. I believe it is the second largest in the world. The only thing seperating me from a whale was a piece of plexiglass. You'll have to go!!! Plus I always like to go to the Botanical Gardens; they have different exhibits-artsee-fartsee. Daughters are definitely a blessing. I have been blessed with 3 wonderful ladies. Good Nite. Teresa",

Anyway feet are swollen-I'm going to walk tomorrow again. CJ how are your feet? Yes I wish I would have been offered Pt for my arm...I was out six weeks and went back to doing the same heavy work I had been doing. I think I mentioned I eventually went to an ortho dr who said he would put me on temporary disability until I found another job.(sit down job) Six months later and I still haven't found a job. My employer will not appointment me to another position of equal \"intellectual skills\" and they won't take me out of their system so I can cash out my 401k, which is under a thousand dollars. I really don't know if I can work for eight hours straight. I get tired getting ready to go to the store. Oh, I always have faith that everything will work out and it always does. JOJO I don't think there is a bad nut...almonds, cashews,pecans, ...I can't buy peanuts anymore-I can't stop eating the whole bag. Sunflower seeds are good. I think salmon would be great. Also we have talked about omega 3's ...does anyone use flax seed or meal? I was eating a lot of soy protein, no one told me not to eat it. I always felt so good after eating tofu and such, now I know why. I tried the melatoin; it worked for me. You don't have to take very much. I put 1mg under my tongue and by the time it dissolved I was asleep. Good nite Linder, I hope your feet are ok. Good nite, God Bless... Teresa",

My cancer was not her2 positive, only estrogen receptive and to be honest I don't remembe if it was IDC or the other. It was caught early, so if I continue to take the hormone therapy, there is a good chance I can stay cancer free.(I think!) My dr. didn't even tell me about not having soy products but darn if he didn't always ask me if I was drinking my green tea! Now I want to do something positive.(Spring, help from you guys, etc) During the winter I was in a funk and I didn't think I was coming out. I didn't keep my dr. appts. or anything...But I'm on it now. I want to take care of my self, I didn't necessarily think the cancer was going to get me as much as the inactive lifestyle I have developed due to the pain.

Right now I'm nervous about posting because I'm afraid of saying something I shouldnt. So please let me know if i do I'm a nurse and it is HARD not to share my nursing experience, but again they are my personal experiences. I was diagnosed with BC May 30th 2006 following my mammogram. I found the lump as I've had severe fibrocystic disease all my life and had had 3 biopsies in the past so used to doing breast checks. June 15th I had a lumpectomy which did not show clear margins on path so had my mastectomy July 13th. After that I went thru chemo and radiation and this past Dec. 12th I started my arimidex. I don't really know all the side-effects and which problems i've been having are related to the arimidex. I got the neuropathy from chemo and my onc said it will go away in six months. I'm also diabetic so I don't expect it to go away totally. It is much better now, only in fingers and toes versus hands and feet. Then I've had pain in my right hip radiating down to my right knee. I has been a 10 out of 10 pain left at its worse. I initially thought it was bone pain from my arimidex but my onc told me usually the bone pain from arimidex is only in the hands and feet. Does that sound right? The pain down my leg is just on the outside part of my leg, not inner leg. I do have mega back problems from 38 yrs of nursing so they are thinking the pain is from my back problems like a pinched nerve? I do have an \"old compression fracture\" at about L2, and 3 bulging discs and lord knows what else. I have done 2 weeks of physical therapy ordered by my rheumie and it has really helped. I am now able to lift my leg more than 2 inches off the ground without it hurting. The muscle and hip pain is better but not gone. Does this sound similar to your guy's pain???? There's also a possibility that I have a fracture right rib probably related to my radiation treatments. My radiation doc to me I would be at high risk for rib fractures following my radiation. Also I understand my risk for fractures is also increased if i'm on Arimidex. Were you guys told this? They said it may be fractured from coughing. Cj...you said you have a lung nodule? Did they do any tests to diagnosis it? Did they give you any idea of what it could be? Six months to sit on it seems like a long time?? I have a lung nodule as well, smaller now, but I know what mine is is why I am asking. You are in NY right? Have you ever been to Arizona, California or New Mexico? Now I'm a bit nervous to ask much more on this issue in fear of breaking posting rules This is my first nite here and I don't want to be banned from something I say lol. Have you ever heard of Valley Fever? Teresa, what profession are you in pushing boxes of IV fluid's? Work in a pharmacy or central supply? nurse? I was tickled to find this place. I have a gf that has really been by my side through this but sometimes I feel bad talking about my cancer with her all the time so its nice to find someplace where you can talk about it. Teresa? where are you from? Thanks for sharing your stories Linda",

      "Content": "Linda, Yeah!!! No new fractures. It probably feels like you have them just the same. Yes I'm moving and walking some. My feet are swollen and I am sore but I was sore anyway. My mood has improved. I don't know if we have talked about this or not (faultly memory) Have either of you ladies experienced poor memory? Mine was very bad; I almost burned the house down a couple of times. Seems to be improving some now. I do crossword puzzles and read. I think it has to do with the estrogen or lack of. I remember when I was pregnant I would be forgetful. A couple of months ago I was more than a little forgetful!! (I don't know what this has to do with anything ) but since the pet food scare I have made my gal Kate's food(my mastiff). She sticks to me like glue now. I think she really likes my cooking...brown rice vegies fruit turkey. By the way, she had a lump in her breast too, it was on the same side as my lump, but her lump was not canerous. Bye for now.",

      "Content": "Linda, I always shop at health food stores and always have. (Hippie generation although not a hippie) I try to always buy organic or locally grown food although the town I'm in there is not a good selection. We have a few stores that are starting to include a larger assortment of Organic foods. I take a vitamin that has CQ10 and omega fish oil in it. I like fish too. I avoid some meats but if I am out and that particular food is offered, I eat it. I really eat healthy and don't have any bad habits other than inactivity. I have got to get into PT so I can start moving again. The inactivity has just been the last six months; prior to that I was in a job that was too stressful physically. I would drag my butt to work but come home and just die!! I have not had the right kind of exercise in along time. This is going to change. I feel like I need an antidepressant as well. I asked my new dr and after she reviews my records -she will respond. I feel some better since the seasons have change. I am on Toprol XL, Dyazide, and Arimidex. I use naprosyn sometimes, I'm in pain most all the time, but I don't like to take anti-inflam because I feel they counter act my dyazide. I am glad to know Gil Monster's are good for something other than looking big and tuff!!! I've never heard of that; pork beef ect but never gila monster. Got to go. Take care!!! Teresa",

      "Content": "I was wondering if either of you ladies had thought about the type of reconstruction where they remove the belly fat and make a breast with it ? I was going to have this surgery when I started having a lot of bone issues. It is a big surgery and there is a risk of tissue rejection. I saw some pictures of the ladies the dr. had reconstructed and they looked great. I was referred to the plastics dr by my onc. because he said the plastics dr did 'good work'. One of the benefits is you get a tummy tuck and a boob job at the same time. The dr. said after you have it you shouldn't lift more than 5lbs. I think I could handle that part! . Tell me what you think. Thanks Teresa PS if we have covered this please repeat again. You know about my memory",

(just kidding, I'm going to walk) Your family sounds great!! Do any or all of your children live at home? My youngest daughter lives at home. By the way, I have divorced since 1984. I was married for 13 years. I really didn't have a chance to heal from that either, I'm finding...I was too busy trying to figure out how I was going to support and raise 3 children! They are \"reared\" now and I am wondering, NOW WHAT?Life is an adventure and I live each day to the fullest. (of course I am not climbing mts snow skiing etc, but within my 'realm', I live it up!) Gas prices are \"ridiculous\" I would love to get a more environmentally sound vehicle but for now that is now in the futue! The prices here for gas is $2.69-$2.79. The cost of living is cheaper in the south. Wages are less and min.wage is less. You know I don't know if anyone has thought about it but with min wage 5.15 here and a gallon of gas 2.79...well you do the math. The big problem here is: we do not have a good mass transit system like people in the big cities do. If we could take a train or bus that would be wonderful. Atlanta is great!!!You can go anywhere-anytime!!! Here we have a bus, but it only runs certain hours 8am-6pm. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T WEAR SHOES EITHER.(CAN'T AFFORD 'UM) Drink a lot of filtered water. I have one of those things you pour water through...you know the ones. I like it!! It is hard to break the carbonation kick. Occassionaly I still have a diet coke. I like the fizz. Bye for now. TA TA Teresa",

I would stay up for days at a time and when you have day time things you have to do (take care of husband children etc) it really becomes a vicious circle. You get wound tighter and tighter. Things do get better; I never took a sleep aid other than benadryl, melatonin, phenergan--melatonin has the least side effects. I have worked in a pharmacy setting for 25 years. I have hear some people doing some sleep walking when taking ambien, but that is in extreme cases and I think the people had been taking ambien for a long time. Cj, do your ankles swell? That is what has got me concerned.. Oh well, Linder are you there? Hope you are doing well! I've got to get a resume ready. Teresa",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone!!! Well, I've been out of sorts lately...grumpy, grouchy, irritable,you know. It's not like me, but I guess as of late, it is like me. I think I'm trying to decide whether I should stay in this house or move. My daughter likes living here...I have a big yard. My daughter is very busy and doesn't have time for yard work. I really don't feel like doing yard work. I love my yard but sometimes it is hard to enjoy knowing I can't keep it up. I am not working at this time and my daughther is bringing home the bacon so to speak. Oh well. Larger abdomen? Are you kidding? I was always 110-120 even up until I reached 50. I had the partial hysterectomy when I was 45. I noticed gradual changes up til 50, getting thicker etc. I have probaby gained 50 or 60 lbs in 4 yrs. I gained some before I was diag. with bc but tamoxifen really started to put the weigh on me. I don't find arimidex much different. The few steroid shots I had didn't help either. BUT YES, my belly is jelly. Linder I am glad you are feeling better. I too have thought about going into a little home business. Like natural products, you know the ones that have been about since the seventies? I sold them in the seventies and wish I would have kept with it. I believe in the purity of the products. I don't really know if I could support myself, but knowing the product is good, I would believe in what I was selling. I thought about pet services:taking care of peoples pets in their homes when they are away. I already do this for a lady who is out of town a lot. She has visited every country in the past year. Linder I believe my money was taxed before insurance. I haven't done anymore investigation on the disability issue, right now I'm in denial of having to pay any more taxes. I feel like the error was on their part, if there was an error, and if I need to pay more, I'm sure they will get in touch with me. I just regret not writing down her id number. I do not think I'm in my golden years and these years have sucked so ....just kidding. Yes, my mouth is dry, skin is dry, eyes are dry etc. I don't know if it is arimidex, could be something else. Swelling is down...I've noticed it is temp related. I think. CJ hope it dries up there soon ...girl you might have to invest in a boat or arc or something. Gotta go. Teresa",
