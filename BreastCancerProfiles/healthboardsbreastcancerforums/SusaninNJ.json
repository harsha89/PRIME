    "Content": "I don't know if this will be helpful, but I'll tell you about my recent experience. A routine Mammogram found a suspicious mass. I had a core biopsy - no cancer. I just had an excisional biopsy - again, no cancer, but the lymph node was enlarged. Now I'm waiting 2 more weeks while that is tested. There's very little information to be found.
