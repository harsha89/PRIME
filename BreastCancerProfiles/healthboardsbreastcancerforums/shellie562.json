    "Content": "Sitting here this a.m....thinking about the events that have played out in my life in the past week I decided to share a portion of my own exp. in an effort to hopefully help others. So here goes.... I am 40 yrs. old & have had \"tender\" breasts most of my life. Due to my age & probably genetics as well, I have very dense breast tissue therefore mammograms have proven a waste of time EVERYtime... A wk. prior to Valentine's Day I noticed an occasional ache in my left breast...later I noticed that when holding my Grandson, my breast was sore...soon after I began to notice that crossing my arms made my breast hurt...the pain wasn't constant & honestly my self diagnosis was a breast cyst which I had exp'ed 8 yrs. previous...Self exam didn't reveal any changes or lumps...My mind kept reverting back to all that I have read & also been told by Dr.'s....\"Breast Cancer is almost never painful....\" Still my instinct whispered that something wasn't right...Just for good measure & precaution, I sched'ed an appt. w/ my Family Dr...The 1st thing out of my Dr.'s mouth was that breast cancer is rarely painful & that was the point that he returned to many times during this & the next 3 visits. \"....Painful...No palpable lump...no family history....You're young age...You have dense breasts...You have fibrocystic breasts.....\"---were all points that he (Dr.) made repeatedly of the course of the next month. A mammogram resulted in the usual \"inconclusive\" & an ultrasound was ordered to follow....I got dressed following the ultrasound & the tech came in to tell me I was being sent to a Women's Cancer Center that SAME DAY. When the oncologist reviewed my ultrasound he did a core biopsy & skin punch biopsy w/in the hr. My biopsies have now proven to me that Cancer isn't always painless & Dr.'s are often too eager to dismiss a pt. presenting w/ pain.... Just wanted to share my own experience. Listen to YOUR whisper. If you feel that something isn't right, it generally isn't! Thanks for allowing me the platform to share Shellie",
