      "Content": "I got a call today about my mammogram and ultrasound and they told me all were normal. However I still have the huge lump in my left breast and its quite painful. The report said it is a palpalble mass but it isnt a cyst and it is benign. I still have the appointment with breast specialist in Jan--and I definitely am keeping that appointment. But could they actually say it isnt a problem-meaning not cancerous without doing a biopsy??Any help would be great. thanks in advance! they said they compared it with my last mammogram and there has been no change in my breasts.But this lump is definitely a change??",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for all the responses. You are a great group of people and a tremendous support while waiting to see drs and see what the next step is. I found out today from my GI dr that I have to have my gallbladder out and I also found out that the surgeon is also a breast surgeon. So I have an appt on this Friday for a consult and hopefully he can do a aspiration or the lump or biopsyof the breast in the office. Will keep you posted!",

      "Content": "Well I just got back from having my annual pap and they found a lump while doing the breast exam. The dr said not to worry because the more he tried to feel it- the more sore and painful it got. He said that cancerous lumps are not painful??Is that true?? The lump in rather lumpy too and has irregular borders. I couldnt get my mammogram scheduled til almost a month from now. So waiting to find out is hard and I was told not to worry- easier said then done. The interesting thing is then my drs office called and said they wanted me to see a breast specialist??So now I am wondering why that now?and the breast specialist cant see me til Jan!! Eeek! Anyways any information or experiences would be greatly appreciated! My aunt and great aunt had breast cancer but they were diagnosed in their 70's.",

      "Content": "HI Cj, Thanks for the response. I did contact my drs office and they were like it is being addressed and so that was that. I was actually thinking of maybe trying to see someone else since I pretty much can do that on my own. The waiting will drive me nutso especially throughout the holidays. I am gonna call them on Monday again and try to be a little more persistant! Waiting two months is nuts.",
