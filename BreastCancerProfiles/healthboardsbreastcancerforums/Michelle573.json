I am praying it is a cyst (i sometimes get those) my dr. should be calling early next week to let me know.",

      "Content": "my ultrasound showed cysts that have apparently been there for quiet a long time, but have grown. they are now causing me pain pretty much all month long now. they are sending me to a breast specialist to determine if they want to biopsy or drain them. they officially diagnosed me with fibrocystic breast disease. the concern there is that the cysts could contain hyperplasia cells. i don't know enough about that to comment on it, but i intend to learn. the masses were not solid, so i guess that's good, but i would have rather had nothing...but then wouldn't we all on here",

      "Content": "I had my annual gyn. appt yesterday. In doing my breast exam, the dr noticed my right nipple has become retracted. He examined me with my arms above my head and with my hands on my hips pushing inward. He said the result was the same with both exams. He is sending me to get labs and a mammogram next with, with a follow-up with the surgeon. Needless to say, I am a little nervous... My question is this, aside from the obvious, what other diagnosis would these symptoms be related to?",
