    "Content": "Hello. A few days ago, I located a hard, round lump about the size of a pea on my breast. It is located on my right breast, just under the edge of my areola, sorry if that is misspelled, and it's kind of painful when I push on it. It has a distinct round shape, and I can pretty much grab onto it (I hope that makes sense). I was just wondering if you can get lumps under your nipple in this area, and if so, is it something to worry about? I've waited a few days to see if it was an enlarged gland or something, but it has not gone away. Also, I don't know if this makes a difference or not, but, I'm only 25, my mother had a breast cancer scare once, and I'm bipolar and on meds for that. Thanks in advance for any information that you can offer. Batmantis",
