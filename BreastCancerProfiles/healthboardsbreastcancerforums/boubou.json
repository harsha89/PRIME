      "Content": "Can I get more specific than that? mammogram in november, they got me to come back 3 times. After the last time, they decided to get a biopsy to be certain these amorphous cluster microcalcifications are benign. Spent an hour today in the mammogram unit with the surgeon trying to get a picture of the calcs so that he could biopsy them only to be told : \" I think they are just too small, I can't see them enough to take a biopsy right now\" They are there and you have other benign ones so I suspect that these are also benign. We'll call you back in 2 or 3 months and take a new mammogram just to see if it's changing or not.\" Any idea out there? should I worry or breath a sigh of relief?",
