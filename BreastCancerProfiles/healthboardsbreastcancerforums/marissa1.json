      "Content": "Hi Leea, Thank you for your comment. I'm told that because I have Lupus as well that that this contributes to the tightness in my chest and as a result between that and the scar tissue I feell 24/7 like I have a wide leather strap pulled tight around my chest. You would think that after ten years one would just get use to it, but you dont. To be quite honest it has made my life a living hell. I'm happy to hear that you are doing so well. Darla",
