    "Content": "Hi everyone, For about a month I would get this sharp pain in my left breast. It was a sharp shooting pain last a few seconds and then go away. A week ago the same breast was a little tender to touch. 3 days ago, near the top of the same breast (closer to my breast than armpit area) I had a lump/mass start under the skin. That same day it began to grow its now a little bit bigger than a golf ball. It has not moved and its very firm. Its bright red and has brusing on it. Its so hot to touch. The redness fades alittle has it moves down the breast. There are small indentations on the lump. Sometimes it can be very itchy. I havn't noticed anything leaking out of my nipples. It feels like its attached to a muscle because I can only raise that arm a little before it hurts. When I bend down and my breast fall it hurts horrible. I try and not wear a bra but then I have to walk around holding it. I'm 31 years old, not on my period, not preg. (had tubes tied), I'm not sick. I feel great other than that. I have tried a warm compress but that doesn't do anything. My doctor won't be back into town till Wednesday. Has anyone else had this? If you need more questions answered just ask. Thanks for reading.",
