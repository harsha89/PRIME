      "Content": "TomatoJuice-My prayer for you is that you may be calm, that you may be happy and that you may be free from suffering. It is a meditation that has its roots in the centuries old Buddhist practice of metta meditation also known as loving kindness. I will keep you in my meditation. I know without a doubt that all your friends at the Osteo board would love to hear from you now so that they can offer you their support and continued friendship. What are the next steps that you need to move through now? Just know that you are not alone. I know that you said that you were up late last night. Are you generally doing ok with sleep , it is really important now. Yesterday I completed my ct scan with contrast and tomorrow will be the biopsy. Apparently they say it will take an hour and a half-that seems like a long time.",

Which considering the alternatives was better than expected. I know you have been through alot and I will keep you in my prayers. Your friend. OB",

      "Content": "Tomato Juice-I believe I have read your messages at the Osteoporosis Board. I am sorry to hear what you are going through. It sounds like the past few weeks have been quite a journey for you.But you seem to have moved through something now that your plan is becoming more clear. Your positive attitude and gratitude as well as your \"Let it Be\" will serve you well and are an inspiration to me. On Friday last week during what I thought was a routine ultrasound of my thyroid ( I am hypothyroid) a 3cm.(approx one inch) tumor was found not in my thyroid but in my neck in the lymph gland.The tumor is soft and moveable. Needless to say my weekend was difficult. I am now waiting for a needle biopsy to be scheduled. At times like this things seem to go so slow. Just like you, when the doctor talked to me about the u/s radiology report I was so stunned , I hardly knew what to say. I didn't get a copy of the report-I just knew I would have a very bad time with the details now. I am hoping to get in to my pcp this week so we can go over the details together and I can get a better idea of what is happening. I have no idea if the lymph gland tumor is secondary and whether or not there is a primary cancer site somewhere else or whether it is even cancer. The size and location though are weighing on me now. What a journey we are on. I hope that I can arrive at the attitude that you are fostering in yourself. Are you taking any meds to deal with your situation now? Are you feeling daily stress and having trouble with sleep?",

And, that as you walk through your days, your appointments and meetings that you feel an abiding calm. Let it be so for all of us. My wellness counselor had breast cancer diagnosed a year ago, a very aggressive form, she is doing well and thankful for each moment and has a hearty laugh to prove it.",
