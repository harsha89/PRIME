    "Content": "Hi, I had 38 radiation treatments following mastectomy and chemo. I had one beam just to the breast area, and a 2nd beam to the clavicle area, to target the lymph nodes in that region. You won't have that, I am sure, I only had that because my CA was invasive and I had so many lymph nodes involved. I have very fair skin, and still I tolerated the treatments well. My radiation ONCO was excellent. I did get tired some, but I had to have gallbladder surgery in the middle, just missed one day of treatment. I did turn red on my back where the beam to the shoulder was, but I did not have more than a faint sunburn to the breast area. My onco told me to put good skin cream or lotion on AFTER each treatment (I think I used Eucerin). Make sure your skin is clean and lotion-or-deodorant free before each treatment. I did develop a cough after treatment, they called it radiation pneumonitis, and I kept it for 6 months. That might not be a risk for you though. It went away, but I have noticed I tend to cough more now, even after a yr and a half. Cigarette and wood smoke bother me now, especially, and I get frequent chest colds in the cold and flu season. I think that is due to the radiation. Sorry so lengthy, hope it helps!",
