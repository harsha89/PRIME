    "Content": "I am a 51 year old, going through menopause. I had my annual mammogram on 03/01 and had to return for a diagnostic one later that same month. I had some microcalcifications that showed up this year in my mammogram. I had to schedule an appointment with a breast surgeon and saw him on 5/14. He didn't seemed too concerned but did say that I needed to get a stereotactic biopsy to remove some of the calcifications and tissue around them. The stereotactic biopsy was done the afternoon of 5/17 (it was not a fun procedure and wish I had taken Xanax or Valium before it!). I was expecting to hear the results within a few days. I called my doctor today, 5/21. The nurse said that they were still awaiting the results from the lab. Also, that the doctor would go over the results with me in a follow-up appointment. So now I am nervous! The earliest appt I could get was on 6/04. I expected to get results over the phone - such as benign, schedule your follow up mammogram in 6 months. How long does it really take to get the results back? Do I need to be worried? How do I get through the next two weeks not knowing if my results are benign or not? Thanks for any advice.
