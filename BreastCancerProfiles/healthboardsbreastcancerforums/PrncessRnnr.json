      "Content": "Heres an update and please give me any feedback you may have because I am struggling to get through the waiting game. Last week my Oncologist had me do several tests. 2 MRI's, 1 on the head and one of the breasts. I had to be sedated for both of these and it took 4 attempts each to get an IV in. Then I also had a PET scan, this was very strange as they left me in a room for 45 minutes alone so that I would not share my radioactiveness (is that really a word?) Then I had yet another CT scan of my pelvis, stomach and lungs followed up with a chest xray. I feel every inch of my body has been scanned and nothing shall be left unnoticed. However, now I wait and worry how all these tests my turn out. I meet with my dr. on Thursday for all the results. We already now that another surgery must be done since they did not get clean margins with the last one. Now we must decide whether a mastectomy is the way to go this time around. I just hate the hurry up and wait game. Any words of wisdom?",

      "Content": "Well it looks like I will be going to UCLA for my surgery. I am hoping to go for my consultation next week. Things seem to be taking forever due to insurance. So here is my question now. I am wondering if I have a mastectomy what the recovery period is like. How long should I anticipate being in the hospital? How long should I plan to take off from work? What is the pain level like? Keep in mind they want to remove a couple of lymph nodes and I will be having the skin stretching implant put in at the same time. I am just a bit freaked out about this because I am hearing this is a pretty intense surgery and that I will be laid out for awhile. Can you guys share your experience with this type of surgery with me. Oh and thanks so much for all the support. You guys have been awesome on here. It's nice to have a place to go where people actually understand what you are going through. And I love all the advice.",

      "Content": "Good news. all test results came back okay. No cancer showed up anywhere else in my body. So after long discussion with my Oncologist my husband and I have agreed with our dr. and I will be having a mastectomy on my right breast and then reconstructive surgery. I too am very small breasted and my dr. feels that another surgery will not leave me with much of a breast at all. Since they have to go in again for clear margins she said it is just easier to remove the entire breast and also a couple of lymph nodes that are showing up a bit enlarged on all MRI's and ctscans. We are leaning towards the skin sparring (?) surgery and having this stretching implant put in then having actual implants put in after about 4 months. The issue now is where to do the surgery. Seems that our insurance is not acceptable with any plastic surgeons in our area. My dr is leaning towards sending me to either UCLA, USC or Stanford. Funny my insurance is acceptable there. I should say my husband is in the military so finding an off base surgeon has not been an easy task. Right now it is another waiting game. I am just ready to get this over with.",

      "Content": "I just wanted to say good luck and be strong if you can. Funny that I say this to you because I too just had calcifications show up on my mamo from a month ago, underwent a needle biopsy that came back with carcinoma in situ. This Thursday I am under going another surgery to remove more of the area. My head is still spinning as this has all happened so quickly. But it is nice to know there are other women out there that have gone through this or are going through it. What a great support system.",

      "Content": "Just thought I would share with you my issues, or at least part of them. I am currently getting ready for a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery also by a great and well respected LA hospital. UCLA - I met with the drs. from the Breast Care Center and the Plastic Surgery Clinis on Friday. I too have a lymph node that is showing up on mammos and feel larger then normal to the touch. However the surgeons said that based on my MRI's, CTscan and PET scan it does not appear to be anything other then just an inlarged lymph node. Caused by a number of things other then cancer. But since I am under going a mastectomy they are going to do a sentinal node biopsy just to be safe. But they seemed pretty certain the cancer had not spread. I have DCIS and it is not invasive. Perhaps a second opinion for you would be worth the peace of mind. When it concerns your life and well being you can not be to certain. Best of luck to you",
