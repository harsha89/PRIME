      "Content": "Thanks for the Glutamine info. Have had several people recommend it, even my oncologist said \"it couldn't hurt\". Haven't had any problems so far with 2 doses of Taxol/Herceptin. Had the same pre-drugs as you. Just had the regular problems with A/C.....terrible taste in the mouth where NOTHING tastes good, hair fell out, etc. Didn't do the Luesta shots either. Did get sent into INSTANT menopause after the 3rd dose (am 52 but never had any s/s of menopause yet). NOT FUN!! Hot flashes quite the nuisance!! Labs were low before the 3rd but they gave it anyway and so for about 4 or 5 days after I was really tired. I still go to my Pilates class 3X a week so energy isn't a poblem for me with the chemo. Hope Taxol goes as smooth....NOT HAPPY that eyelashes and brows are going now....for some reason I was led to believe hair would start growing back IN during Taxol. I guess that isn't correct???",

      "Content": "Hi! Looks like we are in the same boat! Did the 4 AC and now have 2 Taxol/Herceptin treatments under my belt with 10 more to go of the Taxol (and the Herceptin for a year). Didn't loose the eyelashes or brows with AC but now am with the Taxol. Does anyone know if the L-Glutamine works for the bone pain and nueropathy? What is the dose to take? Haven't had any problems yet, just want to PREVENT any. Thamks!",
