    "Content": "Has anyone out there tried Letrozole? After breast cancer surgery I was on chemo for 6 months and then Tamoxifen for 5 years. Now my Dr. says I should start Letrozole for another 5 years. Apparently this prevents the cancer from coming back or spreading. I would be interested in any comments, side effects, mood changes, etc. that are associated with taking this medicine. Thanks for your help. I appreciate it.",
