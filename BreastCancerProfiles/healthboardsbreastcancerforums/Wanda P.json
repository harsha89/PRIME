    "Content": "Hi, I am terrified,, Let me explain alittle more, I had a mammogram which showed \"something\", it was followed by an ultasound that same time for a better look, the tech told me it appeared to be a small cyst,, 2 days later I got a call from my physician that he was makeing an appointment for me with a surgeon,, The physician told me the area was about 1/2 inch. I just seen the surgeon yesterday and he didnt spend no more then 5 seconds looking for it and right away scheduled a biopsy for Wednesday, almost like he didnt have the time to see waht was there. I am frightened beyond belief, mostly because I am scared to death of cancer, not that cancer runs in my family, not that it matters when it comes to breast cancer. So I am going to have a \"Mammotome\" breast biopsy,, and what I would really like to know is 1/2 inch considered large when it comes to breast cancer, in other words, IF it is cancer is it considered early?? thanks again",
