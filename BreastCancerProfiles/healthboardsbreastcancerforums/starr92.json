      "Content": "I too have found a lump i am having it removed on June 22, they think it is a fibroadenoma (benign) they are more common in younger women (i'm 30). It is also easier to feel mine when i am laying down, but i also had to find it first with my fingers and then have the doc feel it. I agree with Twiggy do what ever you have too to have the doc feel it and also ask for an ultrasound. It is better to be safe than sorry! Please keep us posted. Starr92",

      "Content": "Hi Guys, Went to the surgeon today, he's pretty sure it is a fibroadenoma. He gave me the option to either leave it or have it removed. I think for MY piece of mind i might have it removed to be 100% sure. He said it would be done at the hospital (outpatient) with a local. Twiggy thanks for your input since you just went through this, how did the removel go? How long did it take? was it done in a hospital? How big is the scar? Sorry for all the questions but i have never had any kind of anything done to me! LOL A little nervous! My lump is about the size of a pea. Thanks Again for all you help!",

      "Content": "Hello All, I have been having alot of pain (tender, Sore) in my left breast for about 3 weeks. I was doing a breast exam and felt a small lump about the size of a pea.I went to my gyno yesterday he also felt it and sent me to get a mammogram/ultrasound. Which i got done today, the mammogram showed nothing,(they said probalby because of my age i'm 30)so they did the ultrasound. the lump i have the tech said is very mobile and she had a hard time seeing it on ultrasound she actually had to hold her finger on the lump and then place the wand right over it to try and catch it. When the doc came in he really did'nt say much, but i did ask if it was a cyst and he said no. He suggested i get another ultrasound in 3 months, but i have an appt with a breast surgeon on Thursday so i will see what he thinks. Sorry this is so long but i can't sleep or eat i am so scared when i think of breast cancer. Has anyone had an experience with a lump you can feel but not see?? I also have pain in my breast as well as under my arm, any ideas what this could be?? Any help would be great",

      "Content": "Well that doesn't sound to bad... i don't know if i could watch though! I would be curious as to what the \"lump\" actually looks like though. My is kinda on the outer part of my breast closer to my armpit, so maybe the scar will not be that noticable. At first i was thinking i would just leave it but the more i think about it, it's driving me NUTS! Better to get it out and be safe. I am going to call the surgeon's office in the morning and see when i can get this done. I will let you know when i get a date hope it is soon. Thank You so much for taking the time to answer my questions, it really does help!",

Two more questions for ya..LOL How long after the procedure was done were you able to leave the hospital? Right after or do you go to some kind of recovery? And last how quick do you get the results back? Thanks so much for listening and helping!",

      "Content": "Hi Twiggy! You must have read my mind as i just thinking about posting to you for more questions! I have a date set for June 16th for pre-admission testing? blood work etc. The surgery date is set for june 22 at noon. They told me to report at 10:30A.M. for admission etc. Is this how it worked for you? I really am looking forward to getting this over with, but i am very nervous about getting it done!! if that makes any sense? They also told me i would be given a local with sedation? Is this what you had or only the local? I am not sure if i want to be sedated, i just want to kinda of get in and get out of there ya know! LOL Also i am worried because alot of what i have read says that fibroadenoma is not painful? My breast is tender right around where the lump is and a dull ache in my armpit, (the lump is on the outer part of my left breast close to my armpit) Did you also have pain like this with yours? Sorry for all the questions but this waiting is so hard... I THANK YOU so much for taking the time to answer my questions! i really am grateful!",

(Surgeon was running late) surprize,surprize! But once he took me, the surgery took about 1/2 hour and wasn't that bad. I am very sore today though, because it was on the outside of my breast i can't even move or lift my arm without it \"pulling\" on the incision. He said it looked benign and not to worry, i go see him for a follow up on thurs. 6/30 and he will have the path report then. I am so happy that part is over! Now i just have to heal and wait again for the report! Being on this board has really halped me get through this so thanks again! Twiggy how are you feeling? Starr",

You are right about the waiting it is driving me NUTS!! I can't stop thinking about it. But i am so lucky i have wonderful family around me who are very supportive and a great husband, i thank god for that. The fact that the lump is mobile, and is painful is a good sign but you never know. I also have a pain in my left shoulder blade which the gyno said could be from this, but the doc today said no?? So that is confusing also? It is so scary when this happens. I thank you again and i will keep you posted as i find out more!",
