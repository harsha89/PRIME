    "Content": "my mom had breast cancer and the same thing happened with her. she got her first mammogram and she had a spot and they didn't worry about it. then, the doctors just stopped worrying about it and she forgot about her biopsy. she waited til she felt a bigger mass on her breast and went to the doctor. she had stage four breast cancer and her spot grew from tiny(micro-sized) to the size of a half dollar. she didn't have any family member that had it either.. so if i were you, I'd go have it checked out and take every step possible. if you want more than your doctors opinion, go to multiple doctors. do what it takes.",
