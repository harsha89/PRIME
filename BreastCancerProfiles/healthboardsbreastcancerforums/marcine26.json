      "Content": "OK I hopefully make this quick. My mom has breast cancer. I told my dr and she said I should meet with a genetic specialist. SO I called my mom and asked her if she had the brac 1 or brac2 gene and she said she had neither, she was her2 postive. Me, know ing absolutely nothing said ok and went to my apt. I told the specialist this and she said being her2 positve is not a gene its a protein that activates the cancers cells. I said ok but I think she got genetic testing done so cant you just look it up. she said with hippa she cant, but she did say that since my mom and I go to the same hospital that she would have had to meet with her before any genetic testing could be done, and that she hadnt met with her. so who what do I do know. my aunt and I are going back and forth. I say my mom needs to be tested and my aunt is saying, no she already did she has her2. can someone please help me figure out whats going on and the difference between brac1 brac2 and her2? thank you",

      "Content": "Thank you Leea, its does help. I just dont want to nag my mom, I think she thinks she got tested but I dont think she did just because when I asked her if she had brca1 or brca2 she said no i have her2. And the fact that the councelor said \"she would have met with me\" and she hadnt. Thank you. I will discuss with her when the time seems right.",
