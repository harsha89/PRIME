    "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia after a core needle biopsy and excisional biopsy. My oncologist has put me on Tamoxifen for five years. Just wondered how everyone has done on this medication. I have been on it 2 1/2 weeks and have been so fatigued. I feel like I could sleep 24/7. Is this normal? I have occasional hot flashes, but so far they haven't been horrible. Any thoughts you may have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",
