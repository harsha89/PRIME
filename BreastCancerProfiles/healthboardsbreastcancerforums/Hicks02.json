    "Content": "I was originally told that I had a Benign fiberous mass, nothing important or serious, which at my insistance was removed. Once they removed this they found it to be a phyllodes tumor which can easily mask as nothing serious. If you are uncomfortable I would seriously consider your options and with your family history I would be very active in the care received. They may be the professional and have the studies, but You know your body and because we are all human they make mistakes.",
