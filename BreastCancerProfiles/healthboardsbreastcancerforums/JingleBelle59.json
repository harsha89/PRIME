    "Content": "I'm fortunately 6 years on from left side total mastectomy + total lymph node removal in 2009 but still have ongoing post mastectomy pain syndrome across chest and under arm due to cutting through muscle/nerve endings - feels like tight pulled muscle pain and nettle stinging sensation. Does anyone have experience of this and I'm interested in anyone having had injections in site of pain. Read article from American med journal where they have done clinical trials and majority of people in trial had total pain eradication. Answers welcome.",
