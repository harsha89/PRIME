      "Content": "Regarding the discharge. I have to agree - when I had my mammogram in 2002 to my surprise there was a brown discharge when they squished my breast in that thing. Next thing I knew I was being called into the radiologist. There was a tiny cluster of microcalcifications that was not there the year before. Well, after the biopsey - DCIS - I opted for a mastectomy as I can't have radiation treatments -- had radiation to the thymus and it affects the lungs if you do it again in the same area. To make a long story short, it is a good thing I did because the whole breast was full even though it did not show up all over. Better to go check it out ASAP..... Suggi",

Doc gave me the decision for taking some of the breast or a mastectomy. Since I am small breasted to begin with I opted for the mastectomy. Turns out I made the right decision as the whole breast was full of DCIS even though it did not show up on the mammogram. Too bad there is no testing that can be done like an ultrasound on the side the breast was removed so you could be sure nothing was going on. I had a 1 centimeter clear margin which isn't much but then because I do not have that much breast tissue to begin with I can't complain. So far I guess, so good. I am not on Tamoxifin as I am taking Raloxifin for osteoporosis so all I can do is pray. It will be 4 years in August. Hang in there. Suggi",

      "Content": "Hi there, It may be nothing but definitely go as I have had calcifications in both my breasts forever and then 6 years ago I had a cluster on the right side of my right breast. They did a biopsy and it was DCIS. I am small breasted and they gave me the option of mastectomy or taking that part of the breast and having radiation so I just opted for the mastectomy. It is a good thing I did because the surgeon told me from the pathology report the whole breast was full of cancer even though the other calcifications looked normal all over except the cluster on the right side. She said there was no way of knowing and was so happy I made the decision I did. I would have ended up with 2 operations instead of 1 and this is just my opinion but I wonder if it may have ended up spreading it cutting some out and leaving some in until the pathology report came back and they found out there was still cancer in there. I ended up with a 1 millimeter clear margin and becuase I am on Raloxifine for osteoporosis could not take Tamoxifin and have been on nothing at all - no radiation, no chemo, nothing. I still have calcifications in the other breast but there have been no changes so I just have to have yearly mammograms at this point. I still see the oncologist. Good luck and let us know the results. I am praying, if it is anything, that you have caught it in time and will also be cancer free in 6 years. The biggest problem with BC is that it can return 15 years down the road so make sure you go for your mammograms faithfully. It still may not be anything. Keep us informed.",

I haven't been on the board for a while as I have been really ill with uncontrollable gastritis/acid reflux and on double strength meds which aren't helping and can't take anything for the Crohn's disease. I hope this drug works for you. So far they haven't found (or looked for) any mets on me from my breast cancer/mastectomy but sometimes i wonder because I have so many different medical problems and no one seems to know what is going on. They are assuming my bones are hurting because of my severe osteoporosis. My PCP uses a nurse practicioner as she wants to specialize in pulmonary so I can't even see her and any doc that is supposed to be any good is not taking new patients. I do have a gastro doc who is not listening to me and it is the same thing---try to find another one! I do have an oncologist who I see every 6 to 8 months but he did not suggest any testing back in January. No one wants me anyway because of my drug related allergies---even dentists because of the balsam of peru and carba mix allergy. Every day I get a new medical problem or the ones I have already get worse. Since I am allergic to nuclear medicine dye (radioactive isotopes) and CT Scan dye (iodine, I believe) they are reluctant to have me undergo tests. Even an upper endoscopy (which I should have) is risky as the carba mix is in endoscopes and every other thing in the hospital....ports on IV tubing, catheters, rubber stoppers in medication vials, etc., etc. Had a MRI with gad once but I usually get sensitized the first time and the next time I have the dye I get an allergic reaction. I am also now (as of last year) allergic to the Prednisolone topical cortisone group so they are afraid I am allergic to oral Prednisone now also which they at least could give you to counteract a CT Scan dye reaction. I now have a 2 page allergy/adverse reaction list). You inspire me and when i feel I don't know if I can go on like this I think of you and your attitude and want to be like you. Bless you and keep on writing. You are keeping me going...................... Suggi",

      "Content": "Royalgirl5 and jmspdg I had a mastectomy for DCIS in August 2002. I am small breasted to begin with and there was a small cluster of microcalcifications on the right side of the right breast. The biopsey showed DCIS. Since I had radiation as a kid to the thymus gland the oncologist radiologist said it was chancy doing it again as they did not measure the radiation back then (I am 66) and another dose would affect the lungs......so I had a mastectomy. Well, although it only showed up in that one spot THE WHOLE BREAST WAS FULL. The surgeon was shocked as well and said it was a good thing I opted for the mastectomy. I had a 1 centimeter clear margin which isn't much - they like wider ones but what can you do. I did not take Tamoxifin either. So far, so good but who knows. What I have to watch for is a lump on my chest. The surgeon said she felt it was all encapsalated in the ducts and she got it all but a couple of cells could have escaped. I now have severe osteoporosis and have been on Evista (raloxifine) but still going down bone wise and can not take anything else. They took me off HRT when I was diagnosed with the BC but was actually thinking of begging the docs for a script -- it kept my bones good. I can't get anyone to prescribe it and don't want to die of osteo either. However, I don't want a greater chance of getting the BC back either so what do you do???? The surgeon said esp. if I took the HRT it could come back as aggresive/invasive. Right now both of you sound like you can beat this thing. I can't tell you what to do but I really think after my experience of the mammogram not picking it up in the rest of the breast, the mastectomy is the way to go. Who really knows what is in there. It's not like a lump you can feel unfortunately so you know exactly where it is. Good luck to both of you in whatever decision you make. I hope they get it all. Suggi",

I guess they inject the lymph nodes with dye to see if there are any cancer cells present. I was contemplating a double mastectomy at the time but glad I didn't do it. Did they tell you not to use the mastectomy side arm for blood pressure or taking blood or IVs or anything? I guess even though lymph nodes were not taken out you can get cellulitis on that arm. Can you imagine if you couldn't use either arm. At the lab at my hospital I asked them about it and they said to have a blood test you would have to go in the hospital and they would take it from your neck - they don't do that in the lab.....and I guess blood pressure would be taken on your leg. Perish the thought!!!!!! Just curious what you were told. At the time we have the problem we don't know enough about what is going on to ask the proper questions -- besides we are in shock enough as it is. Best Suggi",

      "Content": "Bonnie They still look at DCIS as precancerous and non invasive. Got this off the net. DCIS stands for ductal carcinoma in situ. This means the cells lining the milk ducts (the channels in the breast that carry milk to the nipple) are cancerous, but stay contained within the ducts without growing through into the surrounding breast tissue. Sometimes DCIS may be described as pre-cancerous, pre-invasive, non-invasive or intraductal cancer. f you have had DCIS it is important to have your unaffected breast checked regularly by mammogram (at least every three years). You should go yearly for a mammography according to my oncologist--I wouldn't wait 3 years like the above says. Hope this helps with your decision. I was told the 1% per year for the other breast was based more on invasive, tumor type BC and our cancer was the \"safest\" to get if you are going to get BC. Hope they are right. Suggi",

However, I was put on Raloxifene for osteoporosis and that is supposed to help a bit for recurring BC -- which isn't doing any good for the osteo (went down another 3%) so I guess I will be off that soon. However, the only other option for me is that nasty zometa infusion and I sure don't want that. Raloxifine causes blood clots and so does Tamoxifene but I think Tamoxifine has a lot more scary side effects. Like I said, if they got a clear margin (hopefully larger than mine) you should be OK. And about the other side, I was told just get a yearly mammorgram. What can I do?????? I do have microcalcifications in the other breast but they are scattered not clustered like the right side even though nothing showed up in the rest of the breast and BOY WAS IT EVER THERE!!!!!! I guess i will feel better when I reach the 5 year mark -- another2+ years to go. You can only be on Tamoxifene for 5 years anyway and then they want to give you some drug that actually causes bone loss. Keep in touch.....esp. if you doc advised against it I wouldn't worry.

However, if it were me, with what happened to me, I would opt for the mastectomy. I am so very glad that I did. If I hadn't the aftermath would have been no clear margin on one side and another operation and perhaps it would have spread. I am allergice to nuclear medicine so did not have my lymph nodes checked and did not have any removed. The choice has to be hers. I had no radiation as I had radiation as a kid and the radiation oncologist said they used cobalt back then which was not measured and I might end up damaging my lungs. She had a patient who after 4 years still could not breathe very well because of the radiation. I had a 1 millimeter clear margin which is just about nothing but did not even take Tamoxafine as I have been on Raloxafine for osteoporosis (sister drugs) and can not take both. Raloxafine is the only med I can take for the osteo -- allergic to all the others. It is 5 1/2 years since my mastectomy and so far so good ------ with nothing to keep the cancer away. I am glad they caught it early. It means everything. The only thing I do not understand is there is no way to check for cancer on the side of the mastectomy. Just told to watch for pain or lumps, etc . I now only go for yearly mammograms on the left breast and see the oncologist once a year after the mammogram. Please give her a hug for me. I was scared out of my mind so I can understand how she feels. She still may want a 2nd opinion. I did not have one and everything worked out OK. The worst with the mastectomy that they do not tell you about are the drains they put in to drain the blood build up that have to stay in for a few days and you have to measure how much and empty them a few times a day. That was the worst part. The operation was not that bad. I did not even take the pain medication, just Tylonol. Just so she knows ----- my husband still loves me without 2 breasts.",

      "Content": "I had calcifications in both breasts and then my next mammogram showed a cluster on the right side of my right breast. To make a long story short, the surgeon took a biopsy of the cluster and I decided to have a mastectomy rather than part of the breast off. The surgeon was shocked as my whole breast was full - even where there were no clusters. My other breast still has calcifications. I had DCIS diagnosis. There was a 1 millimeter clear margin so since I have many, many allergies to drugs I am not on anything and did not have my lymph nodes checked as I am allergic to nuclear medicine and she did not biopsy them either so wish me luck. I don't understand why they can't come up with a test - ultrasound or something - for the side of the mastectomy to see if there is any sign of it returning. I am taking Raloxafine for osteoporosis which is a sister drug to Tamoxifine so they are looking into raloxafine maybe helping to prevent the return of cancer........I never knew your breast tissue went all the way up under the collarbone. How easy it would be to miss getting one of those cancer cells!",

      "Content": "ellimae Yes, I am allergic to the isotopes in nuc med. They gave me a bone scan and I had hives from head to foot really bad. If the breast cancer ever goes to the bone don't know how they will see it as I can't have that anymore. I have done OK with the gad in the MRI so far but I get allergic as I take things so who knows. Thanks for the tip though -- I should ask the oncologist if they could do an MRI esp. of the side where the boob is gone. Would feel better if I knew there was nothing going on behind those ribs or the lymph gland in the chest. Thanks again Suggi",

      "Content": "Hi I hope you are OK. What does your doc say? I had a mastectomy 5 1/2 years ago and lately get out of breath easily. The PCP wanted to do a CT scan but BC denied it, saying I had to get a chest Xray first. However, PCp said the Xray wouldn't show up anything so I did get it and of course it did not show up anything. I am going to make another appointment with the PCP after I schedule my pulmonary breathing test and see if she will pursue the CT scan. Keep posting as I would like to know what your doc thinks. Hopefully, the nodules have nothing to do with cancer. Thinking of you.",

      "Content": "Just in case those were not informed --- my surgeon told me - no estrogen creams, no soy. As far as I know (but really who knows what is going on in their body) I have been cancer free for 6 years from a mastectomy for DCIS. Could not do radiation because I had it as a child to the thymus gland. Could not take Tamoxifen because I have been on Raloxifine for severe osteoporosis which is a sister drug to Tamoxifen. My gynacologist wanted to give me estrogen cream for vaginitis and vulvitis but I said I couldn't use it. Doc said it's just a little amount. Just to make sure I called the surgeon's office and was told DO NOT USE IT. Allergic to Deet and found a new product that is FDA approved and really works to keep bugs off you made of soybean oil and cocanut oil. I called the surgeons office and the answer came back -- DO NOT USE IT. It is absorbed into the body through the skin. Not sure what soy has to do with estrogen but there it is for all that it is worth. Just wanted to pass this along so everyone knows about it. If you have any questions about it please check with your oncologist or surgeon. Actually I probably could have just asked my oncologist but the surgeon is super, super and she is the one who told me this in the first place so that is why I asked her. She did say she was happy I have not had any signs of return but that she could have missed that one tiny cancer cell and it could even come back in 10 years so I have to keep seeing the oncologist and having my yearly mammograms. I did read somewhere that most breast cancers return within 5 years but DCIS for some reason usually returns in the 5 to 10 year mark. If anyone has any information on this please let me know as since I read that I am concerned -- I was sort of relieved that I made it 6 years but now I am kind of scared. Thanks for any information. Take care everyone. A little soy is OK like what is in vitamins or processed foods but no more than that.",
