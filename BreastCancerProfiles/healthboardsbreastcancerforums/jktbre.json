      "Content": "hi, i had my abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound on monday to get a closer look at a complex cyst that was diagnosed through a virtaul colonoscopy. the dr called yesterday to tell me that it was a very worrisome complex cyst with septations and wondered if i had heard from the gyn referal that he had placed in the computer. i had not. i called tricare, military health, and tried to make an appt. due to the war, we have lots of expecting moms and they can not get me an appt with a gyn until the 17th of may. both the first doc and this doc have emphasized the need to get this removed as soon as possible..but i cannot even get in to a gyn until another month let alone get a referal from the gyn to schedule the surgery. this is so frusterating and i get more and more uncomfortable every day. the good news is that my CA125 levels are only 10.5. just griping i guess.",

      "Content": "i do not blame you one bit. your daughter has been through enough. they really should have been watching her closely and for her to get to this point..there is no excuse. i just cannot imagine the anger stirring inside you. i would be dangerous if i was in your shoes too. do not mess with my kid. she is in my prayers. when will you be finding out more? when my 17 year old was..i think 11, they told me that they thought he had cancer. they made a big show of support even though all tests had come back fine. he had a mass right under his colar bone. near his throat. they sent us to walter reed. they ran more tests. they were puzzled, afraid because of the position of the mass to take a biopsy. i remember that we were all sitting there looking at the films, my hubby was in korea, my mom was ill, my youngest son was basicallsy having a nervous breakdown, hearing voices, seeing things, not eating and shaking like crazy..which turned out to be a bad response from a medication the military dr had put him on..ironichuuh..when this new kid in training suddenly pipes up..\"uh..sir..isn't that an extra rib?\" lol! it was. my son had an extra rib that popped up because he was hitting puberty and the rib caused the muscle to sweel up. no mass, just a muscle and an extra rib. i could have fell over, both with relief and from the expressions on the drs faces. with your daughter, i realize things are different. there is no excuse for such incompetence. i pray that they re wrong and that your daughter really is okay. please keep us posted. you must be terrified.",

      "Content": "thanks bhunke. i went in today and went straight up to gyn. i spoke with some people there and showed them the reports. she put in a tcom to the dr that is supposed to see me on the 17th of may. hopefully she will get me in sooner. i also spoke to them about going off post and they told me that the wait there is even worse, three weeks just to get the appt and two months to be seen. incredible. the primary dr is on this also so hopefully we will hear back soon with a faster appt. we are at carson. i had not thought about it but i suppose if i cannot get in to the army facilities, i could try the airforce academy or peterson airforce base. thanks for the imput. i did get to read the report and there isn't any free fluids in me so that is good, just a large complex cystic mass with thick septation with a flow through it..whatever that means, lol. i know it is important however because they say that the radiologist called it \"worrisome\".",
