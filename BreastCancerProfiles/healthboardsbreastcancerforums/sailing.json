They tell you this isn't cancer, and I'm extremely thankful for that - but they sure seem to treat you like it is. I do have family history with BC. Has anyone out there also been diagnosed with this and what has your experience been like? Did you get a 2nd opinion? Did you opt to find out about your genetic marker? What is the impact of that on insurance and changing jobs? Did you decide to take tamoxifen or an even more radical approach? Just wondering if anyone has any wisdom/experience to share. Thanks for reading!",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with ADH when I was 35 - biopsy was negative so I did not receive any treatment. My mother passed away with breast cancer when she was 35. I had a feeling that it would catch up to me. When I turned 48, after a routine mamogram, I had to have a sterotatic biopsy. One week later, I had breast cancer - two locations or microcalcifications. Within 1 week, I had a segmental masectomy, 35 days of radiation and some meds - 3 years clear! Hope to stay that way! Best wishes to everyone - if you know someone who is afraid of getting a mamogram....take them. I know of a co-worker who was and died too young.",
