      "Content": "Hi, I am new here and was hoping someone can give me some information. I am 41 and recently had my first screening mammogram which they told me my dr. would have the results in 7 days. Two days later the dr's office called me and told me the mammogram was abnormal and that I needed to go and have a diagnostic one. I should have known something was up when I was there, at that time they had me come back in the room and take a couple more pics. I went yesterday for the diagnostic mammogram and the films of my first one were hanging up. There was a white spot about the size of a dime circled on the films. Of course I was freaking out and they don't tell you anything. She took about 4 pics of my left breast and one of my right and sent me out to wait. She then called me back in and took a few more pics of my right breast. After waiting some more she sent me home and said my dr. will be calling me. Breast cancer does not run in my family, but my dad died of lung cancer, i have a cousin on his side with fallopian tube cancer and my grandma has gallbladder cancer. I do not have discharge and I never have felt a lump. I have had occasion chest pain before but was told it was muscular. I am a nervous wreck waiting for the results of this mammo. I am also having a endometrial biopsy in August due to occasional break through bleeding and wondering if this is related. My pap did come back normal though. Sorry this is so long, but I really appreciate any info good or bad. Thanks",
