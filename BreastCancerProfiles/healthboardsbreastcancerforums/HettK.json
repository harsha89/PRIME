    "Content": "One relatviely inexpensive proactive measure you could implement as now for true \"health insurance\" (I dont mean the kind you pay for ^^) is to include 20-30 grams of flaxseed (ground using a coffee grinder and can be put in salads, oatmeal, use your imagination). Preliminary research in clinical trials has been extremely promising but the ancedotal evidence from thousands of years of use , in many cultures considered it a super food. (It contains a variety of vitamins, minerals, both types of fiber, omega 3 fattyacids and lignans) Other anti-cancer foods that you should include in your diet are garlic, onions, berries of all kinds, carrots (organic preferably), and greens of all kinds (caulifilower, broccoli, etc..) Be sure to be liberal with a variety of spices as even those have shown anti-cancer potential such as tumeric, curry, rosemary, and ginger.",
