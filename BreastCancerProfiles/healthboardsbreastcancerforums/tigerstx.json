    "Content": "I went to the doctor yesturday to have an ultrasound of my gall bladder and when I went to the restroom to get myself cleaned up, I noticed on my bra that I had a wet spot on my right breast area...I then pulled my bra down (thinking that the tech some how got ultra sound gel on it) and squeezed my breast together and I had a milkey looking discharge come out of my nipple area. It still have it and it is discoloring my bra...should I be worried or is it nothing? I can't possibly be pregnant, had a hysterectomy in March 02. Please anyone with this problem please respond... I also have fibroid cysts in my left breast..any relation to that? Thanks, Becki",
