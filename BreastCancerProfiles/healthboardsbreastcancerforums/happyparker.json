    "Content": "I too, have a lump like you describe under my right arm pit only. I am going in for a diagnostic Mammogram and ultrasound on June 1st. This was the earliest they could get me in. My dr. told me most likely nothing to worry about. I asked if it was a lymph node and she didn't think so, but said it was most likely a fatty cyst or tumor. I would be curious to know what you find out about yours.",
