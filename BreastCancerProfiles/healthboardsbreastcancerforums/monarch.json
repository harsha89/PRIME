    "Content": "This is may be too late, but I just had my 2nd breast MRI a couple weeks ago and I went in head first on my stomach. They also tied my arms up on my sides since there really wasn't anywhere to put them - I am borderline claustrophobic and that about did me in the first time I had an MRI so this time valium was prescribed so I could take it before I went to the MRI and it made a world of difference. Have your friend ask for something to relax her if she is worried about the space. Deb",
