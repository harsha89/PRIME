    "Content": "I had what the surgeon called a Lumpectomy done (took out a 2 1/2 inch area) on November 12. The results came back as Carcinoma In Situ - Lobular. I have now been scheduled for my yearly mammogram in March. My concern is I am still having quite a bit of discomfort in the breast and have noticed a raised lump around the nipple of the operated breast. Is this normal after (the discomfort and lump) after 3 month period of time? If this is not healed totally will I do harm in having the mammogram at this time. I know I should have the mammogram but am concerned about the discomfort. Has anyone ever had a mammogram after only 3 months timeframe? I guess I can say I am really more concerned about the pressure applied and possibly doing damage to the healing tissue if it is not totally healed. Thanks for your assistance",
