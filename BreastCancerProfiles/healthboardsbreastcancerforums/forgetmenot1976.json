I'm having the needle localization done before the surgery. Please share your stories... Hi there, i'm brand new to this website, when i saw your concern i felt i must try to tone down your worries if i can. My daughter had to have a needle biopsy, and like you she was very nervous and anxious about having it done. Please try not to worry (easier said than done, i know) but, ask yourself a little question, is worrying helping to ease your anxiety, is your anxiety helping to ease the worry? No, the whole process took about 20 minutes and apart from a little discomfort my daughter found that the worry was worse than the process. The hospital that she attended gave her the result straight away, no waiting for a week. It might be a good idea to find out if you can be told straight away, then at least you will find out if there is a problem or not. What ever the result, don't let it spoil your Christmas, you must be positive. I hope that everything will be ok for you, but, if the result isn't what you hope, please don't let it consume your every thought, it makes it worse and that won't help, and as i said above non of the negative things/thoughts will put it right. My thoughts will be with you and if you want to share the result on the message board i will come back to you. xx",
