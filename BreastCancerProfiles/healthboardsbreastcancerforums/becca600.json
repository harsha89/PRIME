    "Content": "I wondered if any of you out there could help me?! My mother experienced pain in her right breast early yesterday morning. As the day progressed the pain got worse until it came to the point where her breast was extremely sore to touch. Today, she says the pain is not as bad. She is going to see the doctor today but I'm worried out of my mind. Does anybody know why she is suddenly experiencing this pain? She currently has Hormonal treatments every 6 months - could this be related? I'm so scared that it might be breast cancer. Please help.",
