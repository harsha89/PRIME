    "Content": "I am 42 and had my third yearly mammogram this past Friday. I got the call this afternoon that nobody wants to get. They found a small nodule in my left breast and want me to come back this Friday morning for a diagnositic mammogram and possibly an ultra sound. I have always been told that I have dense breasts and when they called back they kept trying to tell me that there could be many reasons for this to show up, but I can't stop worrying. My biggest concern is not being armed with all the proper questions I need to ask. Unfortunatley I am not a stranger to dealing with cancer....my dad is a 4 year lung cancer survivor and my mom just finished treatments 3 weeks ago for stage 1 ovarian cancer. I was always able to have a little more time to research and prepare questions when I went to the doctors with them, but this is all happening really quick (which I am glad so I don't have to wait and wonder). So for those of you with the unfortunate experience of having gone through this I would appreciate being armed with lots of questions to ask. Thanks for your time.",
