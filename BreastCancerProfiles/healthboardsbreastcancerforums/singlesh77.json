    "Content": "body I am 34 years old healthy non-smoker. Recently weaned my 2 year old son about 7 weeks back after breast feeding him for almost 2 years. Felt a lumpy area in my left breast so went to get it checked out by my dr. The dr. felt it was not abnormal but sent for an US just to be sure. The US did not show anything abnormal so a mammo was ordered. This is the summary of the report i received from them: breast tissue is dense. slightly more dense glandular parenchyma in upper outer quadrant of left breast compared to right. some scatered calcifications are seen in both breasts probably most numerous in upper outer quadrant of left breeast. calcifications are fairly uniform, small rounded ones. 6 month follow up left mammogram with mag. views is recommended to follow calcifications. I was assigned a birad 3 score and asked to come back in 6 months. My qs is if these could be related to my just weaning my son less than 2 months back. Also, for the last 6 months of nursing him, i was exclusively nursing him from only the left breast. Any thought would be appreciated. DO you feel i need a second opinion?",
