If I told the new doctor that I was here for a second opinion, they would concur with the first doctor's opinion. They don't want to offend each other unless the first diagnosis was mess up and I am not BRCA1 positive. I have taken that path before when both doctors wanted to collapse my lungs and intubate. Serene Serene, what you are really looking for is a second opinion on the interpretations of what the biopsy shows! I did exactly this and I chose the surgeon who made me feel that she really cared about my situation and advised me as what what would be better for me in the long run! all the best to you, Mena",

Thank you Mena for putting it in better words. Sharon I hope you don't mind, but I just want to make an additional point that explains better the difference between the two opinions. The first DR. (during a 10 mi. visit) after a quick look at all the reports, slides etc. He gave me the following diagnose: You are probably between stage 1 & 2, you can have either a mastectomy with 4 months of chemo, or a lumpectomy with radiation and chemo and before anything else you must get a PET scan! The second DR.( during a 2 hr. visit) after a thorough look at everything, told me: \" Based on what I see, you best option is a mastectomy with a sentinel node biopsy, due to the extensive DCIS that had started to spread in the breast and the Invasive Tumor\". NO PET SCAN! She also told me that it would not be correct if she gave me a final diagnose as to the stage, size of tumor or treatment at this time. This could only be done after the surgery when all the pathology reports came back. I felt so comfortable with her that I actually hugged her and thanked her for being so wonderful. I had my surgery, actually I chose a double mastectomy (my mom died from breast cancer) with DIEP reconstruction and my cancer turned out to be stage 1a,1cm, no chemo! I only have to take Arimidex for 5 yrs. Mena",
