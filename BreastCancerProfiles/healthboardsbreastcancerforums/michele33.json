    "Content": "Hi! I had three months of chemo for breast cancer,now on Taximofen and Im 48 years old. I finished chemo in Oct and have not gotten my period since July. My question I have to lose 20 pounds and I have been dieting and exercising 5 days a week for 5 hours a week of aerobics and weight training. I cant seem to lose the weight. My doctor did tests on my thyroid which came out normal. Is it from the taximofen, chemo, or the fact that I am in early menapause now. I eat healthy, lean protein, high fiber diet but the weight is coming off about a half of a pound a month. Do you have any suggestions and please let me know why this is happening and will it change. I am very frustrated. Thank you.",
