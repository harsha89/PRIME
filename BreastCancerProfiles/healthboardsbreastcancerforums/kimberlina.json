    "Content": "My mother has a lump in her breast that has been diagnosed as \"atypical duct hyperplasia\". It has been explained to her that this is not a cancerous mass - nor will it ever will be - but rather an \"indicator\" of cancer. They want to remove a significant amount of her breast and she is feeling very saddened by this. Is the doctor simply choosing the easiest method of dealing with this? Is there another avenue that could be looked at? Or is this indeed the best route? Any insight/help/words of encouragement appreciated. Thank you so much!!!",
