    "Content": "Hello all, I'm new to all of this so please bear with me. I'm 19 years old and I have had an extreme case of anxiety with HIV. I don't have HIV (been tested) but after a sexual encounter, I've paranoid myself. First of all... this past week, I've noticed that my breasts have become very tender. I know this is usually associated with PMS as I am due to start next week but I've never experienced breast tenderness before. Also, we are all women here so I'm going to describe it the best I can. Where the 2 lips are of the vagina, on the left lip, I've noticed a lump. There isn't a lump on the right side. I would think that maybe it is a swollen gland but are glands in the lips of the vagina? and I always thought that glands are hard and the stay in the same place. This lump that I'm feeling isn't too too hard and I can move it up and down the lip. It also doesnt hurt at all to move ie. But why is it on the left side and not on the right? For all I know, all women could have this and I just dont know it. Again, I'm having a paranoia about HIV and a symptom is swollen lymph nodes in the groin area so I guess I'm trying to look for swollen lymph nodes or something. Thanks for taking the time to read this, any input from you ladies would be greatly appreciated.",
