    "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by Kimmie Months ago I noticed a bruise on the side of my right breast, almost in the armpit area. I assumed it was from the underwire bra I was wearing, as it did irritate the skin in that area. I quit wearing it. The bruise never went away, just faded. Now, about 3 weeks ago it seemed to get worse, I noticed an odd, yellowish-brown bruised area across the top of the breast, and my breast was itchy a lot. Also, the tissue under the bruised areas feels dense, not like a lump, just very dense. I went to my OBGYN, who referred me to a general surgeon, who then referred me for an MRI, since he had no clue what this was. I did ask about Inflammatory Breast Cancer, but he didn't seem to think this looked like it, since there is not any red, imflamed tissue, just the bruising. I just talked to the surgeon, and all they would tell me was that the MRI did not show any signs of cancer, not to worry. But they still suggested I go in for my follow up appt. on Monday (5 days from now) and they would go over the report with me then. If anyone has had any experience with something like this, PLEASE fill me in. I am still VERY concerned about the Inflammatory Breast Cancer. I will come back on her after my follow-up and post what I found out. Hopefully, it will be GOOD news. I am a 16 year old girl with the beginning symptoms you have described. The bruising on the side of the breast, left one, near the armpit area. It's faint, but hurts and hurts when pressure is continually applied, ie by my bra. It only recently began. I never really noticed it until tonight, when the pain got worse. I looked up information on breast cancer and stuff and found your post. Please, if you find out anything, let me know!",
