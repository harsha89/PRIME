Any lump should be checked by your doctor. It's possible that you could have a cyst if it hurts like that, but get it checked ok. Melly",

If you have a lump, you will be able to feel it the same way whether you are lying down or standing up to my knowledge anyway. They do not change shape, size no matter what position you are in from my understanding. Hope that helps! Melly",
