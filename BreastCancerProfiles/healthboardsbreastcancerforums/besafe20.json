      "Content": "Hi I am sort of in the same position. My armpit is puffed up but when I feel for an actual lump I can't find any. The doctor told me it was mammary tissue that has migrated up there, that would explain why it doesn't hurt I guess. I don't think that when you get a mammogram they check the armpit. Lymph node swelling under the arm is usually a warning signal given from the breast anyways. I have never had one but probably need to since breast cancer runs in my family. Goodluck!",
