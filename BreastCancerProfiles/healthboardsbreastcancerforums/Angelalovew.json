      "Content": "This nightmare started on March 20th, me going for my mammagram. A week later, that dreaded phone call that it was abnormal and I had to go back for a spot compression and ultrasound another week later... the radiologist said I could wait 6 months for a repeat mammagram, or have a core needle biopsy... I just stood there and the nurse takes me into a room and sets me up with a surgeon. Another week later, I'm at the Breast Center...I was undressed... another ultrasound, waiting for the biopsy... the radiology doctor says I could come back in 6 months for a repeat mammagram, to see if its changed... or go ahead and have the biopsy... I went ahead had it done last Friday. They will not give me the results on the phone I go tomorrow at 1:45 p.m. I keep telling myself surely they wouldn't have sent me home if they feel its cancer... I am in panic attack mode, so so nauseated... my nerves have taken its toll. Its like I can't even function... my body takes over with nausea and diarrea Thank you all for putting up with me.",

      "Content": "You and I are going thru the same mental torture I had the spot compression and ultrasound AFTER my mammogram. I was told to come back for a core needle biopsy.... \"or\" wait 6 months? Well, I went to the surgeon for a 2nd opinion... he said for me to have the core needle biopsy done... I had this done on Friday... but I get in there, undressed, and the radiology doctor is doing an ultrasound... he said \"we can wait 6 months, if you like... he felt it wasn't cancer. He thought it was a lymph gland filled with blood?? I was just about ready to GO... my mama had brought me... I wanted to ask her opinion... she asked me to please have it done... that I was THERE, and that way I'd know for sure. So I did it... I go back on May 3rd for the results. What will you do??? I had that needle core biopsy, and here it is almost a week later and I'm still sore... and real swollen... my mind is going haywire; I hate how my mind thinks... I'm horrified it could be cancer and that needle biopsy spread it.... is that possible?? This waiting is driving me crazy.... its like it consumes me. Please let me know how you are doing and what your decision is.",

I'm hanging on to those words... this waiting seems like SOOOOOO long. I'm wondering tho -- even if its benign, will it have to come out? They will do the needle biopsy while looking at the ultrasound... its small and you can't feel it. When you are going thru this, its like ALL you see on TV is cancer institues, and you hear of others who have breast cancer I pray and pray and pray.....",
