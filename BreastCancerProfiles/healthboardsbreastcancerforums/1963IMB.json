      "Content": "I had a core needle biopsy almost two weeks ago. Since then I have had a rusty brown fluid that I can aspirate - I didn't have that before. I was told not to worry about this unless it didn't go away after a while. It's possible that the fluid color may simply be a result of having the previous tumor removed. You should check this possibility with your doctor.",
