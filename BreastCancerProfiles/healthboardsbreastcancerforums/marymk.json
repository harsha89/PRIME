      "Content": "Hi pauline61, Do you still have the mark today ? I always seem to have unusual marks on my breasts, after getting out of the shower - I think my breasts are very sensitive to the hot water. Sometimes there are red spots - or the skin just seems 'funny' - by later in the day, it's usually gone. If it's still there, you should get it checked out to be sure it's nothing serious. Also, I'm not quite menopausal yet - but getting close. marymk",

      "Content": "Hi, I had this also - left side, for the past year or so. It's actually alot better now, I hardly notice it. I've had mamogram, ultrasoud, exam by gyn .... It was more like the chest muscle above the breast, but sometimes it was hard to tell if the breast hurt also. Anyway - it started in winter, when I was lifting firewood with my left arm, but the pain lasted many months into summer/fall. The Dr said I could have costochrondritis (sp), and the lifting aggrevated it. This winter I've been very careful not to lift too much on that side, and it's not bothering me. When the pain started last year, I started sleeping with asports bra on (one that's not real tight) - that helped alot - I still do it - I'm a bit large breasted, so it's more comfortable than wearing nothing. Also, advil or motrin helped - if it's muscle pain from straining try it. Hope this helps a bit - you could always check with your Dr again - I know I went several times before I felt better. Mary",

      "Content": "Hi, Is the pain from the bone/ribs, more so than the breast? It's possible you may have strained yourself - especially breatfeeding an 11 month old. I had quite similar pain last year. Sometimes it was hard to tell where the pain actually was - ribs? breast? sternum? It also traveled sometimes to the shoulder/arm area. I was checked out for breast issues - physical exam and mamogram, and all is good there. My gyn said it't probably a condition called costochrodoitis (sp). It's an inflamation of the ribs and surrounding area, and is caused and made worse by exertion/straining. I was frequently carring firewood at the time, and when I stopped, the pain finally got better - although it took quite a few months for me to forget about it all together. Taking advil or ibuprophin also helped (once I new what I had). It's a good idea to rule out any breast issues - which is what I did - then if that's OK - you can go from there. Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Snogal, I get the same thing, the pain is somewhat high on the left side of my chest, but close eneough to the breast, that I'm not sure where it is actually coming from. I was checked out by my gyno a few months ago, when it was constant. She didn't feel anything - said it could be Costalchondritis (spelling?). It seems to feel better when I take and advil, or some type of anti-infammatory drug. I can actually make it hurt if I press on the area. It's much better these days, but still there at times. I am getting my yearly mamogram next week, and my breasts are naturally lumpy also. I think if there was something different or worrisome, I would be able to tell the difference (I hope). marymk",

      "Content": "Hi, I don't have personal experience with fibroadenoma's, but I did work with a woman who had one. They were very certain that's what it was, but since she had a family history of many different cancers, she had it removed and it was fine - just a fibroadenoma. She was younger than you - about mid 30's. Since you have never had a mamogram before, you may have had these at a younger age, and just didn't know it. I know that when you get them - they don't go away on their own. I think your chances that you'll be in the 80% is very good and they are most likely both fibroadenoma's. Good Luck and keep us posted. Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Supermom, Just a couple of weeks ago, I got a 'zit' on my breast. I've gotten them before, but for some reason this one just bothered me. I kept watching it every day, and didn't squeeze it and it did go away. I thought about going to have it checked out, but it looked just like any zit that I would get on my face or anywhere else. I have been getting some cystic acne lately, and also did have a small breakout on my face at the same time. I've been going through peri-menopause, and my Dr's (gyn and derm) says that the breakouts are hormonal and stress related. Mary",

      "Content": "Spider_Lily, I'm sorry to hear of your brother, I'm sure your going through a difficult time, I lost my mom in August, and just started functioning normal the past week, but of course it still hurts. Anyway - I've had a very similar experience with breast/chest symptoms - I wasn't really sure if it was breast pain or chest pain - although if felt more like chest pain, so I had all the same tests - everything checked out fine. Then I saw my gyno - had a couple breast exams and a mamogram over the course of 4 months - everything OK in the breast. I think I may have pulled somthing, because over time it got better, and taking motrin did seem to help. It's started happening last year around November, so it's almost a year now, but I feel much better - most days I forget about it, but every once in a while, I get a symptom, and then I usually remember doing something that might have strained the area. Also, my doctor said I may have costochondroitis, which is an inflammation of the rib cage - causing these type of symptoms and it can be very chronic. Hope this help. Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Ladies, Could the pains be like a PMS type pain - I've been having pain/achiness over the last few months - mostly in the left, but sometimes in the right. I am on the hormome provera right now (to treat uterine hyperplasia), and I think it's related - but I did tend to get the same pains near the start of my montly cycle. Right now I'm getting them through most of the month, because I\"m on the pills for 24 days of the month (and I'm also not getting my period at all). I would pay attention to when it's happening and what type of pain - then if your really concerned - do call your Dr. Also - the depo shot is pretty much provera - but a stronger dose (for birth control), so I would think that sore breats may be a possible side effect.

They say to cut back on caffine, but I'm a heavy cofee drinker, so that's difficult for me. I did take evening primrose oil (per my gyn) - it didn't seem to help much. For a long time I slept with a sports bra on and this helped alot during the night. Right now I'm starting to go thru menopause, and the breasts are feeling alot better. It seems that the worst time I've had with this was from age 45 - 49. I'm now 50 - and starting to get the hot flash issues - so unfortunatley it's always something. Mary",
