I was originally thinking that it was due to my pregnancy and I'm being paranoid but now my hormone levels are back to normal and it's still larger....I can't remember exactly when I first noticed it....... I'm very concerned, could this be cancer?....... any comments are greatly appreciated..... Questionss, PLEASE report this to your ob/gyn. I noticed breast changes since I was about 26/27. I told my doc, they sent me for a mammogram. I had pain/enlargement for years. Nothing significant was found on my mammogram but they asked me to come back in 6 months. I didn't. Then a few years later, (I'm 33 now) my left breast became very large. I told my \"new\" ob/gyn and got the ball rolling. Not to scare you but mine turned out to be stage III breast cancer. Best of luck to you.",
