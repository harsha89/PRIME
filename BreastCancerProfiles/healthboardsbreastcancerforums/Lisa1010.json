    "Content": "Does anyone know the name of the drug that doctors used to give you to dry up your breast milk after you had a baby? I was given this drug back in 1989 and then told later that they no longer could give the drug out because of severe side effects like seizures, cancer , etc. The doctors realized I had breast cancer (already stage 2b) in 2000 and then again in 2004 when it had metasisized to my liver and bones. I am now wondering about the correlation between the two... does anyone know the name of the drug tho.. I cant remember . Thank you so much. Lisa",
