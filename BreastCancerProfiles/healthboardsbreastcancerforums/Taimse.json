      "Content": "My sister was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma last Friday.Left breast. She had a mammogram 16 months ago, but discovered lump herself. It is approximately 1 centimeter. She has always been in good physical shape...BMI is 21-22. Her breasts, and mine too, are small and dense. Doesn't smoke( never did) or drink. She is taking some medication for hypothyroidism. There isn't a history of breast cancer in family,( or pretty much any cancer) though our father died of lung cancer...docs at Mayo say it is most likely related to herbicide use and pesticide use from farming in 60's and 70's. I started taking PremPro last year for menopause symptoms. It has helped immensely. I had a breast biopsy 2 1/2 years ago on left breast for microcalcifications. Benign. I read recently that taking PremPro is not a good idea if at risk for breast cancer....so am I at risk now, and should I discontinue the PremPro?",

      "Content": "[QUOTE= In the late 1990's I went to a seminar of Dr. Laslo Tabar. He is the leading Mammographer wordwide and one of the pioneers of mammography. He was asked by a physician if estrogen caused breast cancer. Dr. Tabar stated yes it does but (at that time thought) it does great things for the bones and heart so keep taking it and have your mammograms. The last seminar of Dr. Tabars I went to in 2002 he was asked the very same question. His response was yes it does cause breast cancer, it does not help the heart, or bones. Also he showed a picture of a type of very dense breast tissue. He stated this is angry tissue and if this women is given estrogen it will cause breast ca for her. Newfie11[/QUOTE] I certainly know what angry breast tissue feels like. I have dense breast tissue....small breasts too. I had a stereotactic breast biopsy on my left breast( same side as sis), upper left quadrant, to sample microcalcifications....8 gauge needle. The pain intensified over a week after the biopsy....it would throb more at night than during the day, but lots of pain. I kept thinking that my breast was angry at the invasion....doctors didn't understand the pain. I had it for approximately 8 weeks post biopsy. ( biopsy report...negative for cancer. Fibrocystic breasts with schlerosing adenosis )",
