      "Content": "Hi out there! I would appreciate any info or advice - About 2-3 weeks ago, one day I noticed major soreness/pain in my left breast - I called my gyn and she told me my best bet was to see a breast specialist - I'd already been to one last fall, due to off and on left armpit pain - (was examined and told to try Evening Primrose oil) - anyway, I saw the breast specialist last Monday - she did a manual exam and thought she felt something in the left breast - she feels confident that it's a fibroadenoma (sp?) - she told me to get a breast ultrasound done, and if the fibroadenoma is confirmed, it should be removed - I have the breast ultrasound on April 6th - funny thing is, now I feel a little less soreness, but in both breasts!!! Does anyone know much about fibroadenomas? She said they are benign, which is a good thing (wheeww!), but I'm still worried about what they might find - thanks! supermom3",

I've been to gynos, a breast specialist, regular docs, etc., and had mammos and ultrasounds since 2004-2005, and no known cause - they come and go - I've got health anxiety, so it would be nice to have an answer - thanks!",

      "Content": "Hi all! Ok, so the past 3 1/2 years (since June of '05) I have had very occasional sharp little pains in the left breast - I have also (since 2003/04) had routine mammos, as well as numerous physician breast exams, ultrasounds, and also done bse's. Everything has been coming up fine, no findings. I am still bothered (emotionally) by these pains with no answer, so I went today and saw my gyno, who did an exam on the left breast and ultrasounded it - came up with nothing (fortunately!) - she said there is a fairly new diagnostic test called Breast Specific Gamma Imaging, which can screen for anything that possibly hasn't been seen on a mammogram. This test is done for women at high risk and also for women with dense breasts. I have been told where I go for mammos that I have dense breasts. I got very lucky and got in tomorrow morning to have this diagnostic test done, and I'm trying to not panic, but I can't help it! I keep telling myself that I've had this off and on pain for 3 1/2 years and nothing has become of it - my gyno really feels that the pain could be from hormonal fluctuations - (I'm 43, which equals perimenopausal!) - she also suggested trying vitamin e and/or borage oil - I know in the past she suggested cutting back/eliminating caffeine - which I admit I haven't done successfully! Just wanted to vent, but any thoughts or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated! supermom3",

I have been dealing with it for 4 1/2 years, and have had numerous ultrasounds, exams, mammos, etc. Today I had a Breast Specific Gamma Imaging test done. The radiologist came into the room after he looked at all the images, and told me he still has no explanation for my pains, showed me one little area on the left breast picture that is darker, and said if it was cancer, it would be black. He said my breasts are denser on the bottom, and that this is just density. I don't know why I don't feel comfortable with that explanation. I am seeing him tomorrow for a consult. Today I said, \"so you don't think that area is anything to worry about, and he said no.\" But I still left there feeling confused. Any thoughts!? thanks! supermom3",

I week ago I noticed what looked to me like a zit on my breast - I worried it might be something more, so I got into my doctor the next day - she looked at it and said it was sebhorreic keratosis - there is no treament, and people tend to get them as they age, usually on the chest and back. I lost my mom to cancer 1 1/2 years ago, (leukemia) and whenever I notice something going on with my body, I always worry it might be cancer - any input would be helpful! thanks!",

I am being treated (with meds and therapy) for health anxiety, but I am tired of living like this! I just want to snap out of it! I have had numerous breast checks, ultrasounds, annual mammos, etc., and am told every time that things are great/normal! This stems from the fact that in 2005 I noticed a couple of sharp pains in my left breast/underarm area. I can't seem to reassure myself after all these visits that it's something \"muscular\" and that I am fine! thanks for any replies! supermom3",
