    "Content": "I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I need to know if I should be worried or not. For the past week I have had a very itchy nipple, my left on only. I have never had this problem before and it has been 7 days straight now and it is not going away. I haven't noticed if there was any discharge...I don't think there has been. I also have not noticed a rash or anything unusual...my mipple till looks the same. But the itching is driving me crazy!!! Should I be worried?",
