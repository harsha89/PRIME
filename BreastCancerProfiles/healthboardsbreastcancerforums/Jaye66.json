      "Content": "I am not sure what it all means, sounds like you have dense breasts? It's very common to have additional views and a sonogram. Every time I have a mammogram I have to have additional views and almost every time I end up getting a sonogram. Luckily though, I never have to wait for that dreaded letter. Everything is done at the same visits and I know my results when I leave. Good luck ! Let me know how you make out.",

      "Content": "I totally agree. They have to check it out to be sure. It would be horrible if they dismissed it as being nothing and then find out when it's too late that it was indeed something. I do think though, that the chances are it's nothing. Especially if the radiologist didn't seem concerned. Good luck and I really hope that you can get in sooner.",
