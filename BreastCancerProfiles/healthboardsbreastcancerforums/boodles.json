      "Content": "Hi everyone As the title suggests my 20 year old daughter has found a lump in her breast. first thing she noticed was a round red mark at about the size of a finger tip. In fact it.did look as if she had been poked hard. A few days later she was in the bath a day pressed down on it to find there was a lump, not in the skin but in the breast. She went to her gp 2 days later who has told her to come back after her period ( she has been on the pill for several years) and made an appointment for 2 weeks tomorrow. She said she has no alarm bells going off and not to worry but that she will.send her to the breast clinic if it is still.there in 2 weeks. By the time she got to the doctors the red mark had nearly gone and has now totally disappeared. Needless to say as a mum I am worried sick but cannot let her know. I Try not to mention it but yesterday she brought it up so I asked if the lump had changed at all. She said not really but she thought it might be less 'pointy' (it was rounded and firm and smooth when I felt it) and more wider and flatter. And first this seemed like a good thing to me in that it was flatter but now I keep.focusing on the wider bit ....don't want to keep.asking her questions and keeping it to.the front of her mind. What does anyone else think? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Many many thanks",
