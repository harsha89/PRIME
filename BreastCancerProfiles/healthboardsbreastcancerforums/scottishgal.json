      "Content": "Hi Rhitbible, I believe your name is Sue. If you need information on Uterine cancer, find your local American Cancer Society, in your telephone directory, I get a flyer every now and again, but I don't have their address. I think their head office is in Washington DC. Also the Cancer Services of America. If you get stuck, look in the Yellow pages for OB/GYN doctors, and ask them if there is any literature available on Uterine cancer, they can send you. Put it this way. I nearly hemorrhaged to death, because the Uterine Cancer had eaten away at the major artery to the uterus. I did not even know I had Uterine Cancer. My surgeon told me that uterine Cancer is a very slow moving cancer, unless it gets through the Uterine wall to other parts of the body. Mine was nearly there, yet I am still here. That happened in 1989. If I can beat it anyone can. Also look at Fran Drescher, she is another success story. If this cancer is caught in time you can beat it. But it is important to be adamant with doctors if you suspect a problem, because they may Pooh pooh your symptoms at first. I had a Total Hysterectomy, because my doctor, told me its better to remove the Ovaries,in addition to the uterus because he said you can guarantee, that anywhere up to ten years later, the ovaries will become infected. Hope this helps, Mary",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, aka Rhitbible, You need to realize you are a person who has needs also. Your friend is lucky to have you, and as much as you wish to take on her problems, you cannot do that. You accept your new job, if thats what you wish for yourself. If you have to move away, then tell your friend, that she can contact you via phone or the Internet to talk to you, which is another form of support. She has a husband, and if he isn't supporting your friend enough then she should find a Cancer support group for herself. The fact is she needs to face this and she will when she is ready. As for telling her children, I did not want to tell mine either, but you have to, because if for some reason, your friend did die, then her kids will hold this in their memories for life, the fact that they never got to pay more attention to their mother while she was alive. Thats just an if. I do think her chances are extremely good if she is getting Medical Treatment. Trust me the doctors know what they are doing. They would not leave a tumour to grow. So tell your friend to think positive thoughts as this is one of the things that will make you more sick if you let it get to you. To use a support group is a good thing from your point of view, because then you can understand what cancer and its consequences are all about. If it is too Maudlin for you, then do something for yourself. God knows, you are a true friend. I wish I had someone like you at my side to help me. My husband was the best, but he is a fella. So hope this helps, and feel free to vent off anytime when you need it. Take Care mary",

      "Content": "To Celtictigress, Sweetheart, Surgery will cost a lot, as you have the Surgeon, possibly Assistant surgeon, Anesthesiologist, and hospital costs. You must apply for welfare, as the State has a Medicaid plan, or other plans that will offer you help. Also talk to the Doctor that is treating you, and tell him you do not have insurance. They can usually find some form of help. DO NOT LEAVE IT. You need treatment. Please go find help, in one form or another. Trust me I used to process Health Insurance Claims, so I realize what you are up against, because I am disabled and do not have insurance now. Well i have Medicare but that is next to nothing. Good Luck, Keep in Touch, Mary",

      "Content": "To RhitBible, Your friend sounds like she is still in denial. If she has told you she has Cancer, then tell her you are there for her, should she need to talk. Don't badger her, but be there because at some point she is going to go through many feelings, including anger, frustration, depression. Tell her you are available to go to Doctors appointments with her, and be there if you can. Help her to be decisive, tell her you support her medical decisions, because she may have different options offered in the way of treatment. But most of all if she knows you know about the Cancer, then make sure she understands, that you are not going to pretend it does not exist. By hiding behind that front, she can never go forward. The support you offer, will be greatly accepted, believe me. Continue this support after surgery if that is what she needs to have. I had a total Hysterectomy, and I felt weak and needing support long after surgery. My husband was there for me. Tell her she can come through this whole ordeal. The word Cancer is the Fear Factor within itself. Tell her I am here if she ever needs to talk. What a wonderful person you are to even be there for her. I hope she realizes how lucky she is, Good Luck, Mary ------------------ Mary Axtell",

      "Content": "Hi Bertha, You sound like you are totally down. Stop feeling like this. You are a decent human being, who has has bad luck. Get out of what everyone else is feeling. You tell your son, you want to be treated with respect. Don't be a Doormat, for him or anyone else. You have a right to life also. You haven't had enough time to grieve your husband before all of this has taken hold. Get some counseling. But I urge you if Welfare is your only means of help, then go for it. Maybe when you get better we can find ways to advocate help for other people in the same position as we have been in. Please, Uterine cancer is a slow moving cancer if it has not penetrated the Uterine Wall. So please don't despair. The world needs you. God needs you and I need you, Girlfriend!!!!! Write me if it is Cancer, I will help you through it. Whatever I can do. ------------------ Mary Axtell",

You should know that, from the things you have been through. Sympathy you don't need, Reality, Caring and Support you do need, and I can help you with those. So can the people in your life if you let them help you. So put your best foot forward, and find out what your actual Medical problems are, before you decide what you feel. Don't guess. Cheers for now, Mary",
