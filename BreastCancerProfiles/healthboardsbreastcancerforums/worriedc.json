    "Content": "i recently went to my dr. and they said they found 2 lumps in my left breast, they said i have a hypoechoic lesion with well circumscribed borders. and then they sent me for a mammogram and follow up ultrasound,,i did them and now report said the hypoechoic lesion is now a homogeneously hypoechoic solid lesion measuring a half a cm bigger within 15 days of first ultrasound...i also found out with the follow up i also have a cystic lesion and prominent ducts... the radiologist was saying the solid lesion is a tumor i guess... if anyone knows what any of this means please let me know... i am very worried.... thanks..",
