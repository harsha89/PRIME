      "Content": "Sorry I haven't been back to update. The second opinion concurred with the initial diagnosis. I'm doing fine. Now my mom is experiencing pain in her left breast, doesn't feel a lump. She has scheduled a mamogram. If it turns out to be something, I'll start another thread. Pray that it's nothing.",

      "Content": "A week ago had mamorgram. Didn't wait for results. Got called back in for another film of left breast. Got there at 7:30am. Took xrays. Waited. Got called back for an ultrasound. Tech said \"If everything is ok, I'll come back and tell you that you can go. If not, the doctor will be with me.\" So, in walks the doctor a few minutes later. Says wants to do biopsy. I said 'Oh, I've had one before.\" Didn't realize at the time that I was getting a core biopsy (first one I had was a needle biopsy). Believe me, they are a lot different. Ouch! Not real painful, but annoying. Got out of there at 11:30am. 4 hours! Waited a day for results. Intraductal Papilloma -benign. Come back in 6 months then go for yearly mamogram. This past Sunday my obgyn called and wants me to go for a second opinion to a breast specialist. I got in for Monday 12/20. He said if they need to do another biopsy, it will be surgical. I'll let you know how it goes.",
