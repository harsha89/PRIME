      "Content": "Thank you that is very comforting. So why didn't it work. Couldn't get enough tissue? Or it simply showed atypical cells? I'm very glad to hear you respond that it went ok. Even the shot for the local didn't hurt bad? NOW you have to come back and update about the core biopsy in case I move there next. I'm not sure what a category 1 lump is. They didn't call mine anything I could easily see the spot on the xray.....but they said they \"thought\" it was just a lymph node. As we talk, under that L underarm I currently have a lump, I assume is a lymph node and its hurting so makes me kinda nervous. Did you have any labs done? Like a CBC? I didn't at the breast place just at my regular dr.",

      "Content": "Well I just went thru this last week. It meant for me that they saw \"something\" a spot. So on the repeat mammo they took several views just of the L breast. Still saw the spot....so we went on to do an ultrasound. The radiologist told me she can't be certain but she really thinks its just a lymph node. And I can either opt for the fine needle aspiration / biopsy or wait 6 months to repeat the mammo and u/s to see if its any larger. Of course every single person in my life is opting for the biopsy so we'll see.",
