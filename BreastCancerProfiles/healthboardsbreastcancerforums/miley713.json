    "Content": "Hi im new here having a biopsy on my left breast tomorrow for a new dense mass i think is what he said. Its a new density underneath my breast. I was just so stunned i really didnt understand. But i do know its a bi rads 4 and is spiculated. I could feel no lump so was taken by total suprise. Im so scared, i have a gut feeling it will be cancer its just how my life goes. But so praying of course its not. But he also asked if i had any trauma there? Wasnt thinking then but between my dogs and the dogs at work those are 2 bulls eyes. Or hoping pre menopausal, im 46 so you never know? Thanks for letting me vent, i have read alot on here so i know many of you understand",
