    "Content": "I had my surgery on December 16,i was up right away with lots of energy,the only thing slowing me down was the drain tubes,and soreness.The last few days i have been really tired,i don't know if it is from healing or what. I know stress doesn't help. I start chemo the week after next,and that scares me to death.I don;t have all of the results to post,i just know that i had a cancer in my right breast,it was fairly small,and it has not spread to any organs or lymph nodes.As with us all,this has just been surreal.But my question was if anyone was really tired around 3 weeks out?",
