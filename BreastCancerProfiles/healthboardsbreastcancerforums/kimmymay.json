      "Content": "In March 2013 I had Lumpectomy to remove cyst and mass, The mass came back non cancerous. Yet I am still considered high risk because of my first core needle biopsy. No one in my family had breast cancer. Here is word for word my core needle biopsy results, Final diagnosis: Right breast, mass, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy-breast parenchyma with stromal fibrosis and detached cluster of atypical epithelial cells. Comment: The intact cores of breast parenchyma show stromal fibrosis and unremarkable benign epithelial elements, however a detached fragment of cytologically atypical cells is noted. DNA fingerprinting was attempted on these atypical cells, however DNA amplification was limited and a complete assay was not able to be performed. My mind was eles where when I had another mamo n ultrasound and didn't even ask why I was hight risk, I know duhhhh! I do not go back until March. Anyone ever had a result like this? Or considered high risk even when mass came back as tissue? I'm so confused! Thanks!!! Kim",
