    "Content": "I posted a few days ago concerning mastectomy with expander and nobody was able to reply so I was wondering if anyone could help me with this one. My surgeon has done 2 lumpectomies and now says he cant get clean margins and I am scheduled for a mastectomy next wednesday. I called my oncologist concerning chemo and he thinks I will need it but he said all thats left in my breast is pre-cancer. So, why cant they radiate the heck out of my breast and then give me chemotherapy to save my breast. I just cant understand why I have to go through this when my actual tumor was the side of a sesame seed..only 2 mm. There was a tiny bit of invasive (which has been removed) and another spot of non-invasive. The rest is precancer. My nodes checked clear. I need some thoughts from someone...please.",
