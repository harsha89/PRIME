    "Content": "I am 42. Last year, I had a screening mammogram, diagnostic mammogram, and an ultrasound. It was rated BIRADS 3 - probably benign, follow up in 6 months on the right side. I went 6 months later for the diagnostic mamm and ultrasound, the result was BIRADS 3 - probably benign. Last week, I went for my followup screening mammogram. The doctors office called and they want me to come in for a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound next week. This time, they said I had these nodular densities on my previous mammogram, but this time, they are more dense and both breasts are suspicious. Should I be concerned?",
