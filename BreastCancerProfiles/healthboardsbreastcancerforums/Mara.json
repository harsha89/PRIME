If that statement was made, I suggest you gather all reports (radiology, cytology, biopsy...) and consider a second opinion prior to surgery. History is important. It all factors in.

Cluster of cysts they think are lymph nodes on the right and have been looking at that every 6 mo, since the first abnormal mammo/sono etc, I am due for the 1 yr in a few months.
