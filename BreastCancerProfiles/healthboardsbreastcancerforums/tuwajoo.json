    "Content": "I'm here with you. For the past year my radiologist has been having me do repeat ultrasounds, yet they haven't been getting the results to my Doctor. I've noticed in the last 4 months that my left has grown considerably. My doctor is sending me to a different radiology clinic and I go in today. I know my aunt died from cancer but not what kind. I'm also a DES baby so I too am scared. You need to be worried enough to make the doctors very clear and if results aren't getting to them, get them yourself and hand take them to the doctor. You might want to have the doctor send you to another clinic. Keep us posted, and we can get through this together. Hugs",
