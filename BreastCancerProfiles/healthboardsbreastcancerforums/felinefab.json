    "Content": "I was diagnosed in one appt. Had the mammogram and it looked suspicious so they did an ultrasound then a doctor came in and did the biopsy right there and only waited about 1/2 hr. to find out I had invasive lobular breast cancer. I had stage 2 going into 3 and it was my own fault as I had missed my mammogram 2 yrs. in a row. Please everyone go for your mammograms\u0085it would have saved me all the hell with chemo and rads.",
