      "Content": "Hey Smoothie--just wondering---does your bloody discharge happen only when you get up in the morning. That is what I've experienced. I have stuck a cotton pad over the nipple in my bra and nothing ever appears on it. It's just on pj's when I get up. And then just a drop or two. Some clear and some looks like blood. I'm like you, I had this 5 years ago and now again. My gyn expressed the discharge out five years ago and it came back ok. Just curious--we gals sure have a lot to worry about. I spit up blood about 10 years ago that scared me to death and turned out to be a cyst in my ear. I think I may be prone to strange things. j",

My gyn sent bit of discharge to lab at that time and came back negative for all possibilities. Fast forward 5 years and I'm having the bleeding again. I just had a mamo 4 weeks ago and am wondering if the mamo caused the bleeding. I have always had cystic breast with clusters of the things. I to am worried and will go to gyn next week. I don't know if cysts can contain blood or not. I have had several US and detected nothing but numerous cysts. It sure set your mind to worrying. Please post when you have a diagnosis. Will keep in contact myself.",

I have not been able to get appt to get checked with US since my doc out of country and don't want to go to any other. Will do soon, but like you, I have been through this 5 years ago and noticed one poster who said she has the bloody discharge every eight months or so. Thank goodness ours is only every 5 years! It does make our nerves get out of joint. Hope you are doing better with no bloody breast discharge. Let us hear. Janet",

My doc visit was uneventful---he felt no masses, but I did not tell him about recent discharge--we were just not on same wave length that day--he began telling me how I borrow worry but told me to get annual mamo which I will after April 7th--that is when insurance will pay for annual. I have always had a very good relationship with my doctor, but that day he must have had something on his mind. I'm going to be back in contact after you get 2nd biopsy. Didn't they say the right side was highly suspicious and turned out ok---can you tell I'm still being a worry wart???? Hope you're having a nice trip. J. Davis",

I received a letter Tuesday telling me to make another appt for a right breast tighter spot mamo or something like that. My appt isn't until next Thursday--appt clerk said he said to make next available appt. So, the worry goes on. It is just dreadful. I only like to talk to people on the boards. Want my family to just leave me alone. Nothing can be felt, so that's good. Let me hear from you. Janet Davis",

I have read so much about taking hormones and what they can cause in your body--so, I decided I'd just stop---BAD IDEA! I also have a thyroid problem so I just messed myself up royally. So, I'm back on meds and taking just enough to control symptoms we middle aged ladies get. Thanks for your email--appreciate. Janet Davis",

I have had clear discharge off and on for ten years like you--had it checked and came back negative. My breasts have been sorta tender, but no real pain. I have routine checkup on Monday and am so nervous doctor will find something. I share your worry. I know my doctor has told me breast discharge is common and can be caused by many things. I guess all women worry that it could be something serious. I have been dreading this appt for weeks thinking something is wrong.

I am worried about my doctor visit on Monday, but have nothing definite to go on---just a funny feeling--sounds so foolish, but we women are prone to worry about our body parts. Please, please let me know when you get your results and my thoughts and prayers will be that it is negative. Bet you'll have it before that long wait--hope so. I sorta get the feeling your doctor has been encouraging. The waiting is what hurts I think. Tx again, Janet Davis",
