      "Content": "Singer1, let me share an interesting experience. I was dx with fibrocystic breasts. After a few mammograms and exams (including self exam) I could feel the lumps. They did send me to a breast surgeon and she felt around, looked at the x-rays and said \" you have lumpy breasts...just like me\". She also said nothing to worry about! Ok, so my aunt gets breast cancer and me being diabetic and usually pretty good about my annual physicals and mammograms, I have always been followed-up well and other than getting an early uterine cancer, have been fine. I just heard a few months ago that the breast surgeon was finally dx. with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. I guess the message... just do your yearly mamos and learn your body and trust your instincts. No guarantees that cystic breats don't get cancer. Just be a good patient and do your follow-ups.",

      "Content": "I hope you are seeing a gyn/onc. That is the absolute best way to go considering your family history and your prior cervical problems. The endo biopsy can be painful but it is your best source of information regarding what's going on in there. Bleeding that long isn't normal and if it is cancer, a hysterectomy can sometimes be all that's needed. It sure would take care of all the problems in one fell swooop! I am also diabetic.. discovered originally when I was pregnant (gestational). That ended with the baby and then 10 years later, dx with type II.. just as the doctor said would happen. I manage it with diet and medication and am making every effort to keep it under good control. It can be done. Your situation sounds like you are just on the beginning edges of type II and possibly just watching your diet will be enough. Stress also raises your blood sugars and when those are up, so are your cholesterol numbers.. all works together. If you get your endo bio results on the 3rd and it shows cancer, please go straight to a gyn/onc. Surgery stinks, but life can be pretty swell after!! Keep us posted...good luck to you.",
