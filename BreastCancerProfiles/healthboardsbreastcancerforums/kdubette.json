    "Content": "Hopefully you've seen your doctor by now. I felt a lump on September 26th. Saw my OB/GYN the 28th; mammogram/ultrasound the 29th; core biopsy the 30th. It was ductal carcinoma. By the time I had a partial mastectomy 10 days later, the tumor was bigger than a piece of charcoal and the cancer was invasive, meaning it was not contained in the tumor and had spread. Thing is, I'm only 40 and was due for my 1st mammogram this year. I had a physical 4 months ago and there was no lump at that time. I now go in for a full mastectomy, followed by chemo. See your doctor and get a mammogram... you may be cancer-phobic but better safe than sorry.",
