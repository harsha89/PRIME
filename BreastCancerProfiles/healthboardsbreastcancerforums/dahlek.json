    "Content": "I've been this route in the past year. A lump was detected & I was referred for tests, MRI's, more tests, this doc and that, needle biopsy, and all the rest. I found many very thorough sites after 'webbing' up info for \"BC information'. Give it a try. Now is NOT the time to waste your energy on the WHAT IF's! There are soo many different types of cancers it can turn your brain to mush. Wait till all the tests are in, ask all your docs, your friends and anyone who can give you input about good docs for your case...meaning surgeons, oconolgists, and whoever else you mite need. Work NOW to learn about the best docs and 'network' to find the turkeys. I know I got lucky in all my doc choices, saved my energy for recovering and getting on with life. Don't ever let fearmongers or folks who say/predict the worst get to you. Good researching for what you need, and learning the right words needed to web up what you need to know will get you far. I'm betting you will find LOTS of help out there - I know I did! Think positive, the cup is more than half-full. Keep it that way. Go to it NOW! Promise?",
