      "Content": "thanx for ur reply...my mother had said the same thing. i just remember my ducts being clogged after giving birth and it hurt like an s.o.b and this is painless. id say my last mam. was about 5 years ago when i was preggers. i do check myself tho every other month or so since cancer of the breast runs so rampant in my family. i hope it is a clogged duct or something...i will check with my doc; unfortunately imma be worried until then. sigh.....",

      "Content": "hello...last night after taking a bath i for some unknown reason checked my breasts and noticed a hard lump in my left breast underneath and to the side of my nipple. it doesnt move but it is real hard and about the size of a dime. i check my breasts every once in awhile so i know my normal lumpiness and this new lump definately is new. i do know that ive had several great*aunts who all had breast cancer...im 27 btw. im wondering if i should be concerned? its not painful and ive not noticed any discharge from that nipple...its just a hard lump. should i go see my doc.?",

      "Content": "thank you so much i will defiantely request the ultrasound along with the mammogram...im already scheduled for the ultrasound so ill still demand that it get done whether or not the mamm. comes up normal...otherwise ill not rest until i have one. thats exactly how my lump feels...its under my nipple tho. this is scary! u havent scared me for ive been scared all weekend. id rather know the possibilites and details than be blind and deny the whole thing. Theres alot of history in my family of this cancer and ugh its so scary. Ill know tomm. and i will for sure let u know how it turns out...hopefully its nothing. weird that something told me to check that breast tho..that scares me. anyways im a bundle of nerves lol. im rambling..shaking. i know how u feel about quacky doctors, there seems to be too many of em out there too. Thanks for your help and i will update tomm. imma try and get some sleep now (yeah right lol). Have a good night and thanx again!",
