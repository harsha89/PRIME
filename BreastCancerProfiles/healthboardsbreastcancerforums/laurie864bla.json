    "Content": "I just got back from staying with my 34 yr old best friend starting chemo on Monday. Her Dx was made after complaining of a lump that hurt a bit. They did an ultrasound, then a biopsy, then a DX of cancer. About a week later, she had a mamogram to see what it would look like on that, and to compare w/ later. It did not even show up on the mammogram! Get that sonogram. My friend had a very, very aggressive tumor and if it was not for her demanding stuff, she would be dying right now. Thank God she will be ok and it's out now, but chemo is no picnic. Be safe--she had absolutely NO risk factors.",
