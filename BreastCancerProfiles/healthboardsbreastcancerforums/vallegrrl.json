      "Content": "If you look into the oncotype you might want to be sure your insurance covers it- it's about $3500 and not all insurance will cover. I was offered it but declined because from what I already knew about my cancer I knew chemo would probably not make a major difference. My dr also emphasized that a low number does not mean you can't have a recurrence and a high number doesn't mean it's inevitable. I did 33 radiation treatments and am now on hormone therapy (Arimidex) for five years. I had a stage 1, grade 1, negative nodes, clean margins tumor and was 62 when diagnosed, no family history of breast cancer. There is also a website that drs use called \"shared decision making\" that gives information about recurrence- they have to enter your data. This is based on large group studies, not your individual tumor, but I found it very helpful in understanding my options, made me much more willing to do radiation and hormone therapy and less willing to do chemo. The radiology oncologist and the medical oncologist were both really good about taking all the time needed to explain all the options to me.",

      "Content": "I went through the came thing last October- biopsy results showed cancer. My family dr called me 48 hours after the biopsy and asked me to come in- she had the entire report on her computer, went through it with me and then printed a copy for me.She referred me to a surgeon and set up the appointment which was one week later. I had surgery ten days after I saw the surgeon. I've just finished radiation and started hormone therapy. The very worst part of the whole thing ws when I knew something was wrong but didn't know what or what would be done. It does get better. I thini it would be a good idea to ask the dr to go through the biopsy report with you and give you a copy of it.",

I was so nervous listening to the biopsy report that I misunderstood parts of what I was told anyway. Where you are right now was by far the most stressful part for me. Once I had the surgery and understood for sure what the situation was I could calm down and deal with it a lot better.",

      "Content": "I saw the surgeon today- incision is fine, she said underarm discomfort is normal for this stage and will slowly get better. She okayed me to return to work 4 hours a day until my hysterectomy next week. Also told me to get the strongest support bra I can find and wear it all the time.( I am a 48DD and gravity is quite a force to deal with) I worked 4 hours today, am tired but no worse than I feel by the end of the day at home, and less bored. I am lucky to have an employer who is glad to have me work whatever hours I can, very flexible. I am not looking forward to another round of surgery. Also was referred by my surgeon to an oncologist and a radiation oncologist- will meet with the radiation guy before my surgery, the other oncologist after it. I understand I am likely to have 6 weeks of daily radiation on top of the two surgeries. On the bright side, I have two wonderful tiny grandchildren and a lot to look forward to once I get through the next few months.",

Still slight discomfort under arm but much improved, also much better energy level and better mood, able to enjoy what I usually enjoy. Unfortunately, I am having a total hysterectomy in five days and will also start radiation as soon after that as I can, so I expect to be knocked on my butt again- but this chance to feel good for a few days inbetween is wonderful. It does improve each day.",

I opted for hormone therapy following radiation. When my radiologist was discussing the 4 month window with me it was in the context of no chemo first. I don't know what he would have said if I were having chemo first-that might change it.",

I had a hysterectomy two weeks after my lumpectomy- I waited a little longer to start radiation than I otherwise would, started almost 6 weeks after the hysterectomy, almost two months after the lumpectomy and am glad I did it that way. I was quite tired by the end of the 33 radiation treatents and would have been more tired had I started right after the hysterectomy. I was able to work straight through treatment although I did reduce my hours the last couple of weeks.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection with guide wire and radioactive dye stuff yesterday afternoon, have been home about 12 hours. I was entremely anxious with all I had heard about the wire and the dye shot. Neither was completely painless but neither was near as bad as I had heard, both were easier than the biopsy. I am sore this morning but moving around the house freely and very glad to be home. Worst part was just feeling weird from anesthesia and Vicodin, and the anxiety beforehand.Now that drugs have worn off I am just using an ice bag and am feeling clear headed and very glad to be home. Those of you who have this surgery coming up, try to relax, what I had heard was so much worse than it really was.",

      "Content": "yes, pathology report said clear margins and negative nodes. I go back to the surgeon next week; she is sending me to a radiation oncologist to start radiation as soon as incision heals enough. And in the middle of all this I go back to the hospital two weeks from today for a total hysterectomy- I have hyperplasia but can no longer be treated with progesterone because my breast cancer is strongly estrogen and progesterone positive, so they're pulling everything out, which is what I wanted in the first place. I am about 48 hours post lumpectomy now, have taken no pain meds except tylenol yesterday morning, am moving around, stitches under arm are slightly annoying because they pull a little, other than that no complaints except slightly tired. I didn't think I would feel this good this soon. All in all the surgery was easier than I thought it would be. Looking back, the roughest part, for me, was the ultrasound-guided biopsy, and even that was bearable- I didn't scream or cry, was able to tolerate it and stay still,just could feel it.",

I take tylenol at night, have not used any prescription pain meds so far. Had swollen hand part of one day, elevated it, okay by next morning. Wearing an industrial strength bra helps a lot. I sleep well at night, am up and around mornings- started driving day 4, have taken a couple of short shopping trips. Need a nap by afternoon, not much stamina. I am scheduled for a total hysterectomy next week so don't know if I will try to go back to work between or just stay at home and take it easy. I am not in pain and do not feel sick but am not 100% yet either.",

      "Content": "I just started Arimidex last month after a lumpectomy and 33 radiation treatments. I had a bone density scan before I started. The oncologist told me I will need a bone scan once a year as long as I am taking it. She went over side effects including joint pain and others, told me to start on a calcium and VitD supplement now. So far the pain I have always had in one knee is slightly worse and I have some back stiffness when I sit for long periods. My hair is thinning slightly- I got it cut as short as I could stand it last month.I was impressed with the long term results of drug studies for arimidex for women in my situation and so far am glad it is available- compared to radiation it's not hard to cope with, we'll see if I still feel this way a year or two from now..",
