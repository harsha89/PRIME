      "Content": "thanks for replying. I didn't hear the surgeon use the term true cut biopsy, but when he tried to draw fluid there wasn't any, so he took cells from 3 different places in the lump. I remember it was 3 because I felt the needle go in 3 times, and it hurt! I understand what you're saying about getting the biopsy done. My understanding was the surgeon wanted to wait a couple months to see if the evening primose oil he told me to take would help for the pain- I have never had ANY type of breat pain before, and ever since i found the lump it is hurting off and on, and only in that breast. He kept saying he didn't want to give me a scar, I guess because he is so confident that it is benign. I have another question- so a fibrocystic change CAN be a solid lump and not literally a cyst? I thought any fibrocystic change had to be a cyst. When I first felt the lump it seemed fairly deep, but now I can feel it more easily, like it's almost risen to the top of the breast. It is no larger in size though....",

      "Content": "Hi- I was hoping to get some advice or ideas about what's going on. I am 27, and a month ago I saw a slightly red spot on my left breast, and felt a thickening beneath it. I have never had a lump, thickening before so I immed. made an appt. A couple days after I noticed it, the area began to hurt. It generally hurts when it is touched/poked, but not always. Sometimes the pain radiates all through my left breast, sometimes just localized to that area. I also felt pain in my left underarm, like it was swollen. So I had a mammogram on both breasts, and it came back as benign. But my ultrasound hasn't come back yet, and I am going crazy wondering what is going on. What concerns me the most is I don't understand why my armpit would be hurting as well as the breast. Coincidently or not, I also came down with a bad cold,virus at about the same time, and my ears hurt, throat was swollen, and I attributed the armpit pain and swelling to that. But I am feeling better now, except for a slightly sore throat, so I don't understand why my armpit is still hurting along with my breast. Does this happen with cysts, fibroadenomas? I can't find out this info on the net! Thanks in advance! Libbie",

      "Content": "I've posted here before about a lump I found in my left breast. Had a mammogram, ultrasound (2 of them), and nothing showed up on any of these tests- even though the lump is palpable by hand. I had a fine needle aspiration of it last week and was told that it is solid lump, no fluid, and nothing suspicious was found in the cells they drew. I was told by my general surgeon (who seems really good and very experienced) that he thinks there is only a 3% chance it could be cancerous, and really does not want me to have a biopsy done. He said to wait a few months and call back if there are any changes. I am having breast pain in the breast with the lump only, and he says this is probably a fibrocystic change. This is another reason why he thinks the lump is benign. I have read on the internet that FNA is not very accurate, so I don't know whether to really push for the biopsy or not. I am so tired of all these tests! I don't know whether to believe the surgeon, esp. since I have had all these tests done and nothing suspicious was found, or go ahead and demand a biospy, since I know that is the only way to 100% know it's not cancerous. Any ideas? I'm 27 by the way.",
