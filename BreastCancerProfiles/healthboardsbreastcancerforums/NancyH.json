      "Content": "Most of it is media hype. If you pay attention heart disease is the number ONE killer of women, young or old by the way, lung cancer is second. HD accounts for twice the death rate than breast cancer. Not down playing it or anything as I have had pre cancerous tumors removed from my breast so I'm at a very high risk. I just think with it being down the list of deadly cancers it receives more attention than the number one and number two cancers that hit women the hardest. It also strikes men heavily to but they don't mention that much do they? Maybe cuz their breasts aren't as exciting? Montel Williams had breast cancer. You don't get the pretty pink bows with HD for women like you do for breast cancer either. My grandmother had breast cancer but it was the heart disease that took her life before the cancer did. I find it irritating that so much of breast cancer is power pushed over the media and yet the number one killer is shoved aside. HD kills twice as many women every year as breast cancer so they need to get on it more and not forget BC but gee, like it is the only cancer out there. My daughters 26yr old friend died of a heart attack, no one in the family has heart disease and it was very sudden. a single mom whose heart attack left 2 kids orphaned, her husband died the year earlier of prostrate cancer. It is a disease of the young and old, there is no such thing as an old peoples disease anymore.",

      "Content": "Maybe it's always been like this with most diseases. Now a days with the technology in communications it's almost impossible to not know what is going on anywhere else in the world. Back in the old days the only form of communication what some newspapers, no TV or radio, and back then people didn't talk about what ailed them especially when it came to the sensitive parts of the anatomy.",
