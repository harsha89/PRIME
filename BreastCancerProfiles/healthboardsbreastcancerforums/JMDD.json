    "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm posting for my wife...who rather not ask certain questions. Her doc suggested laproscopic surgery for a pedunculated fibroid that she has had for some time but now has gotten to big. They told her they are 99% is not cancerous ...lets hope it is and they dont find anything else. They will do it on a Friday but told her she will be out of work for a week! Has anyone here had this done? What is the recovery like? I'm trying to plan my work trips but want to be there for her starting that Monday-? if she needs me. Any info on the surgery or recovery will be greatly appreciated!! Thanks!! JM",
