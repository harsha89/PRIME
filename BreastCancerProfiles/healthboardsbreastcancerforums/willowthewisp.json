      "Content": "Hello, sorry i cant help with an answer but i would love to know how you are getting on. I finished all my treatment in Oct 2011 for the highest grade breast cancer, i was on 2 types of chemo and has RT and tumour and lymph nodes removed, but suddenly out of the blue my breast has swollen and i cant stop itching my buttocks/tops of legs etc, they are swelling and becoming bruised because i am ripping at my skin. But i dont think its odema?? I know the area around my breast is still swollen even if it doesnt look it because i can tell when i put my arm in my coat, its all tight and when i put my bra on again its all tight. I wish you good luck for 2012 x",

      "Content": "Hi Tumbleweed, I myself have/had Triple negative breast cancer, so i am telling you what i know as a patient, not a dr, and i will explain in the easy terms in which i wish someone had bothered to explain to me. The only way i can explain this is that when we have our tumours/lymph nodes taken out, they are tested for certain hormones, there are 3 hormones that us ladies have, and if you have one, two or three of these hormones show up in the tumour, it means a positive result, if you don't have any of these 3 hormones show up, it means a negative result, hence triple negative. From what my oncologist told me, it is better to be positive, because these ladies go on to anti cancer drugs for the next five years, and it helps fight against the cancer, but us triple negative ladies can't do this, so they feel the best thing is to give us a bout of chemo just in case there are any stray cancer cells still in our body. With the positive ladies, their anti cancer drugs may catch any stray cells, but of course we dont have the tablets, so we have the chemo instead. I don't know what country you are in, but there are Triple negative forums out there, especially in American, i joined them as here in England triple negative cancer is quite rare. From what ive been told, its not the best cancer to have, but its not the worst either, and it all depends on how big the tumour was, and what grade and stage it was as well. I had the worst grade possible, grade 3, so i have been told my will more likely come back, and i feel like im sitting with a ticking time bomb to be honest, but i have to carry on as normal, i dont have any choice. I really hope your daughter does well, please update and let me know how she gets on. If you want to ask anything else, just say. I have only given you the advice my oncologist told me, but i hope this helps you , all the best to your daughter xx",

      "Content": "Hello, I have such a sore and uncomfortable stomach and everytime i eat i feel so sick. It feels like my stomach is just raw, and the linings been burnt off!! I am having chemotherapy for breast cancer and had my last round on 5th August, also i have been having very strong intravenous antibiotics (Tazazin) because the drs thought i had picked up an infection but i hadn't. I take 20mg of Omeprazole everyday to try and protect my stomach. What can be causing this, its just constant and is horrible, i know whatever i eat no matter how small and bland i will feel sick afterwards. But the belly is very swollen and uncomfortable, plus i am very constipated. Is this all down to the chemo, i never had this before, this is my 4th round of chemo. ( I also have a very sore tongue, had treatment for thrush so its not that and there is nothing to see on the tongue, its just sore.)??? Any ideas anyone as its really getting me down living like this, i already feel very ill and weak from the chemo itself.",
