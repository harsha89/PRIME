      "Content": "my fiance recently noticed a tiny, tiny knot (like smaller than the size of a BB) under his left nipple that is extremly painful when he touches it, i did all the research about male breast cancer and (so far) he has no other symptoms and he just woke up this morning and his nipple was sore. he is 19 a non smoker (although he does rub snuff on occasion) he weighs 160 and is in very good health, not even a cold in the last year, and (that i can think of) none of his family members have or had cancer (but i will ask to make sure) i realize that the odds of this are pretty small but i am just so worried, his health insurance isnt effective yet and it may be a month or so till it is, so getting it looked at right now isnt an option... i just need honest advice, i am scared to death. if it isnt cancer then what else could it be?",
