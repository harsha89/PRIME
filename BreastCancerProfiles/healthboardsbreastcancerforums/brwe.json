      "Content": "I was diagnosed with dcis almost 5 years ago. I had lumpectomy, radiation, and am still taking tamoxifen. I had a mammogram done yesterday, there was a suspicious spot, and now my Dr. wants me to get an MRI. I was told that I had hardly any chance of recurrence on the same side. My mom died of breast cancer in 1980; she put off getting a lump checked out because my dad had had a heart attack. By the time she was diagnosed, it was already in her lungs. I am really scared. Has anyone else had to have the MRI under similiar circumstances that turned out to be negative?",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I did schedule the MRI for next week. So far, I have been diligent with my checkups and mammograms, but haven't had a pap smear in at least two years. I believe that tamoxifen increases the chance of cervical cancer, so I will definitely get that done as well. I wish you all the best.",
