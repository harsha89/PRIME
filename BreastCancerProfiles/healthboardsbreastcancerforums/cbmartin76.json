    "Content": "How is your treatment going? So sorry to hear about what you are going through. YOur case sound similar to my mother's, she just started Abraxane as well. She was diganosed 2 1/2 years ago. The cancer went away for a few months (although I doubt it went away at all) but returned again in her spine and hip bones and part of her liver. She had done taxol before and Gemzar (sp?). Her first round of abraxane put her back in the hospital though. He blood counts were all really low and she had two transfusions while in there. My poor mother also had a heart attack at 47 and they have to closely monitor her heart because of the chemo. She had a lot of join pain, she said it was the worse pain of her life, worse than labor. Did you experience that? I hope you beat it this time around. I know we are hoping this is the chemo that works for my mom. Keep me posted on your progress. Courtney",
