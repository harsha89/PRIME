      "Content": "lintek45 I don't know how large the node is but there are a few enlarged,one much larger.I cannot feel it at all.They showed up on the digital mamo Feb.23.On March 16th went for different views of the breast.I had about 8 different views taken.Then proceeded to another room for the sono.The sonographer went over the same area for a while,asked if I had been sick,I knew she saw something.The radiologist then came in and asked if I had been sick or had a bug bite,I guess to explaine the node.He also did the sono and compared both underarms.It is just my right side of concern.He wants to do a bilateral fine needle biopsyThursday,I wish it was sooner. I have no lumps anywhere,He said I do have a density in my right,thats why they took so many views,I guess between the density and my node.He is being cautious. I have no family history of breast cancer.I think you definitly should go for another opinion. Good luck to you to.I will let you know.Iv'e been on every cancer site and it scares me,and I'm not an alarmist. Sincerly Annamarie",
