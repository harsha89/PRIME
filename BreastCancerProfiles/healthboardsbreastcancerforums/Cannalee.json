She takes pain pills, hot baths, etc. for the aches and discomfort. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "Goodness, I'm not sure what the MRI means either--sounds like the sinuses might be impacted all the way up! I know sometimes the docs like to \"drill\" the sinuses for drainage, but I've heard results aren't always very good on that and it is extremely painful! Hopefully they'll prescribe antibiotics first and see what that does. Well, brought hubby home this past Monday and learned from our insurance that our doctor was no longer affiliated with them (effective January 1,2006) --its' an HMO type insurance and our doc had all these specialists called in--mercy! The insurance assured me they would cover all the bill, even if at first it was denied--we'll see! The letter was postmarked Jan 9th, I received it Jan 10th--supposedly effective Jan 1! I called my doctor and asked if my husband ran into \"problems\" the 10th if that meant I could not call them for help and they answered \"that is why it is imperative you get a doctor for him right away\"--I opened the letter at 1 pm and had to leave for work at 2pm--I said \"it's not going to happen today\" and the office manager said I needed to get a doc right away--talk about abandonment! After 17 years with this doc hubby was abandoned because of insurance changes! My hubby is weak as a kitten and very fragile cardiac wise--the same day the cardiologist called me to set up an appointment and assured me if my husband ran into cardiac problems to call them--that was a comfort but the insurance said I needed a \"referral\" from a family practioner affiliated with them to cover the cardiologist services...the CCU had a saying \"baby steps\"....Friday we had an appointment with a new family doctor recommended by two of my nurse friends, and he agreed to work with our cardiologist...he also agreed to prescribe physical therapy with my favorite therapist...the guy with \"therapeutic touch\"--a step at a time: my husband was able this morning to get himself up on the bedside commode with no \"help\" from me--it's progress. The prognosis is not good for my husband, but a step at a time: this I know: Love beats all odds, every day.... Thanks for being here...I hope all goes well for your daughter and am very very glad your diagnosis turned out so well!",

      "Content": "Dear DazedandConfused, an MRI has a scale based on the weight of the tumor, which indicates the liklihood of a mass being malignant...I hope and pray your mass is benign, but having been in the field for years, I am inclined to agree with a surgeon I knew years ago who specialized in breast cancer: he one day confided in me that he did not understand at all women who shrunk from having a breast biopsy or who insisted on \"keeping\" a breast which was shown to have breast cancer and could cost the woman her life... I do not believe in \"watching\" a mass, whether it will \"grow\" or not--that is impossible to \"watch it\" first of all, and second, why take the risk? That's sloppy medicine on the doctor's part IMO...if you have a mass that gets your attention, then for life's sake, get a biopsy...quickly...breast tissue is highly plasic, that is things grow and spread in it readily...if the biopsy comes back positive for malignancy, do not opt for the \"simple\" but get rid of the breast...the risks just ain't worth keeping the breast...besides, who wants a diseased, rotten breast anyway? I knew a case in which the girl went for the simple--by the time she and the surgeon realized the cancer was not completely removed, it had wrapped itself around her esophagus and aorta...she died, leaving a 5 year old son parentless...the grief her mother (my best friend) and her son deal with every day can not be assauged or comforted...every day this girl's mother and son hurt for loss of this beautiful young mother...all because she tried to keep a diseased breast intact, and her doctor concurred in this decision! I have had many many elderly patients who had a radical mastectomy \"years ago\",ie. ten, twenty, thirty, years ago...what does that tell you about the survival rates? These ladies lived to a \"ripe old age\", fully enjoying their lives...I realize there is chemo and new radiation therapies etc. and that it is not politically \"correct\" to be advocating radical surgery, especially if you don't know if its malignant yet or not, but I am encouraging you with all my heart to go after this with the attitude of \"get rid of it if it's gonna kill me...\" type view...that is the view this successful surgeon had and he imparted to his patients...few of them died from breast cancer...they were survivors, and were thrilled to be survivors...patients that let doctors \"whittle\" at a cancer a little at a time, end up dead...if it's malignant (God forbid!) then command your doctor to get rid of it--all of it with a wide resection...hopefully it will turn out benign, but this is written in case it is not to encourage you to fight for life...I sincerely mean it that i will be praying for you and hoping fervently that it is benign...",

      "Content": "DazedandConfused: OMG! I am so sorry to hear about your ex! And for you to have to have all this uncertainty hanging over you is too much...I realize the stress has got to be horrible, but somehow you will get through this! That the doctor was \"comfortable\" waiting two weeks is a very good sign: most doctors I have known, if concerned about the possibility of a patient having a malignancy would have operated no matter how late the hour. So that the doctor was willing to wait, while not very considerate of your stress in waiting, is a very good sign I think. The 22nd is a ways off; I think I would put it back in my mind like a dental appt. faraway: you have done your part, so go Christmas shopping, take in a movie, do some stuff you like, and shelve the worrying until the 21st...concentrate on your daughter and your ex's family and most of all, do a couple of pleasant things this season just for you....and we'll keep in touch...and of course will be praying that this thing will be benign.

      "Content": "You have a lot on your plate honey...how old is your daughter? My hubby has a \"thing\" in his head they discovered back in 1987--all the doctors agreed it needed to come out, but no one wanted to operate...(we buried his Dad of brain cancer in Oct. 1986, and found my husband's in Dec. 1986 actually) My adopted oldest teenager picked that time to regress to a state of rage (from her early childhood years of abuse prior to being adopted) and I worked 12 hr./day shift...it was hell. There is life after hell...my husband opted never to have the brain surgery, the thing in his head is evidently encapsulated and not growing...but the shock when you first hear news like that I will never forget. Hang in there....sometimes with today's technology we learn things \"accidentlally\" about our bodies that years ago we never would have known and actually never adversely affect us...like cysts. Colloid cysts turn up in various places in the body--such as in the breast and the brain I am ever so hopeful that there is a family tendency to develope such cysts (which are completely harmless and tendency to develope them is hereditary)and that will be case for you and your daughter. I fervently hope so. Wishing you a beautiful Christmas, Candy (I will be in and out on the board infrequently but will definitely be here the 22nd!)",

My hubby was better at understanding about ex's than I was--I felt somewhat threatened by his ex, who seemed to be everything I was not but guess that happens.... A half hour massage is on my secret wish list but alas--guess it was too secret!
