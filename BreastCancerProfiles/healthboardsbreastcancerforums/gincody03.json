After 3 months of going to a doctor who treated her for breast milk infection which she didn't have. She also had a mammogram but it doesn't show anything.

      "Content": "I don't have cancer in any of my family background. I found a lump in my breast-- I skipped one year mamogram.. I had a biopsy done it was easy they have me a valium 10 minutes before the prodecure I felt nothing and was very elaxed. Well I did have cancer in feb 05. I had it removed and I'm glad they did because there was more cancer in it and didn't show on the mammogram. HAVE THAT BIOPSY DONE AS SSON AS POSSIBLE--every day that goes by counts... Judy",
