      "Content": "Hey Beppie.....I had invasive ductal ....found out with regular mammogram. I was less than 2 cm. and stage 2. I had the lumpectomy....didn't stay over night and was driving the next day....wasn't surpose to...but I am single and hate to ask people to do things for me. I did 33 days of radiation and I will tell you, you will get tired.I did teach during that time. I am on Femara and it does make me tired and achy, but I feel blessed that it was caught when it was....it could be worse. You will find that BC survivors are strong and supportive people...I have a friend who is a 20 year survivor. I found everyone that were involved...drs. rad. nurses were absolutely wonderful. They will do a sentinel node test during surgery to see if the lymph nodes are involved. It's a dye and travels to the first 2 lymph node and they will test those. It sounds like it was caught early and probably none are involved. KD just had a lumpectomy and she'll be on the board. It's normal to be upset, but it could always be worse! Come back to vent, if you need to...we have all been there.",

      "Content": "Hey Beth. I posted a reply yesterday, but who knows what happened to it! I did have a lumpectomy and did not spend the night at the hospital....sort of like a drive thur! I drove the next day...wasn't surpose to, but had a couple of things to do. I took 33 days of radiation....I will tell you....it makes you tired, but I taught while I was taking it....the process you are talking about I don't know about, but have heard of it. When I was told I had BC, I was so brave.....I suprised myself!! My mom had it when she was 81 and went through it , so she was my inspiration. It was only after all the treatments that it really hit me.....I found it was like the stages of grief. The realization hit me. We have Cancer Services and they offered a program called Survive and Thrieve and it was just what I needed. I met some wonderful people and my eyes were opened at how some young people at age 16 faced and fought the beast. As for Femara, I don't know the time limit. I have only been on it a year. I know it is 5 yrs most people stay on it. Did they say when you will have surgery? I know you don't think so right now, but you are very fortunate that they found it so early. Along the journey, you will meet some extraordinary survivors...they will give you inspiration and strength...as will we.",

I was able to carry on everyday, but had to rest. I had the sentinel nodes tested and they were clean. I take Femara since my was hormonal. I am 61 and have no children...have a sister but she had back surgery about 2 weeks after mine. Your friends and neighbors will be there for you.....the breast cancer community is very close. Stay strong and keep on posting as we are your sisters.",
