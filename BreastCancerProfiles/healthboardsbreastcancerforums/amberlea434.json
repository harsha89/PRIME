    "Content": "Hopefully I'm just panicked and worried over nothing, but I'm hoping ya'll could give me some advice. I've been reading on this thread and online about the symptoms of IBC and how an itchy nipple is one of them. Well, here's my question... is it just the nipple itself or the entire breast? And do you have a dry patch of skin, as well? The reason I ask is because for a couple of months now, I've had a small, dime size patch of dry skin right above my nipple. It's not red or inflammed, but it makes my nipple and breast itch constantly. I've been putting some cream on it that I had got from my dermatologist a while back that he gave me for some other dry skin that I've had, and it helps a lot with the itching...but the dry patch just won't seem to go away. I have no other symptoms of IBC, so do you think I'm just being paranoid?",
