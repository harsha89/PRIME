    "Content": "Hi marion, As a person with a family history of breast cancer, you probably know that they're all serious, to a certain degree. I was diagnosed last spring with stage I cancer at the age of 49. I was peri-menopausal, ER and PR+ and HER-. I also had a lumpectomy ( and no node involvement ) and was originally told I would just have radiation. My physicians decided it would be best to have chemo as it lowers the chance of recurrence in younger patients. It wasn't fun, but it was manageable. The radiation was a piece of cake after that. I'm now on Femara for next 5 years. I found that anti-anxiety meds were very helpful and would strongly recommend them. Not a huge dose, but enough to help deal with each \" stop on the road \" as they appeared. Hope that helps. Kathy p.s. Your daughter may want to consider genetic testing. I'm doing it so i can give my daughter as much potential future info as possible.",
