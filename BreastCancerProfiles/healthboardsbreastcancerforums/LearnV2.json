      "Content": "Hello all, thanks for looking. About me: I am a 19 yr young male; ~ 5ft 8 in ... ~165lbs. I have an athletic body. I am very healthy to my knowledge. I run mid-5 minute miles, play various sports, lift weights, swim for extended periods of time, etc. I eat and rink pretty darn healthy. Lots of water and orange juice, lots of balanced meals, little sweets, no sodas, no alcohol, no drugs. I had my substance abuse stages very early. Been clean for ~ 4 years now. THE CONCERN: Just a few minutes ago, I felt a little pain in one of my breast ... just to the side of my nipple. I gently rubbed my hand over the pain and it felt very tender ... like the slightest touch is equivalent to a fairly strong pinch. Pulled up my shirt, and yes, I have a bruise about the size of a thumbnail. When I rub into the bruise a bit, it feels like a small firm stucture lies there .. and when comparing to the other breast ... I am certain that the other breast does not have the same firm little lump that seems to not raise above the skin contour but only exist underneath. I do not recall having any sort of impact at any time that could have caused a bruise like this. I do not recall myself ever finding bruises on my body that seemed to have no cause from impact. I suppose, if I have just occured some impact and forgot ... then both the bruise ... and the inflamed/firm tissue beneath the skin have a clear cause and will go away. My main concern is that this has occured from something other than impact. I just got kicked off of my mom's health insurance plan and I have no insurance at this time, so I am only going to call a local Patient First ... and maybe my previous general health care physician when their office opens tomorrow. Please respond and include any credentials, citation from source of information etc or lack thereof. All responses welcome. I will post up what I find out from phone calls as well to add to the archives. Thanks! Re: Random bruise and firmness by nipple. Concerned. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just got off of the phone with a nurse from Patient First. I wanted to clarify somethings. First, it seems that what is the main issue is this lump/firmness fairly deep undeneath the skin ... maybe between the size of a thumbnail and a pinkynail. The discoloration that I saw on my skin is not typical bruise-like. There is no purple/red/yello combo like a bruise. I think the only discoloration may be from me rubbing the lump and irritating the skin a bit when compressing the lump .. and the colo is a light pink. Again, even a gently brush of my hands over the lump (which is not above ... but feels like a few layers below the skin) ... makes it feel like somebody just pinched me. I cannot tell if the lump/firm structure seems to be fluctuating in size or not ... possibly from whether I am messing with it or leaving it alone. When I epxlained this to the nurse, she said: This definitely rules out hair follicle infection ... lol. I suppose the only other things that it could be are ... maybe some sort of cyst ... whether it be benign or malignant. This could mean beginning of some sort of cancer. It could also mean some stupid lump that will hopefully stop hurting I suppose. I also read another thread in the breat cancer section where some young lady said she had a similar circumstace, got a biopsy ... and was told it was some \"fibro\" ... BLAH BLAH ETC ... and not harmful. I am going to wait for a few days, to see if it disappears ... or gets worse ... stays the same ... whatever. Then if it does anything other than disappear ... I am going to have to spring some cash to go see somebody. I own a start up business and have no health insurance at this time. Even if I got a job benefits would not kick in for 3-6 months at earliest .. so .. this cld cost me a \"pretty penny\". The nurse told me to apply heat to it to try to increase circulation and see if it disappeared. I sure hope that it does. I have had DARN HARD life as is .. and I know I am not alone ... over coming MANY obsatcles at an early age though .. that seem to have set me apart from a very large majority. I know I would overcome cancer ... or whatever serious alment this could be ... but I ... of course ... would REALLY HATE to have to put up with it. I have so many good things to look forward to in the near future .. both business obligations and donations to charities/humanitarian aide .. accomplishment in business, family, friends, adventuire etc. I would so hate to put a damper on that from something that just crept up on me like this. Just venting/ranting. This really reminds me of how many random people have to put up with such unfortunate circumstances where things like this turn out to be a life-threatening battle ... at random times. It really makes me passionate about these \"unlucky\" people, and reminds me to donate some time and money to helping them. I know a lot of cancerous things truly do have causes from diet and lifestyle though ... and I don't think that I am subjecting myself to those causes ... so I really would be astonished if this turned out to get \"really bad\". Wish me \"luck\" people, please Please respond with as much info as you can. All responses welcome. Thanks!",

      "Content": "UPDATE: I waited it out and it disappeared. I do not know what it was and I may never know. I kinda regret not going to the doctor to get an idea of what it may have been. Regardless, I hope I never experience anything similar again .... especially not cancer ... and I am so very glad that this worked out this way. Again, I have no idea what it was ... and I wish I did know. I know it wasn't a hair follicle infection/clogged pore infection/in-grown hair etc. I have experienced that. This was very deep under the skin and felt much like the simulated cancer lumps that I have felt when I used to study a bit about cancer in school. Maybe it was some sort of blood clot. I have NO idea. It was a good reminder of how cancer could creep up on anyone ... at any random time ... and it encouraged me to donate time and money for the fight against cancer. My sincere condolences to those of you that have found your random bumps to be cancer. The run down: Day 2 it got larger 2 dimensionally and 3 dimensionally ... and a bit more painful. I started taking about 2,660 % daily intake of Viatmin E in 2 400 IU tablets PER DAY ... to aid my immune system. I increased my already large daily intake of Vitamin C through supplements and Orange Juice to aid my immune system. I took long hot showers and massaged the area. I applied a heat pad to it at every time possible. Day 3 It seemed a bit larger but the pain went away. It slowly decreased in size/pain discoloration and by day 7 ... it was \"completely\" gone ... although I can still feel a silohuette of soft and flat tissue where it was. Happy Holidays!!!!",
