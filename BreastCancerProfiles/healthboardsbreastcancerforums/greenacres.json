      "Content": "No you're not wrong to get a definitive answer. I had the exact same scenario. I'm 37. \"Had\" lump in left breast. EVERYONE could feel it. Mammo and U/S were normal (go figure). I was concerned and expressed that to my ob/gyn, he referred me to a breast surgeon. She said \"it's gotta come out, the best lump is one in a jar\"!. Had it out 5/2 and although it's benign, the findings put me at higher risk for BC sometime in my life. See my post just below this about my pathology results. DEMAND a lumpectomy and get it out and get it biopsied hun. GOOD LUCK and let us know of the results.",

      "Content": "Hi Linda, thanks for answering. I did have a followup appt. and she basically told me that my risk of getting BC sometime in my life is 1.5 - 2x higher. For example, normal risk right now is 1 in 7 and my risk is 1 in 5. She is going to have me get breast MRI's until I'm 40 (I will be 38 in Oct.). So, two of them coming up before I go to regular Mammo's again because my breasts are extremely hetergenously dense (that's what is says on my mammo along with benign calcifications). Her exact words were she wouldn't be concerned if it had just read \"adenosis\" but because it says adenosis with sclerosis, the sclerosis is her concern. I need to keep doing my monthly BSE's and also annual testing with Breast MRI to check for abnormalities. From my research online (scary, although I rely on it 2nd to my breast surgeon), I have found the same information, that sclerosis does put me at higher risk, which is also scary. My risk factors are grandmother had DCIS (no first relative w/BC though, so far), my mother has Fibrocystic BD, I had my first period at age 11.5, my first child at 32, was on birth control, have been on HRT/estrogen for 2 years. I'm sure I have a couple others LOL!. Anyway, THANKS again for your reply.",

      "Content": "my surgeon says I have a 1.5 - 2x higher rate of getting breast cancer sometime in my life based on these results (benign), however proliferative breast disease is what this sums up. Other comments are welcome. I had my excisional/lumpectomy biopsy two weeks ago on the 2nd of May. It's healing very nice and hardly any pain anymore. Thanks everyone! \"Received in two parts. Part \"A\" labeled \"left side breast mass\" consists of a 3.5 by 3.5 by 2cm fibroadipose tissue with one string indicating superior and two strings indicating medial aspects. The medial aspect of the specimen demonstrates a 3 by 2.5 by 1.5 cm tan rubbery area which is toward the posterior surface. The posterior surface is inked and representative sections are submitted in two cassettes. Part \"B\" labeled \"posterior margin, left side breast mass\" consists of a 2.5 by 2 by 1.5 cm irregular portion of tan rubbery tissue. Sections reveal tan somewhat fibrotic cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.\" Diagnosis: \"A\" left breast lump; excision: adenosis and stromal sclerosis Diagnosis: \"B\" left breast lump, posterior margin; excision: adenosis and stromal sclerosis.",

      "Content": "Here are what the results read - ANY INPUT? I will be picking up my letter during my lunch hour that my ob/gyn sent to me. I have no idea what it says - hopefully it says I have the choice if I'd like it biopsied or not since he did mention that it was my choice to have it \"excised\" if it was still causing me pain. The thing that bothers me about this is it does NOT say that they found a palpable lump during my U/S in the report, but both the radiologist and tech saw it on the screen cause they were trying to figure out what it was. Anyway, here is what it says: Indication: left upper outer quadrant breast pain. Findings: The breasts are heterogeneously dense which limits mammographic sensitivity and can obscure a mass. Within the bilateral breasts, no suspicious calcifications, architectural distortion or dominant suspicious mass is seen. Benign calcifications are noted in the left breast. Benign appearing lymph nodes are seen in the bilateral axillary regions. Some asymmetry of breast tissue greater on the left than the right is seen. This was seen on the prior study as well. Ultrasonic evaluation of the left upper outer quadrant was recommended and performed. Ultrasonic images demonstrate normal fibroglandular tissue. No evidence of a solid or cystic mass is seen. Impression: 1. No mammographic or ultrasonic evidence of malignancy. 2. Follow-up is recommended at age 40. 3. Monthly breast self exam is recommended. 4. The decision to biopsy a palpable finding in the face of a negative mammogram and ultrasound must be made clinically. That's it - basically what I get from this - dense breasts, could obscure cancer. We didn't see anything, we don't know what's in there, maybe a biopsy would tell you if you have cancer or not - that's what I get. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Usually, when a cancer is growing, it shows calcifications around the tumor in a linear fashion and sometimes they indicated pleomorphic linear calcifications. That is how mine showed. I had Stage 1, IDC just finishing up tratment, diagnosed in 12/2009. I hope and pray it's not cancer, please post back and let us know how it went. GOOD LUCK to you!
