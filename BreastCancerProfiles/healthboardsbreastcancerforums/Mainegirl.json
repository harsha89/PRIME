    "Content": "I had several lumps in my breasts and my OB sent me to get a mammogram. They said that most likely they were sebaceous cysts that form out of nowhere. They hurt because when your cycle comes around, they get hard and rub against the nerves in your breasts. My general surgeon didn't think they were big enough to drain through a needle so he suggested I try some vitamin E caplets when they started to hurt. Supposedly, vitamin E keeps the cysts soft. I had a breast reduction in 2005 and my kind PS took out as many cysts as he could find. I have one or two that still act up but the vitamin E helps.",
