    "Content": "Hello. I am 31 years old and have recently found a lump on the right side of my neck. It is approximately midway down between the jaw and the collar bone. It is under the skin and has grown slightly in the past week or two. I first noticed it a couple of months ago but didn't pay too much attention to it at the time. I was planning on scheduling an appointment to have it looked at when I remembered that I was hospitalized for four days in December, 2001 with mastitis. I have not breastfed my children and the doctor did not offer a lot of information about how the infection started. I had a follow-up mammogram and they were not certain that the infection had completely cleared up and I was to have a second mammogram. However, I became pregnant shortly thereafter and am waiting for the second mammogram appointment. I am wondering if the lump I recently found can have something to do with the mastitis? The only thing that is out of the ordinary is that I have lost approximately 50 pounds since the hospitalization. While this has been intentional and the result of eating better and exercising, I have briefly wondered why I have had so much success with losing weight (even while pregnant) when I have never been able to lose the weight in the past. I called my GYN/OB to ask if the two could be related, and the nurse immediately scheduled an appointment for tomorrow morning. This nurse made me nervous, as she appeared quite concerned about me getting in quickly. If anyone has any insight into this matter, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for reading this far!
