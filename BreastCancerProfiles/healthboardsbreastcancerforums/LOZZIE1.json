      "Content": "well,i had my mastectomy 5 days ago and so far i seem to be coping ok.i had all of the axillary nodes removed on that side.my main problem is that i still have a drain in which is a pain but i think that will be out by tomorrow.surprisingly i am managing my pain with just paracetamol.my docter gave me some tramadol but after taking just 2 i had a bad reaction to them,very sick,dizzy and feeling like a zombie so i will not be taking any more.am feeling better emotionly now i am wearing a bra with the soft falsie in.i couldnt cope with looking down and seeing a flat space where my lovely bood used to be.my lovely new husband,as of 3 days before the surgery,has been an angel,helping me to bath,washing my hair, and doing all the cooking and cleaning.he has also told me that he doesnt want me to have a reconstruction,as for him its just not important and he doesnt want me going through more surgery,ahh,bless him.felt like cring when he said that,but then i fell like crying a lot at the moment,i guess thats to be expected at this stage.i go for my check-up next week and i will fing out how many nodes were involved and what happens next.i am preparing myself for chemo.",

      "Content": "sorry i havent posted for a while,things have been a bit hectic.i have now found out that i have invasive lobular carcinoma in my right breast.i have 2 tiny tumours,both around 7mm in size and i also have lymph node involvement in my right armpit,but after a bone scan and full body ct i am clear of any spread which is good news.i was hoping for a lumpectomy but because i have 2 area's of cancer this is not possible,apparently.my mastectomy is to be done on August 2nd,just 3 days after i get married.no honeymoon for me!!i am more worried about the chemo and radio that will follow.i had chemo for my lung cancer last year but i have read that breast cancer chemo is quite different.will i defiantly lose all my hair?i didnt lose any last year.and i am terrified about losing my eyelashes and eyebrows.i know i sound really vain but these things are part of me and losing a breast is going to be bad enough.i am hoping to be able to carry on working through my treatment if i dont suffer to badly from it.has anyone else managed to work through their chemo?anyway,for now i am just trying to concentrate on my wedding day and the fact i shall be able to enjoy it with both boobs!!!",

      "Content": "i have just had the results from my biopsies and it is breast cancer.at least they think its a primary in the breast but they are not sure if it has stemmed from my lung cancer last year.i am devastated,terrified,heartbroken and loads of other emotions i cant describe.i am waiting for a ct scan and hopefully that will tell them more.i know i will have to have a mastactomy and chemo and radio and that is all frightening in itself.i would be truely grateful for any words of hope.",

      "Content": "i posted here last week saying that i had found a marble sized movable lump in my right armpit only a year after being diagnosed with and surviving lung cancer.well,i have had a mammagram and ultrasound and the lump is a lymphnode which is a little swollen but doesnt look suspicious.but the mammagram showed up two tiny,and i mean tiny,about 2-3mm,areas in my right breast.they are not lumps,just little patches that the docter was a little concerned about.he said they could just be normal breast tissue but with my history he didnt want to take any chances with me.i had a core biopsy taken of both areas and he placed a marker next to each one in case of any future surgery being needed as they were so small.i should get the results next week.is there anything these little area's could be besides cancer?and if they are cancerous,how would they remove them if they are so small?or would they just give me chemo or radio.i would be grateful for any input as my mind is going into overdrive with all the what if's.thankyou.",
