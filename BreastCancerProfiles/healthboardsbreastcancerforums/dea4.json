      "Content": "Hi, I have the same thing, pain in the upper part of the right breast, gets worse right before my cycle, but is there all the time, sometimes it hurts when I touch the area, other times its just a stabbing or tearing type of pain. I have had this for months and ask my doc about it, she felt the area and said it was fine, there is no lump or anything, but the last few days I have noticed I can feel the lymph nodes on the side under the arm, I don't feel them on the other side. I'm scared it could be breast cancer, I have another appointment with my doc on Monday. Has anyone else with this type of pain noticed the lymph nodes also? Should I be really really worried?",
