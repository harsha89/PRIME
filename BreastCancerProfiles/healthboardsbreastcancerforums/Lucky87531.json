      "Content": "I would definatly ask to have a mammogram. Even if they look at you like you are crazy and try to talk to you out of it, because you will feel so much better once you have it done. Even if it hopefully turns out to be nothing, you will still feel so much better. Male doctors dealing with femal problems tend to not be so understanding. You might have to be a little agressive with getting what you want. Dont let anyone think you are crazy either. When i was having heart problems no one listened to me because i was 18 and there was no possible way i coul dhave a heart problem, and turns out, i did have a heart condition! Good luck and let us know how it goes! Annie",
