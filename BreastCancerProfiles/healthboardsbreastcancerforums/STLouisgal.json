      "Content": "Forgot to mention - I also had an abnormal mammogram (not long after the unwarranted hysterectomy) that showed some calcification. They had me do another one several months later and it was still there. So I had to do a third one. But this time I asked if I should stop taking my calcium supplement for a period prior to the mammogram. They said \"yes\". Guess what? The calcification was gone. Here I probably could have been spared all the anxiety from each of those abnormal mammos!",

      "Content": "I totally understand your mistrust and apprehension. I was lied to about my condition and treatment options as well as risks/benefits and have been suffering the after effects ever since (unnecessary hysterectomy). Since abnormal pap smears can be caused by things other than abnormal cells, it's oftentimes recommended that the pap be repeated versus doing a biopsy. Of course, your personal history (e.g., prior abnormal paps, prior dysplasia, presence of high risk HPV type) needs to be considered when determining next steps. Also to be considered is that cervical cancer typically takes many years to develop from abnormal cells which is partly why it's so rare. When I had an abnormal pap many years ago, my gyn merely suggested repeating it in 6 months or so. I've never had another abnormal one.",
