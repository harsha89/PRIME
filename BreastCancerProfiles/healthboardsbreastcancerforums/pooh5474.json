I think I should check it out... The pimple under the armpit thing....I had one that I had to have removed, it's commonly an infected ingrown hair and the one I had grew and became painful. The surgen that did it said it's very common in women because we shave under our arms and alot of times we apply deodorant right after. As far as breast cancer history goes....nobody in my family had a history of it either then last year my mom and aunt both found lumps and both were cancerous. So, please don't not have it checked out just because there's no prior history.",

Can someone tell me about the lump? How does it feel like when you touch it and is it noticable? Oh god...I dont wanna go to the doctor to find out its my bone or something. Im 15 by the way... thanks! OK, my mom and aunt both had breast cancer. Before you panic you definitely have to consider alot of things, it could be calcium deposits, which are normal with age, it could be a cyst. You need to definitely have it checked out.....both my mom and aunt had lumpectomy's where they remove the lump and clean all the tissue around it. They are both doing wonderful. The longer you let something like that go, it could end up spilling over into the lymphnodes and then it becomes more serious. If it is hard, there is a good chance it could be a fatty deposit or calcium deposit, BUT please, don't let fear stop you from having it checked. The BEST and FIRST defense against breast cancer is EARLY detection. GOOD LUCK.",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by SapphireSky I had surgery for breast cancer in April, and radiation in May/June. I am still experiencing some swelling and pain in my breast and wondering how long this is going to last!! It is not something that is alarming, just pretty annoying at this point. I realize that my body is still recovering from the radiation. I can't sleep on my right side at all, can't wear certain bras and need to \"hang on\" when going over bumps in the car. My radiation oncologist scheduled my follow-up visit and mammogram for the first of February, and today I contacted her to try to get it delayed (still waiting for a reply). I don't think I would be able to endure it at this point. It will hopefully be done more towards the 12-month mark instead of now. Anyway, any tips on how to deal with this would really be appreciated. I know my doctor will most likely have me come in to be examined after my call to her office, so I will get info from her, too......but sometimes it is nice to know what others have done. I think the pain is mainly from the surgery...I know it takes a long time. The swelling though, I would definitely have them check it out to make sure you don't have an infection at the surgical site. Maybe try some cool compresses to help with the pain. IF it is red and hot to touch where it is swollen, definitely do not try to doctor it at home and demand they see you.",
