      "Content": "Hi, I'm 30 years old, and a few weeks ago my OBGYN thought she felt something odd in my left breast. I had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound done on Monday this week. I felt very embarrassed and self-conscious about the whole ordeal. I hated that I had to walk around and wait in a room with other lades while braless luckily the mammogram and ultrasound tech were both females and very nice. I still felt embarrassed but they were able to put me a little bit more at ease. While I was laying there getting the ultrasound done I saw a breast x-ray on the screen with a white dot in it, I knew it was mine. She concentrated her search in one area and showed me what she saw and said the Radiologist may want to take another look at it. A short while after she finished a young, handsome, man comes in and says he\u0092s the radiologist and needed to take another look. I was mortified when I saw him (because he was so cute) and wanted to cry, I felt very uncomfortable having to show my breast for another ultrasound. And if things couldn\u0092t get any worse he proceeds to touch the lump, saying oh yeah, I feel it. He shams me for not doing a self breast exam and I try to explain why I don\u0092t but he didn\u0092t seem to listen (their very \u0093lumpy\u0094 and I can\u0092t tell what\u0092s a lump and what\u0092s normal...not a very good excuse, I know..). They didn't find anything in the area my OBGYN was concerned about but they found a mass on my right breast. The radiologist called it a tumor. I wasn\u0092t surprised by this but wasn\u0092t expected to decide on the next course of action. The radiologist told me it\u0092s probably nothing and they could look at it again in 6 months, do a biopsy now or surgically remove it (but he said that would leave an ugly scar and I didn\u0092t want that). I wasn\u0092t too concerned with any of this so I opted to wait 6 months but when I got home I began to worry and worry and worry. So I called and got an appointment for a biopsy (core biopsy) that will be done next Wednesday. I keep trying to find the lump but I can\u0092t This is very frustrating and I can't seem to think about anything else. I\u0092m very nervous about the biopsy and don\u0092t do well with this sorta stuff. Ah! Thanks for letting me vent about my experience.",

      "Content": "Hi Brenda, Thanks for asking about my biopsy. It wasn't as bad as I had thought it would be. They gave me Valium to take before the biopsy to calm me down but I was so worked up that it didn't work. It only hurt when they numbed my breast. I felt a lot of pressure and heard the popping and tearing of the tissue which bothered me mentally but other than things went ok. I don't think I bruised at all either and i'm just a little sore. I was soo stressed over the biopsy and now that its over I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Hopefully I won't ever have to do this again but if I do then I won't be so scared. Now I just have to wait, and i'm worrying. He said the earliest I\u0092ll know is Monday and the latest is Wednesday. I usually look forward to the weekend but I hope this one flies by. He thought it looked benign but in the back of my mind I keep thinking what if he's wrong. I hope he's right though.",

      "Content": "They called me with the results today and its a benign fibroadenoma tumor. I'm so relieved. This was the longest weekend ever and to keep myself from going crazy I cleaned the whole time, so at least my house is cleaned from top to bottom. They said I would need to return in 6 months for another mammogram and ultrasound on that breast. I suppose to see if its grown any bigger or changed, but they said the chances are slim it will turn malignant. I'm very happy now",
