      "Content": "I'm so scared. I'm 37 and had a lump checked on ultrasound and has come up very suspicious. Had mammogram today and another ultrasound and needle biopsy. Surgeon is 90% sure it's cancer, get results as to how bad on Friday. I am not coping at all. The lump is 16mm so they say it's not big. I'm desperately hoping they can treat me and it hasn't spread. I have no history in my family and check my breasts all the time due to having cysts. I don't know how long this lump has been there, I felt it a few days ago. But not sure if it's been longer as I was pregnant but had a miscarriage 2 months ago so my breasts were swollen and sore and lumpy. I'm trying so hard to think positively but I am losing that battle.. I just want my life to go back to normal.",

The only thing that is keeping me upright is my husband (I love him so so much) and these boards where so many wonderful women are helping each other through this crap. Hugs 2u xx",
