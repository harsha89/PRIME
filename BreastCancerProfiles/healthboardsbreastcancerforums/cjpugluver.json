    "Content": "I had a benign tumor removed from my breast last week. This week, I had a cyst aspirated in the same breast at the general surgeon's office. The color was a rusty brown. He said he didn't see any blood in it and just threw it out. I'm very concerned because he didn't send it to the lab. Hmm, maybe it's nothing to worry about. I know if the color is clear, yellow, or greenish there's no sign of cancer. I know if it's bloody then there's something to be concerned about. But, what about the color of rusty brown? Does anybody know? Oh, one more thing. My mammo showed six clustered white salt spects in same breast. That's the tumor he removed. When I asked him about it, he said they were scattered. I told him my mammo and US showed clustered. And he was saying scattered. I asked him the difference. His reply, \"Oh, don't worry about that. It's the same thing.\" Hmm, well, um, maybe I'm just overly worried. Please, if you know anything about the rusty brown color, I'd love to know. Thank you in advance for any reply on this. HUGS",
