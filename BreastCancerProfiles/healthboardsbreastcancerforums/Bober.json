    "Content": "hello, i am 19 years old and i weigh about 152 and am pretty healthy. my problem is that i have large areolas and it has been this way since puberty i believe. i once asked my aunt if there was a problem with it and she said to me that it will go away when i turn 18 or 19. that was a while back and still nothing has change. i once squeezed my nipples and fluid did come out and out of both of them. when my nipples are erect it looks normal, but when they arent is the problem. i also spoke to my doctor about it once and he told me not to worry. is this normal? will it go away? and should i get it checked out again? please help!",
