      "Content": "Thanks. It turned out being only a cyst. I had two breast surgeons look at it. But I still feel uneasy. I can feel shotty lymph nodes in the same armpit and one in the other. I didn't realize I had them when the surgeon looked at me. I saw a general doctor and she said I have shotty lymph nodes all over my groin as well and ordered me an axilla ultrasound and stomach ultrasound. I couldn't get an appointment for two weeks at the diagnostic place. In the meantime, I went back and saw the surgeon and he basically blew me off saying skinny people can feel lymph nodes and didn't even feel them. I guess I'll wait until the ultrasound. I've been super scared thinking it's lymphoma. Blood work all normal. Thank you Karen. Hope you are recovered and doing well.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any information. I found a hard lump under my armpit around a month ago. I'm not sure how long it's been here. It's pretty big and in the axilla spot. It feels as if the top of it is a big hard round lump that extends to a thinner long piece on the bottom. It is unmovable and painless. I'm not sure if I have any breast lumps. I think I naturally have lumpy breasts and I guess I can feel tiny little knots. My doctor ordered an ultrasound for my underarm lump and the place was booked for 15 days so I had the ER look at it instead last night. They ordered the ultrasound and as the x ray tech was doing it she was saying she could see other baby lumps around the area?? When the radiologist walked in, he looked puzzled by my results. His exact words \"I want to say this is fluid but i don't think so, umm, umm, i don't know what this is.\" He said he was going to talk it over with the ER doctor and when the ER doctor came back he said it's definitely not an abscess (infection of any kind) and he doesn't know what it is. I need an immediate biopsy and referred me to a breast oncologist. I'm very worried. I'm 28 and have no other than I have been very fatigued since my early twenties. No visible symptoms in my breasts. There isn't a history of breast cancer in my family except for my aunt who got it around my age and died 5 years later. She was one out of 4 sisters though and every other female lived until old age. Also all of my female cousins are fine and they are a few years older than I am. If anyone could provide any information, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much.",
