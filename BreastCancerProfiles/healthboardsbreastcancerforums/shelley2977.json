      "Content": "LADIES, I HAVE JUST READ ALL OF YOUR POSTS AND WANT YOU BOTH TO KNOW I HAVE YOU IN MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER JULY 2003 . PLEASE MAKE SURE TO GET ULTRA SOUND OR MRI . EVEN AFTER BOTH OF THESE TESTS THEY STILL DID NOT SEE MY TUMOR. YOU MUST BE PRO ACTIVE AND REALIZE THAT YOU ARE JUST A NUMBER WITH DOCTORS. I AM SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT I AND MY FRIENDS HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED THIS. JUST KNOW THAT NOW A DAYS THE CURE RATE IS SO VERY HIGH (NOT THAT I HOPE EITHER ONE OF YOU HAVE CANCER).WAITING FOR RESULTS SUCK AND YOU MUST BE PUSHY BUT NICE. PEOPLE JUST DON'T GET HOW SCARED YOU ARE WHILE WAITING. I WISH YOU BOTH ALL THE BEST, AND MY HOPE IS THAT YOU BOTH HAVE A BENIGN GROWTHS. REGARDS, SHELLEY",

      "Content": "Hi Bonnie, I have been on Arimidex since July 2004. I had my ovaries removed 2005. All of my friends on arimidex have severe joint pain and walk like 95 year old ladies. I was on Norco for the pain for the last 2 years. This is a narcotic and i felt i was addicted so i finally got off 2 weeks ago and all the pain is back in my whole body. I had still had some pain while on the norco so my oncoligist had me go off arimidex for 6 weeks to see if my pain would get any better but it did not. My one friend has decided to go off arimidex and take tamoxifen and she feels much better. I'm stage 3 and i feel that i need to take the best anti-cancer drug out there. of course tamoxifen has been around for 20 years and is very successful but i feel arimidex (and it could all be in my head) has better statistic rates. i have tried taking mobic,ultracet,ibuprofen,glucosamine. i am very worried about daily living with all this pain. it is really effecting my attitude and zest for life. i am afraid that after the 5 years on arimidex who knows what permanant damage it may have done. i am going to talk to my oncoligist about tamoxifen, i know the percentages for blood clots, uterine cancer are very low. I am sorry i have no answers,it seems like lots of us survivors are in the same boat with the pain. i am still searching for answers. I will keep you posted. Regards, shelley",

      "Content": "HI BONNIE, HEY WHY DID YOU NOT HAVE CHEMO? WHAT IS ZOLADEX? IT MUST BE A FORM OF CHEMO SINCE MOST ALL STAGE 2 PEOPLE GET CHEMO THESE DAYS. I HAD MY OVARIES REMOVED BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN I STARTED GETTING PERIODS BACK AFTER CHEMO AND IF YOU HAVE PERIOD ARIMIDEX IS GOOD FOR NOTHING. SO AT 48 I HAD THEM REMOVED. THE NORCO WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN TORTUE AND I AM ACTUALLY GETTING LOTS OF HELP FROM THESE BOARDS ON ADDICTION. FOR YOUR DOCTOR TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO PAIN WITH ARIMIDEX IS CRAZY. EVERY RESEARCH INFORMATION STATES THE 1ST MAIN SIDE EFFECT IS JOINT PAIN. MY GOAL IS TO GET OFF NARCOTIC AND GO TO PAIN MANAGEMENT DOCTOR AND SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE TO HELP ME. YES, AFTER 5 YEARS WILL WE BE CRIPPLED DUE TO THE ARIMIDEX? THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION THAT NO ONE CAN ANSWER. I AM ALL OVER WITH MY RESPONSES TO YOU SORRY! YOU ARE RIGHT, AFTER 6 WEEKS OFF OF ARIMIDEX MY PAIN DID NOT GET ANY BETTER WHICH MIGHT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PAIN IS FROM THE AGRESSIVE TYPE OF CHEMO DRUGS THEY USED ON ME. I HAD TAXOL AND TAXOTERE ALONG CYTOXAN AND ADRIMYIACYM (BAD SPELLING) . IT IS SO WEIRD THAT YOU MENTION THE NAILS. MY WERE CHIPPING AND BREAKING AND SOMEONE MENTIONED THAT HAD TO DO WITH YOUR LIVER. WHO KNOWS. OH MY GOD, I AM SO SELF OBSESSED, I'VE GONE ON FOREVER. STAY IN TOUCH AND BE WELL. SHELLEY",
