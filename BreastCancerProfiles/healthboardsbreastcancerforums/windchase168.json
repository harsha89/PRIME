      "Content": "Thank you for your reply csoar2004. I went to see another general doctor this morning. But basically what he said is similar to the first doctor. Both of them said the lump is too small (about 5mm) to be concerned about. He also refused to send me to do a ultrasound or mammogram. Just like the first doctor, he told me to wait for another month to monitor the lump. What should I do now?",

      "Content": "Well, I know it's odd for a male to come here to ask a question. But I really need some advice. I am a 40 years old male. About two months ago, I felt my left nipple has continous needle type of pain for two days. I didn't really pay attention to it at that time. Then after the pain has receded, somehow I found that there is a lump under the areola later (It might have been there before the pain though). From what I can feel, the lump is painless. It is hard with very smooth surface. It adheres to the nipple at one end and extends almost to the edge of the areola at the other end. I went to see my doctor today. To say the very least, both me and the doctor were kind of embarrassed when he had to feel the lump because of the location of it. At first he said he could not feel the lump. After I tried a few times to pinpoint exactly where it is for him, he said he found it. Then he said it's nothing to worry about. He said the lump is not hard but I am sure it's a hard lump. He just told me to go back to let him check it out again after 1 month. I asked him whether he thinks it's a good idea to have an ultrasound done on it. He said an ultrasound cannot tell anything. I have a few questions. (1) Would you follow the instruction of the doctor to wait another month before doing anything? (2) Is it really true that an ultrasound can't tell anything? (3) I heard if a male has breast cancer, it would be at the location where my lump is. What might it be if the lump is benign? Thank you.",
