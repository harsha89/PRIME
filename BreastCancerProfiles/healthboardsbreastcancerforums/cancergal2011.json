      "Content": "I wanted to post a little hope for those out there fighting this battle. I was diagnosed with TNBC in July 2011 and completed all treatment in April 2012. I went through chemo, a lumpectomy and radiation. I remember getting on this board and reading so many negative things about TNBC and told myself that once I knew I had completely beat it, I was going to post something positive. Yes, it is hard, but yes you can beat this cancer. I am happy to report that I am living a normal life. It is so important to remember that \"you CAN beat it\" and don't ever give up. You got this!!!!",
