I'm going to try and stay busy with the granddaughters this weekend to keep my mind off of it. I'll watch for your post to see what your results were. fingers crossed for you.....lala",

It seems like if anything happens, it happens to me. So I am hoping for the best but trying to be prepared for the worse. I can't help but be scared, cancer is such a scary word.",

He has been cancer free for four years now, I think he said he has one more year of the medicine to take. good luck.",

      "Content": "I had that and had my biopsy today. They wanted me in right away for the biopsy. I'd ask the doctor why should you wait for so long? What makes your different than mine. The doc that did the biopsy says that 20% is cancer. I wouldn't want to take that chance. Having said that It is only right that I had there are two types of calcification, macro and micro. Macro is less chance of being cancer by a long ways, micro is 20% chance if it is a small area and not just dotted here and there in the breast. talk to your doctor.",
