    "Content": "Hi all - new here & just have a question that I hope someone can answer for me. I'm having an ultrasound-guided core needle breast biopsy next week. I have non-refundable reservations to go horseback riding 48 hours after the procedure. Do you think I will be feeling well enough to handle to such impact to my breast after only 48 hrs? To complicate matters, I can't wear a jog-bra bc I have a chronic pain/paralysis problem with my arm (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) that makes putting a jog-bra on nearly impossible for me. Not really nervous about the procedure itself, just a bit worried about the results bc my mother died of breast cancer. Thank u so much for input!",
