      "Content": "I have has a sore/burning sensation on and off for almost 3 months now in my left breast. I think it might be a little larger than before but my husband says no he sees no changes. I waited through a couple months cycles to see if it was hormonal. I went for my yearly exam earlier this month and she did the breast exam but felt nothing. I am going on Monday for a ultrasound and mamogram. I am not to stressed over it more curious than anything. I was telling a friend of mine about it and she immediately thought cancer. I said cancer is not painful. Any thoughts?",
