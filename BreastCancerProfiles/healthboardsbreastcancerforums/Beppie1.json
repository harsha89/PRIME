      "Content": "I too have just been scheduled for an ultra sound after they found a 1 cm lump with spiculated margins. They are calling this \"suspicious\", although my doctor said it is nothing about 85% of the time. The \"spiculated margins\" thing has me worried a little. Has anyone had experience with finding a lump with edges that wasn't cancerous? I am not totally freaked, but a little surprised. Have had a ton of tests lately and all were great, except the mammogram, which I didnt even give a second thought.",

Dont know if that includes the tendril like things I saw on the original mammobgram Naturally I am totallly freaking. They couldnt really answer any of my questions at the hospital. Questions like: -Since it is so small can I assume it is early stages and easily treatable. -Does this mean possibly I have cancer in other areas of my body. -Does this explain my tiredness over the last couple of years. -Should I tell my aging parents? (I did talk to the gyno while I was writing this) He said it would be very unusual to have it metastisize from other parts of my body or to other parts from the breast. He was very upbeat about options and treatment He said it wouldnt explain the fatigue and lack of stamina I originally started all the testing for. DRAT!!!! Are there any other good educational sites on breast cancer besides this one? Has anyone had a similar experience and can offer that?",

I was supposed to wait until next week also, but muscled my way into the ultrasound tomorrow. It is somewhat ironic that I was so faithful in my mammograms until about two years ago and now they find something. I had been under going a lot of other testing and the mammagram was just an aside we threw in there. Hopefully if it is cancerous, it is early enough to do something about it. May explain why I have been so tired for a couple of years. That was the original symptom we were trying to solve. I am a little freaked, but mostly irritated at myself, for not keeping up the yearly mammograms. I also have dense breasts so it is possible they did not see this until now. Keep a positive thought for me.",

Maybe only 10-15 % are malignant. At least we may have caught it early. I do not know if they will order a biopsy or not. Today is the mammogram ultrasound and I guess they will decide from there. I have already made up my mind it is probably something, which isnt my usual attitude. Just so ironic I would slack on the mammograms that I used to be so faithful about. I know, beating myself up doesnt help. Looks like great support here and I really appreciate it. Your news sounds pretty positive, since it doesnt seem to be acting malignant. I can not feel mine. It is near the nipple area. Hope to know more later.",

If he is talking about spiculated margins..the legs or thread parts, I know they like to biopsy these because cancerous lesions often do have those type of characteristics, but not always. The fact that you have had it for awhile could be good news. Often non cancerous lesions will react to hormones. Therefore if you were having more normal periods again, it could cause the old lump to grow. Still I wouldnt get too worked up until you have the biopsy. Often these things are nothing.",

How long are you out of commission from a lumpectormy or masectomy. Then it is my pride and how I dont want people to know.

I am still on a steep learning curve. It seems so weird to me that they wont tell you about the lymph nodes until after the initial surgery.

I feel a little quilty that I have been very lucky so far. Nothing in the lymph nodes and clean margin. Stage1/Grade1. The only reason I am so lucky is because my gyno threw in a mammogram with a bunch of other tests we were doing to see if HRT would help some of my menopausal symptoms. That's out forever now!! I have had mammograms religiously since I was 37. I had two aunts and a great aunt die of breast cancer in their 50's or 60's. But I was a little overdo on the mammo in the last two years. They tell me it probably wouldnt have mattered, because it may not have been visible. My surgeon is talking about a clinical trial for women in the mid range oncotype scores. I do not know what my oncotype score is yet. The tissue sample was just sent out. Truthfully I hope it will be in the low numbers because then I will only have to do radiation and endocrine therapy. I was her2 postive. So I am over the intial shock and starting to feel like myself again. At least for now, before the next phase...the radiation.",

I figured those days were gone and these were women doctors and nurses. I am sure it is difficult on their end too. I looked up mammosite. It is a portal of radiation they place in side the area for a week. I would love to do that instead of the 6 weeks but there may be a problem with how close to the skin my tumor is. Apparently it is hard on the skin. So off to the counselor this morning. I will be prepared with the tissues. IT is difficult to see and say the word cancer. I still am in shock that I even have it since I always took good care of myself. I know that doesnt matter. I picked up my mammogram films to take to the second opinion person. I had forgotten how many mammograms I have had. Started in 1989 when I was 37 and had them at least every other year since. Me being me, I might actually look at those films myself. Would love to see if I can detect any difference. I slacked on my mammograms after late 2004, so that is a lesson to many hopefully, although they are still saying it may not have even been visible until recently. Have a good day, CJ.

It usually takes about half the dose of medicine to work with me. Maybe I can talk them into that. Yeah, right? The counselor appointment went well. She was very focused on what my goals would be while in cancer counseling. I said to deal with my emotions and keep living my life to the fullest.

Various entities were talking to me before i finally saw the surgeon. While they were all good, I thought, on the whole, the practitioners and the surgeon talk too much and dont listen much. Has anyone else had that impression? Just me being stubborn, maybe. I had done a lot of research and felt for awhile they were talking down to me and explaining things I already knew, while I had other questions. Me, being me, I just interrupted eventually. Barring any other negative test results, they seemed pretty positive. They think it is Grade1/Stage1. Of course I will not know fully until lymph node testing. They want an MRI too, first. Apparently radiation is a given, but a slim possibility I could use something called a mammosite, sp?), that would be for less time but more intense. Has anyone had experience with that? They talked about tamoxifen or something like that maybe later. That final piece seems a little like overkill, but maybe I am missing something. So now waiting, waiting, waiting, as usual. That is the hardest part. That and trying to continue to live life fully in the meantime. In that vein I am gong to a cancer care counselor tomorrow.

But they wanted to schedule an MRI and the lupectomy to get any other cancerous areas around the original tumor and to get what they call \"clear margins\". That is why I am surprised they went right to the sentinel node testing. Usually this is done during the lupectomy. An Mri can detect very small possible cancers. It turned out I had a little activity in front of and behind the orignal tumor. So they took out a rectangular section and checked for clear margins. They did the snb while I was out for the lupect. and got the results immediatley. No node involvement. Now I am waiting to hear what is the next step. Usually radiation first and then one or both of the following; chemo/hormone therapy. Yes the tumor was cancer, but well differianted and Stage 1. Hope that helps. You might ask your doctor about an MRI and other diagnostic tools and whether he plans to do a lupectomy. Ask him about the clear margins.",

      "Content": "Sounds somewhat similarc to my situation. I did not find the lump or did anyone else. It came up on routine mammogram. I am surprised that they want to do the sentinel node biopsy without first an MRI and possible lupectomy. Did I miss something here? Still it all sounds very positive, although it will be scary for you, while you wait for all the tests and results. Hope you can take some comfort in the fact they got it early. I was sure my nodes would be positive because I have felt so bad for a couple of years. But they were not. Someimtes we expect the worst. Have they talked to you about other treatment options like radiation, chemo, hormone therapy? All scary thoughts. Give yourself time to digest it all. You are just starting on the journey, but there will be people to help you along.",
