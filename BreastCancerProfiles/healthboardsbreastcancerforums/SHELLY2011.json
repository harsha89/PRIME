    "Content": "If someone had a little bit of blood coming from one nipple, but it wasn't persistant, and then a black scab formed in that spot and is still there; what does that mean? This person is a member of my family, where there is no history of breast cancer. A few months ago this person (71 years old) noticed a clear discharge coming from one nipple after checking herself and squeezing the nipple. She went for a mammogram and had an ultrasound, and what these reports showed was that she had dilated ducts. But she needs to go back in a few months for another mammogram. But in the meantime, she noticed a little bit of blood coming from that nipple on its own, but then it would clear up. And most recently, after just a little bit of blood came out on its own, a black scab formed and is still there. Has anyone experienced this before, or have any idea as to what this could mean? I know from doing some research that even bloody discharge can mean an injury, or a benign condition; but I have never heard or read anything about a scab forming in the spot that discharge would come through. Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you with any opinions/advice/insight you may have. KellyAnn",
