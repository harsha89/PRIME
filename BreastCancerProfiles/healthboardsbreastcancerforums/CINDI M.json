    "Content": "I have been getting mammograms for the past 8 years because of calcifications and cysts. In 2003 there were changes in my mammo so they had me get an untrasound too. I was sent to a surgeon who said that the cysts looked fluid filled so he declined to do a biopsy/aspiration at that time but wanted me to get a mammo & an ultrasound yearly instead of just the mammo. I just went a couple of days ago for my annual and the diagnostic center wants me to come back in 2 months to look at a cyst that developed in my left breast that seems to look blood filled. My left breast has lots of cysts the largest at 3 cm. My right breast has cysts but not as many. The blood filled cyst is under 1 cm. My doctor is sending me to a surgeon to let him review my reports and mammo/ultrasound and examine me. I am worried because I read the booklet in the diagnostic center and it stated that if the cyst has blood or other matter in it, it needs to be sent to the lab to check for cancer. I am 47 years old pre-mense, the only breast cancer in my family that know about is my 1st cousin on my mom's side. She is 48 and was diagnosed in her late 30's. Should I see the surgeon or should I just wait 2 months and go back for the 2nd ultrasound? Should I worry? my Dr's office seemed to leave it up to me if I want to go to the surgeon or wait for the ultrasound.",
