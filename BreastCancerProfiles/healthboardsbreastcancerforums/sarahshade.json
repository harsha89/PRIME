      "Content": "This time last year I was diagnosed with breast cancer - a mucinous carcinoma. It was removed along with some lymph nodes and I had a course of radiotherapy. I developed a rash which has not responded to treatment and yesterday my doctor told me that he is worried it could be carcinoma erysipeloides which is also called inflammatory carcinoma. From the internet I have found that this condition is very rare and is always secondary to another cancer most commonly to breast cancer. What I couldn't find out and want to know is, whether it is secondary to mucinous carcinoma. I have an appointment with the oncologist for next Monday but that seems a long way off with this hanging over me. I would be very grateful for any info on this subject.",

      "Content": "Thank you Newfie11, Your post was more comfort than you realize. When I read about the rock hard breast I remembered seeing that symptom mentioned in the abstract I read yesterday of a research paper. Because of my state of mind at the time it didn't register. Reading your post and remembering, I realized I don't have that symptom and that gave me a lift. I felt quite a lot better after that. You may be right, it could be from the radiotherapy. Also thank you for your good wishes. sarahshade",
