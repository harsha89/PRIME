      "Content": "hi, I found a lump in my right breast... But it's kind of long... And more of a flat lump... It's not painful, and it is hard and does not move around, but it's fairly noticeable and big (as in it goes across most of my breast). I went to the dr and she told me it doesn't feel like it's in my breast tissue but that it's more on my chest wall and she thinks my rib may have just disloged and that's what I'm feeling and to come back if it gets bigger and they'll send me for imaging tests. But it's already fairly big, I'm worried if it gets bigger and if it's anything, it would be already an advanced stage? I'm just wondering if should get a second opinion? Or has anyone else experienced the same type of thing? The lump isn't what I hear most breast cancer lumps described as so I have no idea if I'm just over stressing about nothing. And I'm only 24 so the chances of it being anything would probably be very low?",
