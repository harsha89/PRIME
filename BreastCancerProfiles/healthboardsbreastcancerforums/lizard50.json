Everything you ever want to know about every type of breast cancer is in this book. Get educated. Take charge on how you want treatment. It gave me a great sense of power when I felt powerless. I just had 1/2 of my colon removed and I am doing well. Remember there are a lot of gifts to be found when we have to walk through fear. You are not alone. Good luck, lizard50",

I have had friends who have had a really bad time with it, this is not in your head. I have to tell you that with a area of cancer that big I would try to find something. There is a new drug out there that I read about and I am sorry that I can not remember the name of it. It is suppose to have much less side effects. My feeling is that if the quality of your life is messed-up you need to try something eles. If your doctor says that it is in your head, ask him to try it for awhile. Also pick up the great book \" the breast book\" by Susan Love. it is great and easy to read and you will get so much great inforrmation. Lizard50",
