      "Content": "I'm 30 years old and about 4 weeks ago I found a lump in my breast. It doesn't feel like I expected one to feel. It feels long and thin like a string bean all along the bottom of my breast. Anyway, yesterday I had a mammogram and ultrasound. I wasn't real worried about anything until the technician doing the ultrasound told me that the radiologist would read the films right away that morning and then send a report to my dr by afternoon. She said, \"She will have the results for you by the end of the week and we'll go from there.\" The \"we'll go from there\" part freaked me out because that implies that something else will need to be done. How in the world do I wait patiently until tomorrow (my dr is closed today)!!",

      "Content": "Thanks for your concern! After getting the run around from my dr and crying on the phone with the breast imaging place, I found out everything is normal. My dr's out until Tues and they wanted me to wait until then. I threw a fit and said there was no way I could wait until then and then I started crying. I didn't mean to get upset, but I couldn't help it. I'll still follow up with my dr because if everything came back normal, then what is this thing in my breast? Once again, thank you for your thoughts and prayers",
