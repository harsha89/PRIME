    "Content": "Like Hitchy, my cancerous lump did not hurt, it just felt like a golf ball. My daughter suffers from painful lumps and the doctors have always found them to be cysts, etc. Once she was even emitting some \"green\" fluid, which greatly concerned us, but my breast specialist/surgeon (and she is awesome) assured us that as wierd as that may seem, it's \"normal.\" There may be many reasons for painful lumps. But remember we are all different. I understand your concern, but try to relax until your doctor tells you what is really is and what needs to be done. Meanwhile, think about things you enjoy....go out and have a fun weekend! (I say that because there is NOTHING you can do about it until Monday anyway, and focusing on the pain will just make it more intense.) God Bless!",
