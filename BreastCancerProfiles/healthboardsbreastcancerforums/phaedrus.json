      "Content": "Hi Supermom. I was diagnosed with a fibroadenoma about 4 years ago. I found a lump that wasn't painful at all at the time. I had an ultrasound done and was referred to an oncologist. The physical exam and ultrasound were used in the diagnosis of a probable fibroadenoma. The ultrasound cannot give conclusive diagnosis alone. Only a proper biopsy wil do that. The oncologist said that in her very experienced opinion that this was for sure a fibroadenoma. She was prepared to biopsy it but was nervous to do so because the lump was located directly over a rib, and this would make the procedure more invasive than necessary as in order to make sure the lump was completely removed (which is harder to detect when bone is in the way apparently), they would have to remove more tissue than normal. From the info that i read, it is standard procedure to remove a certain amount of outlying tissue anyway when biopsies are taken. I can't afford to lose anymore tissue than necessary, if you know what i mean (lucky if i can get into an A without padding, thanks to two wonderful children- lol). So I opted not to do it. Now that I have had other issues with other body parts, I have become more and more aware that anything can happen with the body. What I can tell you is this, fibroadenomas are not cancerous, as you say. And most doctors do not link tham with cancer, though there is a section of the medical profession that believes they can rarely become cancerous later. I would go ahead with the biopsy, just so you can know if there is anything else there. A fibroadenoma is a tissue mass...a tumour. It is not a cyst (also not usually linked with cancer, though it can be in rare cases, as one poor lady on this health board found out recently). Cysts are fluid filled. Something else that is reassuring is that typically, pain is a good sign. Only late stage cancers usually have pain as a symptom, as well as a whole host of other symptoms that would be hard to miss. My fibroadenoma has changed position and size, tenderness and even doubled depending on menstrual cycle, stress, immune system dive...you name it. You need to keep an eye on this and anything else, skin colour and texture changes, nipple discharge (noting colour), and any lumps that are not movable. Good luck and keep us posted with your results and how the biopsy went. I am thinking of going back and asking them to go ahead and biopsying it now anyway....",

It also takes a level of determination to get on a message board to get the info you need, so you obviously have what it takes you get your life back on track. I was wondering if there is a breast cancer support group in your area. Maybe other women have had exactly the problems you are facing now, and can help you. Whatever the case, please keep checking in with us. If you are the only person here post-mastectomy, you may be able to help others with this kind of surgery looming. And we are here if you need to vent. Good luck with your recovery and finding what you need....",

I know its early days to be trying to feel optimistic, but please please don't give up. My moms friend a few years back (about 8, I think), had advanced breast cancer. I guess it was probably stage 3. Far enough along for them to throw the book at her in terms of treatments. It wasn't a picnic, but she got through it. She has been in remission ever since. She looks as good as she did before the treatment, back to work, resumed normal activities. I know this isn't always the case, but it can be. please please keep posting and let us go through this with you both. And has your doctor recommended a support group for you both to attend? You can get all sorts of real-life info at these groups, and someone who really knows what you are going through (I wish I could be a more substantial shoulder to cry on... but I will absolutely pray for you). God bless",

      "Content": "Hi Z, Vent away, my dear. I can only imagine how much everything is sucking for you right now. I totally agree about the lack of education thing. Just like anything else in our screwed up society, everything is determined by its ranking on the fashionable scale. Cancer isn't a fashionable disease anymore so it lost its prioritzation to other diseases. Just like crises that you see in the news, one day its devastating, the next it's no longer The Topic, so we hear no more about it. And we as women (particularly those of us who have had kids, or started off with perculiar health issues) just resign ourselves to odd aches, discomforts and other symptoms because it seems as though we have to fight our own health from day 1. If we were given the right info on early detection, these situations wouldn't happen the way they do. Most of us know about the self-breast checks, but nothing else to look for like nipple discharge/colouration, or even something as simple as don't assume that if you are not in pain, then you don't have cancer. All we know is to look for a lump that hurts, and by then it can often be too damn late. I consider myself pretty well read on medical issues but i had no idea how little I knew about symptoms and early detection till my pap was detected as being bad. Can I ask you what symptoms you had that prompted you to see a dr.? I have been experiencing some nasty breast pain and changeable lumps (now you feel 'em, now you don't), which weren't palpable at my ultrasound a week or two ago, but now are very uncomfortable. I thought maybe it was linked to my other areas downstairs giving me trouble. Please keep me updated as you find out what is going on, and what treatment you are likely to have, and please vent as much as you would like.",

      "Content": "I had a breast lump investigated a while back and was told exactly what you know. On an ultrasound (didn't have a mammogram), a cyst by definition is fluid filled therefore comes up as a dark area. A mass of tissue (whether benign as mine was, or malignant) appears as a condensed white area. Even though mine was tissue, I was told by the oncologist that fibroadenomas are not connected to cancerous cell growth, and it is almost certain that mine will not become cancerous even though it was tissue. Anyway, let us know what your surgeon says when you talk to him/her. And there's a good chance your hubby was as worried about it as you were, so may have heard his worst fears as opposed to the actual words said... (hug him lots, sounds like you both had a good scare)",

Heating up the tumour makes it more vulnerable to low intensity chemo and radiation therapies. It had a 40% cure rate of advanced-terminal patients. It is particularly used for breast cancer patients. No hoax...discovery channel special two weeks back. Both patients (stage 3 - I think) had their tumours significantly reduce in size within a 3 - 6 month period. And almost no side effects from treatment.

      "Content": "Hi there. Well, I for one believe you have some reason to doubt her story, but this doesn't mean that she is not sick, but it could be something else (I will go into that later). Mainly because as I understand it, her parents would have to legally consent to any treatment she undergoes, as she is under the age of 18. Even if the age of consent in medical treatment is 16, she still falls below. I also doubt tremendously that she could have chemo and maintain daily routines. If you look under the general board for cancer, you can read some stories about people who have had chemo. It has many side effects, the main one being nausea and vomitting, unless she is also on anti nausea meds. However, in the late stages of cancer, the tumour would likely hurt, and may have many other symptoms, including skin texture and colour change, nipple discharge and a visible mass. My grandmother died of breast cancer, and my mother cared for her at our home till she passed. She was bedridden for the last few months, and was clearly wasting away. This is not something that is easily hidden, though it is true that there are often few visible side effects till the last part. Here is what I suggest: Show an interest in her illness. Find out what stage she is (and it is so much more complicated than 1, 2, 3 or 4) and what her tumour is called, and what type of cell growth there is, which drug she is on. Here is some language you can use: Names of Tumours Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS) Lobular Carcinoma in situ (LCIS) Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) Types of Cell Growth: Solid Cribiform Papillary Comedo Chemo Drugs: Cyclophosphamide Epirubicin 5-Fluorouracil or 5 FU Methotrexate Mitomycin Mitozantrone (mitoxantrone) Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) A cancer patient knows their condition, especially if they are dealing with it without parental supervision. This way, you can look up side effects like hairloss when she tells you which drug it is. This is a guess, but I also do not see how a breast tumour can press on your heart. There is a whole rib cage between the breast and the heart. If this is bogus, this may be a cry for help...maybe she feels that she doesn't get enough attention at home (how often do her parents leave like this?). Is there anything else going on in her life that would leave her needing to know people care about her? Is annorexia a possiblity. A story like chemo treatments would cover weight loss, hairloss, altered periods, fatigue, an overall lack of wellness. Annorexia isn't just about eating, it is about deception and feeling empowered. I had a friend who became alcoholic as a result of annorexia (she needed alcohol for regular energy boosts and carried a bottle of vodka around with her at school, so her friends wouldn't notice any difference in her energy levels). Lastly, there is a condition called Munchausen's syndrome. This is a mental illnes. The patient compulsively creates illnesses for themselves in order to get attention over and over again. They are often very well read on medical issues, and sometimes aspire to be a medical professional. They are in and out of hospitals and medical facilities with various illnesses regularly. Very often, they will go to the extreme of harming themselves physically (like injecting toxic substances) in order to make themselves ill and require treatment. I do think this is unlikely, but clearly, if this is untrue, your friend has a problem that needs figuring out. I think it may be a very good idea to contact her parents, or at least tell yours. You are a good friend to care so much. Good luck, I hope your friend is not suffering from this terrible disease. Let us know what you find out...",

      "Content": "Hey twiggy, rooting for ya. I had one 3 years ago. Scared the crap outa me. Turned out to be a fibroadenoma. Basically a benign tumour. The ultrasound was uncomfortable as they really pressed hard. But it wasn't the worst thing in the world. And I was so relieved to be getting the tests done finally, I didn't care if it hurt. I had to wait a few more days for the results, but was able to talk the ultrasound technician into giving me some info. Though she only scared me. As it wasn't a cyst, she couldn't confirm what it was. It's best to wait the few days to get a definate diagnosis, and I found it easier to wait for the test results than for the exam, because at least there was a sense that someone now had it in hand, and was on top of it, what ever it was. Fibroadenomas are common and harmless, and have not been found to develop into cancer at later stage (that's what I was told by the oncologist). They never even removed it, or biopsied it, though I do get ultrasounds regularly to monitor it. Keep up on breast checks, of both breasts. And remember, the process has begun, you've seen the doctor, the ball is rolling so it will all work out fine I am sure. If you hadn't seen anyone yet, then I would worry. Good luck, let us know the results. God bless.",
