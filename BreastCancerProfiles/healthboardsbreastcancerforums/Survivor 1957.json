      "Content": "hi, I am not sure what to tell you but that I just had one. I had my yearly mamogram on tuesday at 11 am and the screan showed a 6 cm mass in my breast. The dr did not wait and did the core needle biopsy right there in the breast diognostic center. I had no time to be scared or time to process the subject. I will get my results Thursday afternoon. I am scared, confused and feeling very alone right now. The procedure is not painfull, they numb the area first and then stick the needle in and you hear a loud click and they remove the needle. I will tell you your breast may be sore for a few days. just follow the dr's directions and you should be fine. Good luck and keep positive thoughts. k",

      "Content": "i am so sorry your in such pain, i know the fear, the burning, the numbness, and i only had 4 nodes taken 11 days ago.... A friend of mine is a massage therapist and has worked on many women with breast cancer. maybe some mild massauge would help your back and arm...Why dont the doctors tell us about the pain and burning, Is it that they hope we dont have any or is it they dont want us to be scared? All I do know is that I am the type person that wants to know what is happening to my body and what to look out for, i would not of known the ups and downs of all of this if it was not for this board and the nation cancer society hot line. good luck to us all, i am so glad we have each other for information sharing k",

      "Content": "Hi, I am so glad you are recovering so well, I had the same thing and I am still having pain under my arm and the swelling has not gone down. The Dr drained some of the blood out last Monday and if it does not go down on its own they will drain it again. i have not go back to work yet and it has been 3 1/2 weeks. the Dr kept me out till the 14th. I bruised quite a lot and when I take a deep breath it hurts. The Dr states it is because of how deep they had to cut. I start chemmo on the 12th and that was a disappointment. Then it is 31 treatments of radiation. k",
