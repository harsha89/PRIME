    "Content": "Hi Sl I haven't had the needle localization done, but I have had several biopsies done. My girlfriend had the needle one done. They take a Mammogram, and thread in a thin wire, secure it, and then it's off to surgery. I have had 2 breast biopsies, and a lymph node removed from my armpit. I was awake for the lymph node, and one biopsy. I know that it can be scary, but try not to worry too much. I know that's easy for me to say, because it's you going through it. But really try not to worry. My last biopsy, I had the Dr. laughing so hard, that he had to stop several times. Hang in there!!!!! Sid",
