    "Content": "Hi there, I have breast cancer myself and am able to give some information. Firstly I would like to say that although statistically it is unlikely that a 15 year old would have breast cancer, it is definitely possible. Now to your questions/points raised: *When she was diagnosed, she didn\u0092t have her parents with her, and didn\u0092t want to even tell them about it. She also requested that her friends didn\u0092t talk about or even mention her cancer. Cancer is a frightening disease to have, many people that have it don't want to talk about it, that is quite natural. *Her parents are leaving her to go to out of town for a week, and want her to find somewhere else to stay, out of the comfort of her own home. I am not sure that this is really a relevant point. *Her oral chemotherapy pills resemble perfectly to Vitamin E pills. She keeps them in a small tin (not the bottle), and freely handles them. Chemotherapy pills should of course not be handled freely, but would a 15 year old girl know that? I have to say that I was not told that my oral chemo tabs should not be handled by any medical staff. *After breaking the news to her friends. She waited almost one month to start chemotherapy treatments. Sometimes chempotherapy treatements are timed in line with the menstrual cylce. *Because she is so young, I feel doctors would be more inclined to operate. It is not always possible to operate, sometimes the tumour is in an awkward position, or sometimes they try to shrink the tumour with chemotherapy before attempting to operate. *The day after her first chemo treatment, she looked not only healthy and strong, but had loads of energy and told everyone she felt great. That is quite possible, we all react differently to chemotherapy, some people react extremely badly while it can be much easier on others. *Before receiving her first chemo treatment, she discussed how scared she was, which is understandable, however, she was seriously considering not going through with it because some of her closest friends were going to be out of town and unable to be there for her. Her next treatment is scheduled for when again her friends will be out of town. Her medical team may have advised her on the importance of the timing of the treatment. It is not really possible to work around a social schedule. *Because her mom was going to be out of town, she had first planned on driving herself (yes, illegally) to and from chemo. Silly girl! *She still works many hours every weekend in her very physically demanding job. Many people are able hold down full time jobs throughout chemotherapy treatments. *She recently started going to a tanning bed, which I think only adds to the stress of cancer. It is advisable to avoid sunlight during chemotherapy treatments and many people cover up completely, it would be irresponsible to use a tanning bed during chemo. *She has claimed that her type of chemotherapy will NOT result in hair loss, it would only leave a rash hidden on her breasts. Not all chemotherapy treatments do result in hair loss, I didn't lose mine, although it did thin a lot. I have never heard of chemotherapy leaving a rash on the breasts, this sounds unlikely as it is a systemic treatment (meaning that it treats the whole body) so if it were liable to cause a rash, it would not likely be confined to any one particular area. *She says that her cancer hurts, but according to other people\u0092s knowledge of breast cancer, her tumor shouldn\u0092t hurt. Breast cancer can and in many cases does hurt, sometimes aches and stabbing pains can be felt. *She has told everyone that because her tumor is pressing against her heart, she only has a little over a year life expectancy. Wouldn\u0092t doctors want to operate immediately to remove the tumor? It may not be possible to operate, in fact in a situation such as that it probably wouldn't be operable. I would greatly appreciate any advice or comments about what I have observed in the last few months. I hate having a sense of doubt in my mind. Please tell me if the above is all normal, or do I need to take more direct measures on clearing it all up. I am unable to say if your friend has cancer or otherwise but I hope that I have been able to clear up some points raised/misconceptions for you.",
