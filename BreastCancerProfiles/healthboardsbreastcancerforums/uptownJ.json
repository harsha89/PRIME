If they only knew how much anxiety this lack of communication gives their patients. I could go on but leave it as you have to be your own best advocate when it comes to your medical care. OK so the words and findings that earned you furter testing is \"new nodule\" and \"irregular asymmetries\". The rest of the words are just refurring to the location the \"the thing.\" Sometimes calcifications will earn you an extra trip but now in your case. The rest of the report sounds very reassuring. Since your breast tissue is \"moderately dense\" it makes getting a clear mammogram a bit more difficult. You will have your ultrasound and they will tell you if what they see warrants a biopsy. Even if they do..... do not lose-your-breakfast, as they want to make sure about what \"the thing\" is. I am at an age where (old-as-dirt) where my pals have \"things in mammograms\" commonly. I am the only one who have a \"thing\" turn out to be \"something\". Keep in mind, odds are in your favor. Please keep us posted. I am so glad you had a little edge to your voicemail.

I have an annual mammogram of my remaining breast. I also have an MRI (my request) because it would show any abnormality at it's smallest point. I also take a hormone blocking drug because my tumor was hormone positive... which was a good thing. I had the most common type of breast cancer which was also a good thing. My doctor told me at least I have the \"good kind of breast cancer.\" I really want other women to know breast cancer is not a death sentence. I also want other women to know how important it is to have regular mammograms and to do regular breast self checks. I found my own breast cancer 7 months after my regular mammogram. It was early stage, I chose to have a mastectomy but I could have had a lumpectomy. I also had to have chemotherapy and I never had a bit of nausea... just felt like I had the flu for about 4 days after the treatment. I just marched through everything with a positive attitude and a big sense of humor. I am so glad you are ok. We are living in a wonderful time where so much can be done to cure breast cancer. Diagnostics, surgery, treatments, have become so much better. The key to it all is early diagnosis. It's bad enough to find out you have breast cancer but to find it at a later stage is really lousy. Keep up with your mammograms and do not live in fear. Wonderful to talk to you and so glad you are ok! Hugs and take care, Sharon",

So many women recognize they have a lump in their breast or other such things that just happen and then we find outselves being terrified. We have to wait for an appointment, and if there is any testing we have to wait again for the outcome. It is horrible to find yourself in that situation. First of all, this isn't something new, most of these --things-- turn out to be non-cancerous. The only thing I would push you to do is ask the doctor to be referred for a mammogram and possibly an ultrasound. Sometimes doctor's have a tendency to blow-you-off and poo-poo your fear. Doctor's are not always correct. I would rather have a test that is real proof things are ok rather than having the doctor snickering at me. Young women do get breast cancer. You want to make darn sure, this inverted nipple is not a \"southbound freight train\" coming at you in the future. I wish I could take away the fear you feel.... been there, done that because I am old enough to be your grandmother. We are always surrounded by people who have illnesses and you can't help but think --it could be you. Chances are.... it WON'T be but until you go in to see that doctor, you are stuck in a scary spot. Just try to keep busy with that new little guy of yours. Pretend .... you are NOT worried for his sake. Hang in there, your appointment will get here. If that doctor poo-poo's you and says \"Little lady, there's nothing wrong with that breast\" you ask him, politely... \"How do you KNOW?\" Take care, and hug your darling little boy. Sharon",

It could also be they need to do an ultrasound because they want to see the consistancy of something seen on the mammogram. I absolutely have been through this more than I can count and it does not get any easier. Of course, it is over the weekend so you have a worry about it. 9 times out of 10, these come back as nothing horrible. Doctors are so concerned they check everything!!! If they still have questions, they may even want a needle biopsy. That's when you normally start wetting your pants with fear.... but again..... most of the time they come back nothing horrible. I have also had breast cancer so I know what it's like to get that lousy phone call but I am alive, well, cancer-free. Try not to worry but I know there is a part of you that will. All I can say is, you have kept up with your mammograms and are doing your part. Chances are in your favor, nothing it wrong. As for changing mammogram places.... YOU BET.... things CAN get screwed up. You make sure you ask questions as so checking to see your mammogram is truly YOUR'S. My doctor read one of my blood tests incorrectly and was going to send me in for a bunch of horrendous liver tests. I am the one that discovered he had mixed up two tests and read them in the wrong sequence. You are your own best advocate and you have to not put all of your trust that things will be just perfect. I always make sure and ask questions.... politely if I have any misgivings. Please keep us posted about your further testing but I bet things are just fine. Hang in there.... take care, Sharon",

Usually the way it goes is a mammogram, and then if something suspicious is seen on the mammogram then an ultrasound is done. If a lump still can't be identified, you will then have a biopsy. I know you are concerned about breast cancer but there are many other non-cancerous things it could be. As for the back and chest pain, it can be stress, muscle strain, etc. You are probably really focusing on this discomfort which can heighten it even more. You are probably unconciously holding tension in your shoulders, back, chest muscles.... I do this myself. You are taking the right steps to identify what the lump is. Be sure to mention the chest and back pain but it probably isn't related to breast lump. Do you have any family history, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, of breast cancer?

      "Content": "Shellie, thank you for sharing your story... I am new to this board but have had breast cancer. My breast cancer was also missed by my yearly mammogram and I found a lump 7 months after my \"clear\" outcome. I was being checked in a breast diagnostic center in a large city but my breasts were also dense so I am sure the cancer had been missed by a year or two. Your story and mine are not that uncommon. Mammograms are not infallable. My advise to any woman who has dense breast tissue and has any kind of pain or something out of the ordinary needs to demand an MRI or some other diagnostic tool. When I finally had an MRI, the cancer showed up like a light bulb. I was diagnosed with Stage 2B IDC 1 node positive. ER+ PR+ Her2-. Mastectomy, 4 rounds of AC chemo, and 5 years of hormone blocking Femara. You and I did what we were supposed to do and the medical community failed us. I have found.... and I know you have too, you have to be your own best advocate. We are far from alone in this. I know another woman on another board who was also mis-diagnosed and she is going through treatment for her Stage 3C breast cancer. Shellie, I am sure we have many \"sisters\" out there who could add to the stories. I hope there comes a time when an MRI is a standard for women with dense breast tissue. Thanks again for bringing up your story. It allowed me to \"vent\" my frustration. How are you doing now? I am coming up on my 5 year anniversary and will complete the hormone blocking therapy in January. Take care, Sharon",

They would be --nearly-- convinced it is nothing to be worried about but to cover \"all their bases\" they refer you for a mammogram and ultrasound. I would not worry so much because the vast majority of these lumps and bumps turn out to be benign. This is very standard good practice by your doctor to refer you. Don't even get too ruffled if your doctor asks for a biopsy. Every one of my friends have been referred for multiple testing on various breast lumps and I am the only one who turned out to have breast cancer.... I have a LOT of friends. I would just stay busy, and try to push these negative thoughts out of your head. This will probably turn out to be ok. You have already done the right thing by having these lumps checked.

Keep in mind, it usually takes about 3 days to get test results back. One more thing, I found the lump in my breast 7 months after my annual mammogram. It felt like cauliflower under my skin. It felt uneven, and the edges were also uneven. There wasn't a smooth place on it. When I felt it, it was weird, clearly unlike any other lump I had felt in my breast. I hope you can set this worry aside. Most of these lumps are benign, this is small, the radiologist did not think it looked suspicious.

      "Content": "I am glad you checked this out with your doctor and by now you have had a mammogram. It is difficult to say if these random sensations that occure are a sign of something bad. Having had breast cancer, the breast affected did have sensations.... itching, tingling. I, too, had regular mammograms and ultrasounds that didn't show anything.... until I felt a lump. It is so important for women to be aware of their bodies. What is normal and what isn't. Realistically, you can't keep running back to the doctor with each tiny little thing. It is so vital you do monthly self-breast exams, the same time each month. This is how I found my breast cancer even after regular mammograms. The mammogram and U/S never picked up this cancer. Take a look at the symptoms of breast cancer, if you feel there is something in question do not hesitate to have it checked. This is especially important since you have breast cancer in your family. I did NOT but still got breast cancer. You have to be on top of things and realize there are certain breast cancer that do not present as a lump. Just know your body, and question something that has changed. Take care, Sharon",

      "Content": "So many women get this little \"greetings\" by phone or in the mail. All they want to do is take more views of the breast in question and do a compression which will flatten out the area a bit more and allow the mammogram to penetrate the dense tissue. A \"0\" birad is the lowest grade number. Birad grades go from 0 to 6. 0 means the exam was incomplete and they need more views to complete the mammogram exam. They may need to do an ultrasound if they still can't get a view. This happens so very often with younger women. They have dense breast tissue and it can be challenging to get a clear mammogram. It turns out very cloudy, or white on the film and reading it with any degree of certainty is difficult if not impossible. Do you know if the machine used was a digital? They have a better chance of getting clearer shots through dense breast tissue. They may still have to do an ultrasound to tell what they are looking at. In some cases.... they might even do a needle biopsy. PLEASE.... even if they go to something like that, this does NOT mean you have breast cancer! Your tissue is just so dense, they can't tell what they are looking at. I have a lot of friends who have had needle biopsy's.... only one turn out positive and that was me. That means a lot of doctors are being very careful to do a complete exam so they can positively identify this as benign. There are ba-zillions of women who have these kind of benign findings every single day. Only a small percentage of these women actually turn out to have breast cancer.... and I mean S-M-A-L-L. Please try not to worry. Chances are, this is a very painful cyst but they have to make sure. There is nothing in your report that would set off alarm bells to me. Absolutely.... take your husband with you to your next appointment. If you do have to have an ultrasound.... it would be good to have him right in the room with you so the findings can be explained to both of you. Chances are great.... you are going to be just fine. The older you get, the weirder boobs can look on a mammogram. Please keep us posted. Try not to worry.... take a deep breath, hang in there and take care, Sharon",

I don't know how many false positives.... that could be a rumor that has grown-legs. The dye injected for an MRI is taken up by breast cancer tumor which are usually rich with blood supply. In my case, my 2.2cm tumor looked like a light bulb. I went to the clinic in which the doctor who developled MRI for breast cancer diagnosis. I got to talk to him personally about MRI's and my case in particular. He pointed out so many things in my MRI and I could totally see the significance in getting this test. I was diagnosed with invasive ductal cancer stage 2B with one node positive. He gave me a lot of information that was much more comfort and reasurance, that than horror about the diagnosis. I just worry about wait and see. I still don't think you have enough information and am convinced since you are so worried. I would be too so I completely understand your fear and feel you are justified. I would get an appointment with the radiologist and discuss your concerns. Since you have had breast cancer, I would get a consult with your oncologist and possibly surgeon. I am surprised the radiologist place isn't giving you quicker results. The place I go, I do not leave until I get my mammogram results. Same thing with the ultrasound. I totally get it.... think it's a nightmare. Keep us posted... Sharon",

Having had breast cancer, I would welcome this further investigation as my breast cancer was missed for 7 months. This IS NOT to say you need to be more worried than you already are. Your doctor is taking the correct and prudent approach. Most of these things turn out to be not cancerous but they have to cover their bases. They probably have a criteria for doing further testing on ''things\" they find. You probably fall in to those parameters. Nobody knows what this is, for sure, until they look at cells under a microscope. Hang in there, I am sure this will be fine and a lot of worry for nothing. BUT.... your doctor is doing right by you.

Having been through breast cancer and a wedding.... NOT all at the same time.... your plate will be full. Of COURSE the impact of losing a boob, hair, is a big one because it is a visible statement of what you are going through. I must say after having gone through where you are going, \"the hair\" thing is a bummer. You DO get through it. I would suggest you take this one step at a time. FIRST & FOREMOST, embrace your beautiful wedding and your wonderful husband. Try to shove the next few months out of your mind for right now. You already know what will be happening so don't concern yourself with the breast cancer. When those thoughts creep into your mind, shove them out and focus on your new life. This IS a new life! This may sound odd but I am happy.... if you had to have cancer.... this did not turn out to be a \"mets\" from your lung cancer. This is different and caught at an early stage. Your CT & bone scans are clear which is a life-affirming celebration in itself. Honestly.... even with a diagnosis of breast cancer, you do have a lot to be happy for. I hope to hear from you again and really will help you along your journey even if it is from half way around the world. I always think of fellow breast cancer ladies as sisters. Your job right now is to enjoy your lovely wedding and really your new life. Hang in there.... take care, your \"sister\" Sharon",

You must not let these fears stop you from being seen by a breast specialist. Talking to them on the phone will not help you with the bottom line. They cannot tell you what this lump is without an exam and testing. What will happen.... they will order a mammogram, possibly an ultrasound, and from that you may have to have a needle biopsy. Even if you have to have a needle biopsy, this DOES NOT MEAN you have breast cancer! I have had many friends have to have biopsy's and not one turned up with breast cancer..... only me. Chances are good, this is not beast cancer but you have to be seen. A mammogram is an e-ray of your breast. An ultrasound is a painless look at the lump using a wand that sends sound waves and projects a view of the lump on a screen to try to see what it is made of. A needle biopsy entails numbing the area and getting a sample of the lump to view under a microscope. You will be scared until you get the results back BUT do not let this fear paralyze you into doing nothing. FORGET trying to talk to a doctor before you make an appointment put on your big girl panties and call for the next available time to be seen. You have had a lot of medical stuff happen in your life but putting these restrictions from your fear is not going to make this go away. The stress of not knowing what this is will only make your depression worse. You have got to be stronger than your fear and you CAN. You HAVE to be seen, that is the bottom line. You will then be doing what you need to do to take care of yourself properly. Keep in mind MOST of these lumps and bumps turn out to be NOT breast cancer! Hang in there, no more drama about this.... call the surgeon's office and get yourself seen. You can talk to the doctor when you are in their office. Great big hugs for courage and strength.

Rest assured, you could start a good search that would help you in your query. Another suggestion I would schedule a consultation with her doctor, hopefully an oncologist. We are lucky to all be connected with communication at our fingertips via the Internet. Doctors are on top of that list. They have sources for information about care in different countries. The most important thing for your mom is getting competent care no matter where she goes. You should be able to find excellent care in each country. and there are, well known, cancer centers.

      "Content": "I completely understand your angst! I almost see a tinge if girl-guilt but if you are worried, you can't help it. Until you get the explanation of \"WHY\" & \"WHAT'S UP\" this worry will be with you. Yes, I did have breast cancer and found out when I was 59, in 2006. It was early stage, I went through treatment and am perfectly healthy. As my picture shows, I returned to my passion in life which is horses. This photo was taken about two months after I had finished chemo. (I am still bald under that helmet of mine) Of course, as a celebration, I entered a horse show with one of my mini horses. I think why I am so adamant for you is because I was mis-diagnosed. The breast center told me my mammogram was clear. I found a lump 7 months after that mammogram and my breast cancer ended up being a 2B. If if would have been found at that mammogram check up, it would have been even smaller. So.... I am all for anyone to keep digging until they get an explanation! Now... this is NOT to say you are looking for breast cancer. I think your problem probably stems from some kind of virus condition BUT your worry is affecting your quality of life and peace of mind. You need some answers. I think you are getting the impression from those around you that your worry is being dismissed as silly. Your gut is saying you still need to find some answers. This is your body's means of survival. Do not keep apologizing because you have a basic human instinct to LIVE. You ARE doing the right thing... you need to find out why you have these swollen lymph nodes and the \"cyst\". You just put on those \"big girl warrior panties\" and go get your answer. I am cheering for you! Hang in there, take care, Sharon",

So many more of these biopsies turn out to be nothing and these are also incredibly tiny. Your doctor is just being really proactive which is great. I have had cancer also so I can completely understand why you are very scared but try not to make yourself sick.

As for the lesions on your pancreas, I would imagine, if it were something serious, you would have had some kind of symptoms by now. You should bring up to your doctor but I would think you would be sick.... or worse by now. Colon or pancreatic cancer doesn't metastasize to the breast....thankfully! Yes, you are correct, breast tissue changes with time. When are you having your procedure done? I have been thinking about you and wondering how things were going. I live on the West Coast and my favorite doctor during my treatment had done his training at The Cleveland Clinic. Are you going to have a friend, or family member going with you to your appointment? I always dragged somebody along with me so they could listen and take notes. I was such a basket case, I couldn't remember much of the things that were told to me. Please keep us posted. I will be thinking about you. Remember most of these things turn out to be nothing. You will be in good hands. Prayers and positive thoughts to you. Take care, Sharon",

On another board, with many young women who have faced the same genetic factors, they have gone through the extensive surgeries. So far, no one has mentioned other extenuating problems because of those surgeries. These genetic tests are both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, they give you a possible look into your health future and let you consider being able to alter having to deal with a fairly deadly type of cancer. It is a sobering look that will have some ramifications and outcomes that greatly impact your life. I wish I could give you more advice than just a relatively pathetic.... get a second opinion. Hopefully, someone with more wisdom than I will respond with more information. Thankfully, you live in or near a very large city with excellent specialists. I guess I wouldn't be making any decision until you have been able to gather a lot more information. I have been through a successful treatment of breast cancer. It is a big plateful in itself but having genetic implications makes breast cancer pale in comparison. Wishing you the very best, and all the positive energy I can send your way.

      "Content": "After having breast cancer, my best pro-active advice would be anytime you have ANY change in your breast, it is time to get it checked out. Inflammatory breast cancer is one of the nastiest varieties of BC and first signs are changes in the skin. Usually it gets an appearance of orange peel, red, rash, or thickening of the skin. Thankfully, this aggressive form of cancer is one of the more rare types. I have even heard of some doctors, brushing it or messing about with creams to treat the rash.... thinking it is only a rash. I would suggest you put the bug in your doctor's ear and bring up the term inflammatory breast cancer. You may also only have a blood vessel... almost like varicose vein showing through the skin. Do not lose sleep over this as most of these breast things turn out to be a big fat nothing. If it does turn out to be something, best deal with it asap. Good luck to you and keep us posted.

Since you have fibrocystic breasts this is something that will continue to happen.... the dreaded call-back. My word of advise from a fellow fibrocyctic breast woman, if there is any question about a lump even after having a mammogram/ultrasound insist on an MRI. I had a questionable area even after having the extra views. The wrong decision allowed my breast cancer diagnosis to be put off for 7 months. An MRI would have diagnosed my breast cancer much sooner. The breast center said their finding didn't warrant an MRI even after my doctor requested one. Sometimes you have to be very pro-active as it can catch cancer much sooner. As for the long wait for appointments or a finding, the thing I do is just know I am doing the right thing and there isn't any more I can do at the moment. I KEEP BUSY and shove the dark thoughts out of my head. Hang in there a please let us know how it turns out. Take care, Sharon",

Going to the dark side... it also has symptoms of a very aggressive, but very rare type of breast cancer... inflammatory breast cancer.

I would, absolutely, be on the phone for a clarification by your primary care physician. The radiologist can only go by what is seen on the films taken there. If nothing abnormal was seen then the there wasn't a reason for the radiologist to do an ultrasound. I think you are right and correct to question WHY? I also think you were very observant to mention the mammogram taken earlier was more painful. It would make me believe MORE compression was done for the original mammograms. I, too, would question all of it. I have learned to trust my \"gut\". If it is giving signals, it is best to listen. Please keep us posted.

The fibrous tissue is dense and more difficult for a mammogram to penetrate. Fatty tissue is easier for a mammogram to penetrate. I am glad you have an appointment coming up. Offices are being very proactive so if they suggest a biopsy, try not to worry too much. They are doing this so much now and the majority of these are benign.... not breast cancer.

Having had breast cancer I know a bit about all the emotions and throughts going through your mind. The good thing about breast cancer is the improvements in treatments and outcomes. Progress by leaps and bounds are being made daily. Even in the time since I was treated.... protocols have changed. I had invasive ductal carcinoma a 2.2CM. and one positive sentinal node. I chose to have a mastectomy, but could have had a lumpectomy. I had 4 rounds of chemotherapy and 5 years of follow-up hormone blocking drug. I am cancer free 5 years later. Treatment is no longer the shotgun approach. Pathologists can pin-point at a cellular level and recommend specific treatments because of your unique cancer cells. Women want to know what to expect and that is almost impossible to guess because of the specific treatment that will be just for you. Women also want to know their --survivability-- DON'T GO THERE it is in cold, clinical statistics. When you start reading that, it puts everything on a negative plane. Doctors have to talk in percentages but we were unique individuals. We, as humans, do NOT have an expiration date! I just marched through my treatment with a positive attitude, and a big bucket of humor. I know you are not at that point yet. Once your treatment path is mapped out for you, you WILL feel better. The --unknown-- space you are in right now is a terrifying place. You already KNOW you have breast cancer. Even in that, you no longer need to --worry--. The rest is a process of discovery. You will be able to get through this and hopefully, women on this board can help you.... I know I would. I also went through the preliminary tests.... an MRI, a CT, on and on.... plus a million vials of blood.....arrrrgh. Right now, I wish you a quick passage of time to gather all the facts you need. Be very careful what you read on the internet especially at this particular time in your diagnosis. You don't have enough facts to read something that really applies to you. There are a so many of us breast cancer alumni alive and well today. You can join us!!!! It is a rocky journey but we all make it along that path. Please keep us posted.... I will follow is you reply on this board. You have a whole lot of living to do... you will make it. Hang in there...take care, Sharon",

I chose to have a mastectomy but I could have had a lumpectomy. I went to an oncologist for a consultation and then went to a surgeon who was a breast specialist. She was a young woman and I was so pleased with her care. I don't know if you live in the U.S. but if you do or have any say in the matter, I would recommend getting a referral to a surgeon who specializes in breast surgery. Sometimes there are women's center's where you would find a breast cancer specialist. I had a medical oncologist and I felt I received great care. I had 4 rounds of AC chemotherapy. Treatments have changed even in the 5 years since my BC. Diagnostics have become even more sensitive and treatment even in women with the same diagnosis will be different. You have the most common type of breast cancer so there is a lot known about how it is acts and how to treat it. Hopefully, your cancer will be ER+ PR+ Her2- which means your cancer's cells feed off of hormones. Mine was and I am taking a hormone blocking drug. So far, it doesn't sound like you have received this information yet. You may have to have several more baseline tests... such an an MRI, or PET Scan, a bone scan, MUGA, and about 50 gallons of blood.... or so it seems. You already have a lot of information but you still have more discovery to take place. It is not uncommon to feel like you are walking around in a fog. Life around you almost feels unreal. You go to the grocery store and you see people just going through their day and you have just heard you have breast cancer. Please know, breast cancer is not a death sentence! It's not fun but you get through it and come out the other side a much stronger women for the experience. I would advise you to try to contact a support group. The other thing I did not do was keep it a secret. Don't be surprised when you tell people you get \"THE LOOK.\" I had one person ask me how long did I have to live? Arrrrgh. You WILL live. If somebody starts telling you awful stories... stop them instantly. You only want to hear of positive outcomes. You will imagine your own horror movies in your head. It's a rocky road but you will get through this. There are millions of us women out here alive and well after treatment. Again, I would advise you to try to get to a specialist in breast cancer surgery. They could also give you the best options for reconstruction if you choose to have that too. I wish you the very best and want you to know you will be OK. My life is completely normal and I will complete my 5 year hormone blocking drug regime in January. I hope you keep us posted and let us know how you are doing. I wish you hadn't joined....\"The Club\" but you have lots of \"sisters\" out there. Heck.... even my poor brother-in-law was diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer last Christmas. He, too, is doing great. He had a mastectomy and did not require any further treatment because it was a very low grade with a zero chance of reoccurance according to his oncoDX test. Hang in there darlin' you will be OK.

      "Content": "Well, more good news.... this is one breast. This is a typical recommendation for surgery when there are two spots in one breast.... mastectomy. Chemo depends on more pathology reports.... your age, stage, size, is it ER+ PR+ Her2- aggressiveness of the tumors or grade, lymph node involvement, and also an oncoDX test. The last one can predict if this is the type of cancer that might reocur in the future. The oncoDX test takes 2 to 3 weeks to get back after the surgery is completed too. So there are more labs you have to wait for until you know if you will have to have chemo. Have a chat with your doctor about what he thinks your chances of having chemo are. They usually have a feel for what is going to happen. I had cancer 5 years ago and even in that short amount of time there have been changes in protocol for treatment. I wish I could give you a better guess but every woman's case is unique to her and the types of cells in her tumor. I would say to you.... \"So far, so good.\" IDC is the most common form of breast cancer.... and if you were to be ER+ PR+ Her2- I'd say a big YAHOO for you. What those letters stand for is the type of breast cancer cells that feed off of hormones. You can literally starve any free floating cells by cutting of their hormones by taking a hormone blocking drug for 5 years.... like I have done. So... you are still waiting for more pieces of the puzzle. So glad you had an MRI because that shows up other spots of cancer that would be in the other breast or chest or large area's of lymph nodes if they were involved. What I am about to tell you about my experience with a mastectomy is one side of a spectrum. I had the mastectomy, had 5 sentinel lymph nodes removed. I woke up from the surgery, laughing with the nurses in the recovery room. They put me in my room, I spent the night, eat like a horse and no pain. I never took one pain pill because I never had one tiny little tweak of discomfort. I had a drain in that was taken out after about 10 days. For me.... I know this isn't common but I had no pain. I was up and about doing the dishes, in about two days because I was sleepy from the anesthesia. I really don't know what the down time is because I just didn't have much. The drain is kind of a pain to have to deal with beause it has to be emptied but I thought it was very easy. That is NOT to say other women don't have discomfort. I would think your real down time would be about 10 days or until you get the drain removed. As for reconstruction.... there are a couple of different procedures. The most common is after your mastectomy, a tissue expander is placed. Slowly over the next few months, tissue is expanded until there is enough to place an implant. I didn't opt for reconstruction so what I am sharing is from other women who have had this done. Your reconstructive surgeon will be able to give you the best information. The women I know who have had this done are happy with the outcome. One more thing... since you are going to have a mastectomy, you will not have to go through radiation treatment... which is good. It can be many daily appointments over a series of weeks and it can be pretty tough on your skin. Please keep me posted... I am so glad to hear from you. Yes... you have breast cancer but you are GOING TO BE OK!!! Hang in there, and I will share any information I can with you. Take care, Sharon",

      "Content": "It is my guess a bi-lateral mastectomy for your situation is fairly common. I belong to another breast cancer board and it comes up quite often. I would share the board's name with you except I would get kicked off of this board if I dared mention it. What happens, a woman will have a profilactic bi-lateral mastectomy after finding breast cancer in one. At the time of the pathology dissection of the second breast, they find a small cancer hiding in that one. DCIS is a pre-cancerous or stage 0 cancer condition, which is a pre-curser to invasive ductal carcinoma as you probably know. You have a grand opportunity to prevent the full blown cancer with all its ramifications. Your long term estrogen therapy may have been a contributing factor your situation at present. I was also a longterm estrogen patient. You may have some hot flashes with the withdrawal from your hormone therapy but only time will tell. It is something I have now had to live with for Y-E-A-R-S. I have more to tell you but have to take our little doggy to the vet right now. I will get back to you asap. Hopefully, you will have more responders. My opinions are only that.... just sharing my experience with breast cancer and having made a boatload of friends with various types of breast cancers. I will leave you with the thought, for having breast cancer or the pre.... you are in a good place. All of this, so far, is the earliest of stages. A big YAHOO for you. I wish all women would find their cancers as you have. Will type later.... Sharon",

This is attached to your spine and not in the spine, itself. I am not a doctor but just wandering my way through your description. What I am about to say is just a guess... when breast cancer metastasizes, it usually starts in an organ or IN your spine. On an x-ray, the bone would have a dark look to it as the bone starts to deteriorate. Your radiologist and oncologist need to look at any studies you had done that show this area BEFORE you were treated for BC. I think at this point, your oncologist will order more testing to determine what this is. This is probably a straight forward protocol at this point. It is probably going to be treated in one or all of 3 ways.... surgery, chemo (if it is determined to be mets.) and radiation. I can imagine your absolute fear because those of us who have been treated for breast cancer live under the threat of mets ALL the time. I totally understand how you are desperately searching for answers right now and I wish I had real concrete information to give you. You WILL find out what this is and be treated for it asap. You are just extremely lucky this was found at this point. You can thank your COPD. Please keep us posted... I feel your fear, Debi. Hang in there and many blessings to you. Take care, Sharon",

This discovery then pushes us to make decisions rather quickly. I truly believe you are on the right track and support your plans... as terrifying as they are right now. Your decision to find the best plastic surgeon for those new ta-ta's is really such a positive move. You can also get a second opinion about all of it too. Ask your doctor if he/she plans to do an Onco DX Test? This is a specialized test that can tell how aggressive or likely this cancer is to come back at a future time. This can also be another tool to help you and your oncologist make a decision about a possible course of chemotherapy. The treatment for breast cancer is made on looking at each woman's cancer in it's individual cells. No longer is there just a shotgun approach to treatment. Every woman's cancer is different on a cellular level even if the type of cancer is the same. You already have a bunch of information just from the biopsy's you have had. The rest of the picture becomes totally clear with the pathology report. Sometimes when women have a bi-lateral mastectomy, more cancer is found in a different part of the breast where it hadn't showed on the mammogram. Have you had an MRI or has it been suggested? So often, an MRI can pick up very small cancers that a mammogram missed. I have been thinking about you today and hoping you are doing ok... mentally.... This is a very difficult time.... actually, in a way, things get easier once you get all the testing back and are set on a course of treatment. At least then... you know what the plan is. This all is just my experience and friends of mine I have made over the past 5 years. There are a lot of us breast cancer folks out here. We have a very large sisterhood. More and more is being discovered for diagnosis at earlier stages, and better treatments. I hope you keep me posted. You will do fine....you will live, and you will become a much stronger woman for having to walk this path. Huge healing hugs, sister, and take care, Sharon",

I would like to say I am very sorry to hear about this diagnosis.... there are so many breast cancer folks our here. Believe me, I know how frightened you are. Keep in the front of your mind.... these are early, early, cancers. Standing on the outside, I can see many things that are in your favor. Even in a diagnosis of breast cancer, you have many silver linings regarding your story. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common form of breast cancer and therefore, has almost a standarised treatment. You have a much less aggressive form of cancer, which will probably turn out to be ER+ PR+ Her2- another good for you. You don't know if you will have to go through chemotherapy but probably no radiation because you are having a double mastectomy. Here is where age is a good thing.... post menopausal disease more in your favor. The only negative I can throw in is the expanders for the reconstruction cause pain. Universally, this is the same story from every woman having reconstruction, expanders hurt. I think as you go along in your journey, as you gather more pieces of the puzzle of your personal disease, you will become less fearful. It is a long road to be endured but every procedure you go through will be one less and one closer step to getting back to your normal life. Being that diagnostics have become so much better, each woman's treatment is a bit different from somebody else's. Protocols look at individual cancer cells when determining a diagnosis. At this point, what you have had for your diagnosis so far I would be out and celebrating. Keep in mind, if you get a response from a woman who has had exactly the same diagnosis, how her body responds, could be completely different than how you may respond. Having been on another board, this is a universal plea. Women want to know how they are going to feel and what it is going to be like. Unfortunately, we are all different. We can all tell you of our experience and yours will turn out to be something different. You will be ok. As you go along, you will gain more information about your diagnosis and knowledge will take the place of fear. Hang in there and much good luck to you. Sharon",

I hope you NEVER, EVER, EVER, have to visit here again with worries about breast cancer. Tuck this into your memory bank though..... breast cancer is a disease which is highly curable/treatable when caught early. So, if you find something weird going on in your breast, be sure to check with your doctor ASAP. I was one who did that and had treatment and am 5 years down the road without cancer. It is bad enough to be diagnosed with breast cancer but to be diagnosed with late stage breast cancer is a shame. Take care, and good health to you! Sharon",

Usually what happens in these things they do a needle biopsy but that will depend on what the radiologist who reads the mammogram has to say. The reason why the emergency room doc put you on antibiotics was just in case it might be mastitis... an inflammatory process in milk ducts. If the report comes back.... \"Wait 6 months... and then do another mammogram\" I would seriously question that. Myself, having had breast cancer, I want to KNOW what that thing is and the only way to do it is with a needle or core biopsy. Since this is solid.... I really want to know what it is. Now after I say all of that awful stuff.... I want to \"back up the train\" and say lots of these things turn out to be just plain nothing. I also question why this surgeon will be cutting it out as a needle biopsy would give you the results you are looking for. I kind of think the ER doc is guessing that it will be removed. If I were you, I would take some over the counter pain medication for your breast. You might also see if a cold pack might help... if not, try heat.

      "Content": "Oh darlin' I am sorry for this news BUT even in a diagnosis of breast cancer this is GOOD NEWS! This IS early stage cancer and there are treatments galore to cure you. I also had invasive ductal carcinoma.... THE MOST COMMON FORM OF BREAST CANCER! About 80% breast cancers are invasive so they know the most about these types. They will stage your cancer, and your treatment will be tailored just for you. They have the ability to look at individual cells. It is like they can look into a crystal ball! No two women have the same type of treatment because these cells are so individual. I chose to have a mastectomy with no reconstruction (I could have had a lumpectomy). I was and am happy with my decision. It is just a personal decision you can talk over with your surgeon. I am very glad to hear you are set with insurance and sick time. That can be such a huge source of worry. How wonderful they brought in a bus for mobile mammograms. You will probably end up being \"poster girl\" for finding breast cancer at early stage. You are going to be ok, you are NOT going to die! Be prepared when you tell your friends, co-workers, and relatives about this. Lots of them are going to give you \"The Pity Look.\" They will be thinking you're a goner. Do NOT listen to negative stories. Stop people from telling you about Aunt Betty who died.... You are NOT Aunt Betty and breast cancer treatment in this day and age are not the same as in \"Aunt Betty's Day.\" Be careful about going to different sites and reading about breast cancer. The one referred for you to read is a good one! Be careful, because some of these sites will only scare and depress you. Please, please, keep in mind, this is where doctor's want to find BC, at this very early stage. You WILL be one of the survivors! I have walked the path you are on right now. You be brave, and realize there are ba-zillions of women who have been there, done that. You WILL be ok. I hope we can keep in contact and don't be afraid to ask any of your doctors if you have questions. I am sorry to hear about the diagnosis but very thrilled to hear what it is and at such an early stage. Like my doctor told me, \"Yes you have breast cancer but you have the good kind.\" Your son sounds like he is also in a good place and has worked very hard. You are his Mom who knows what is best for him. Hang in there, God will always be next to you. Big huge healing hugs, you will be ok. Please keep in touch. God's blessings, Sharon",

      "Content": "I am glad my bla-bla has helped. It is just from my experience and knowing a lot of women who are ALL ALIVE today after going through breast cancer. As you go along, you will actually become less anxious. It sounds really odd, but as you see your treatment path laid out in front of you, the terror of the unknown will melt away. You actually already have a lot more information as to what you have. My advise to you as you start out.... get a large 3 ring binder and a hole punch. Get business cards from each of the offices you visit and tape them on the inside of the cover. ASK FOR COPIES OF EVERY TEST YOU GET. They have to give them to you and are usually happy to. Put them in the binder and carry that thing with you to every appointment. You will be surprised how often you have to leaf through it to share some information from one office to another. It saves a lot of time and each office will have all of your information always at hand. ALWAYS be polite and pleasent but be your own best advocate. Question something that doesn't sound right. Ask for clarification. Doctor's/nurses make mistakes, you have to be on top of your game and be your best advocate. As you go to these first information appointments, take a family member or a good friend with you to take notes and LISTEN. Your head will be swimming with the information and the understandable fear you will have. You will forget half of the stuff so you really need to have someone help you remember what the doctor told you. You just put on your big girl panties and march right through this challenge. I can assure you, you will be a much stronger women for the experience. I know you would much rather be doing anything else but for some reason this is what's in your life plan. You WILL get through this, and you WILL BE OK! You will join your other \"sister's\" and beat this disease.... I have no doubt. You got a lot of company out here. If you need any information I would certainly try to share what I know or point you in the right direction. Hang in there, gal. God will always be there for you. Take care, and big huge healing hugs, Sharon",

We could all guess as to what this is but nobody knows until you get a mammogram and see a doctor and that is pretty much the bottom line. Contact the American Cancer Society, Planned Parenthood, and Susan G. Komen Foundation. Between these organizations, you should be able to, at least, get a free mammogram. I completely understand your sense of fear. Chances are it will turn out to be something other than breast cancer. BUT.....if it is, you want to get it diagnosed as soon as possible.

MRI's are great for picking up things that mammograms and ultrasound's can't. I have had 3 friends have spots of calcium show up on mammogram's and 2 out of 3 were benign. The 3rd one had DCIS. I would think about getting a second opinion about this lump. It is never a bad thing to be thorough. Most of these lumps are totally benign... in fact the vast majority of them. For your own peace of mind get it checked out again. This is not a fun way to live! Take care, Sharon",

There has been so much discovered in the years since your Mom's cancer treatment and a ton of stuff to help get her through this more recent diagnosis. So glad she went in to have it checked by her doctor. I have heard of breast cancer reocurring on the scar from breast cancer surgery so anything is possible. I would have a positive feeling about this and even though it is a reocurrance, much can be done. Prayers for your dear Mom and for you too. She is lucky to have such a loving daughter.

Honestly, when it comes to MRI's just like shoes.... get on the phone and start shopping! You can also arrange a payment schedule.... just as I have done. My husband and I are retired.

ASK FOR A COPY OF THE TEST RESULTS. Just from my life experience, and having had breast cancer, I have grown a lot more bold. Since you have very dense breast tissue it is difficult to get a clear, diagnostic image. Digital Mammograms have made improvements but your breasts are going to add to the difficulty of diagnostics. Do not be afraid to ask for further diagnostics to put your mind to rest and to be your own best advocate. As scary as it is to be a bit more aggressive, you are taking the best care of yourself you can. Being that it has not become larger, and that it is a well circumscribed mass sounds like it means it is not irregular... irregular masses could be an indication of cancer. My lump felt like cauliflower under my skin. The edges were irregular. Please, contact the radiologist, your doctor, or the office who did the ultrasound. You need to have your mind put to rest about this. Never be afraid to ask for further testing such as an MRI. The MRI was the test that really showed what was up with my mass along with a needle biopsy. Since your lump is the size of a pea.... this is very small. Call asap to get more information.
