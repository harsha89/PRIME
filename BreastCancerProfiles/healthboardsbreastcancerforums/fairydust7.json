      "Content": "Yeah he didn't specify, but him and the other doctor that came in to see me (she's seen me the most and knows my medical history fairly well and filled him in on my rare skin dysplasia some) both talked about the ultrasound and mri. its military healthcare, so cost isn't an issue if they want to do an mri instead of an ultrasound. so i'm sure they'll choose whichever they think is best for the next step. my friend who's had swollen lymph nodes and cysts and lumps and a lympectomy said they might also do a fine needle aspiration biopsy. i ddin't think of that. so if it's still the same and i go back I'll bring that up as well with them. he also mentioned sending me to a specialist, but what kind i have no idea cause i didn't ask him to elaborate. I've been taking the antibiotics since Wednesday night and so far no difference. infact it seemed a bit more swollen earlier but now its back to the \"normal\" swelling. I'm just trying not to get all scared and convince myself that its cancer. But i honestly just can't think of anything else that would cause my lymph nodes in my arm pit to swell up. but it sure sucks having to wait. i am really glad they are listening to me though and glad that i don't have to deal with hmo's as far as diagnostic testing if it doesn't go away. but it doesn't make me any less nervous as to why i'm having these problems.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone I have an appt for Wednesday August 1st because I found a small lump that has been there for a month. I have fibrocystic breasts so my doctor says if i find a lump/bump to wait a menstrual cycle and if its not gone to come in. It's gotten smaller I think, but its not gone. So I'm going in. Also my lymph node under my left arm pit (its my left breast i'm talking about in this post) has been swollen snice at least Feb. Now I have another medical condition that I pick up infections fairly often, so my doctor said itw as nothign to worry about. and that sometimes they just dont' go back down to normal size. But my right arm pit isn't swollen, just my left. And my lymph nodes around wehre I get infections don't stay swollen. Also my left breast is heavier than my right and is saggier for lack of better word. It has always been a tiny bit lower than my right, but it seems like its gotten worse in the last 6 months. Plus I also get pains in my left breast, but not my right. So I did reading on breast cancer and I read about IBC. I don't have any skin dimpling or redness and its not like really noticably swollen, but I can feel and see difference. If my lymph node wasn't swollen, i probably wouln't be very concerned. I'm only 27 but I realize that you can get breast cancer at any age and that IBC is far more common in younger women. Now that you have the story, here are my questions. I have read repeatedly that mammograms do not pick up IBC. Either a skin biopsy or MRI need to be done. But will an MRI pick up breast cancer that isn't IBC? What should I ask to be done if my doctor doesn't offer any suggestions or anything? I want diagnostic testing to be done to make sure there is absolutely nothing wrong. so should I demand an MRI? Or skin biopsy or mammogram or what? There's no real area on my left breast that looks abnormal as far as the skin goes, so I don't know if a biopsy would be a wise choice? Or should I demand for both a mammogram and MRI since I also have that tiny lump? I want to go in armed with as much information as possible and ask as many questions as I need to. I have another health problem that affects my immune system, so I know I really have to be on top of my health if I have any other health problems since I am not completely healthy as it is. Thanks in advance for reading all of this.",

      "Content": "so i had my doctor appt today and the doctor was concerned, but because of my other health problem he decided to put me on antibiotics for 10 days and see if it helps. if not, then he said to come back and he'll put in to test it. he said because younger women tend to have denser breast tissue a mammogram wouldn't help much. so i assume he'll do an mri or ultrasound. and he gave me another referral to my dermatologist in Philly and said to ask him about this as well. that maybe he's seen lymph nodes in odd places act this way from skin disorders. so we'll see. he couldn't feel the lump that i can feel and he mashed the heck out of my chest. i'm glad he listened to me though and is concerned as well. so hopefully the antibiotics will work with the lymph node, if not i'll be going back.",
