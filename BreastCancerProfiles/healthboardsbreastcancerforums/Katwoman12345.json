    "Content": "Hi - I was going to post today asking about breast pain - and I actually thought to myself yesterday if the boned bra had anything to do with it. (my pain is only on the right - and not constant - just an ache that lasts for maybe a minute and goes away) - I do not actually possess any wire-less bras - but after reading your postings, I will go out and buy one and see if it makes a difference. Thanks Kat",
