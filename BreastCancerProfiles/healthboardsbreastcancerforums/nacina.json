After my little boy was born, 3 years ago, I really don't think I had a full night sleep. I would wake up 3 or 4 times a night and just lay there. It would also take me hours to get sleep. Elavil has been great for me. As far as the pain under my arms...it's gone. However, right before my period this month I could feel some minor pain under arms. Felt like lymph nodes but couldn't feel any lumps etc. After my annual gyno appt. I mentioned this to him and asked if it could all be hormonal and he said yes. Having said all this. I believe my aches and pains were from a mixed bag of things. Stress, lack of sleep, carrying a 10 lb brief case around, worry, anxiety...we will see how things work out. Has anyone else taken Elavil (I believe I'm spelling it right?) Say, what I do not understand is this: Having pain under the arms which I also have now and it runs into the brest and at time causes a burning in the breast mostly my left .I also ranned to the doctor to get it checked fearing cancer. The doctor assured me it was not cancer. But he also added due to my brain stem and nervous system that I may need to rest more often.Plus there is many other reasons , but none of this is a cause for some one to say you need medication for depression. THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK the pain is real is it not?",
