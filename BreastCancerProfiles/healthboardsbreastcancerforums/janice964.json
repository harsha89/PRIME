    "Content": "My son had several lumps in both his 'breasts' at age 10. Took him to the doctor immediately, but it turns out it is quite normal for kids heading into puberty to have lumps there. In his case it was a build up of testosterone and no big deal (though he tried to claim that if he had a tantrum it wasn't his fault - he had too much hormone - yeah, that worked). Anyway, while she is young to be heading into puberty, don't rush to the big C conclusion - it could be hormonal and nothing more. Good Luck.",
