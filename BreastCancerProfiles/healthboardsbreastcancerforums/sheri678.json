    "Content": "I am a 49 year old female who had a complete hysterectomy in November for suspected ovarian cancer. It turned out to be extensive endometrious which required major surgery and repair to colon and pelvic wall. During this period of time I also had an abnormal mamogram which showed calcifications. There was not major concern about this and I was instructed to return for a 6 month recheck. The follow-up mamogram was disturbing to the radiologist because the calcifications were no longer layering. They were clustering with abnormal shapes and borders. It was decided to go forward with a stereotactic breast biopsy. The radiologist explained the purpose of the stereotactic and the plan of treatment should everything be okay (benign) (6 month follow ups for a period of time) I received a call from my physicians office telling me that it was recommended that I go to see a surgeon. When asked if my physician recommended this, I was told that it was the radiologist at the breast center. Needless to say the conversation was very confusing. I heard \"they could not get everything they needed during the sterotactic, aytpical cells. I did not understand this because when I was undergoing the biopsy, the radiologist told me he got excellent samples and pieces of the calcifications. So, I am anxiously awaiting the appointment with the surgeon. Based on the information that I have obtained from researching, it seems that they found atypical cells and now I need another biopsy. (excisional) Based on this information, can someone who has had similar experience, give an opinion as to what is going on? Should I go to my ob/gyn and get help? Could all this be related to estrogen (ovarian/breast) I am on hormone replacement but the radiologist did not think this was estrogen receptive. Sounds to me that I have a huge problem with estrogen. I am scared to death and so exhausted from this nightmare, not to mention very overwhelmed. Thanks for reading. Any help would be most appreciated.",
