    "Content": "Have any of y'all researched 'inflammatory breast cancer'? Not to scare anyone, but I've been having problems too. It took over a year after weaning my last child, and I still (two years later) have a duct that a thick yellowish discharge comes out of. I've been told it could still be lactation, but I'm starting to get terrible pain in both my breasts-like sore, you can't even touch them pain. It seems to be cyclic, starting about 2 weeks before my period, then goes away for two weeks. The person I talked to told me all my symptoms could be hormonal, but would be remiss if she didn't tell me about the inflammatory cancer, as you don't have the normal 'lumps' with that type. I don't have insurance, and kind of in denial, just hoping it is hormonal. I spoke to a lactation specialist. I hope the original poster let's us know what's going on. That would scare me to death, and then a two month wait?? That's absurd. smoochy",
