      "Content": "Hi there, a couple of weeks ago I found a lump in my breast. I saw my gp and was told that as my period was due to wait until it was finished and then if it was still there to call her back and she would arrange a referral to the breast clinic. My period finished at the weekend so I called the surgery and asked to speak with the do tor, the receptionist said the doctor is booked all week and doesn't gave time for a phonrcall so I asked if I could see another doctor and was told they are busy too. She did offer to take a message and leave it on the doctors desk but I really would like to speak to someone as I don't know what the referral entails or how long it will take. To make matters worse I am a transplant patient and have been back and forward at the hospital since the middle of June for an infection that won't clear up. The infection us causing problems with the kidney and until it clears they can't tell if it is damaging the kidney or just temporary because of the infection. I just don't feel like I am coping, I am crying constantly and struggling to focus on anything. My husband is away on business for a few days so I don't want to worry him too much. I have suffered from severe depression in the past and am scared I am heading for another break. I just need to vent really and would normally post on ******** but then my mum would call and I don't feel like dealing with her right now. I know that it is most probably a cyst or something but I can't help being paranoid, my tonsils were removed a few years ago as they were con earned that I have cancer then and the two week wait for the results was horrible, this feels just like that all over again. I must sound like a neurotic person but I just don't know what to do, I suppose I should call the doctors again but I don't really want to discuss this with the receptionist, its hard enough speaking to the do tor about how I am feeling.",

      "Content": "Had my appointment at the breast clinic, apparently it is a pappiloma that I have. They are going to arrange for a core biopsy to confirm however they are sure it is benign. They told me if they were worried I would have had the biopsy that day, the biopsy is just to check that there are no abnormal cells, once they have the results I will go back and we can discuss what they might need to do, if anything. Feeling my h better about it all now. On another note my ct scan of the transplant kidney was clear, however if they can't find any reason for the infection when they do the camera of my bladder they are considering removing my native kidney as they think that might be the source of the infection. Feel like I am getting somewhere now though so fingers crossed it all gets sorted soon.",
