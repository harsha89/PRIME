    "Content": "There are many, many things that could cause a lump in your arm pit. Most of them totally benign. Please try not to worry. You should still have it checked right away, but my teenage daughter gets lumps there all the time. Most likely a clogged lymph node. They come and go. If you lost your gyno, call your regular doctor and have them check it out, but start asking for recommendations to find a new gyn. Best Wishes. Also, try and tell at least one friend or family member, it will make you feel better.",
