      "Content": "Hello I'm new to a message board so here goes; three weeks ago I had a mammogram it showed a 2cm mass in my left breast. A week later I was sent for a spot compression mammogram and an ultrasound. The spot compression came back 1cm. A week later the ultrasound came back showing speculated (star sharp)lesion BI-RADS 4 suspicious for malignancy no measurement. Made an appointment with a breast surgeon for a biopsy. That appointment is over 2 weeks away which feels like forever. I know i'm not suppose to worry but it seem that all I do. I count the days I can't really talk to anyone because all I get is don't worry. Has anyone been through this?",

They want to be sure and that's a good thing, you don't what them to be to quick to say negative only to find something later. All the best to you let us know how it turn out.",
