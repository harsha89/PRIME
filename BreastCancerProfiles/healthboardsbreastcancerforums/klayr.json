      "Content": "Cathy, First of all, if you are 45 with a history of breat cancer in your family, you must be getting regular mammos. If you aren't, shame on you and get going! If you are, then you need to make the doctor aware of not just your itching problem, but also your emotional concerns. That's what you pay them for. There is a type of breast cancer that attacks the skin on the breast. Some of the symptoms are a red rash that is very hot and inflamed and the skin gets dimpled. Do you have any of these symptoms? Make an appointment to have it checked. Itchy breasts are usually just changes in hormones. At your age, it could be the beginnings of menopause. But then again, you have a history that warrants a visit. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Hello, fellow survivors! I have a question for you. I assume that most of you, when you had your surgery, had the lymph nodes removed for testing. For those of you who did, this question is for you. I had my surgery in Nov. '01. I had 14 nodes removed. Recently (almost 2 years later) I have terrible aching in my armpit. My plastic surgeon said there could be pain for up to two years, but it should start to improve and lessen over the course of that time. He and the breast surgeon said that they have never seen a recurrence in a reconstructed breast, and they are both chief of their specialties at the hospital. I trust them completely, but Dr. Love's Breast Book does mention that it is possible to have a recurrence. How far down the arm do they have to go to get to these nodes; or how high up near the shoulder? Does anyone know? Could it be simple scar tissue? The reason I ask is because I found a lump that they termed fat necrosis, but it is extremely painful, even to the touch. I'm going to have it removed in July. Do any of you think I have anything to worry about? I don't usually have a problem with hypochrondianism, but this sounds all too familiar. I found my own tumors originally and the lymph nodes were very tender. I'm interested in hearing from my sisters in suffering. Thanks in advance! -- Klayr",

My treatments are done, but I don't have a day when I don't feel like a whole bottle of pain killers would be about my best friend. I'm not suicidal or anything, but I can hardly stand it anymore. The only thing that bothers me about this underarm pain is that I only recently got it. I had full range of motion. I never babied myself, and so I didn't have any tight scar tissue to battle. From my underarm all the way down the side of my breast, where the lump is, is on fire. Maybe it is just nerve damage. Anyway, thanks for posting. I hope your appointment goes well. Let me know.",

I guess I'm not really worried about it, but lately it seems as if I just can't feel good no matter what I eat, how much I sleep, or how long I exercise. The ache feels like my glands are swollen and I feel like I've got an ongoing, never-ending case of the flu. I feel the ache in my shoulder and neck on the same side. I wonder if it's something else, and I'm just paranoid about everything. It's funny, because I never was before! I wasn't ever worried this was coming back. Maybe this is my Achilles heel!",

From the way you worded it, it sounds as if they don't feel that it needs to be taken care of immediately, but I'm not sure if that's your words, or the way they were thinking of it. Definitely anytime there is something suspicious, you need to have it checked. The longer you wait, the worse it could be if it is something serious. As far as the money is concerned, speak with the facility that will be doing the testing. Oftentimes, they'll work with you to make a payment plan. You got the mammo, now follow up on it, for your own good health. Good luck to you!",

No one can tell you to do that when you're facing the awful news that you seem to be getting day after day. I read in the breast book that tumor markers are not very effective in breast cancer, but did you say you were a Stage IV? If that's so, has the cancer spread? Maybe the doc is watching for other signs that it has moved into other areas that would and could be affected by the test. I think that if you don't have a good relationship with this person, you need to get another opinion. If you are end stage, you need someone who is really good at explaining, and being sympathetic to you. I feel for you, and everytime I see a post of yours, I will bow my head and say a prayer for you. ~ Klayr http://www.healthboards.com/ubb/heart.gif",

I would say that if you know your cancer has spread, you need to have a new complete set of scans to find out where it's gone. Has anyone recommended surgery for anything? I had 10 of 14 positive nodes, so I know how you feel. It's like a ticking time bomb. Like I said, find someone who at least develops a good rapport with you, someone you feel wants to help you fight. You're still in there, and we're pulling for you!",

Aren't they supposed to monitor at least once a week? Poor her!! Such an uncomfortable spot to suffer in. I hope she's better soon.",
