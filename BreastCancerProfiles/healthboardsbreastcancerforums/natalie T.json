      "Content": "Hi Fitchick,Thanks a million for your information which seems to come from a professional point of view. It is very helpful. I am surprised that you don't think Aromasin is a steriod - but I hope that you are right. I am now into my second month of taking it and I have been watching my weight like a hawk!!! thankfully I am happy to say that I have lost about four pounds in the last couple of weeks due to my diet. Like you, I try to keep fit and the thought of weight gain is frightening. the other issue that worries me is \"possible hair thining\". So far nothing seems to be happening but I dread it if it does. However, on tamoxifen I seemed to be fine so hopefully I will get through the next couple of years in a reasonably happy state. Many thaks again...............Natalie.",

      "Content": "Hello to all - I am new to this site which seems to be very helpful. I have been on Tamoxifen for 3 years and have now been prescribed Exemestane ( or its other name Aromasin), I have been reading up on it and now realise that it is a steroid type medication. I have put on some weight over the last three weeks ( since I have been taking it). Please let me know if anybody else has suffered weight gain on this drug. Love and good luck to all of you out there. We are in an unfortunate \"club\" but at least we can give support to each other...............Natalie T.",
