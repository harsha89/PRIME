    "Content": "Hi. I recently had a pelvic/abdominal CT scan done because a urologist discovered that my bladder is being pushed to the left (and I have been peeing sooooo much!). The scan revealed that my uterus is enlarged and there is an asymmetrical mass there and that I have cystic lesions on my ovaries. I am hoping that someone on here can give me some scenarios of what all this could be. Should I assume cancer since both are affected? I am also quite anemic so I don't know if there's a connection with that as well. I have to schedule a pelvic ultrasound but I can't call until Tues. because of Labor Day. UGH! So, does anyone have any info. to tide me over until I can find out more? Thanks! [This message has been edited by RAG (edited 09-01-2002).]",
