    "Content": "Hi all, I wasn't sure where to post this, so sorry if it is the wrong place. I recently have been experiencing swelling under my right armpit, but more to the front part of the armpit. I went to the Dr about it (mainly because my fella said it just didn't look right) and he wants me to get a scan, which I am doing next week. I don't feel any obvious lumps, and there is no pain just the swelling which is more noticeable when my arm is beside my side. Is this a symptom of anything, anyone else had this, should I be worried or not. I've also noticed it makes the top part of my breast look more dinted along the curve near the chest/arm area as compared to the other side. Am hoping it's just fatty tissue and nothing to worry about. Any thoughts, or comments from those with the same thing would be greatful. Thanks chooky",
