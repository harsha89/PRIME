      "Content": "I have multiple cysts, and I think some that have recurred after aspiration (but not sure how anyone can tell whether it is recurring or just a new cyst?). As far as I know, it is nothing to worry about, but I would strongly recommend getting under the care of a breast specialist - if only for the peace of mind it has given me. After years of doctors, radiographers, and ultrasound technicians going ashen-faced when they see the images, leaving the room, repeating the images, whispering amongst themselves, referring them on etc. etc. I found it really stressfull. The breast surgeon I was referred to is an absolute pro - he knows exactly what to look for in terms of risky cysts and acts accordingly - everything is benign so far. He did explain to me that if you have cysts, it makes it very hard (in my case impossible) for you to detect any changes that may be more serious than a cyst (leaving aside the fact that some cysts have characteristics which can raise red flags, and really need an expert to pick up). So he reviews my mammogram, ultrasounds and does his own ultrasound every 12 months, and has said to go see him straight away if I find anything that worries me. I have pretty much 'given over' all the worry to him, and, while you sound tired of being poked and prodded, which is understandable, I can only recommend this approach as the one that has given me peace of mind, and the confidence that it is being managed as well as possible. I'm going to swing a guilt trip on you here - you need to be able to look your children in the eye and let them know that you have done everything possible to make sure they have a healthy mother. I see you have had an ovarian cyst - I've had a couple of ruptured ones. IMHO there is a link between these cysts and the thyroid condition I have (you'd have trouble finding a doctor who would say that, but there are plenty of people on the thyroid board who would agree), so it may pay to get your thyroid levels checked if they haven't already been? All the best",

      "Content": "I'm glad you are seeing the surgeon - good luck. I just want to tell you (you have obviously read up on what colour the fluid is and what that may mean) - I read up too and found out that red (blood) is bad. Of course I had to look when it was aspirated - it was red. BUT after the lab tests it was still benign. Just don't go freaking yourself out is all I am saying. It doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but you are doing the best thing you can by getting this kind of medical attention. my thoughts are with you Georgie",
