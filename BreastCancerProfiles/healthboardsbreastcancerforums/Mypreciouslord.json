      "Content": "I recently found a pea sized lump in my left breast. I'm having a mammogram and ultrasound Monday. I'm scared because my mom had breast cancer twice and although she's a surviver, we went through a lot...it's just a bad time cuz I'm going through a lot of different things in my life, and I'm very stressed! I've read some similar stories... Some awaiting MRI results...please let me know how those results turned out..",
