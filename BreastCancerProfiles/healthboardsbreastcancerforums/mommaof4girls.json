    "Content": "On Sat my daughter came to me with news that would knock down any mother. I was scared as I don't know, but kept my cool in front of her. Knowing that my grandmother had a double lumpectomy and less than a year ago my dad's first cousin lost her battle with breast cancer. So it is very much present in our family. I took her to the hospital when her primary physician told me that she couldn't get an appointment till later next week. I refuse to wait that long. So anyhow, I took her into the hospital ER Room. They did some blood work and an ultrasound on her left breast. So, the dr. came back in the room and said that another dr. would be in to talk to us. They both came back in the room and suggested that she stay overnight so they could drain it. However when the second dr. examined her, he came to a conclusion to give her antibiotics and see her in the office on Wed morning. Confused...why one dr. wants to keep her, drain it in the hospital because it is too painful to do as an outpatient. Another dr, says oh..a little antiobiotics and a visit. I am not sure. But I do know that I want to know what caused this and what can I do as a mother to help her not get another one. My daughter is 12, has had her cycle for less than a year now, very large breast for her age, and a bigger than golf ball very hard and painful cyst. The doc told me that cyst in a child this young is very rare. Ok..so lets get to the bottom of this and find out why she has gotten one. Can cyst lead to Breast Cancer? I am scared. I am scared because I know for a fact that my Grandma lost her battle and so did my 2nd cousin. Please..if anyone out there who is knowledgeable or has gone through what my daughter and I are going through, Please give me some insight. Thanks so much",
