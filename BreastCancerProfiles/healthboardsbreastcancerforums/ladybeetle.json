    "Content": "Hi, I am 27 years old and have had lumps under my left armpit for approx 1 year. Initially I panicked when I felt the first one (just fiddling around) but followed up at a breast clinic where the doctor found another lump deeper in (I sweating in the waiting room). I had an ultrasound which indicated they were just swollen lymph nodes. The Doctor said this was fairly common for women of my age group (especially under the left arm). Does anyone have any idea why? I've never heard of this before. I try to put it out of my mind, but I think I have more lumps now... I have had the flu for a couple of weeks and have put it down to this. The original lump feels just the same but I think the 2 others are larger... To panic or not to panic? ------------------ ladybeetle",
