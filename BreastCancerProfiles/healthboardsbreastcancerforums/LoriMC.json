    "Content": "This is a tricky one. One wants to believe that their doctor knows what their talking about - on the other hand alot of times they don't always know the answer. I would ask for a complete blood workup including CBC, platlets w/differential, as well as a Chem 27 (which should cover the kidneys, liver, etc). If you are severly anxious about it, talk to your doc and ask him to refer you to a specialist. I'm not 100% sure who you would see - perhaps a Hematologist. Keep us informed. Good luck, and God bless. ------------------ Praising Him, Lori",
