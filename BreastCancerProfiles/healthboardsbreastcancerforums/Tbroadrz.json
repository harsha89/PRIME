    "Content": "I have what appears to be a blister on my breast. The skin surrounding it is a yellowish pink colour and the blister itself is black and purple, it is about the size of a nickel and tender to the touch. It started as a small mark and over the past couple months it's grown into this blister. It feels like a blister when you poke it but it hasn't actually popped or anything. I have tried googling it but turned up empty handed. I have shown it to my doctor and she has sent me for an ultrasound next week. Anyone have any idea what this could be?????",
