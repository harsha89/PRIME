    "Content": "Hi I've had fibroadenomas in past and one was so big it was removed. I've also had 3 biopsies and thankfully all were benign. Last week I went for my yearly mammo and sono and they found a new nodule which measures 1.1x0.3x0.9cm and are labeling as macrolobulation and a birads 4. All my other biopsies were labeled birads 3. I guess my question is what are the chances of this being malignant based on measurement and being macrolobulated? Any help would be appreciated!",
