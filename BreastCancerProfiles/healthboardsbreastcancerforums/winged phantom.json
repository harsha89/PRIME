      "Content": "cc, I know what you mean... I could not come up with anything in the time I searched, either. I know you are feeling very scared and anxious right now, but you should remember that usually things turn out ok. I don't want to second guess you, and I know little about how they do the US, but I do know they have lots of knobs and dials and can look deep into tissues or stay on the outside.... Are you sure you were seeing both ovaries at the same resolution? Please try to take a few deep breaths and relax... I know your visit seems months away...just know you are not alone. wr",

      "Content": "Hey, Careyanne, I thought the name sounded familiar... You sound like you still need help, and if you are not getting adequate and on-going medical treatment for this, find a new doctor. I don't think the bra type has any fault in this, but others may have different opinions. The important thing is what is happening to you now, and I think it has not been resolved, because you are still in a lot of pain... not only that, but one breast is noticeably warmer than the other, so I would think there is some sort of infection or inflammatory process going on. I did notice that you did not say that you were not going to see your doctor (sorry about that awful sentence construction), so I'm going to assume you are still under a doctor's care. I sure hope so, sweetie, 'cause you need to see one again because of continuing/worsening symptoms. Don't let this slide; I doubt that it's just because you cracked a rib (did they look at the X-ray for that?), and you might have something like pleurisy or even an abscess. I know I'm not guessing very good right now, but that's ok, since I'm not a doctor. Just please make sure the doctors take good care of you, and let us know how you're feeling.... wr",

I hope that by this time next year, this incident is just a distant bad memory. Take care, and thanks for the update. wr",
