I am on a schedule to return in a few months to check on the progression of two lumps in the same breast. There is no pain or discharge in this new area. Should I reschedule sooner with the surgeon.",

      "Content": "I went for a mammogram. Had to have an ultrasound as well. I get the results in about a week. The only difference with this mammogram was that they didn't tell me know changes like they did last time. I have a couple of autoimmune disorders that I get regular treatment. One of the side effects is that it does slightly increase the chance of getting cancer. I can wait for the results. My husband and I have talked about it a couple of years ago after two friends died from BC and a third was diagnosed. I told him hands down a mastectomy for sure. No I'm not jumping the gun here. But over the last few years I've been faced with some scary medical decisions. Thanks for letting me get this off my mind.",
