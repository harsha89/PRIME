      "Content": "Hello, I used these baords and found them very helpful when I was diagnosed with ankle arthritis and degeneration of the sternum! Now I am hoping for some advice to what I have recently discovered ( like an hour ago) I have a white round patch on my right breast, if I was showing my cleavage it would show at the top...it probably wouldnt be noticable to anyone else though... should I see a doctor? Has anyone else had this? I have had a bit of an ache around the top of the breast this week, but have had that before , it feels like pulled muscleas when I stretch it is worse, today it isnt hardly there at all... I out that down to my sternum problem added to I work on checkout and that is my stretching arm..as have had it on and off for years... I really hope someone is out there and can help me.... I am shaking as I am writing this.... Cazz. x",
