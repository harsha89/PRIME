      "Content": "If you are uncertain, call the doctor or go there and speak with him. Take the information that you have found on the internet and ask him those questions. Any time you're uncertain, he should work with you about it. How do you know it was blood filled? Did you see it or did he tell you? Did he say they were going to examine the fluid? Was the cyst found through mammography? In general, fluid that is blood filled is taken to the lab and looked at. Maybe this is being done?",

      "Content": "It's a good general practice to get a second opinion any time somene wants to cut you open. Are you seeing an oncologist? My advise would be to take all your results with you to an oncologist and get a second opinion. You could also wait and talk to the surgeon with all your concerns. Just because you talk to this guy, doesn't mean you have to go through with it. If you don't like what he tells you or are skeptical, see the oncologist. Make a list of all the questions you have and give it to the surgeon at your appointment. This way you won't leave with unanswered questions. Also, anytime you do have questions, call up and leave a message. Any good doctor will call you back. Don't feel weird calling, it's part of their job and happens daily. If you go for the surgery, remember that nearly all lumps are not cancerous. Ask about all that. Sometimes, depending on where the lump is, they can do the surgery with a local and then you know right off if its cancer so you won't wake up with a suprise. Good luck.",

Being that you have a family history of cancer, it could be cancer. I'm sure that is why they are being extra careful with you by doing a biopsy. Finding it and treating it this early (if that's what it is) is a very good thing. It may also not be cancer. With the biopsy, you shouldn't have to miss work. It doesn't hurt much. Your breast may be tender at the site for a few days. They give you local anesthetic first then inject a syringe into the lump and take fluid and a small amount of tissue out. You're doing all the right things. I know it's tough to wait it out tho.",

      "Content": "A general consus among breast cancer screeners is that if you have atypical lobular hyperplasia and do not have a family history of breast cancer, that your chances of develping breast cancer is 4-5% in the next 15 years. The highest risk for the development of invasive breast carcinoma occurs during the first 10 years after biopsy and the risk decreases thereafter. This implies that the most critical follow-up should be the initial 10 years following diagnosis. Some patients with atypical hyperplasia may also be recommended to take the drug tamoxifen to help prevent breast cancer. While the appearance of atypical hyperplasia increases the risk of breast cancer, not all women with abnormal breast cells go on to develop breast cancer. In a recent study conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), tamoxifen was found to reduce the risk of breast cancer development by 50% in the group of high-risk women studied. In addition, five years of tamoxifen treatment decreased breast cancer risk by 86% in women who had a history of atypical hyperplasia. However, the risks associated with tamoxifen therapy must be considered, including an increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic disease.",

      "Content": "Hi again You mentioned that you were on HRT. Do you mean ERT? ERT is almost always given to woman who have had a hysterectomy. HRT consists of estrogen and progestin (a form of progesterone). ERT is just the estrogen part of HRT. The progesterone protects against endometrial cancer, which in your case, isn't an issue. It is still under study whether high risk breast cancer patients should receive HRT or if HRT increases your risk of breast cancer. I'd say that you probably shouldn't be taking it considering your situation. But your doctor, being you said he was pretty good, probably knows what's best. To grow and reproduce, breast cancer cells require estrogen. Tamoxifen is an \"anti-estrogen\" and works by competing with estrogen to bind to estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells. So logically, to me, taking HRT is counter productive to your situation. But like I said, your doctor has actually seen what is going on and must not think it's bad for you to continue. He might only see very very slight changes in your tissue at this point. I think you don't have to decide right now about the tamoxifen. If your next mammogram shows any changes, then your doctor will probably put you on it. I think the reason he isn't right now is because in most cases, the use of tamoxifen as a prevention is reserved for people with a family history of breast cancer or significant proof that what you have will turn into cancer. He's probably waiting to see if your tissues change first. The good news about tamoxifen is that is works best for someone your age. I'd say for your daughter, I'd have my next mammogram in one year and if nothing changes, go to an every 2 year schedule. Not because of serious risks of cancer but more to put her mind at ease. You know how it is not to know what is going on and be scared. Good luck to you both.",

It is currently thought to be due to ovarian hormones since it goes away during menopause. 60% of woman between the ages of 30-50 have fibrocystic breast changes, so it is very common.
