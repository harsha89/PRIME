      "Content": "I don't have any lumps that I know about, but I have had clear discharge out of both breasts since the birth of my son 11 years ago. I have heard similar stories about discharege. However, if you have a lump I would definitely get a second opinion. Its better to be safe than sorry. On a good note, 8 out of 10 breast lumps are benign. If you are 29, I would not worry about it too much, but still get it checked out. Best of luck.",
