      "Content": "Hi Msnik, Thank you for your response. I followed your advice, called them once more. I get an appointment for next Thursday. Now I am thinking maybe I should also have a mamo, but the secretary told me if I want a mamo, I have to wait longer than Thursday. They want both mamo and the ultrasound on the same day and they can't give an earlier day for both of them. I guess I'll get the ultrasound first, then ask my doctor to give me a referral for mamo as well. So bad this is the only place that does breast ultrasound in town. Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am a 34 year old women having hashimoto's thyroid. Recently, I my breasts started to feel awkward, as if feeling heavy and more sensitive (No- I am not pregnant and I have never gave birth). I did not pay too much attention thinking that it might be because I gained some weight (4-5 lb) in the last couple of months. Couple of weeks ago I learned my aunt, who survived breast cancer 10 years ago, has a metastatic breast cancer. I scheduled a women wellness exam with my naturopath and she found two lumps on both of my breasts. She thinks it is probably cyst, but recommended further examination. Rather than mammogram, she offered less invasive options: thermography or ultrasound exam. I choose ultrasound, but the place she recommended could give me an appointment 16 days later. When I was struggling with getting a diagnosis for my thyroid, I got a lot of help from healtboards and also learned that I need to be my own advocate. So I wonder if I should keep searching other options, earlier appointment at least? In other words, would it be still safe to wait 16 days, keeping in mind that I have waited also before having the wellness exam? Many thanks, G.",
