    "Content": "Hello -- I had a mammogram last week that came back with two \"small faint calcifications\" on it that had not previously been seen. My doctor has recommended extra views on the right breast for this reason. I am, naturally, worried about this and wondered how worried I need to be about calcifications. Does anyone else have experience with calcifications in their breasts and do I need to be extra worried about it? I'm trying to convince myself it really will be nothing, but I still have this worrying going on in my head! Can anyone share?",
