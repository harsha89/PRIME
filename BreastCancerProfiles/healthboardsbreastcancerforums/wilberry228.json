    "Content": "Hi - hope you are well, I see this is an old post and maybe 12 weeks have gone by. I wanted to say I have the same exact thing, right breast, pain, clear ultrasound, lumpy breasts with 'no dominant mass.' It is very scary and stressful to live with. Calming down for periods of time and then panicking again. Since you have a young child, maybe your hormones are still swinging, especially if you breastfed. Please post an update if you see this thread!",
