    "Content": "Im a 19 year old male. last wednesday the right side of my chest was a little sore. felt like a cramp. so i checked it out and noticed this odd tissue. it starts right below the nipple and goes off to the right on my right breast, its kind of tubular i dunno like a tendon or something. and its hard. i also have one on my left breast but its smaller. it does the same thing it starts bellow the nipple and goes off to the left. i went to the doctor and he didnt really know what it was. he said it probaly isnt nothing but he also said probaly because he didnt know. he told me to watch for a month and see if it changes. if it changes he wants me to go back and get an ultrasound to see what it is. Im over wieght, im 6'1 and weigh 265, so i dunno if it could maybe be fat or gynecomastia. im a little worried because my mom and grandma both had breast cancer.",
