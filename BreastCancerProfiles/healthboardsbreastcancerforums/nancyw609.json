    "Content": "I have a breast implant in my right breast only due to a birth defect. I had my first implant when I was a junior in high school, and then had it replaced 25 years ago. I have been feeling a lump and yesterday had my annual physical. When I asked the doctor to feel what I was feeling on my right breast, she ordered a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound. I know this is unusual due to the implant, but has anyone else had this issue. I am thinking it is either a mass or the beginning of rupture of the implant. Not sure what to think. BTW...I am 62 years of age. Not that age should be a factor.",
