    "Content": "Hi, about 3 months ago I realized i had a small hard lump underneath the skin in my armpit. Yesterday this lump was slightly painful so I called the doctors. Today it seems fine but after searching the internet yesterday I have concerns this may be a bit more serious that I thought. Any advice would be much appreciated as I'm only 18 and very panicked now. Thanks x",
