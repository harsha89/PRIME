    "Content": "Hello everyone, Please excuse the cross-posting. I know that papillomas are not a form of breast cancer, but there is no perfect board to post this on. I am scheduled to have a specific duct excision following a diagnosis of breast papilloma in one week. I'm wondering if any of you who had this surgery can offer some info about postsurgical recovery and any tips you have to cope with pain and discomfort. Many thanks!",
