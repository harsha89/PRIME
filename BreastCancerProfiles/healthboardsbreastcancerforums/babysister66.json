My doc wrote me a script to get blood work to test my thyroid, and to check for lymphoma or leukemia. I will have to call tomorrow and see how much those tests run, as he also wants a complete CBC with diff and a metabolic panel. I know I need to do these, but hopefully it won't be too much money. He switched my pain meds for me, and I about died when I filled them $155, I'm use to paying like $30. lol Oh well, I'm gonna keep on keeping on until I figure out what is going on with me. I'm not crazy, I must just have a difficult problem to diagnose. Grrr. Take care everybody.",

I talked to someone at the breast center, and she said the doc was waiting to talk to me as he was compiling the results from the ultrasound, mammo, and ct before he talks to me. I don't know if that is good or bad. I am so frustrated. I got called into my director of nursing office at my college, and basically got the talk that I either get better or get out. I have been going to college 5 years now, I am in my senior year. I have always made high grades, won scholarships, and now because I have been getting sicker and sicker this year she says I might have to leave. I have to go see her tuesday, hopefully after I get some results, and if I so much as cough I am out of the program. She says I am getting too skinny and am coughing all the time. Well excuse me for getting sick. I will definately post next week when I hear something. Is it crazy that I am actually wishing to hear I have something? I am tired of feeling that I am crazy, when I know there has to be a reason I feel like I do. I feel bad, I feel wrong. And I am losing a lot of weight, and these sweats are horrible.

      "Content": "I'm still waiting to hear anything. When i was having my CT scan yesterday the guy looking at it there was like \"poo pooing\" it, like maybe youjust have a large muscle like baseball players get. It made me so mad. This mass grew in the last 3-6 months, I am 44 years old and do not overuse one arm, I have a horrible wet cough and am coughing up phlegm with blood. I also have enlarged lymph nodes. I have not heard anything about what it could be, or any news on the results of my diagnostic mammo and ultrasound, even though they acted all worried at my appointments. Why won't they tell me anything? I have been researching on the internet and it says with chest wall tumors that sometimes MRI's are the only way to see them and that CT scans sometimes won't show them. What do I do it they say nothing? I have a definate large palpable mass, I have lost now almost 30 pounds, I cough up blood. I am so scared and it makes it hard for me to concentrate on anything else until I get some answers. I have so much achy pain too. I always take two percocets a day for my pain from autoimmune disorders, but since I have been real sick over the last 3 weeks I have had to take two at a time, and take them in the afternoon too instead of just morning and night. I am afraid if I ask for more he will look at me as a drup seeker. I have no money, but my brother is going to pay for me to see my doc today to see if he has results of CT scan, and I want to get more meds but I am afraid to ask. Sorry for rambling, but I don't know what else to do.",

I have an appointment to see an oncologist on tuesday the 28th. i guess that answers my question of is it or isn't it. lol I still wish someone would have called me in person and let me know what they saw, rather than this impersonal letter and making me wait. Oh well. Does anyone else go, or have gone, to a breast center that is located in a hospital? Through my other two biopses, mammos, etc, the letters always came on the breast center stationary, and of course they came after a personal phone call that all was well. This letter just says my appointment is at the medical center(hospital). Is the oncologist usually seperate from the actual breast center people? I don't know what to expect when you go to see an oncologist for the first time. Any ideas anyone? I am going to have to be going alone, so someone suggsted I bring a tape recorder. good idea? Bad idea? Best wishes to you all",

      "Content": "Hi folks, I'll try to make this brief. I have been followed with mammos every 6 months since I was 40 ( I am now 44) after finding a lump, as my mother died of breast cancer. That first one was nothing. since then I have had two biopsies after finding calcifications, birad 4, and those also were fibrocystic changes. My last ultrasound and mammo, at the first of the year, showed two areas that my doc wanted to biopsy. After discussion, he decided to wait and follow up in 3 months. The one he was worried about, as it had \"dirt\" in it, he wanted to wait on as it was sitting next to my implant. Well, things got hectic and I missed two appointments. During this time I have lost over 20 pounds without knowing why ( I am skinny to begin with), have grown a very hard fixed lump in this same breast, and have swollen lymph nodes in that armpit and two in my neck. I got worried enough that I finally went in. I go through the Susan G. Kohman foundation since I have no insurance (thank god for them). Since I had waited so long I had to be rescreened and approved before going for the actual mammo. After the doc felt the lumps, heard about my weight loss and night sweats and stuff, said he has been doing this for over 30 years, and this was all very worrisome for cancer. They wanted me to start all the tests the next day, but with my schedule I couldn't do it until monday. That is two days away. I guess I don't really have a question but I am so nervous. I am totally alone, no support system to speak of, and really wish I haad someone to go with me. I don't know if any of you know what I'm talking about, but I really \"feel\" that I have cancer. I have just not felt right. Like I said, Ihave lost over 20lbs, I have night sweats, I have these new rock hard fixed lumps. I am tired all the time. I am in my senior year of nursing school, and I work to keep a roof over my head. I am afraid to think that if I have chemo or surgery that I will not be able to keep up with my homework or clinicals or such. Any advice out there? Also, Can I please hear back from someone so that in my head I can take someone with me when I go in for my tests monday? They said they are doing 3 different ones, one a 1, one at 1:30, and one at 2, Does breast cancer usually cause weight loss and night sweats like I have? Is the fact that these lumps are hard like a rock and fixed bode worse for me than if they were softer or movable? Sorry for the long post, but I have been debating all week wether to post, and finaly am just blurting it out. One more thing. I had a hysterectomy, with overy removal, 5 years ago. I thought you couldn't get breast cancer if you didn't have your hormones anymore. Is this not true?",

Cancer runs strong in my family, and I really don't feel right. I was also found two years ago to have atypical cells in my bladder, but I didn't like the clinic I was going to so I haven't followed that up. I still pee blood sometimes now. I don't know if all this is connected, but I am afraid and anxious all at the same time. In a way I just want them to finally diagnose me so I can quit feeling like I am crazy, with how sick I have been feeling and all the weight I am losing. If they diagnose it than I can be on the road to fixing it. I kind of feel like I'm just holding my breath, waiting to exhale.",

I am alernating between crying hysterically, laughing, and sitting here in a daze. I guess I no longer belong on the breast cancer board but Im not sure where to post yet.
