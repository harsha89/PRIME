    "Content": "I'm a 35 yr male. I found a lump under my left nipple. It's about the size of a quarter (it hurt at first for now it's uncomfortable). It happen about 2 weeks ago and I'm waiting for a referal from my Family Doctor. He dosn't think it's cancer but want's to check it. While i'm waiting any info peeps? My info: Last March (2005) I had a bad car accident (head on). I had a dissection (both) arteries (carotid). My left inlining let out blood to my brain and I had a stroke (my speech/language area). I'm lucky to be alive. I accident also had my septum (sp?) in my nose. I was on 100mg Dilantin 2 per day for 2 weeks (stopped April 2005) I was on 81mg Aspirin 1 per day for 3 months (stopped July 2005) Right now i'm on Nasonex (December 2005 - March 2006) to help my septum (sp?) nose to breath. 2 times per 2 per day in each nozzle (sp?) I read that there is Steroids in the nasonex. Could any of this medicine cause some hormones to my left breast? Sorry about my writing, it's hard to write since my stroke. ty",
