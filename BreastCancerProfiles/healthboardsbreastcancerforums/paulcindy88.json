      "Content": "I am 38 years old, no history of breast cancer in my family other than a great Aunt on my grandmothers side. Since I was young my left breast and aereola(sp?) has been larger than my right. I never liked this as it always looked weird to me. I have had three children and of course since my left breast sags more than my right it still looks funny to me. When reading the symptoms of breast cancer, it is hard to determine exactly what it is to look for. My left breast always seems to be more \"squishy\" around the nipple and aereola, I can feel several small lumps around the nipple area, but it has seemed to be this way for a long time, at least a few years anyways. It is also \"bumpy\" looking around the nipple as well, like \"wrinkled\". More so than my right breast. If I am laying down flat, my left breast kind of flops over to the left and my nipple looks funny. The aereola looks wrinkled and so does my nipple(don't know if this is a symptom or just age) I have not seen a gyno in almost 6 years now since we do not have any insurance, but it seems as if my breasts have been this way for a long time. If you have Breast Cancer, other than having the \"normal\" symptoms, (lumps,puckering etc)wouldn't you show more advanced symptoms if it was never diagnosed? If so, what are the advanced symptoms of breast cancer? I feel fine but am curious. And I cannot have a mammogram until I am 40 or it will not be covered by the state. Thank you",

      "Content": "Is there a difference between normal lumps that are \"glands\" and lumps that are signs of Cancer? I do self exams all the time, and my breasts, especially my left one, is full of small lumps everywhere, especially under the nipple and around it. It is more prominent if I squeeze my breast with my thumb on top and fingers on the bottom. I feel small lumps on my other breast as well, so how am I supposed to know what are \"good\" lumps and \"bad\" lumps? Or do some women normally have lumpy breasts? Or are lumpy breasts not normal either? I don't get it as to how I am supposed to know? I mean if a Dr did a breast exam and felt all these lumps and was concerned which one would they choose to biopsy if there are so many? I have no insurance at all whatsover, and am only 38. Baseline Mammo's are age 40. Hopefully my questions do not sound silly. Thank you",
