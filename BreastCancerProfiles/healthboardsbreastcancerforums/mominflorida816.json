      "Content": "Thank you for the quick replies! I had been waiting to hear of my results all week and anxiously awaiting the mail in hopes that I'd get a letter stating all was well so the call today was a shock! I could barely talk on the phone I was so scared. I was told in my 20's that I have dense/fibrocystic breasts but then it was never mentioned again during my yearly ob/gyn visits. I have myself so worked up (I have horrible health anxiety) that I almost wish I never went for the mammogram to begin with since I am not yet 40.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new here and very scared after having just received a call back from my first (baseline) mammogram at age 36. The nurse told me that the report says I have dense breasts so she is going to send me a letter/prescription to go back to the same center and have an ultrasound and possible second mammogram. She said it is common and the report did not list that anything was suspicious. Has anyone experienced this? Is this common? I have no breast cancer in my family and no palpable lumps in my breasts but I am still very scared. The call came eight days after the mammogram and of course on a Friday so I can worry all weekend. Thanks for any help!",
