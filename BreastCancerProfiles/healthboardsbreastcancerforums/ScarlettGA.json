      "Content": "Hey Tenngal31 - I went to the doctor today with my complaint. He told me I was having these problems because I'm a smoker. Not that I disagree that I need to quit but I don't see where that has anything to do with my breast pain. He said it wasn't pain it's called tenderness. I told him tenderness doesn't wake you in the middle of the night. Anyway - he suggested I cut out smoking, caffeine, and chocolate and that I'll be a new person giving up these things and the tenderness will go away. When I quizzed him on my previous mammogram he flipped through my chart and then said...Well you have calcification in your ducts and that's no big deal. I stated that I had read that calcification is serious and that I needed to know what it meant exactly. He told me that it was nothing and that if I gave up smoking, caffeine and chocolate the calcification will go away. I gave up the \"fight\" after that - I could tell I was getting no where with him. I mean - honestly - he can tell me to quit smoking and I wouldn't have been so offended but everything I brought up to him today including the breast pain issue was happening because I am smoker. He didn't take seriously one thing I said. He did give me a slip to go and get another mammogram and on the order he wrote for them to call him with the results (instead of him waiting for the results in writing). As I was leaving he did say \"Oh yeah you can start taking Vitamin E - that's suppose to help with breast issues.\" Needless to say - I don't think he helped me at all. I will try some of his suggestions like cutting back on the caffeine and chocolate and I'll take the Vitamin E and of course, I'll have the mammogram done. But IF anything shows up I'm certainly not going back to him again. Anyway - that's how my visit with the doc went. Let me know if you find out anything. Take Care...Scarlett",

      "Content": "I'm 48 yrs old - and over the past 6 months or so I've noticed that my nipples are extremely sore. I mean painfully sore - to the point where if I roll over at night the pain will wake me up. So far I haven't seen any discharge or anything. Just painfully sore. Last year when I had my mammogram they said there was something suspicious on the film and I went back in and had it done again. They then sent me for an ultrasound and that came back just fine. The tech said she saw nothing but normal breast tissue. They then sent me a letter telling me all was well but for some reason I have this nagging feeling that everything isn't okay - especially with this soreness I've had over the months. I had a hystorectomy when I was 26 so this isn't due to any cycle. I did quit taking horomones last year after the scare with the mammogram but I'm wondering now if maybe I need them? Or could this be something else? I have a doctors appointment scheduled but I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this before. This is definitely a first for me and trust me - I've been through a lot over the years. But I've never experienced this sort of pain before. It's just weird feeling. Any help, suggestions or whatever - I sure would appreciate it. This has really got me stumped!!! Take Care...Scarlett",

      "Content": "Hi Ramona - I read your post with great interest..... I'll tell you a story about a friend of mine - she too noticed a lump but for some reason thought it was part of her rib cage and didn't pay much attention to it. She finally made her annual OB/GYN appointment and during the breast exam he noticed the same lump and sent her directly to have a mammogram. Within 24 hours she was in the hospital having a masectomy because she did have breast cancer. Fortunately for her it had not spread. This story is not meant to scare you but to make you stop and think - if it's a lump wouldn't it be best to get it checked to be on the safe side? Peace of mind is priceless. Let me know how everything turns out. Take Care....Scarlett",

      "Content": "Drea - I had this same problem when I was in my late 20's. I went to the doctor and he basically told me it could be a tumor on the pituitary gland but he doubted it - he thought it was more of an infection in the milk duct. He gave me a breast exam - took some blood and handed me some antibiotics to take. I took them and it cleared up. Over the years it has reoccurred only to disappear again. I tend to believe that it's just an infection. But just to clarify - I'm not a doctor - so go see yours and see what he has to say. Peace of mind is priceless. Let me know how it turns out for you.
