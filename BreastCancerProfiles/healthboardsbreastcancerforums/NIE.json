    "Content": "Exaura, My mom is on Taxol for Ovarian Cancer. Yes, she does have sever joint pain about three days after treatment. The doctor gives her pain medication for relief. The pain only lasts a day or two. Other side effects are nausea but there is medication for that too. Also, mom gets norapathy (spelling?) which is numbness in fingers. I think she has some medication to help with that as well. That is all I can think of right now. Write back if you have more questions. My mom has been taking Taxol for quite a while now that apparently there is no limit on the amount you can take. It is just a matter of how much one person can tolerate. Search for the name Cathy Hainer on the internet. She is a USAToday report who wrote a journal about her battle with breast cancer. Although she eventually lost her battle I thought the journal was very touching and helped me to understand what a breast cancer patient may go through. I think it will help you. Good Luck and God Bless. NIE",
