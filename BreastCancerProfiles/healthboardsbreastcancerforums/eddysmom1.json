Results are quick--did you make a follow-up with your doctor yet to go over them after the mammogram and ultrasound? I had my films and mammogram done at an Imaging Place and they sent me a letter in the mail the results even before I went to my gynecologist. I don't know where you are having yours done, but I would set up an appt with your doctor shortly after you have the tests so you don't wait long. Let me know how you make out & good luck!!!!",

      "Content": "So glad your results came back ok!!!!! Sounds like the junior doc may be saying you have fibroadema--which is a benign tumor. Usually painless, definitely non-cancerous, and monitored over time. And it also sounds to me like your radiologist--if he said \"lumpy breasts\" is indicating Fibrocystic breast condition. It's characterized by lumpiness and sometimes discomfort in one or more breasts. It is a common and benign condition and sometimes doctors can't even feel the lumps you feel on an examination. It used to be called Fibrocystic breast disease, but is not considered a disease at all now, but a common condition. Go to the Mayo Clinic website to read on both conditions. It's a great site, and, to me, easy to read and gets right to the point, unlike other sites. I would ask my doctor to let me know when it should be checked again if it is a fibroadema (6 months?, etc). But I guess you need to know if the final diagnosis was a fibroadema or fibrocystic breast condition. I am really not sure if they keep monitoring that or not. Don't be mad at leaving the radiologist's without questioning him the way you wanted--it definitely happens. You just get so overwhelmed, and if they are being an ***--frustrated and then you tend to just want to get out of the building!!!! I have forgotten questions, called back, etc. I am glad you got good results--just call doctor back and ask which condition you were finally given. Ask what the ultra sound results said--or request a copy of results--I did that recently for a bunch of MRI's I had done. Good to have on file. Let me know what they say............",

      "Content": "Well, I was told that the ultrasound gives a much better picture than the mammogram. That's why, with me, they told me they would do a second mammogram, and only a ultrasound after if they couldn't get a clearer picture. I am 41, so you are quite a bit younger than me. But, I have always had alot of health problems and had my first mammogram at 31 because they detected some calcification. My point is, I have been ok, even with the little scares, so I am sure you will be, too. Be positive and good luck!!",

      "Content": "Hi ManicPanic!! The report is saying that there is an area in your left breast, towards the side of the breast nearest your armpit, which may have abnormalities. But,since it was only found on the CC view it means this area does not look abnormal on the Lateral view--when an abnormality is found on one view only it is extremely likely that it is not a cancerous finding. They are saying in your report that if they still see the nodular asymmetries on another view then more tests are suggested. That happened to me, also, I needed the ultra sound after the spot compression--they did see a cyst, but it was non-cancerous. They told me that that is usually the case. Could be some cysts that they just need to get a better look at because they didn't get a real clear picture in the first mammagram--or it could be just that tissues are folded over and it looks like something that may not be there. I am not a doctor, for sure, so when you go you should ask them if this is correct. But, I think it is, as this is pretty much what I just went through. They found a cyst after doing the spot compression and ultrasound and then it ended up being non-cancerous after the needle biopsy and it aspirated. The doctor said they are non-cancerous most of the time. Spot compression is when the mammagram is used with smaller paddles--it applies more pressure to a small region of the breast so they can get a clearer image. Hurts a little more than the usual mammagram--but not too bad. When you have dense breasts it does raise the possiblity of false negatives--which means you go through all this worrying and then find nothing is wrong--further tests were needed to get clearer images. I know none of this will make you feel better until you are done with the tests and get good results, but hang in there, you will be relieved when it is all over. Let me know how you make out this Friday!!! By the way, I am a fellow OCD sufferer, so I know how that makes this all the more harder as far as worrying and centering on it. I am here for you!!! Stay positive and I'm glad that your tests are this week so you can get them over and done with. Hang in there honey!!!",

I will ask to go there from now on for anything concerning that area. Thanks for pointing that out & your kind words!",

      "Content": "Hi MissyJoy, I was thinking of you and wondering if you had the diagnostic appt yet. They want to get a clearer look--they may have seen something small on your film that they could not distinguish. Sometimes, that is just because a fold of skin is getting in their way of a clearer picture. Here is a quote below from a doctor on another site that may explain what I mean by 'Fold of skin\" better \" It is very common to have an area of \"asymmetry\" appear on a mammogram - this is a common description. In these cases spot compression is recommended to further evaluate the area. Many times the outcome is that the tissue may have folded over on itself and spot compression will smooth it out, yielding a normal mammogram.\" Spot compression just means special mammagrophy films and maybe an ultra sound in conjuction --in my case they used smaller paddles on the mammography machine and did an ultrasound. (my case is different than yours because they saw something different so don't worry about what I told you about me in the other post.) They may get a better picture on your second mammogram films and not need to do any further testing. However, they may do an ultrasound if they still don't get a great picture. Hope this helps and good luck!! Let me know how you make out.",

Only, since it does hurt me and my family history is full of cancer, they do want me to go back to the hospital one more time next week for another ultrasound and to try and aspirate the cyst. Don't like the thoughts of the needle in me--but I can surely take that as I am extremely lucky to hear the great news that is benign.

I know this won't help much, but try to think of it this way, if you can--doctor's do not hesitate to tell patients when it is something they think is bad. I know, who wants to hear \"inconclusive\"--but he did say he was pretty sure there was no malignancy. No doctor is going to say that unless he hasn't a pretty firm idea. I wish you and your Mom the best of luck and will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. I am around if you need an ear & don't forget to post after the procedure so I can be happy all went well.",
