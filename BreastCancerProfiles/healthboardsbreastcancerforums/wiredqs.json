When you are this young, you probably have dense breasts and an ultrasound would probably be ordered, that would be relatively painless. The mammogram is not that bad, uncomfortable certainly but not agonizingly painful. The biopsy is usually a needle biopsy done with a local anesthetic, as they expained to me..no worse that novacaine at the dentist. A moveable lump is usually a fibroadenoma,(a benign growth) especially in a younger woman, but there is a small chance that it could be something else, so get it checked.",
