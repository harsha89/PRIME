    "Content": "mwgirl, I can identify with how you must be feeling right now. I also have implants and have had the same ones since 1978. NO problems other than in the past year they have become firmer. I have really been fortunate there. On 9/21/05, I went in for my yearly mammogram and received a letter a couple of days later requesting I return for a follow-up mammogram due to an abnormality in my right breast. Needless to say, I was panicked. On 9/30/05, I had the 2nd mammogram and had the same results, so they followed up with an utrasound scan. That showed NOTHING out of the ordinary, not even the spot the mammogram showed. The radiologist stated all he could surmise is a ruptured, leaking implant and I needed to have them replaced SOON! I have NO family history of cancer, but I do have fibrocystic breasts. I am waiting for a call from my GYN in the morning and hopefully get a recommendation for an excellent PS. Until then, I will have another sleepless night. Please keep us posted on your results. Good Luck To You!",
