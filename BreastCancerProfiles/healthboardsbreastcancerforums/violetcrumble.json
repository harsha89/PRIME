    "Content": "Hello all, I am 28 years old and recently, I have been experiencing pain on my right breast and I noticed a very small skin like thing protruding out of my nipples. It changes colour when I tried squeezing it (from red to white like colour), indicating that there must be somekind of thing in it, which I am not sure what. Despite of the size, it is causing a lot of discomfort even when wearing a bra. Should I be concern and seek professional opinion? I hope there is somebody out here who have experienced this to advice me. Cheers violetcrumble",
