I just had a mammogram and thank god everything is clear. But the pain is still there. Tuesday I have an appt. with a neurologist...we will see what he says. I am about to start my period, so maybe it is just hormones. It's never happened in the past. Damn aging! : )",

      "Content": "The neurologist thinks I have some trigger point pain in my neck and back that are referring pain to my ears...so he treated that with trigger point therapy (big needle!) and physical therapy, stretching etc for my back and neck. He also changed my antidepressant to Elavil, saying that healing comes with a good nights sleep. I've been on Elavil for 2 months and I can honestly say that I don't remember dreaming until now. After my little boy was born, 3 years ago, I really don't think I had a full night sleep. I would wake up 3 or 4 times a night and just lay there. It would also take me hours to get sleep. Elavil has been great for me. As far as the pain under my arms...it's gone. However, right before my period this month I could feel some minor pain under arms. Felt like lymph nodes but couldn't feel any lumps etc. After my annual gyno appt. I mentioned this to him and asked if it could all be hormonal and he said yes. Having said all this. I believe my aches and pains were from a mixed bag of things. Stress, lack of sleep, carrying a 10 lb brief case around, worry, anxiety...we will see how things work out. Has anyone else taken Elavil (I believe I'm spelling it right?)",

      "Content": "Hi folks, I've been having pain under my arms (mostly right) that sometimes radiates to my breast...for a week or two. It feels like it's running down my arm. My right shoulder is killing me as well. Before that the pain was up under my neck and chin. I've seen three dr.s and no one can feel any lumps. My bloodwork has come back fine. I'm grasping at straws here... what the heck is going on. They are hesitant to call it Fibromalygia(sp?). I was put on Zoloft because of my vast array of symptoms and anxiety that was coming from it. Could this med be doing this? Your thoughts are so very much needed.",
