    "Content": "Good afternoon. I'm new to this forum, and am hoping you can help. I had a phyllodes tumor removed in December. The surgery and recovery went very well, as I had amazing doctors. The only issue I am having now is the fact that the surgery left me noticeably uneven. On a day to day basis it doesn't bother me, but I am standing up in a friends wedding next month, and the style dress (which was purchased before the surgery) doesn't look right anymore. I was wondering if anyone knows of a product or anything that helps with this. Maybe some kind of insert? I've looked online, but have had no success in finding anything. I am hoping to go through reconstructive surgery in the future, but would love something to 'deal with the problem' in the meantime.",
