    "Content": "I hope this is the right forum to post this questioncause it was deleted out of another forum I thought would be the correct forum for it. I am wondering if any1 (fem) has experianced a loss of sensation in their breasts? I am very big breasted and have been a tummy sleeper all my life, however since I had my son 2.5 years ago my breast seem to have almost no sensetivity anymore. I breastfed my son for the 1st 3 months and I am not sure if that could have caused this or if their is some other underlying problem I should be concerned about? I have a VERY strong history of Breast Cancer in my family which is why this is concering me now. I don't do breast self checks and never have cause I quite frankly to scared to do it!! Thank U",
