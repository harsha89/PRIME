      "Content": "Georgie, Thanks for your reply. It was reassuring. I'm sure all of this stuff I'm experiencing is just me being in my 40s. I have a breast cyst, cervical dysplasia, cervictis, an endometrial polyp, an ovarian cyst and now a suspicious mole to have removed. I'm not particularly reassured since most of those conditions have to be monitored over time or removed. Hence, the doctor shuffle. I'll see the breast surgeon just to get their blessing that everything is ok. The last radiology report said the same cyst had returned so I asuuming they're right but who knows. Mamabear",

      "Content": "I posted this question in early Sept and NO ONE responded. I'll try again. If you have a cyst aspirated and then it refills 6 months later back to the old size (2+ cm), does that indicate a problem? Has anyone had that happen?? I asked my GYN and she referred me to a breast surgeon. She said something could be irritating it (?). The DX mammo I had in August said it was benign and just follow-up with my doc. I'm tired of being shuffled around to different doctors (for recent GYN problems). I'll go to the surgeon if necessary, but I wasn't too worried about this until the GYN was. If you can help, thanks!! Mamabear",

      "Content": "I know what you mean! I remember about 3 years ago I had an US. of my entire breasts. They kept focusing in on various cysts and taking lots of pictures. I was told make sure to see your doctor! The report said everything was benign. This last mammo I was told be sure to see your doctor but the report said the cyst was benign and I thought: what is she going to add after 2 days ago (I had just seen her)? So I waited a month, switched doctors and she seemed very concerned. Anyway, my appt is Oct 12. Its the first of many appts I have coming up. I feel like my body is falling apart!",

      "Content": "Hi Georgie, I had my appt. I had a 1 1/2 inch. oval cyst. The doc aspirated it and sent the fluid to the lab. It was the same cyst, returned. She doubts it's cancer because there was no blood in it and the cyst was perfectly symmetric. Hopefully that's the end of it! Have a good weekend. Mamabear",
