    "Content": "Hi 8 weeks ago I pressed on my left breast and there was a mild pain (kinda like pressing on a bruise) so I checked for a lump which there wasn't. Since then everyday I've poked and prodded at my self (I suffer with health anxiety) and the pains there most of the time when I press although not always if that makes sense. Every so often my rib underneath the left breast hurts when pressed too. I have no lumps,dents,pitting,rashes,inverted nipple,nipple discharge,swelling redness or anything like that just this pain. Sometimes it at the side of my breast other times it's underneath and sometimes on my nipple. I'm 28 a smoker,I have rather large breasts,slightly over weight,drink alot of cola and my diet is rubbish. I was just wondering if anyone has had the same or similar or if anyone knows what this could possibly be? I don't want a diagnosis just possibilities what it could be as with my anxiety I've pretty much convinced myself I've got breast cancer. I'm so scared! I have an appointment for Monday with the doctor.",
