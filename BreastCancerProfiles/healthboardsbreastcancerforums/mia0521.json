    "Content": "I read your concerns and I would highly recommend you go and get it checked out. I would not recommend a mammogram because if it cancerous, mammograms have a tendency to trigger aggravation. I would recommend thermography, very safe and does not give off radiation. I advise you to get it checked because I found a pie size lump in my upper left breast, went to have it checked and was misdiagnosed. 2 years later it grew and when I went back it was diagnosed as a malignant tumor. I am now healing from it as we speak through alternative medicine. I choose not to go through chemo and radiation. However, do not panic, for this may not be the case with you. Whatever the result, trust that it can be resolved. I wish you the best and although I don't know you, I pray that you follow up on it and all is goes well. Warmest Regards",
