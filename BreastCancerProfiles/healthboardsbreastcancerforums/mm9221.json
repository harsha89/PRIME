      "Content": "I have a lump on the edge of my breast going into the armpit. I've had this for at least five years. When I had the mammogram and US five years ago, it didn't show up. What did show up were microcalcifications. I was breastfeeding at the time. At the end of April this year, I had a blood transfusion because I was severely anemic. To that point, my periods were lasting about a day. I am no longer anemic and feeling much better as a result. Now, I haven't been real good about self-exam since five years ago, but now that I'm having real periods, I decided to check last week. Not only was the lump there feeling bigger, but it did not go down as it has in past months. That area feels quite lumpy compared to my left breast and armpit. I thought I could call my doc and get the referral straight to the place that does mammograms around here. NOPE! I went in today and his comment was, \"This is ....not sure of word....like a spindle with a top and bottom. It's bigger/wider than I'm comfortable with.\" So, I'm getting the mammogram and US; however, he has already explained that even if those come back normal, that I will probably end up consulting with a surgeon and possibly get a biopsy. I can't find specific information related to lumps that are like spindles----two threads attached. ANYONE have an idea about this and what the possible significance is? I want to know. Thanks for any information you are willing to share!!!!! Elaine",

      "Content": "I think the fact that is attached bothers me the most. It moves which is supposed to lean towards benign, but I have a feeling about this lump. It's little and pretty tough feeling. I have another odd mass---no regular shape close to it in the same breast. I'm about midcycle, so that could be it. I am following my instincts. I will probably ask for a biopsy no matter what, but I'm going to see what they come up with first. Good luck on Monday Beppie!",

The good thing is that if they give a little and you feel them on both sides, then it's probably something like cysts. Hang in there until Thursday. It's natural to feel scared, but you'll make it through if you take it one day at a time. Elaine",

      "Content": "Thanks Beppie1, With this, I really don't know what to expect. My father's mother died from metastasized breast cancer and my mother's sister had a total mastectomy, but has survived into her 70's. So, I know the chance is there. I just don't want to be blindsided from the possibilities. Thanks so much! Elaine",

      "Content": "When I was 19 I found a lump in my breast. It was at a spot right above my areola. It was solid as well. My gyn sent me on to the surgeon the same day he saw me. That was scary!!! At that time, they weren't doing mammograms (would have been unusual at my age anyway). I had it removed pretty quickly. It was a fibroadenoma. Nothing to be concerned about. The US government has quite a bit of information about cancer. I too have had relatives with breast cancer. My aunt had a mastectomy in her 30's, but is in her 70's now. Since breast cancer is rare in young women, try to stay focused on the positive. The good news is you won't have to wait too long to get things figured out. Elaine",

      "Content": "I'm a bit frustrated and I'm curious about what has happened to others after this. I found a lump at the beginning of July that was spindle-shaped and attached. Since I was going on vacation at the middle of July, I was on the cancellation list, but I couldn't get the mammo then US scheduled until last week then today. From what I could tell by what the radiologist told the techs, the microcalcifications were stable and a cyst they found in 2003 is stable. However, he agreed with my doc that I needed the US. Today, the tech doing my US found cysts in the breast, but not the lump that my doctor and I felt. She found them all around the place. To me, the lump feels very deep and the cysts are closer to the surface. Now what? My doc told me that US and mommogram doesn't always pick up the lumps. Am I looking at some kind of biopsy now? What have you all experienced in this case? I'm uncomfortable about them not being able to find the lump and I know it's there. Help!!!! Any insight you have is welcome. I see my doc tomorrow. Thanks, Elaine",
