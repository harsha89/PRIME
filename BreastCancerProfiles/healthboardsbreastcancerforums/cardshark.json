    "Content": "No, you should not be concerned! It is actually pretty common for some women to have denser breasts & doctor's to do ultrasound with the mammogram/instead of mammogram. I am in my early 30's, have family history of breast cancer & am a childhood cancer survivor & each time I have had a mammogram I have also had an ultrasound of my breasts along with it because I have dense breasts- they can actually see more details with the ultrasound than the mammogram anyway. For example, if someone has a mammogram done & it shows an abnormal mass a lot of the time they will order an ultrasound done because they can see if the mass is filled with fluid such as a cyst or if it is solid material like a tumor. There is no need to worry nor be concerned- just be thankful your doctor is on top of things & acknowledging that you have denser breasts & knows the ultrasound will be more likely to show an accurate picture!",
