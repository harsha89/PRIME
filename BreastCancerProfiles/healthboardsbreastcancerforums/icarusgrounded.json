    "Content": "One of the things the doctors don't tell you is if you have fibrocystic breast disease, it is sometimes difficult for them to see the cancer with a mammogram. Also, some forms of breast cancer are more aggressive than others. I have also read that there is no way to tell if it's a cyst or cancer you are dealing with unless they can aspirate some fluid out with a needle or cut it out and examine it under a microscope. With mine, all the doctors were sure it was nothing, and didn't even want to perform a biopsy. They did, and it was cancer. Even the radiologist said it \"looked totally benign\" to him. My advice would be not to wait. Bless You. Best Wishes.",
