    "Content": "Hi there. I have been experiencing a pain under my left breast, also right where the bra strap would be. I took the wire out from a few of my bras, but I am still having that sharp pain. It seems like no matter what type of bra I am wearing, I am uncomfortable. By the way, I am 26, and am a C cup. Have you talked to your doc? Anything help you? If so, please post. I'd like to know. Good luck.",
