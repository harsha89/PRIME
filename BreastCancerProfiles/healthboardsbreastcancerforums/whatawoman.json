      "Content": "I am 35 years old, a single mum with a special needs teenager and 3 year old daughter- I had a small peas sized hard lump in the lower part of my left armpit - it had been there a while but suddenly changed shape and size so my GP sent me to a breast consultant to ahve it checked out. She ordered a mamogram and an Ultrasound but said she didn't think it was anything to worry about. I have large breasts size 34GG and they are quite dens tissue wise so I often have a little heaviness or tenderness - especially during ovulation and menstration times. The mamogram was uncomfortable but not painful. The scan revealed that the lump was nothing to worry abot BUT they found a large mass deep within my armpit/breast and said it looked sinsiter - they were 90% sure it needed further urgent investigation. I have been sent an appointment for a XR Mammo guided core biopsey for 13th June (seems a lifetime away). Of course my mind flits between it being okay and it being cancer. I am making plans for my children incase I need surgery and/or treatment. Every day seems to drag. During all this time my right breast has not even been examined. Well yesterday (29th May) my right breast was swollen, and very tender - and the lymph nodes in my arm were very swollen and it hurt to lift my arm. I went straight to my GP who was very concerned she called my Breast Consultant's secretary and found out that the consultant is on leave till Tuesday. So she put me on a course of anti biotics just in case it is an infection somewhere and I had a full blood count, bone and liver blood test taken with a 48 hour result put on it - I went back to my GP today and it is negative for any infection and my FBC was all within normal ranges. So I am wondering what people think might be going on? Has anyone had similar symptoms? Also having anormal blood count - does that mean I don't have cancer?[ Thanks",

      "Content": "Everything in my breast was benign but now they are looking into hormonal problems possibly related to my ovaries that are causing, dense inflammed breast tissue and to begin with I am having a mirena coil fitted to 'turn my ovaries off'. When I am ovulating I get very very heavy and tender breasts and it is during this time that my lymph nodes are becoming enlarged. Good luck with your own investigations Helen",
