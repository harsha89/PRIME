I already have a lot of benign tumors in my breasts (about 50 pea sized tumors in the underside of each breast, and a few thumb-sized tumors in the upper halves). Any diagnosis or info yet anyone?",

      "Content": "I am pretty sure that it's not mammary duct ectasia, that's usually associated with menopause-aged women, and is usually accompanied by pain, an inverted nipple, and a lump or redness. Any other ideas? Most disorders generally site discharge from the actual nipple. All I know is that I'm kinda scared, and a little worried, and a whole lotta confused.",
