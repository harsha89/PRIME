      "Content": "i was dx with Stage2 B Breast Cancer in 2002. i had large3 tumors, and the surgery ended up taking almost half my breast. my margins were clear, although it was almost borderline.i had A/C chemo, 33 rads, 4 of 14 nodes were positive. i took tamoxifen for 2 years, then switched health insurance and started with a new oncologist. He said, because of the aggressiveness of my cancer, he'd prefer that i take Femara. i took that for 1.5 yrs until money ran short, and i had to stop femara. Now that i'm financially back on track, i see the oncologist soon. What do you think the odds are that i will be done with the Femara? and of course, in the back of my mind, is my cancer going to come back, because i didnt really complete either the Femara or Tamoxifen?",

I kept fans close by.. handheld, and electric. we invested in a small a/c from Walmart for 90 bucks. i dressed in layers, because i was hot AND cold. my heat came from the outside in. when someone saw clothes flying off me, fans instantly came on, people would fan me. cooperation from everyone in the family was wonderful. I had a/c chemo, rads, was on Tamox and Femara. My menopause was chemo induced (i was 46). And really, i know it may seem difficult, but it will help you to have a sense of humor. oh, and water. keep water nearby!",

Cancer back again but concerned about the potential life threatening side effects. Thanks for your time. i didnt have one problem with either Tamoxifen or Femara.i was 46 when i started Tamoxifen. Of all of the drugs i have ever taken (diabetes, migraines etc) i have never had an adverse reaction to any of them.",

Laura i had my surgery in May 2002. started chemo at the end of july. 8 treatments. i started radiation in feb (so if i remember it was just a couple months after chemo). i had to wait a bit for my chemo, because i had failed sentinal node, so they took out 14 nodes and i was left with a pretty big scar there, and two big scars from my lumpectomy and biopy. maybe you could ask why you have to wait so long.",
