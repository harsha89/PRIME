No chemo is planned. I am already on hormone therapy--Arimidex. My various doctors all urge radiation since it would help prevent recurrence in that breast. But radiation does not increase survival rate. I'm worried about the side effects of radiation--lung scarring, fragile ribs, who knows what else. All my naturapath friends say no to radiation, of course. All my mainstream friends assume a yes. I seem to be trapped in the middle ground. Anybody out there who can help or who has gone through this? Would really appreciate hearing from another agonizer about this decision. (Also, has anyone had experiencw with a prone breast board? that's one in which the patient lies face down, breasts going through some cut-outs, thus reducing the amount of radiation to internal organs, etc.) Atid I had a lumpectomy followed by chemo and radiation in my left breast 16 years ago. Seven months ago I found a large lump under my right arm. My cancer came back in the breast that was radiated, by-passed my right breast and spread to my lymph nodes under my right arm. I had all the tests to find out that it has not spread past the lymph nodes. My case is very unusual. All cases are different. My radiation did not prevent a recurrance, but it did complicate the double mastectomy I had in December. Radiated skin will not heal. I had to have a flap of skin and muscle taken from my back to cover the hole in my left chest when my breast was removed. The radiated tissue had to be removed down to the chest wall. I also had a skin graft, but it's still not enough to replace all the tissue distroyed by radiation. I'll have to have another flap surgery from my belly after I'm done with chemo. Luckily, at my age I have plenty of flabby skin for flaps! You need to do what you feel best, and have doctors that you can trust. Get 2nd opinions if you feel the need to do that.",

My mom died of breast cancer in 1980; she put off getting a lump checked out because my dad had had a heart attack. By the time she was diagnosed, it was already in her lungs. I am really scared. Has anyone else had to have the MRI under similiar circumstances that turned out to be negative? I had breast cancer treated by lumpectomy, chemo and radiation on the left side in 1990, 16 years ago. I found a large lump under my right arm 7 months ago and had a needle biopsy, which came back positive for cancer. It had been so many years since my first cancer that I thought I was home free. I've had an MRI, bone scan, all the tests which show that my new cancer has not spread past my lymph nodes on the right side. I've had a double mastectomy and I'm on chemo now. My case is unusual, as my tumor came back in the left breast-the original site, by-passed the right breast and spread only to the lymph nodes on the right side. If I had followed my doctors advice and had my regular follow-up exams, this might not have happened. As it is, I'm very lucky that my new cancer has not spread farther. I would advise you to have the MRI. Don't wait. You already have a history and it's always better to know for sure.",
