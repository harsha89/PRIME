    "Content": "Well, as we get older (51), health problems seem to creep up on us and I'm no exception. I went for a routine screening mammogram yesterday and they saw a cluster of calcifications on one breast. I'll give a short history in a nutshell. I've never had problems with my past mammograms with the exception of fibercystic breasts a few years back. My older sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 56. My aunt had BC also. So you can see where my fear lies. They wanted to do a biopsy next Tuesday but I pushed them to do it today. Im scared about everything...the problem, the biopsy, the waiting...everything. normally I am always the strong one but yesterday my world changed and I was paralyzed by fear. She drew a pattern of what the calcifications looked like and they werent all connected together but rather side by side or sporadically in a curved line. What does that mean? I never know what I can trust reading 8n the internet. Thanks for all your help!",
