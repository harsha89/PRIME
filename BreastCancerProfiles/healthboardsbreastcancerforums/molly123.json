      "Content": "Hi epse, I had breast calcifications in my right breast. At the follow-up, they took more pics. Then said to come back in 6 mos., which I did. From there, it didn't change much and maybe there were a few more. They did a biopsy, it came back benign. Thank goodness! Then they wanted to surgically remove some tissues of it, so I did have that done too. It came back benign and I did couple of dr.'s checkup after that just for him to check how I was healing, etc. Apparently, calcifications is not a lump of some kind - it's \"powder\" like so they couldn't tell me the size of them. But, it looks just like little white dots on the x-rays. And, there's nothing you can do to prevent them nor did you do anything to get them. After all this, I was told to come back for a mammo yearly. By the way, the surgical biopsy was easier than the first biopsy they did on me. If you're interested in knowing more, I can dig up my paperwork and repost it). It is definitely very important that you go for the follow-up and do what they advise! I know it is scary whenever you hear they suspect something from your mammo! They gave me brochures on calcifications and it did say that about 98% of the cases are benign. So think positive and try not to worry! molly",

      "Content": "Hi, I just had a MRI done this morning on my left breast. I too was very worried about being claustrophobic but it's not that bad. I laid on my stomach with my breasts through these holes. My feet was in first so that means it's in the inside of the machine and my head was towards the outside so I'm facing into the room. I found tilting my head a little to the side with a pillow helped - otherwise, you're neck gets tired. You wear a gown and they gave me a pair of cotton elastic pants to wear too. Have to take off any jewelry, no cell phones, no metals. The machine is huge - looks like a huge space capsule or the end of a dump truck! LOL! When they are doing the MRI, they tell you not to move and since it's the breast area, you basically can't move from your shoulders down. There is a lot of loud noise going on - hammering, jackhammering, knocking, banging sounds! The tech gave me earplugs but I could still hear it all and can hear her talking to me. She never told me I had to hold my breath - just not reminded me to not move around. She did have this IV thing in me where she later injected some kind of saline solution - said it allows them to read some of the scans with it and without it. The whole laying down lasted about 1/2 hour only. I usually try to get the very first appointment so I'm not home waiting for my appt. to come plus being the first gets you in and out quicker. Hope this helps, molly Quote: Originally Posted by sobs Hi folks My friend had bc 5 years ago.

Do you go in feet first? Is your head in or out of the machine (claustrophobic issues)? I also read one post here that someone laid on her stomach and they had two holes for each breast. She wanted an open MRI, but the docs told her that they do not \"read\" the breasts well enough. Can someone PLEASE let me know the procedure and description of the machine, body/head position, etc.. Thanks a lot! sobs",

      "Content": "Hi chocolatesprinkle, That's it - I had the stereotactic needle biopsy done first too. It's pretty simple procedure but can be very uncomfortable because I had to lay on my stomach the whole time and was told not to move at all. After a while (about 45 mins), my neck started hurting (even tho they gave me a pillow). Things were benign with me. I later had a surgerical biopsy done where they removed some tissues to make double sure and that procedure was actually easier. I think it best to get a biopsy of your microcalcifications to be sure and I would make them check into the swelling of the armpits too. Take care, molly",

      "Content": "Hi , This is my first post on this particular board. Just wanted to get some reassurance that things aren't as bad as I'm making them out to be. I had a mammo last year which showed calcifications on my right breast. Went back and had the area magnified and was told to come back in 6 mos, which I did, which happened just couple of weeks ago. I was told that I had couple of more small calcifications and I could come back in 6 mos but instead they suggested doing a stereotactic biospy and it's probably benign. Had that done and was diagnosed as benign. Then I'm recommended to have the calcifications removed just to make sure which means just an outpatient surgery/biopsy. The nurse practioner said the dr. was suspicious w/what he saw on the mammo and that it was \"discordant\" with the benign results that is why its recommended that I have it removed for further testing. I've heard of false-postive but is there such a thing as false-negative? I met w/ the surgeon and he tells me what that's involved and that it's probably 90% benign. Am I worrying for nothing? Thanks for any input or shared experiences, molly",

      "Content": "hi smithn, thanks for responding. You made me feel better. I am scheduled to have it done (removed) next week. I guess since I had the stereotactic biopsy done already and it was benign, I shouldn't think things always have to be bad when they recommended this surgery/biopsy. I'm such a worry wart!! The surgeon does seem experienced, an older man, and if he said it's likely 90% benign I have to trust what he said and 90% is fairly high. I am scheduled to meet w/him 2 days after in his office. My stereotactic biopsy path report said: \"Benign non-proliferative fibrocystic change (primarily microcyst formation). 11o'clock right breast core biopsies. Comment: Biopsies are quite bland in appearance and probably a histologic correlate to calcifications is small crystals in association with microcyst formation; more blunt duct adenosis-type changes.\" Much appreciated, molly",

      "Content": "katsmee, thanks for sharing your experience. I realize also how fortunate I am that they are being thorough with me. Even tho my results came back benign, I just have a tendency to worry the worse. I have been in menopause this past year and I don't know if it has anything to do with the califications that showed up this year esp. since last year's mammo was fine. I am so glad you are doing well. It is always nice to hear someone having good results and surviving something as bad as breast cancer. Be well, molly",

      "Content": "Thanks, Anna! You're right, just the fact that it is so small that they couldn't even do a biopsy is a good sign! They said there isn't a lump or anything they can feel. I just have to keep reminding myself otherwise I get myself all worked up with anxiety and worry! Re-reading your posts, did you get your results back or did you just have the biopsy? molly Quote: Originally Posted by anna317 Good luck to you, Molly! Let me know how will the things turn out.

      "Content": "Anna, First of all, it's great that things turned out good for you. congrats! How weird, I too have \"some area of concern\" that showed up on my left breast on the mammogram and the ultrasound. Went in for a biopsy and whatever it was that they saw was so small that they couldn't do a biopsy on it afterall. There is no lump, can't feel anything. But now I'm scheduled for a MRI tomorrow - kinda worried but at the same time want to be positive. Wish me luck! molly Quote: Originally Posted by anna317 Just wanted to share with you good news and encourage those who are still in suspence! Last week I had excisional bipsy of my left breast (the MRI showed \"the area of concern\" of about 0.9 cm, neither mammogram nor ultrasound could see my lump, which was very pulpitable). The biopsy itself was far less scary than what I was imagining myself, I did not need even Tylanol after the first night. So, don't be scared! I was going nuts for the last almost three months over this lump, time to time almost convinced I had cancer! The biggest lesson I learned: don't worry about something to happen untill it really happened! Easier said than done (you have a queen of anxiety here!). But I think you learn that, you just don't have enough energy any more to worry about everything life brings your way untill you sure it is something worth worring about. I feel that way now at least. Good luck to all of you!",
