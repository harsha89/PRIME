      "Content": "Hi everyone, I've been reading the posts and have a lot of respect for the ladies here. Your strength is amazing. I admire you all. My whole experience has really enlightened me as to how many women are affected by breast cancer--and how scary it is! In early November, I visited my GYN for my yearly exam and nothing was felt. However, on November 16th I accidentally discovered a lump behind my nipple. I went back to the GYN and she still could not feel the lump. That's because she did not check the nipple area! Why not?! After I showed her where it was, she felt it. She told me it was nothing to worry about, but ordered an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed an abnormal mass behind the nipple. I was then referred to a General Surgeon who recommended a Core Biopsy. He said he didn't recommend removal (unless it was cancerous) since the lump was in such a \"precarious\" location. I had the Biopsy on Dec. 4th and am waiting for the results. I'm posting here for a couple reasons: * Support from women who can relate is always helpful. * I also plan to update this thread once I receive the results (as this can help other women who may experience something similar). Thank you for reading! Shellie",

      "Content": "My biopsy results came back--non-Cancerous. I'm waiting to talk to the surgeon to see if he thinks it should be removed or not. I have a new awareness now about how many women are dealing with breast cancer--and how scary it must be. The strength they possess is amazing. God bless you all! Shellie",
