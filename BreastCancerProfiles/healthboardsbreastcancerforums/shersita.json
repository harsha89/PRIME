    "Content": "Hello there Terrie. Is completely normal to be worried when we have some new symptom in our bodies. When I was 25 years old one day without a reason I felt one of my nipples itching like you, so I touch it, when I did I also found a crust next to my nipple in the aerola, the crust was like 3 or 4 cms of size (sorry, I know it sounds disgusting), I have never in my life had any itching or crust in neither of my nipples so I got very scared and worried I remember, even if I was 25 only I know breast cancer currently happens even to young women of 20 years old. I search on internet about crust + itching on a nipple and everything point to \"paget cancer\" even with pictures, the crust on all paget cancer pictures looked exactly like mine, so I got more scared, my nipple was also flat not inverted, instead it was flat like you said with the aerola. I did went to the doctor extremely worried, and finally my problem was not paget cancer, was a fungus infection in one of my nipples, and here I am today I,m 32 years old healthy women. Internet search sometimes point always to the deadliest disease always, even if maybe what you really have is simple, if you search on internet finger pain all results will point out to \"cancer\". I recommend to you to not worried too much, and first visit the doctor and have another mammogram to ease your mind, if you,re very ansioux and can,t wait 30 days you can paid for the mammogram at least, just to make sure everything is clear.",
