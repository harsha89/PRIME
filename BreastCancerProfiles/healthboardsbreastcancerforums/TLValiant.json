    "Content": "While I have not experienced this myself, my mother did as did my aunt. My mother turned out to have breast cancer but they caught it when it was still stage 1. She starts her radiation therapy this month in fact. My aunt also got called back because of some of the films did not turn out as they wished. She had a 2nd mammogram and she was perfectly fine. I guess you do not know for sure until you get up there and have another mammogram. I know it is stressful, it was for both my mom and my aunt as they waited to go back. I hope I was able to help.
