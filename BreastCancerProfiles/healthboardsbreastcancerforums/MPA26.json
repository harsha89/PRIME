    "Content": "I am 26 years old and am experiencing pain in my right breast. I have an appt with the dr on Wednesday but am just looking for some reassurance from anyone who has experienced this. It has been going on for a few months now off and on. It is on the lower outer side of my right breast and hurts to push on it in a certain spot. I do not feel any lumps and cannot tell if it is my actual breast that hurts or if it is from the bone behind my breast as it seems to hurt the most when I push it down and can feel the bone. It hurts really bad right now from me mashing on it so hard but I wanted to make sure I couldn't feel any lumps and I don't. I'm worried about what the dr will say. There is no history of BC in my family but still you never know. Has anyone had this before and what did it turn out to be?",
