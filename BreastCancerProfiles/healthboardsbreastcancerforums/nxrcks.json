      "Content": "Hello everyone, I was hoping someone may be able to help me out... I will give you some background.. I am 32 years old and I have been been getting yearly mammograms since I was 30. My Mother had her 1st bout with Breast Cancer at 38-40 years old... her 2nd at 55. My Baseline mammogram, they found calcifications and they did a biopsy, everything was clear. I went last Thursday for my yearly mammo, and this time they say they have found a high density mass. I have been searching the internet for some information ( I spoke to the nurse at my Dr. office, and she really didn't have many answers for me) Has anyone heard of this?? I cannot really find out any info on what this could be?? I am going in for an ultrasound on Monday, and if they see something a MRI... Can anyone help me out?? Thanks, Dee",
