      "Content": "I had breast cancer 3 years ago with bilateral mast and reconstruction. My breast surgeon told me to massage the scar and use Mederma or other cream for scars. My right side is basically ok but the left side scar has hypertrophied and is raised and more red. I would not have known about what to do, except that every time the surgeon exams me for follow-up, she comments on the area and how I should use those txs. - the funny thing is she is so concerned about it, but I could care less. - only myself and husband sees it anyway, so who cares?! BUT, I could see for you if the scar tissue is hurting, you would wan't to fix it. Best of luck. Leea",

      "Content": "I have not had any major emotional issues but plenty of hot flashes, joint problems like i'm 85 yrs old, instead of 50, amoung other things. I am not surprised though, about all the different side effect women go through, on the aromatase inhibitors, like Armidex. - As I understand it, these drugs, cut off nearly all our estrogen, which is a good thing for any possible estrogen positive stray cancer cells, but not such a good thing for our body systemically. I've read estrogen helps with mood, bones, heart health, blood pressure, vag dryness, joints, skin and of course hot flashes. - It's no wonder so many of us don't feel like ourselves on these drugs!

      "Content": "Hi Shelly Sorry you are going though this. I know many, many women get call-backs and it turns out NOT to be breast cancer. They check out many things that are even slightly suspcious just to be on the safe side. Even if they found a lump, 80% of lumps are NOT breast cancer either. The odds are in your favor that it will be ok. Thoughts and prayers with you. Leea",

      "Content": "I could only speak in general. After looking at your report. It appears that in general, any potential abnormalities were attributed to other beneign conditions, except the sternal lesion. Even then, the sternal lesion was most likely another condition. The report states possible follow-up with a CT scan. Does your doctor think that is necessary? In general MRI's pick up every little thing so they address each potential abnormal feature. but the report also says no masses, no thickening etc., which sounds reassuring. Usually breast cancer grows very slowly, so even if there was a problem, a one year follow-up for an MRI is probably per protocol. But you could get a 2nd opinion for piece of mind. Do you have a hx of breast cancer in your family? Good luck. I am a survivor, so know these tests and reports can be scary.",

      "Content": "I went to Florida with my family 4 wks after a bilateral mastectomy. I was told not to go in the pool or ocean from the waist up d/t chance of infection. Also I was to keep the chest area completely covered as sun damage could inhibit healing. I was still able to have a pretty decent time. I just wore a coverup on top and still managed to get a little sun and beach/pool time. Just had to be more careful that year and couldn't swim of course. Good luck with your surgery. Leea",

      "Content": "I had double mast a little over 3 years ago. How much rest are you getting? I remember feeling very energetic the 1st 24hrs, but then when I got home I was much more tired. I did fairly well in the morning but needed a long nap each afternoon. I think because, I took naps each day and didn't do much, I felt pretty decent in 2 wks, but everyone recovers differently. The biggest thing I did during the recoup was go to a movie with my sister, drains and all. I agree, I think stress has a huge impact on fatigue. I don't know if visualization, relaxation techniques would help. I do know alot of ladies dxed with breast cancer get a script for a short course of anti-anxiety meds, only when you need it. - I did this myself before I did my breast reconstruction, 7 mths after the masts, because I was terrified to have another surgery. I only took it once in awhile but it was nice to know I had it, if I needed it. It might help if you think you are not getting enough sleep or can't relax. Your righ, the whole experience is surreal but you will get through it. Best of luck. Leea",
