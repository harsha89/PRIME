Mammograms pick up calicifications that US don't. This mobile lump you feel could simply be a cyst. The positive knowledge here is that most breast lumps/masses are benign. Have your mammogram done soon. If it doesn't clarify a diagnosis then I would ask for an US. It sounds like your doctor is right on the ball with this. Be sure that you do your monthly self-breast exams to keep track of any future changes.",

While it's uncommon for a woman in her teens to have breast cancer, it is not uncommon for one to have it at 28. You positively need that second opinion and that lump positively needs to be aspirated at that office visit. You need to see a general surgeon who can perform an aspiration at this same initial visit. If he is able to obtain fluid from it, then it's a cyst. If not, then it doesn't mean it's a cancer, but it's more worrisome for cancer and needs to be excised.",

I am having a particularly bad day, because of the blood discharge last night, and also just generally, for whatever reason, came across a lot of negative information on the internet. I went to google and typed in what the doctor had written on my order, which was 'bloody discharge and right subareolar density'....and there was some good information on things I hope it might be, such as the papilloma, or ectatic duct, but there was lots of scary scenarios as well, such as invasive cancer being on the list of possibliites. [BThe list of possibilities and scenarios are endless for anything and anyone, really. You should be as positive in your thinking as you can be and try as hard as you can to get a grip on your worrying until a doctor gives you good reason to. This far, there isn't an indication at all that you have a cancer so you have to hold onto that. KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE as much as you can, okay?[/B] You make me feel so good when you suggest that it will put my mind at ease, because that suggests that you think it would be good news. I'm trying to be positive around my kids, but it's hard. My eleven year old of course dosen't know anything, but as you said, I'm sure notices my anxiety. I have a 20 year old son, and an 18 year old daughter, and I do talk to them about it. I'm actually shaky inside I'm so nervous about it. The thing is, my husband is here now, but he commutes in on the weekends from the Northeast, and so he absolutely has to fly back tomorrow afternoon, so unless I want to put my 18 year old daughter through this with me, I'll be going alone to the appointment on Tuesday, and that kind of scares me, if it's bad news. Like you said, I don't even know if the doctor will talk to me, but the GYN suggested he would. If you need someone to go along with you, then I don't see a reason why you shouldn't take your 18 year old daughter with you. I think it would give her a good experience and make her realize how important it is to do monthly self-breast exams and maintain good follow up for herself. SHe's at an age where she should be doing this also! Some people might not agree with me, but my own kids are involved in all family matters in our household - good and bad. We want them to be aware that there is good and bad in the world and that we can share all of the times, together as a family. By sharing this with your daughter, you are making her feel needed, making her aware, and helping to build her inner strength. As far as Tuesday is concerned, you aren't going to have an exact answer either way. You'll have to wait for your films to be read. Thank you soooo much for the advice about the General Surgeon. I can't thank you enough, this could end up making a difference saving my life! I looked it up in my yellow pages, and didn't see any doctors that specialize in that, so I guess I have to call my GYN and get a referral, right? I would assume for a specialist like that, it might take a while to get in. I was wondering, and I'm so sorry to keep bugging you.....I don't know how I could ever repay you!~ But, my appointment at the hospital for the mammogram and ultrasound starts at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday, so there is no time before the appointment to contact my GYN....but do you think I should just still go and do these tests at this place? It's at the local hospital here, where they do all the mammograms, stuff like that. I guess it's kind of a women's center, but I know they do alot of different imaging there. I was wondering if you think I should wait and see the General Surgeon first, and do the tests with him, maybe somewhere else that he prefers. I am worried about the radiologist talking to me, and making me even more nervous, because, as you said, these guys are not specialists and might make things worse for me in the short run. I truly believe getting opinions from a surgeon have saved many, many lives. There's nothing worse than have a doctor not being able to identify what a breast lump actually is and then they have you wait 3-6 months for a follow up mammogram. I think this is so wrong! You do need the referral to most general surgeons (not all) but it would be in your best interest to have the GYN make the referral for you in terms of your insurance company covering this. Just call your GYN's office and tell them that you would like a \"surgical consult\" and would like them to make you an appt. with one. Becaue you are symptomatic, it should not take long at all for you to get in to see one. Yes, you should go and have your mammogram and US done at the time and place it is already scheduled. You simply take your films along with you to your appt. with the surgeon. They'll all take good care of you. So, you have made me feel so much better, without you, I would really be a mess. Really, with all the negative stuff I've read today, I keep reading your letter over, and feel reassured. I am happy to be here for you but you know, with or without me you will do just fine! I'm like you in that I need to talk about it when things bother me or when I'm in certain situations. Many of us need that! I'm not a negative thinking person - ever. And honestly, if a doctor told me I had breast cancer, I don't see that as the end of the world at all! The majority of the woman that have breast cancers have caught them in time and have been totally cured. It's not like it use to be years ago. Science and Medicine have come a long way in terms of testing and treatments. So, to sum up, even though it's unilateral, bloody, and spontaneous, it's still very possible to be benign....but that you think it's serious enough to see a general surgeon because of the fact that it can be coming from a possible cancer, right? Yes, it's very possible it's benign. I think you need to see the surgeon because you need an answer regarding exactly what the reason is for the discharge and a GYN cannot give you this. You not only need the reason, but you need to know what your options are in resolving this. You shouldn't have to go around with nipple discharge. Also, I think that the surgeon will recommend removing that duct or possibly doing a biopsy of the density. If the dense area cannot be completely explained, then I think that you should expect this (a biopsy) - this would be a good thing! I forgot to mention that, to deal with the blood soaking through your PJ's and shirts, stick a mini-pan inside of your bra and it will help. Thanks for the great words of advice, they are in my head as I'm going to go and do something with my eleven year old. I just want to be here for her so bad, she really needs me, as her Dad travels all the time, and we don't have much family around here. I am so sorry to have taken up your time on this holiday weekend! You are an angel....Thanks so much, Val It's no problem at all. I'm here to talk with you. I also want to know how it goes for you tomorrow especially. Good or bad, I'll be here....... but I truly think it's going to be good!",

We camp right on the river - it's beautiful and the weather is just perfect this time of year. If I were you, I would call the GYN and ask for the referral to a general surgeon....now. Don't ask them if they think you should be referred, just tell them you WANT the referral and you want them to set it up now. Have the MRI done on Thursday as planned and then follow up with the surgeon. I would think he would send out a sample of the bloody discharge for Cytology and then schedule you for a simple surgery. Oftentimes, when nothing abnormal is found, the surgeon will simply follow a patient for discharge of this type but due to the amount and frequency of yours, you don't need to put up with that - there's no reason for you to have to wait. Your GYN doesn't know what the surgeon will do and neither does his nurse. They are in a different field altogether. Sounds like (within two days after your MRI) you are going to need to call your GYN's office and ask for your results yourself. It doesn't sound, to me, like the nurse is on top of things. When you see the surgeon, just make sure you don't say anything negative (to him) about the GYN or his office. It would be easy to do! These doctors are all colleagues who work with one another and talk among themselves about their patients and it would get back to your GYN, whom you are going to need to see in the future again at some point. By the way, have you had any bloodwork done? Good luck on Thursday! I'll be thinking about you!",

      "Content": "Bloody, unilateral discharge is NOT highly suggestive of it being a cancer. Plus, you have no family history of it. This is all in your favor. Think about this... if you have a papilloma, it only makes sense that the bleeding would have to come out of the nipple as there is no where else for it to go. Many women have this condition. Their nipples discharge blood spontaneously or it comes out whenever they pinch them. You also have to keep in mind that you are feeling the lumpy areas in your breast repeatedly and this can cause this condition to bleed more so than at other times. We have many women coming for regular follow up for this condition (they don't have cancer) and the discharge varies. Some have bloody discharge, some have yellowish-colored output and others even have black. Also keep in mind that most every woman has \"lumpy\" breasts. Breast tissue is glandular so it can change at any time. Your GYN is a good person to follow you with your regular breast health but he does not specialize in breast surgery whereas a general surgeon does. You need to see a general surgeon to evaluate this problem of yours, regardless of the outcome of your mammogram and ultrasound. If your film impressions don't determine the problem here, then your surgeon will (and should) send in a sample of the discharge for cytology. This wasn't done by your GYN because it's out of his field of expertise. Get the ball rolling by having your GYN's office make an appt. with the general surgeon now. Your film results will be ready by the time you see him and you can ease your mind. You aren't going to find peace with this until you have a definite answer and you need to get the opinion of the surgeon. I would do (and have done) this very same thing! It will ease your mind tremendously. You also need to stay positive and try to be strong. Stop beating yourself up for being overdue with your mammograms. It's done and in the past and you can't do anything about that so forget about it. The important thing here is that you now realize the importance of regular mammograms and check ups with your doctor. Also, you should perform monthly self-breast exams without fail. Doing this at the same time each month is a good idea. After you see the general surgeon, you will have become established with him. This will be a great thing for you because if you ever have any worrisome breast condition thereafter, you can bypass your GYN and make your appt. right with the surgeon who is now familiar with your breast health. For now, enjoy your weekend and don't let this ruin your labor day with your family. You want the best for your 11 year old and it isn't best if she is sensing your anxiety over this - and I'm certain that she notices. Tuesday will come soon enough and then it's going to take a few days to get your results, depending upon how swamped the radiologist is. If you haven't heard from your doctor's office three days past your mammogram and ultrasound, then call his office and ask his nurse for them. The only delay would be if if your films haven't been read or transcribed and she can call radiology and request that they do this. You also need to get copies of your own reports so that you can keep track of your health and see/read for yourself what's going on. Lean on your faith, Val. We're here for you as well!",

Also, it's all that much harder to breathe when you are nervous and you are (rightfully so). The Ductogram seems like the best plan in your case. I think though, that just consulting with the surgeon will make you feel a sense of comfort. They are so knowledgeable about breast disease/abnormalities that you will feel like you are in good hands. No, I don't think that this delay will effect your prognosis. Just go for the office consult with the surgeon and he'll guide you from there. PS. Men are so funny, aren't they! Can you just see a man in most of the situations we find ourselves in?!

When your surgeon told you to have an US done in a couple of months, he meant that your GYN (or whichever doctor orders your mammograms, etc.) should order this. Just call your GYN and ask them to schedule this for you and tell them you want a copy of the US report to go to your surgeon. I'm very happy for you that you haven't had any further bleeding. Don't forget to do your monthly self-breast exams too. It's so important to keep up on our own health. I remember in the early years of dating my husband, he was stationed in the Army in Texas for awhile and I flew to spend a week with him. I remember the heat was so sweltering I couldn't believe it! I had never been in that kind of heat and humidity before. We complain about the snow and cold here but really, it is great to have the four seasons. We had a beautiful evening on Halloween. The kids could actually wear their costumes without having to wear winter jackets over them! Christmas is now just right around the corner - my favorite time of the year! I even put our Christmas tree (artificial) up this past Sunday! I've been playing Christmas music and baked some cookies already! I love it so much. I make a lot of Chocolates also and give them to my favorite aunts as presents. It's such a fun, giving season! With our lives being so busy with our boys and our work, we haven't had the opportunity to travel much at all but this year, we wanted to do something big. We wanted to share a big, fun family vacation while all of the boys are still here (before they start graduating and going off to college). We are leaving in about 3 weeks to go on our first cruise ever! It's exciting for us! Our boys haven't even ever been on an airplane before. They have no idea! It's a five night Western Carribean Cruise. I'm as nervous as I am thrilled but you only live once and I want a great vacation for all of us to remember forever. Instead of going through a travel agent, I booked it entirely on my own and it made it very possible and affordable. I am hoping it goes well. I've been working my tail off at work to not only keep up but to get ahead of schedule as I can so that I can be ready to go when the time comes. I haven't had much free time for myself lately in trying to keep up with that and with the boys. They are into every sport imagineable so it keeps us running! You take care of yourself, Val. I've thought of you and wondered how you were doing. I'm glad things are going well for you and your family! Happy early Thanksgiving! I'm thankful for your friendship",

I say that because a general surgeon would not say that \"the radiologist will be talking to you\" as if the radiologist will be giving you your results. That's not typical at all. Also keep in mind that the technician doing the actual mammogram or ultrasound is not qualified to make any remark at all - on anything. They can actually lose their job on the spot for making any suggestion regarding your results. Typically, the tech performs the mamm, the radiologist reads the films and then faxes the report to your doctor, who then gives you your results. When results show a matter of concern, then the patient is referred to a general surgeon for his opinion. In your case, even if your mammogram comes back clear, I would highly recommend to you that you ask for a referral to a general surgeon who is very astute in this field. It's always best to be safe. I am also thinking you are dealing soley with your GP right now because intraductal papillomas are not at all rare by any means. Intraductal papillomas rarely turn out to be a cancer, is what he should have said. You really need a general surgeon's opinion. Bloody nipple discharge is also a symptom of DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). This means that in a part of the breast the cells lining the milk ducts (the channels in the breast that carry milk to the nipple) are cancerous, but stay contained within the ducts without growing through into the surrounding breast tissue. This is a \"safe\" cancer and one of the best kinds to have. All things considered this far, I sincerely don't think this is going to turn out to be a cancer for you. Good luck to you on Tuesday.

I really wouldn't be o.k. without you, I am telling you, the only really positive things I have read have been from you, and one site on the internet from Dr. Susan Love's book (I think that is her name) in which she states that even bloody, unilateral discharge is related to breast cancer only 4% of the time. Pretty good odds, but I do have that lumpy area also. I think that greatly increases the odds that it is cancer, This doesn't increase your odds since on your previous mammogram, this \"lumpy area\" was read as \"non-suspicious\". And it really hasn't changed except for teh fact that you are feeling the area a lot and kind of wonder if it has changed. If this lumpy area was a malignancy years ago, and you let it go without treatment, then not only would it have changed and grown, but you wouldn't be alive right now. because if the lumpy area is kind of to the side of my nipple, and maybe up a bit, that dosen't sound like what I've read a papilloma feels like. I am so hoping that is it, but I can't help but feel it's such wishful thinking. I've really gone so many years not taking care of myself as I should. I don't smoke or drink, but I have eaten badly, and just generally let myself go. I just can't help but feel that I've let my family down so badly, because if this is something, there was just no excuse that I didn't get in earlier. My husband has a good job, and I stay at home, it wasn't that complicated for me to take care of myself, but I've been lazy. Instead of being out exercising, and doing things, I would be lazy around the house during the day. Ok, sorry to go on and on there, it's just hard. It's not hard unless you make it hard. The only person you are letting down is yourself. Your family loves you just the way you are and every single one of us has weak areas in our lives. We are our own worst critics. Thanks so much for the advice on what to do, I will make sure to write as soon as I get back on Tuesday. My husband also said what you did, that I probably won't know much tomorrow, but they'll probably refer me to a surgeon, since there apparantely is a mass. But, shouldn't they be able to tell somewhat from a mammo and a US if it is a papilloma? The Radiologist will be able to tell once he reads it but they don't usually read them on the spot like that. The films are taken to him while you are there, for him to quickly check to make sure that they are a \"good, viewable read\" and then the tech will come back to you and tell you that you can either leave or that they need additional views. Routinely, the films are then taken to the Radiologist's office stacker and as soon as he gets the chance, he will read them and then fax the report to your GYN's office. If it's a solid mass, and it's been bleeding, that tells me right there that it's cancer, right? Nope. I thought that was what the US was for, to distinguish it from a cyst or a solid mass, and if it's a solid mass, and it's been discharging blood, that dosen't sound good. I don't mean to be negative, I'm just so scared. Also, you were saying before about things being in my favor, but I'm not sure I have that much in my favor really. I am post-menopausal (I'm 45, almost 46, at the end of October)...and went through early menopause, and I know bleeding after you've been through menopause is bad. Do you know if any of those ladies you were talking about had the bleeding after menopause? Before AND after... contrary to some statistics, their menopause status doesn't seem to make much difference. My GYN kind of acted like, well, you might not be truly post-menopause since it was early, and I guess I could still be going through hormonal changes. I hate to sound stupid, but I can't remember when I had my last period. My husband swears that it was earlier this year, but I think it was way before that, about a year ago or maybe more. The mass thing is confusing, because I went in at that last mammogram, about 3 1/2 years ago, for that lumpy area near my nipple, and they said it was nothing. This is your golden ticket right here, Val. As long as the radiologist read those films properly at that time, then this is good! By the way, I forgot to mention earlier about your family history of CA. You have a family HX of ovarian CA, NOT breast CA.....two very different cancers. I hope that something wasn't missed, because this lumpy area is in the same breast, and that's the one I'm bleeding from. This nipple is inverted, but it's been that way all of my life. I suppose there might be another lumpy area there that wasn't there before, but I guess I missed it. The GYN did say he felt something, but that he couldn't tell what it was from his fingertips. Do you think the GYN wouldn't be experienced enough to tell somewhat if this is a benign condition? Not at all. The GYN has no idea whatsoever. If you saw a general surgeon to begin with, he would try to aspirate the area to see if fluid would return (rule out cyst) and then he would suggest a biopsy. GYN's just don't specialize in this area. I think he was trying to make me feel better, but he said he thinks it could be benign...but of course told me other scenarios. Could a papilloma be there for years before it starts to bleed? Not usually \"years\" but you haven't had the bleeding until recently. Based on your last mammogram results, I'm not sure that your lumpy area and your bleeding are much associated with one another at all. But you will soon know after your films. I worry that something was missed on this last mammo, and now the bleeding is signaling advanced breast cancer. If your last mamogram was suspicious at all, they would have ordered a biopsy then. If you had breast cancer back then, your symptoms would be multiple and much greater than bloody discharge from one nipple. My age is what worries me, and just risk factors of being overweight, and eating badly. You can't do anything about your age but you can do everything about your weight. Instead of beating yourself up wtih the woulda, coulda, shouldas.......get on a diet plan, get out and do some regular brisk walking and make that change starting today. Do it for your family and for yourself. If this turns out to be nothing, it sure is a wake-up call. I will never, ever put it off again! (I hope I have the chance to make up for this!) Anyway, I truly am sorry to keep bugging you, you have spent so much time helping me, and I really feel bad. I have to repay you! You've been there so much for me.....I just can't thank you enough. I feel that I'm going in tomorrow armed with so much more information now. One other question, on the mammo form, the doctor put that it was a single episode of bloody discharge, and of course, it's been doing this all weekend, so I guess I'll tell them that it's not a single episode any more. Does that also signal cancer, that it is persistent? Nope. IT means nothing until they tell you it means something. I wouldn't say it was alot of blood, but like if I look now, it's like there is some dried blood in the nipple (it gets trapped there as my nipple is inverted)...and like I said, I've had the inverted nipple as long as I can remember. I had a few spots on my nightclothes again last night. OMG~~I am writing you a manuscript! I'm so sorry, please forgive me for being such a pest...again thank you sooo much!! Again, you are an angel!! Thank you, Val Let us know how your appt. goes today!",

I am very happy to help you and I know how nerve wracking it is when you have a personal health situation - all of the waiting and wondering.... Plus, you have a husband that works out of town which makes it all the more difficult. I remember having outpatient surgery in my GYN's office and he just began without telling me what he was doing as he went along. He injected my cervix with Lidocaine with Epinephrine (back when I didn't have medical knowledge) and my heart began to race something fierce. I was so angry at him for not telling me to expect that. I have an extremely strong FM HX of heart disease and I swore I was having a heart attack. Scared me to death. I had so wished I would have had someone to talk to that could have warned me or helped me to be more informed! You are rightfully concerned about your bleeding because bleeding is always a warning sign and it goes to show that you are taking your health matter seriously. You are being very smart in being agreeable to further testing. The clear Mamm and US proves good news and it is good for your health to be feeling more positive with this so far. Cancer can strike any one of us at any time in our lives. Yes, with the MRI they will be looking for the source for the bleeding... papilloma vs ductal carcinoma. I believe that if you have an invasive ductal carcinoma, this would have shown up on your Mamm or US. If you have an intraductal carcinoma, then it is a cancer that is confined within the milk glands and has not spread. The latter is curable with surgery. All in all, you need to keep thinking positively and hold the belief that this is not a cancer until a doctor tells you differently. Like I said before, the odds are so in your favor that I even think that (by going what you have told me this far) and I haven't seen any of your reports. I will strongly suggest this to you: After you consult again with your GYN over your MRI results, please tell him that you WANT to see a surgeon for a second opinion on this. Again, GYN's and surgeons think along different lines and each have their own methods of treatment. Whether it be a cancer or not, you don't have to (and should not have to) deal with the bleeding like you are. This can be taken care of surgically, very simply. For your own health's sake, see the surgeon and expect him to offer an excision. You will have peace of mind. Plus, it will take care of this problem without leaving it to develop into something more down the road. Discuss it with your husband and certainly do what YOU feel is best for you, but I urge you to opt for the excision of that duct. Have a great weekend! I'm going camping with my family this weekend so I'm anxious to get on the road tonight. XO",

I thnk that doctors forget how much the rest of us really don't know and they oftentimes assume that we do. Especially when they do the same procedures over and over. Sort of becomes \"old hat\" to them when it is so new to some women. Yes, a papilloma would be the better condition to have but if it's ductal, it's certainly treatable and I'm sure that, either way, you want to treat it anyway so it's really going to be fine. If it's ductal, you certainly don't need to have a mastectomy. That would be the extreme. They can remove the duct using monitored anesthesia (a general would not be necessary for this) and they should be able to \"get it all\". When ductal carcinoma shows up as appearing to be an area of calcification, that area would appear suspicious to the radilogist and he would have therefore suggested a biopsy then. Whatever your condition might be, you can know that it's new. Your heart arrhythmia is something the surgeon should know about when you consult with him. Do you take a blood thinner for your condition? That will be important to let him know also so that he can instruct you as to whether or not you should come off of it prior to surgery. Do you require an antibiotic prior to dental procedures because of your condition? If so, you'll need to tell the surgeon that also, so he can order one. Good luck to you tomorrow!",

You are sleeping but you are breathing on your own. It's a piece of cake. Yes, dense tissue can hide masses at times, but an MRI is an excellent resource in that instance. An MRI will pick up any abnormality in the breast. You are on the right track, doing the right thing and I'm sure you'll be just fine! I would suggest that you do not go through your insurance company to find a suitable surgeon. They wouldn't know who is good or not. I'm sure your doctor will recommend a good one and I would go with whomever he suggests. If it were left up to you to find one on your own, your best bet would be to contact individual doctor's offices around your area and ask them who they recommend for a general surgeon. However, like I said, I would go with the surgeon your doctor recommends. Good luck to you tomorrow!",

My incision looks really great but you can hardly see it through all of the bruising. I showed my surgeon yesterday at work and he told me I would be fine and should gradually heal day by day. He told me he did a lot of probing and that I bled more than usual. At least it's \"normal\" so I'll let the days pass and see how it goes. I didn't realize how much trouble a minor inicision can cause. Great news that you made it safely through hurricane Rita! Good thing that tree didn't fall on your home!

It's considered a \"Halloween Weekend\" at this particular campground that we will be going to and you decorate your trailer in the theme. The kids wear costumes and trick-or-treat from trailer to trailer. They have apple bobbing and pumpkin carving contests etc. We are camping with several friends so it should be a lot of fun. I hate to see the season end - I just love to camp! I love the outdoors a lot. I love the warm campfires on these cool evenings. Take care of yourself and keep in touch!

It took several days for me to feel like I was on the upclimb of healing.

We closed up the travel trailer for the winter. I'm sad to see it end but it gets cold early here and it's not fun camping in frosty weather - for me, anyway!

If it proves to be something else or is not able to be distinguished, then an US is the next step... just like you said. They can both be very necessary for many, many women. And any doctor who uses the \"wait and see\" method rather than ordering further studies is asking for a law suit. If a woman has a biopsy, then the path report reads either malignant or benign... period. I think 99% of women would want a suspicious mass removed. Personally (and this is only my opinion), I would much rather have a lump removed (which I just did, by the way) than try to see if Vitamin E works. Although it isn't AS common for a lady under the age of 20 to develop a breast cancer, breast cancer knows no age or limitations. Same goes for any type of cancer. If the US proves the mass to be a cyst, then the surgeon can drain it/these, right in his office. This provides greast relief for some women as these cysts can be very painful as they grow and change throughout her cycle. As for path results, reports come in within one or two days unless it is a send-out to another larger institution. All you have to do is call and ask for your results and you should be able to get them. The nurse will take the \"callback\" to the surgeon and he will either call himself or allow the nurse to. If he is out of town, then there will be someone covering for him... always. The only reason a woman would have to wait is if that doctor's nurse isn't doing her job. If that doctor knew that a patient of his had called on a Monday for results and those results were in but the call wasn't addressed with the doctor without good reason for the delay, then that nurse would be reprimanded. Lastly, women with fibrocystic breast disease are at an increased risk for developing breast cancer at any point in their lives. All lumps/masses should be monitored closely by way of monthly self-breast examination, yearly mammograms, and yearly breast checks by a physician.",

Which is a condition where the cells lining the milk ducts or channels in the breast that carry the milk to the nipple, are cancerous but stay contained within the ducts instead of invading teh surrounding tissue. It's also known as non-invasive or pre-invasive. If DCIS is left untreated over a period of years, it may spread into the breast tissue itself. If you have this condition, it is not harmful to you at this stage, but must be treated. It's important to see your path report also because there are three stages of DCIS low, intermediate and high. This \"grade\" refers to just how abnormal these cells look under a microscope and gives the doctor an idea as to how quickly this may turn into an invasive cancer. Or, how likely it is that the DCIS will return if surgery is indicated. Low grade is where you want to be if you have this. I'm happy to hear you are going to get your path report!

You shouldn't take the advice of a tech or a radiologist alone, you need to hear it from a doctor. A surgeon is best because they deal with these issues on a daily basis. When we see patients in the office for a breast cyst, We insert a fine needle into the \"cyst\" and try to aspirate it. If it can't be aspirated, then we recommend a biopsy. Breast cancer is so prevalent anymore that it's better to be safe than sorry! My family history is full of breast cancers and \"they\" also tell me I am too young to undergo annual mammograms. My insurance won't even cover this - but I have them done because breast cancer isn't always symptomatic. Your inlarged lymph node isn't anything to wait on either. Please see a general surgeon.",

This means, for example, that an area of fluid (cyst) and an area of normal breast tissue are easy to differentiate on an ultrasound image. However, ultrasound does not have good spatial resolution like mammography, and can't provide as much detail as a mammogram image. Ultrasound is also unable to image microcalcifications, tiny calcium deposits that are often the first indication of breast cancer. Mammography, on the other hand, is excellent at imaging calcifications. In my opinion, it's best to have the mammograms regularly and then US for follow up, in necessary cases.",

The difference between the two is that with an aspiration, fluid either returns or not. With a true-cut Biopsy, actual tissue is taken for pathology. This is not a complete biopsy. Just because the tissue taken in that very small area did not prove to be a cancer, does not mean that this lump is benign right to the margins. I just had an excision of a breast mass last week. This palpable mass did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound. This is not unusual and all the more reason it needed to be excised. It was benign (thank God). My mom was in the same situation five times over. The first four excisions showed benign, fibrocystic changes. The fifth.... a cancer. In my opinion, your mass needs to be removed no doubt about it. If this surgeon's wife had a breast mass, you can bet she would be in the OR pronto. I say all the more reason since it doesn't show up on film because this mass does not even show to give the radiologist any indication of its characteristics. If your surgeon feels that this lump has only a 3% chance of being benign, then it most likely is. However, SOMEONE has to fall into that 3% category. What will he say to you if it ends up being a cancer.... \"I'm sorry?\" Of the surgeons I know and work with, none would let you go without a biopsy. Absolutely none of them.

I faithfully have yearly breast exams with my GYN as well as an annual mammogram. I admit to not being so good about my self-exams . About 5 weeks ago, my husband noticed a red spot on the upper (outer) left side of my left breast - he at first thought it was a pimple. I didn't look like a pimple to me, but I was busy and just didn't pay much attention to it. I looked at it later and realized it felt raised on the skin and when I pushed harder on it, I noticed that it felt hard underneath, but not real deep (if that makes any sense). I decided it was probably just a skin irritation and left it alone. The color seems to change from time to time - sometimes it's darker red and other times it's lighter red and there seems to be what I can only describe as a shadow around it. When I pull the skin taught around it I can actually see the \"lump\" which is quite irregular in shape - it's very small though - maybe only .75cm. It sounds more like a cyst but even so, you need to have it checked out. I have noticed that my left breast seems to be a little bigger than my right and when I put my bra on this morning I really noticed that the left side did not fit as well as the right. It seems to be bigger around the outside. Isn't it normal for one breast to be larger than the other anyway? It is common for one breast to be larger than the other. I have an appointment later this week with my GYN to have this looked at, but I've been curious to know if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this. I know breast cancer shows up in different forms for everyone and since this doesn't fit the \"feels like a marble, or a pea, or a grape\" symptom I thought I'd see is familiar with anything like this. I'm not easily scared - I'm very realistic, so if anyone has been diagnosed with breast cancer by something that started out like what I've described, please don't be afraid to share it with me. We're all very glad to know you'll be seeing your GYN! Breast cancer doesn't take on any same, certain symptom. It can be different each time with each individual. Because you have a family history of breast CA, you will forever need to keep a close watch on your breast health! Please let us know how your appt. goes. A mamm and ultrasound are in order.

You can see for yourself what the impression reads on that mamm to know what is needed here, and what her options are. If the doctor truly recommends a biopsy then a fine needle aspiration is a waste of time. A biopsy is recommended for suspicious or highly suggestive mammogram results. The area of suspicion might not even be showing up on her mammogram at all which is all the more reason to have it biopsied. Surgeons generally order monitored anesthesia for biopsies, not general anesthetics. I hope she's willing to let you help her.

I have never had children and I do have three maternal aunts who had breast cancer - also one cousin, the daughter of one of these aunts. However, my mother and her other sister never had breast cancer, and none of my 3 sisters (all older than me) have either. I have not yet reached menopause. I recently had two vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsies because of microcalcifications found first on digital screening mammograms and later viewed with a closer look on digital diagnostic mammograms (September 2005). There were three sites of clustered microcalcifications found - two on my left breast and one on my right. I was referred to a specialist breast surgeon - I met with her, she looked at my mammograms and examined my breasts. She referred me back to the radiologist to perform two sterotactic biopsies - one on my left breast and one on my right. (The third site was too close to the chest wall to have a stereotactic biopsy performed.) Fortunately, the pathology report determined the samples to be benign. I then heard from the same breast surgeon, who had discussed my case with the same radiologist after the stereotactic biopsies had been performed - and the surgeon advised that it would be best to have a surgical biopsy for the last site of clustered microcalcifications that was near the chest wall on my left breast. However, I've read that is a good idea to have a second opinion before one goes in for a surgical biopsy. I would feel more comfortable getting a second opinion regarding the surgical biopsy. Who should I get the second opinion from - a radiologist or a surgeon? If surgery is recommended by the second physician, I do feel comfortable with the first surgeon and I would go back to her for the surgery. However, if a wait and see approach is recommended, I may want to go that route. My surgeon suggested that I should have this done within the month. The microcalcifications were very small - hardly noticeable to the human eye on the mammogram. They were noted on x-ray reports by a different radiologist from mammograms from 1999 and 2000 - but just listed as calcifications - perhaps they could not see microcalcifications because they never took other close-up views. I waited five years before having another mammogram and I did bring the old films to the new radiologist. I never was told that any type of calcification was something to be alarmed about. (Therefore, I never was that concerned with the previous reports - nor, did my doctors seem to be.) I would be most appreciative if you could respond soon because this is a time-sensitive matter. I would really be grateful if someone in the medical community could respond to this post. Thank you so much! You have breast densities and suspicious calcifications.... this definitely (in my opinion only) warrants a surgical biopsy. If they are benign (and most are!) then that will be wonderful and will have been worth going through the biopsy for the safety and peace of mind. You do however, have to keep in mind that you do have a FM HX of breast cancer and that a biopsy would not be recommended if it was not suspicious so it's better to be safe and see what it is and to get rid of it. Just because the other two areas were benign, doesn't automatically mean that this third one is. These same (if benign) clusters can become cancerous over time and you won't be aware of any changes until you become symptomatic or until your next mammogram. The radiologist reads your films and makes the suggestion - he is not a surgeon. An oncologist isn't the person you should see at all because he treats cancers which you have not been established as having yet. If you want a second opinion, then get one from a surgeon you feel most comfortable with. Keep in mind that surgeons to not suggest biopsies on all clusters of calcifications. They have to have a certain suspicious appearance to warrant that. Or sometimes the diagnosis is borderline and it's simply just best to biopsy the area to see for sure what it is. If a biopsy is recommended, then go for it. This is minor surgery and the surgery only takes 30 minutes or so. You are given monitored anesthesia which will make you feel as if you are sleeping, but you are totally breathing on your own and only taken to a certain state of sedation. It's quick and easy. You are in and out and right back to work the next day or the day after, depending on your soreness for which they will give you pain relievers. The scarring is minimal and you won't have to worry any longer about what these calcifications might be or what they might turn into in the future.",

      "Content": "I have had nodules before that have turned out to be nothing more than a change in my cycle. They have come and gone. If they are calling yours a nodule at this point, then you really need to make sure you follow up on this by seeing a general surgeon - no matter what your diagnosic mamm and US read. If it's truly a nodule, then the surgeon will evaluate it thoroughly and most likely will want to biopsy it (since you have a FM HX of BR CA). If it's a cyst, then he can aspirate it and then give you good follow up care. I hope you ask your doctor for the referral.",

If your aunt is having regular mammograms and ultrasounds like it seems she is, then her doctor is watching for abnormalities and is taking good care of her. To me, 54 is not old at all lol!",

They have the knowledge to provide you with the best treatment plan and follow up care. Keep in mind that breast nodules can show up on film and not be palpable as well as not show up on film (mammogram or ultrasound) yet are palpable. The surgeon will most likely try to aspirate this nodular area to see if fluid returns. If it does, then it's a cyst and he will recommend follow up in a couple of weeks or so. If no fluid returns when aspirating, then the surgeon will most likely recommend a biopsy, which is a good plan since you have a family history.",
