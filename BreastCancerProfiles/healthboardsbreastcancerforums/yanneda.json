    "Content": "@Honeywest - glad to read your results were good ones. I had (HAD) very dense breast tissue and would always get the dreaded call that the mammogram showed something suspicious and that I needed to come back for further testing. I finally asked if we could just cut to the chase and get the mammogram and ultrasound done at the same time and that's what I did for years. Saved a lot of anxiety. I finally wasn't able to dodge the bullet anymore and was diagnosed with pretty much the same thing as @Uptown. I had bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction on March 28 and I'm doing great. Good luck and continuing good health to both of you!",
