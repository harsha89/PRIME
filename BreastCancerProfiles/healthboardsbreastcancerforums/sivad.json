      "Content": "Hello Everyone: I hate to say it, but I am new to this Board. I need to learn a lot and quickly. On Monday, I went to see my GP about the iching and a little discomfort in my right breast. I had seen a Dermatolgist about it in Jan. and she gave me some cream to put on. It did not go away, and was bothersome, but not terribly. Still, since I have had it off and on for 7 or 8 months, I was not worried. I have a mammogram every year. Dr. said she wanted a new mammo and, if indicated, a ultrasound. I had both. Final Assessment of the findings. BI-RADS category 4, Suspicious Finding, recommend biopsy. The report said they found no change in the mammagram from 7/07, no supicious abnormalities. Ultrasound: dense shadowing at 9 to 10 o'clock of uncertain etiology. It has some shadowing and some increase in flow. Today, they sent me a certified letter, telling me to have a follow-up. I don't know, seems to me that one should not rush into anything. Maybe have another US in 3 to 6 months. I did make an appointment at the Cancer center up north, but I am not sure I really want to keep it. I feel very sure that there is no real problem. Anyone had a report similar to mine and it was cancer or was not? Any advice to help me make the decision? I really appreciate the folks on the Boards who take their time to help others. Sorry this is so long. Sivad",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone: I am back from the famous medical center in minnesota. I am healthy, no breast cancer. I took my last three mammograms up and my ultrasound. They said the films were of good quality and had the breast radiologists study them. First my Dr. Stan, did the most different kind of clinical breast exam I had ever had. She told me she felt no mass or lump. About 5 hours later, when they paged me back, she said the radiologists agreed 100% that all the ultrasound showed was extremely dense breast tissue. She felt my radiologist in our little hospital here probably don't see this kind of ultrasound but rarely and therefore did not want to take a chance. She said they see about a 1000 or more of this kind. Apparently extremely dense breast tissue is fairly unusual in someone who is 69. Now for the future. I still have two strong risk factors for BC. She told me to start doing BSE every month and follow up with tests. My husband has a life threatening health condition they are monitoring (an aneurysm) and we go up every 6 months. In the future, I will schedule my Mammogram up there to go along with his visits and then I can automatically have an ultrasound too. Thanks to everyone for their prayers and advice and council. It helped me so much. I dodged the big one this time, but must stay on guard. Louise",

      "Content": "Oh Terry, and everyone.. I had a lady tell me today to be realistic. Thank you Terry, that could not have been easy to write, but you are helping me to at least consider that I may indeed have breast cancer. Why did you decide on double surgery, if I may ask? If you don't want to say that is fine, I understand. I am so worried and yet must keep busy. Mom fell today and hurt her arm, not bad. She said she had not slept much last night was wobbly. I must look out for her, but what can I say she knows already. I wish I knew what, when, how and where, but must wait until next Monday. Thanks again so much for your post. Louise",

      "Content": "Terry, bless your heart. Thank you for the detailed message. I can see from your tests that if they do not schedule an mri, I will request it. Maybe I better ask for both breasts?? I was so surprised to hear you had stomach problems. I have had on going, off and on problems for the past year. You know I just blame it on getting old. LOL. We will leave Sunday morning for the 6 hour drive up north to that famous medical center everyone knows. Since we originally lived in Minnesota, it was our place to go. I have complete trust that if they say I am ok, I am ok, and if they say it is breast cancer, then it is. Oh, I wish it were all that simple. It wont be it sounds like. I have a couple of friends who are on call for my Mom if she needs them while I am gone. I should be home by next weekend. Then the worrying will be over by then or really just getting started. You are so brave and doing everything right now. I just know you will continue to be well. Thanks again, Louise",

      "Content": "Hi Terry, I am really in the healthy eating and taking the necessary vitamins. I take flax oil capsules 1200mg. twice daily, C 500mg 1 time day, D 1000u. 2 per day, 1 multivitamin/multimineral daily. Plus I take acidophilus, l capsule daily. My diet is very low fat and high fruit (every meal) and high vegetables. Organic. Most we grow our selves and preserve. I have been eating this way since 2000, but did not add the flax oil capsules until 2 years ago. I also take thyroid medication daily, 5mg of blood pressure medicine to keep it in the under 120 range and Lipitor 10mg. My blood work looks extremely good. Is all of this going to make a difference? Who know how long the mass has been there since they could not see it on mammo? I am going up tomorrow. I will try to post while I am there, but do not have a laptop and will have to wait for a computer at the patient communication center. I appreciate so much your help and those of others who have added to the conversation. God Bless You and all of us on this journey. Louise",

I always thought that they said cancer has not pain or feeling. Looks like a lot for me to learn. You all on the board are sure helping. I appreciate it. Louise",

      "Content": "Hi Leea, Thank you for your reply. You are RIGHT, of course. My head was swimming and I just could not think straight. I am worried about leaving my Mom here. I am the only daughter and her caretaker. I need to travel a distance for care at a cancer center. I have a couple of persons here now that she can call if she has a emergency. I guess I am worried about what will happen if it is cancer and I need treatment, long term. Oh dear, that will be a problem to deal with. I am keeping in close contact with the Lord and I hope he is hearing my prayers. Thanks again. Louise",
