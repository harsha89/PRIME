      "Content": "After drying myself off from having a shower.I looked in the mirror and noticed a strange shape/pattern on on left breast.Its difficult to describe but looks like a water stain.I can't think of any other way to describe it.Imagine dropping water onto lipmus paper and leaving it to dry.It seems to have a defined edge and measures about 4 x 5 inches in diameter.There any no spots,but the skin within the strange shape seems to feel smoother than the rest of the breast.My breast feel tender if i catch them.I am post menopausal,having my last period February 04, so doubt if its hormonal.This strange variation of skin pattern starts from the areola (hope i spelt that right),and seems to have appeared overnight.Any ideas anyone,should i be worried?",

      "Content": "Hi Marymk, Thanks for your reply. The mark i mentioned in my post has almost faded away after having had it for nearly two weeks.I am recovering from a Virectomy after suffering a detached retina. After some thought! i wondered if the mark may have been caused from the meds that i am taking due to the op.? I think i may be suffering from depression to a degree also at the moment, and are also thinking this may also be a side effect of the meds i'm on at the moment. Only time will tell once the meds are finished.",
