The U/S found 2 enlarged lymph nodes, but they have since gone down and I am still having the pain. The Dr thinks it is breast tissue pushing into the underarm area (whatever!!!) Basically they cannot figure out why I am having this pain. It is pretty unbearable at times. It has been going on since Oct 2009. I am 35.",
