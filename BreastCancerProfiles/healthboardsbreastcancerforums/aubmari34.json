    "Content": "anabella ~ I was told the same thing by my OB/GYN. Usually they will schedule you for an ultrasound to check for a cause. I actually go in tomorrow for a D&C and Hysteroscopy because I have a fibroid/pollyp in my uterus that is causing problems. I have a thick endometrial lining that is thought to be cause by the fibroid.pollyp. Have they set you up for any testing? Aubmari",
