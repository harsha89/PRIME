      "Content": "Discharge could also be a sign of PROLACTINOMA....there's an area in your brain that secretes prolactin which is among many things responsible for producing milk. Sometimes there's a tiny tumour that forms...very begnin....NOT CANCER...and it increases the production of this hormone which causes you to produce smal amounts of milk. That's just one of many explanations. It's a condition that is very well treated with medication which you may not have to take for a long time before going back to normal.",

But it's important to get it checked out, 1) for your peace of mind 2) because you are at increased risk for developing BC and 3) to treat it whatever it is....good luck",

      "Content": "I'm sorry to hear about your mom. My MIL just stopped Xeloda. She was also on it since Oct. 04 and could not continue taking it because of the effects it is having on her heart. Before Xeloda she went through 3 other types of chemo over the past 2 yrs and now they are going to put her on an experimental drug. What comes after a certain type of chemo depends a lot on what she's been on before and what effect it had. In my MIL case certain other drugs are not available to her because she had her lungs fill up with water that is why they're putting her in this clinical trial. I wish i had a clear answer for you but the decision about treatmment is really on a case by case basis. You are both in my prayers. Please let me know how things are moving along.",

Its done much better than Taxol and is doing well for mets. I certainly hope it will work for you. I imagine since it's such a new drug not too many people have had a chance to give it a try. I wish you all the best your treatment...keep us posted",

      "Content": "If the cancer spread to her lung she would be by now on some very aggressive chemotherapy treatment where she would lose her hair, make her tired, nauseous, etc. You would notice a difference in her. You can't walk around with metastatic breast cancer and undergo chemotherapy and be like nothing is happening to you. I would try to expose the lie. When you talk to her why don't you ask her how she can live everyday without telling her parents she has a life-threatening illness? Or how come the doctors haven't informed her parents since she is a minor and you know for a fact that it is illegal to treat a minor without parental consent. Innocently ask her these pointed questions and see how she responds. If she doesn't lash out at you by saying that you don't believe she has cancer she may start thinking that you are suspicious of her and that her story just isn't holding up anymore. She may not like you anymore or want to be friends but she needs to get to the bottom of this need for attention. It needs to be dealt with and sometimes unfortunately it's those nearest to the person in need who get burned! Best of luck...",

      "Content": "I would be very suspicious of your friend. It doesn't sound like she really has breast cancer but rather is seeking attention. Too many things do not fit in her story and the first thing is that if a doctor suspected that a 15 yr old has any type of cancer they are obligated by law to inform the parents of a minor. She cannot receive this diagnosis on her own or be treated for it alone, as a minor!",
