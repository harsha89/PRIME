    "Content": "I started the contraceptive pill a month ago and noticed my breasts were becoming very sore. Right beast had more pain and symptoms than the left breast, the doc referred me for an ultrasound. Whilst having the ultrasound on the right breast, they thought they would randomly check the other to compare the two..... Received the report back - right brest (where the symptoms were) appears to be a well-defined hypoechoic lesion - fibroadenoma. But they noticed on left breast where they had randomly checked appears to be a 'slightly ill-defined hypoechoic lesion' 3 o'clock from nipple with internal vascularity, it appears to be indeterminate. Recommended to get a biopsy. Should i be worried? I am 28 years old. Can an ill-defined lump turn out to be benign also?",
