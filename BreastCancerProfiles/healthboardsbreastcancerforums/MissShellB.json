      "Content": "Last week my left breast was kind of sore and there was a redish rash around my nipple. The redness went away after a couple of days but it still was itching. I then noticed that it all scabbed up and is itchy. I went to the dr and he did a breast exam and told me that it looks like it might be Paget Disease of the breast. It's rare but he's been seeing more and mores cases of it. He told me to put body lotion on it and call him in two weeks and let him know how it is. However if it gets red again and is irritating...to come back in. Has anyone ever heard of this? Reading about it on the internet has gotten me very scared. I'm due to start an IVF cycle in less then two weeks and I'm not too sure if I should or not. If it is in fact this Paget Disease, will I be treated for Cancer? Should I just call him and tell him I want a biopsy done and not wait for two weeks? Any advice is much appreciated. As well as if anyone has had this or know anyone with it. Thank you",

      "Content": "What you are describing sounds like what I was experiancing. Sorness and burning. Then I got a redish ring around the nipple and then it all crusted up. I went to the dr yesterday and he said that it looks like it might be something called paget's disease of the breast. I have to call him back if it doesn't get better in a two weeks or if it gets worse, then call him. Please go get it checked out. Don't wait.",
