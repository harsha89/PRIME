    "Content": "I too had microcalcifications in my right breast (just 1 calcification cluster). At the age of 31, I told my Dr. that if it didn't belong there to remove it. I was lucky that the the microcalcification was benign. Not lucky that the surrounding tissue was cancerous. At 31, they diagnosed me with carcinoma insitu of the right breast. I went through another surgery to clear the margins, then I had 36 treatments of radiation, no chemo. I am now a 15 year survivor of breast cancer and still going strong. I believe I'm 100% cured of breast cancer. Now I'm onto my next fight. For Christmas, I was diagnosed with Stage II rectal cancer. The doctors said that this cancer has nothing to do with my breast cancer episode. Go figure, I just have bad \"Jeans\". Good luck. Remember, it's your decision! I firmly believe if it doesn't belong there, get it out, so you don't have to worry.",
