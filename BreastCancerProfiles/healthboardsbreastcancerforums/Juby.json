      "Content": "I read about some research done by a German doctor named Dr. Budwig. I think her first name was Johanna, but I'm not sure. She says you have to have the cottage cheese with the Linseed oil, in order for it too work. I will check out the sites you listed, and maybe you can type her name in the search engine, and let me know what you think. There are even some message boards about her work. I will be gone this week, but will check back next week. Thank you for your reply.",

      "Content": "I probably am comparing apples to oranges. I always have things popping up that I feel like I need to check out. I have been cancer free for nineteen years and I still am constantly on guard. I have a long list of herbs, foods, and I don't know what all that I avoid because of the hormone activity. My dad was into medical research and I got a lot of my information from him, but now that he's passed away I don't know how to find answers to all of my questions.",
