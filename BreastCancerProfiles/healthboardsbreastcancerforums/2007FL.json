    "Content": "I recently had a breast excision that removed ductal carcinoma in situ from my left breast that was directly under the nipple. For at least six months (probably more like a year), I have had liver pain and a constant feeling of bloating and when I take a deep breath it hurts more. Today they took an ultrasound of my liver, gallbladder and pancreas. I recently tested positive for hyperthyroid and the ultrasound showed my thryroid was enlarged, so they just did a radiation uptake test. I guess my question is that I know breast cancer can metastasises (sp?) in other organs, but can it effect the thyroid too? It just seems like I have alot of things happening all at once, and I am kinda scared. I am only 38 and have 3 kids. If anyone can give me any insight, I would really appreciate it. Thanks, Jill",
