    "Content": "I too had been wearing underwire bra's for added support for years and the pain I had was in both breasts and it was quite severe. I stopped wearing bra's altogether and went to camasols and the pain went away within three days. I tried wearing one over this past weekend just to see what would happen and by the end of the day on the second day the pain was coming back with a vengeance. I'm really beginning to think it's bra's that cause the pain.",
