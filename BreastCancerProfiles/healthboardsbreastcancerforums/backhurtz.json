      "Content": "Hi, Well I finally heard about the two biopsies...you guys aren't going to believe this because I can't but I got a call this morning from my doctor regarding my thyroid biopsy. It seems that it needs to be redone since they completely missed the thyroid tissue altogether...not one thyroid cell in the stuff they took out for the biopsy. Tonight, I got a phone call from the breast imaging center pathologist- apparently, the microcalcifications that they were supposed to biopsy also weren't found in the stereotactic biopsy samples so I need to go get it redone as well. That is going to be Tuesday morning. She explained that they believed they had one in one of the samples of tissue they took but when it was cut for the biopsy, they could no longer locate it so it has gone back and forth between pathology and the biopsy suite over and over this week...however what ever tissue they did sample was benign. I spoke to my doctor to see about maybe a short interval follow up instead, but he and the pathologist are insistent that I repeat the stereo again on Tuesday, otherwise they want a lumpectomy /biopsy...",

      "Content": "Hi ItsMeG, If I were a betting person , I couldn't even begin to figure out the odds of that happening once, let alone twice in less than 9 hours , to the same person. I hope that they also put a rush on the results since this has been going on now for most of the month of February so far, and bythe end of next week, we will be coming to the end of it.. I hope that your biopsies show nothing but benign too....this is so frightening, and I don't know how they really expect that we should hurry up and wait all of the time... I am not sure how I feel about this whole mess up on the biopsies, but I also don't want an open lumpectomy again either. I've had them twice before, thankfully benign but still, the recovery is a bit more painful.",

      "Content": "That's awesome news ItmeG! I am thrilled for you and hope that I hear something today, one way or another. I don't want to wait another week for results. The only good thing is that I know that they had the microcalcifications in this biopsy because I made them xray them before I left to make sure. I wasn't taking any chances that it might be missed again and then the next step would have been an open biopsy. I've had that twice in my twenties and I am not excited at the prospect of doing it again. I have a feeling that I may not be so lucky , but whatever the outcome, I just wish that it would be done already. They went through all of my previous mammo's, all of the repeat mammo's since the end of January through to Tuesday, then did more films again, both before and after the stereo...I have had far more radiation than I expected but he said that he didn't want to miss something this time. My doctor is out of the office today ( day off) but last time he called me as soon as he got the report so I am hoping it is the same today... Thank you for being so supportive to me. You've been really helpful and reassuring. Back",

      "Content": "This might be a bit of a long post, so please bear with me..I had my last mammogram in 2006- and finally changed doctors after realizing that my former primary never seemed to follow up on anything. I scheduled a new physical with my new doctor, who sent me for a follow up on some thyroid nodules - 10 years since my last scan of those. That led to a finding of a new nodule with some arterial blood flow- and a phone call telling me that I needed to get a biopsy done of that. That happened yesterday afternoon. Last night, I got a phone call that my mammogram done at the same time as the thyroid ultrasound, needed to be repeated and they wanted to see my previous studies. I got a phone call telling me that they wanted me to have a second set of mammo films done along with an ultrasound. During the phone call last night from my doctor, he told me that the second set of mammo films showed an increase in microcalcifications, and I needed to get a sterotatic biopsy done - he called the radiologist, who agreed to do it today..so off I went again for the biopsy. I must tell you that I am scared to death- there is an extensive family history of cancers- leukemias that killed one sibling, and another sibling got as an adult a few years ago. My uncles have all had NHL- Non-Hodkins Lymphoma, and an aunt with some rare cancer.. now this.. I am trying to hold on- trying not to think the worst, and one would be bad enough but to have two things happening at the same time, has me beyond scared..any reassurances? Oh, my original mammo report as a Birads- 0 and now has gone to a Birads - 4 Back",

      "Content": "Thanks G, I will send up some prayers for all of us . It sure seems like things seem to happen all at once. I really dislike doctors and my habit is to avoid them unless I or one of my kids are really ill. I can't deny that all of this has me worried.....and I'm sure that you are too. The good news is that the stereotactic biopsy wasn't too awfully painful. It was strange but not overtly painful. I will watch to see how you make out , and hope for a good outcome for all of us. It was so sad yesterday because while I was waiting for them to come get me for the stereotactic biopsy, a woman who looked to be about 25 was just told that she has colon cancer and her surgery was scheduled for Friday. My heart just broke for her.....",

I also don't have female relatives to talk this stuff over with and if it weren't for my best girlfriend and you, I think that I might have come unglued over the last few days and weeks. It's good to know that there is someone who cares and is listening when you are going through this stuff. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Quote: Originally Posted by Cnhi37 I've been barely able to function I'm so frightened. I went for my annual gyno exam. A little background, I have severe anxiety and dread going to the doctor. So I mustered up all the courage I could just to go. I was so focused on the uncomfortable part of the exam I had forgotten the do a breast check. So I laid back and she performed the exam on my right breast. She palpitated on one area and a look of concern washed over her face. She said you have a cyst. We need to have checked out. I was in shock. She made small talk about my kids and I answered but my insides were screaming with fear. She takes me into another room and I'm sure I heard 'breast two inches'...two inches? I left in a daze, and was called the next morning for bilateral mammogram and ultrasound. They scheduled it for Valentines Day :-( I called back and said could I please have the next available appointment as I was extremely anxious. So they moved me up to Monday. Now I have barely been able to function. I'm 37 and never even was thinking of mammogram until I was 40. I had a CT scan from the neck down a couple months back for lung nodules the pulmonologist said she was 99.9 sure it wasn't cancer but recommended another CT in six months. Now I'm worried its all connected. My boyfriend tried to reassure me that a CT would have probably picked up a mass in my chest. But I read otherwise. I just wonder if physicians take into account people's mental conditions. The waiting is agonizing. I've been preparing a will and everything. Not to mention at every phone call I'm afraid my gyno will have results of abnormal pap. This weekend is going to be agonizing and scary. I just needed an outlet because no one seems to understand what I am going through. Sorry for rambling on. I understand , and I\"m sure that everyone here does, to some extent or another, the wait for the results is agonizing. I am waiting myself, since I had my biopsy yesterday....and another one on my thyroid the day before, so I understand your anxiety.....I am right there with you.",
