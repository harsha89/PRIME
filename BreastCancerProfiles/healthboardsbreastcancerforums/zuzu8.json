      "Content": "Hi- There are definitely three things going on with you that are GOOD signs. One is your age. Male breast cancer is not only relatively rare but normally occurs in men over 60... .Another is that this problem has been going on for 4 years without any others symptoms of ill health (A malignancy doesn't remain \"static\" for 4 years.) The other good news is that the fluid can be \"expressed\" bilaterally (i.e. squeezed from BOTH nipples). Cancer does not usually occur simulatneously in both breasts. That said, it is a bit odd that none of the doctors (how many?) have bothered to examine the fluid. Seems to me that a needle biopsy or fine-needle aspiration biopsy where they remove the fluid and examine it under a microscope would have been in order. Since you now have a new sign, nipple retraction, I would go for one more check-up and insist on a needle biopsy, just to absolutely make sure everything is okay. (Just to put this last question you had aboiut not examining the fluid to rest once and for all.) Actually, they wouldn't even have to use a needle, since they can just squeeze the breast and get fluid easily enough. Also, it's not good enough for the doctors to NOT tell you what is causing this. If they don't know, find a better informed physician! It's their JOB to know.",

      "Content": "Hi Lyla- Not knowing your age or medical history, it's difficult to access your symptom (or rather \"sign\".) But often, when there is a sudden change in size of one breast, if it's a cancer, the breast will become SMALLER (not larger) because it is pulling the skin and shortening the ducts. However, any changes in breast shape or contour, or anything \"new\" that you have never experienced before should be checked out. Chances are this is hormonal or maybe a benign cystic condition, and you have no reason to be alarmed.....Still don't ignore it.....get yourself a breast exam ASAP if for no other reason than to put your mind at ease.",
