      "Content": "Thanks for that story. I wish every woman could read it, not just the ones on this board! And you are right. You have to educate yourself and take care of yourself and not just rely on what doctors think. I have a question that I would like to ask everyone. Do you think that yearly mammograms after 20 years, can cause cancer? My other question is \"do mammograms really save lives?\" Judging from this last story, it sounds like it saved hers.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone: I learned something VITAL last summer when my sister-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. I want to share the knowledge with you. She had her regular yearly mammo (18 years of them) and it showed nothing. Four months later she found a lump and it was cancer. She learned that mammograms do not find all cancers. When she was given an ultrasound, they could see the tumor. So now I have decided that when I have my yearly mammogram, I am also going to have an ultrasound at the same time - if my insurance doesn't want to pay for it, then I will! from Sister.",

      "Content": "I'm scared. A doctor on TV said that women 50 (NOT 40) and older should have a mammogram every year or two. He said that if you have mammograms for 20 or 30 years then you will get breast cancer from the radiation. Well I've been having mammograms every year since I was 40 - that's 20 years of mammograms.. And some of them were multiple x-rays because I had cysts and a terrible technician one year. She took about 12 x-rays because she couldn't get it right. The usual amount is 4 x-rays a year. Now I'm worried about radiation. Is there anyone on this board who knows the danger of mammograms - have they done any studies on this? Thank you for any answers or opinions.",

Sometimes I get so fed up with worrying about breast cancer that I want to go and get prophylactic mastectomies. I don't need my breasts anyway. They are cumbersome, usually tender or painful, and my main cancer site. My husband said it would be alright with him because he was only 28 when his mom died from breast cancer. Both his daughters are in their 30's and have one of the BC genes. Without breasts, I would feel free from worry, free of mammograms and biopsies and the fear they bring, (I have to take Ibuprophen for a week after a mammogram because I have cysts and the pain from a mammogram is bad) and could jog and ride horses without having to hold my breasts because of pain! I am serious about this. Breast cancer is just too common. My grandmother had it and now my sister-in-law, a co-worker, and a friend from high school. I have a friend who is as \"flat as a board.\" (Naturally) She has a nice life and doesn't mind not having a bustline. I wouldn't mind either. Thank you for letting me vent my anger at breast cancer.",

She found a lump 3 months after her last mammogram, and now she's dying. I don't see what is wrong with having your breasts removed after the age of 55. They are only milk glands. It's not like they are needed. Just the opposite: no more mammograms, biopsies, panic attacks about lumps, and ESPECIALLY, NO MORE F E A R !!! I'm not too worried about uterine or ovary cancer, because it is much more rare, and the tests of finding uterine cancer early are excellent. What do you think about what I just said??? Am I wrong to want to live flat-chested but with no fear??",
