      "Content": "I had the mammogram and ultrasound done last Friday, and will have an MRI done next Monday. They felt there was not a problem after seeing the mammogram and ultrasound, but are doing the MRI anyway...(my sister had BC when she was 50). I feel very fortunate thus far, and I hope your results turn out well! I found it odd that the doctor wrote a script for everything, including a biopsy, and yet the imaging was not positive, (still praying the MRI is going to be normal)! Bright blessings...",

      "Content": "Bless you for your reply... I've had fibrocystic breasts most of my life...When I was 36 I had a hysterectomy, and am 53 now. It seemed that the fibrocystic issue subsided as a result, and I had fewer pelvic exams and breast 'feelings' as well. 'Breast feelings'...I mean exams. Am alarmed by her finding this so quickly,,,as she seemed so sure of herself. I've tried to 'find' the hard pea since I've been home tonight, and when I do, it's so very, very obvious....otherwise, I feel and feel with my arm behind my head and can not find it...But when I do, omg...there it is. It is not easy to find! Not a big lumpy bulge, but a smallish hard 'pea'. I'm trying to be calm about it. Thank you for your reply, I appreciate any thoughts from women who have walked in this world. Kathryn",

      "Content": "My gyn found a pea sized lump in my left breast today. On the outside between the nipple and armpit. Breast cancer has never been a thought that I thought would/could be about me! She said... 'There's not a lump like it in the other breast' 'I've been doing this a long time...' She wrote a script for me to have ultrasound, mri, biopsy.... My last mammo was in Sept of 08 and was 'normal' My question is...Has anyone else had a day like I had today, and had everything turn out to be 'nothing'??? I feel numb and sad... Thank you in advance for any help, Kathryn",
