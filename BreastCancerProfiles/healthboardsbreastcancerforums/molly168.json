I had a bad reaction to a cat scan dye, but I know that is much different. Any experiences are appreciated. ellie",

      "Content": "He didnt take a tissue sample because he didnt see any thing abnormal on his screen. The other imaging place told him the dark area was at 9:00. However he didnt know how far away from the nipple the area was. He said he couldnt read the cd or film from the original imaging center. That does not seem right either. All they told him was it is at 9 oclock. So he went from under the arm to the nipple and it all looked normal to him, so he could not just shoot in the dark to get a sample of something.",

      "Content": "Here is my story. My nipple looked crusty so my gyn ordered an ultrasound of the right breast. The facility is up the street 5 blocks from my gyn. On the ultra sound they found a NOT well defined darkened area 1 cm by .7cm. So the doctor who read the ultrasound suggested getting an mri to further investigate. ( They have a brand new mri machine in the same building ). My insurance company rejected the mri request. So I met with the surgeon, who is also in the neighborhood. He said, Well I could have you come in for a biopsy but I probably wont be able to see anytihing here in my office ( on HIS ultrasound machine ), so you will end up having to do an mri anyway so I can see where to place the needle. I thought this was strange. What would make him say that? So I said that I did not want an mri because I am so afraid of having a reaction to the dye Gadalynium that they inject, and could we please just go right for the needle biopsy. ( Which the insurance company has approved ). So he finally agreed to try and do a core biopsy today in his office. Well sure enough, he could not see any unhealthy tissue using his ultrasound machine, so we did not do the biopsy. The first thing out of him again is that we must push the insurance company for the mri. I said, well I may opt to just wait and do another ultrasound in 6 months. If there is nothing there today, then there is nothing there. He insists that this is the wrong decision. So I am wondering: 1- Why did he so correctly predict that he would not be able to see the so called mass with his ultrasound machine? 2- Does he get a \"kick back\" for referring someone to have the mri up the street? ( They have a brand new GE mri machine in this facility that I assume needs to be paid for ). This sounds fishy to me and I wonder if there was anything in the breast at all. We cannot feel a thing. Thanks for any insite. El",

      "Content": "Here is what the research says: Unfortunately, MRI and MRA contrast dye containing the heavy metal gadolinium has been the cause of a disease called Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) or Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermotherapy (NFD), a serious condition that starts in the skin of the arms and legs and spreads to other parts of the body. People who undergo an MRI\u0096especially those with kidney disease\u0096in which this contrast dye is used are particularly at risk for developing this disease.",
