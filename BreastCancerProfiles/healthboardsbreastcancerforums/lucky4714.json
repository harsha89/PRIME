      "Content": "I went to my ob three months ago about a lump i found in my left breast. We had a mammagrame done showed a nine centermiter breast lump.just went back to her again she is sending me back for yet another mammagrame because she feels like there are changes in the lump found before.My mother lost both breast at 41due to breast cancer.When i last spoke with her she keeps saying she wants to wait and see what this mammagrame says.My cocern is i want this seen about like now. I want the mass removed so that nothing further can happen but when i mentioned this to her she just keeps saying lets just watch this carefully. Should i insist on having it seen about are am i being over anxious? Advice needed and would be appreciated. I am 53 years old and have other health issues as well.Thanks Deannie",
