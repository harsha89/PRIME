      "Content": "Several years ago, I too went to the doctor because of pain in my left breast. they almost miss the cancer (carsonoma/ something to do with the milk duct) I was in my 30's and was told that kind of cancer would have been noticibly by age 45. they had did a biopsy and it was on the tip the biopsy. Today I'm having chemo because that cancer had spread to various parts of my bones and the fluid had settled in the space of my right lungs. Be aggressive with that pain please!!!!!!!!!!",
