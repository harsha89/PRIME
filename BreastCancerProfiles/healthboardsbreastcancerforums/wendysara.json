Pain is usually the last thing to show up in breast cancer. Well, that is a relief. I was a bit worried. So, what does it usually end up being that is causing these pains? For me, I have been told that it is hormonal changes. I have been growing in that area lately and since they are bigger, I have not had any pains....does this sound logical to you?? Thanks!",

      "Content": "It is kinda scary....I am kinda scared to feel for lumps too. Sometimes the pain is around my nipple and sometimes it is on the side of my breast near the underarm. The pain seems to feel like it is in the underarm sometimes. It is really weird. Thank you for your response. It makes me feel a little better. I was really worried about it being so young and already having breast problems. Thanks again",
