    "Content": "Hi Bev, I'm 53, and started regular mammo's at 40.... due to a couple of calcifications on one side, I've had (conservative estimate!) about 40 xrays now of the ol' girls. I remember how un-nerving it was to say the least, the first time they said, \"repeat the study, the result is not clear.\" You have yourself mentally in the worst possible scenarios within 5 minutes of getting that letter! Now I'm more accustomed to having to do repeats, and views where they magnify one area, and I'm still kicking... no cancer ever found. But I just wanted to write back and tell you I know how scary that is, and to say you'll probably have some more views taken, and all will be well. The other answer was correct that the denser (younger) tissue is often harder to show clearly. Try not to worry, and I'm betting the next time they will send you home with \"come back in a year.\"",
