      "Content": "Hi. Our daughter recently experienced a discharge from one of her nipples. From what I understand, if the discharge is white or yellowish, it is usually nothing to worry about. If it is bloody, brown or dark, it should definately be checked out. Hormonal changes can cause the discharge. See your doctor about it so you can relax and not worry. Keep us posted. Mary Ann",

      "Content": "Hi Dana. Remember most breast lumps are non-cancerous. Also, why the heck are they waiting until March 2nd. You have to be aggressive with your doctor, and tell him/her you don't want to wait that long. If it was their daughter or wife, you better believe they would get in right away. God Bless and keep us up-dated. Mary Ann",
