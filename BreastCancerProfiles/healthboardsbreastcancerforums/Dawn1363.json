    "Content": "Greetings, I saw your post & see that it's been quite a while since you wrote it, but I also saw no responses. I truly hope your scare was not cancerous, & that you had it checked. I'm a female but I have fibrous cysts that are small lumps & hot, & painful. Sometimes more than others. I have recently battled breast cancer, so far successfully but just wanted you to know I was concerned & truly hope you had this checked out. Take Care, Dawn",
