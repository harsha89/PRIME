    "Content": "I'm 61 years old, in apparent good health. I went yesterday for my annual mammogram, expecting nothing unusual. When I got back from the gym today there was a message from the clinic. When I called back, I was told they needed to do second mammograms of my right breast. They said it was probably nothing, but they like to double check all changes. They wanted to be sure to schedule me for when the Dr. would be there to \"give me the news\". That means a week wait, and worry about the \"news\". I'm worried, of course. So I went into the bathroom, and was manipulating my right breast & nipple- of course nothing that I could tell about, however, there was a small amount of thin, bloody discharge from one duct in my right nipple Now I'm REALLY scared. I've got an appointment with regular doctor for my annual checkup, which I've now delayed for a day so he'll have the mammogram results. Has anyone else had non-spontaneous nipple discharge like that?",
