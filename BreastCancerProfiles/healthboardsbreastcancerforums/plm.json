    "Content": "I had a mammogram at the end of August. Doctor said he saw a dense area and would like to compare it to a previous test. I got hold of a 3-year old mammogram and gave it to them. After comparing, he said he'd like to do a special view of left breast only. I went for that today. I had to get a doctor's order to take with me, and on the order, she wrote \"ultrasound if necessary\". After comparing today's test, he said maybe it was an overlap in tissue (or something like that), so to come back in 6 months for another left breast special view. Actually, it was the tech who came out and told me what the doctor said. That made me uncomfortable and I said why not just do the ultrasound if he thought there was something suspicious. She was nice, but pretty much said they would only do what that doctor reading the film said. So my question is this. If he felt there was something that he'd like to keep an eye on, why not do an ultrasound NOW rather than waiting? What if he sees something in 6 months that warrants an ultrasound. If I have something growing in there, it is allowing it 6 more months to grow. If he'd just said everything looked fine after looking at this special view today, I wouldn't be worried. But since he says to come back in 6 months, I don't like that. I suppose I could ask my regular doctor about it and ask her to order the ultrasound. Anybody have any experience with this? I'm just thinking of the \"early detection\" concept, and if this tests needs to be repeated in 6 months, why not just do an ultrasound now?",
