      "Content": "no i have not, i just figured the were all the same. i have a client who has about 5 or 6 of them on her head. I just think they (the drs.) arent as concerend as we are. I know i get nervous at the sign of any bump, where ever it may be. If you dont feel comfortable with the way they are treating this, speak up or get a second opinion. Good Luck with everything and try not to worry",

      "Content": "unfortunatly i had one of these also. mine was closer to the bikini line and the first time i had it removed was largely in part of my making the dr. remove it. I get freaked out of any lumps and bumps I was told it would probably come back. and it did. About a yr. after it came back (only about the size of a pea), i accidently nicked it while shaving (so tiny, i didnt even know i did it) the next day i woke up and it grew to the size of golf ball. i went right to the dr. and she was the one who asked if i had been shaving. apparently the tinniest nick can cause a major infection. Normally these sebacous (oil) cyst are not dangerous, but if it bothers you that much, ask he or she to remove it. Hope that helps",
