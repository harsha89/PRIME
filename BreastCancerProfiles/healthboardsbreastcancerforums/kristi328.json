    "Content": "I had a conization done in March of '99. So far, so good. I know that it is tramatic when you are going through it, but if you do what your dr tells you, and follow up like you should, there shouldn't be any further problems. And it is possible to get pregnant after having the cone done, at least it was for me. Good luck to you, and I hope it goes well.",
