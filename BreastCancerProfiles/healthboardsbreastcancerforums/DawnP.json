      "Content": "Search on the internet for information on Paget's Disease. It is breast cancer that starts as an exema (sp?) patch on the skin. I don't want to alarm you but want you to be aware so in case this is the situation it isn't left untreated. I read on Oncolink that usually there will be no accompanying lump in the breast so a mammogram would likely come out negative. I would recommend that you see a good breast surgeon to be safe! All the best to you and please let us know how you are! [This message has been edited by DawnP (edited 07-10-2002).]",

They didn't even have Chemo then! I don't know how effective treatments are today but I wanted to answer your question about whether BC can travel to the liver. All the best to you, DAWNP",
