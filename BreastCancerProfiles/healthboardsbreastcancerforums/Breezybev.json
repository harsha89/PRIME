I was told it is lymphodemia and received some massage and pressure bandages. Will it go away? What else can be done? Hope someone can help! Thanks Hi Vleglo, No, lymphodema (LE) doesn't go away. I was diagnosed with it, a few months ago, after my lumpectomy for breast cancer and radiation like you. I'm sorry you are going thru this. I've read that LE can happen even years later. The reason it needs to be watched and treated is because you can develop cellulitis which is extremely serious and can cause you to be hospitalized. I don't know about where you live, but in my area we're lucky enough to have two great LE clinics. One of them is connected with a hospital. My doctor sent me to a therapist there and she has taught me massage to help move the fluid along and got me a compression sleeve and a pump machine that does the same thing. Please get the information you need. I'm a member of the forums at: http://community.breastcancer.org It's a great site. I've gotten so much help and info. Just type in lymphedema in the search and several things will come up. There is also good info at the Mayo Clinic website. Good luck, Bev in the sunny Santa Cruz Mountains, CA, USA",
