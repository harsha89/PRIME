    "Content": "Find a way to get a mammogram right away. IF this doctor won't give you one, find someone that will, Even IF you have to go to the ER. I don't want you worried, but I do want you PRO_ACTIVE about this. Time is always of the essence. Please check back with us. A lump is a lump and needs to be checked out. I don't care where you are in your cycle. I am sorry, but I think this doctor is taking a risky chance with you. PLEASE seek a mammogram ASAP. (((Hugs))) Madison",
