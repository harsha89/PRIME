I had a wire guided biopsy where I had to go have two wires inserted first so they knew where the tissue was that needed to come out. Good luck and let me know how it goes!! Even mine was know big deal , except waiting for the results which were good!!",

But believe me I know your anxiety!! And thank God I recieved great results on the 25th. Try not to panic to much, I know it is easier said than done. I had approximately 7 in one group and it turned out to be nothing!! So good luck",

Back at the beginning of summer they saw the first ones and then 6 months later there were more so they (and I )wanted to be sure it was nothing to worry about. I go back tomorrow to have the stitches removed, I also am 49, they said they are very common in women of my age group.",
