      "Content": "Hi! All these questions are best answered for CERTAINTY by the breast biopsy and its results. It is the best advice I could give anyone. We can offer you our guesses, but I won't do that as I worked in the medical profession and I dealt in certainties. Nothing eases the mind more than an absolute answer based on facts. There may be no history of breast cancer in your family but there are life style choices that can put us at risk. The main one being HRT or hormone replacement therapy. Has your mom gone through menopause yet? Oft' times we, women, take HRT due to symptoms of menopause affecting the quality of our lives. I was absolutely miserable so I chose to take the risk with HRT. Society is getting much more intelligent now about the use of estrogen to control symptoms of menopause. Today they have safer estrogens not to mention other medications entirely that controls symptoms. The best advice I will give you is to stop reading and to stop torturing yourself by guessing. Support your mother lovingly and make sure she doesn't put off that biopsy! Please keep us posted because we really do care. Sandra",

      "Content": "There is nothing wrong with searching out new possiblities especially since you describe your situation as a living hell. Also, how does one just get used to having a tight chest and difficulty breathing? My God, having Lupus is plenty enough to deal with all on its own, you absolutely should seek out other options if it can improve the quality of your life in any way at all. Please discuss with your physician/surgeon something that is referred to as a \"scar revision\" surgery. This may be what you are looking for. Please keep in touch. Hugs~ Sandra",

Do we get nausea. What does it feel like. How long is a single \"zapping.\" Do we feel a burning sensation during the irradiation? I know we feel like we are sunburned afterward but what about during the treatment itself? Will I do worse than my darker \"sisters\" out there due to my being so d*** pale? Sandra",
