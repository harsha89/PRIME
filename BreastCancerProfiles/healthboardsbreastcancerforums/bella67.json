      "Content": "Well, not to get too graphic here..lol but it's on the inside of the labia. That skin in front of the clitoris. Gosh, it's been there for at least a year. I never sat there and felt around to see how many but it seems like a few. Maybe they swell when you shave. I read that somewhere before. If you even get a small knick somewhere after shaving you will get a swollen node. Although these are not painful. Thanks to both of you for your replies. Take care",

      "Content": "I should start off by saying that I've been through the whole cancer scare since august of this year. Last month I had 3 lymph nodes removed from my neck and it was a pretty difficult surgery being that it was right near my carotid artery. Aside from that I've been noticing lumps in weird places that I never worried about before, but now that the big C has been considered over these pasts months I figured I'd ask just to be sure. While showering I noticed lumps near my groin area. I looked up the location and it is called the \"labia majora\". Of course while searching about these lumps Vulva cancer appears to be in most links. Now these lumps move around and seem to be almost like lymph nodes. I don't currently have any infections that I know of and I'm not sure if it's normal for those to be there. Has anyone here ever experienced such lumps??",
