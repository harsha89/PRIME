    "Content": "Could this be fibrocystic disease? I had that for many years, so sore that I could not remove my bra at times because of the pain. It makes your entire breast very sensitive. I did get breast cancer after many years of fibrocystic disease. The cancer was much harder than the other lumps but that is not always the case. Just keep a good eye on it and don't let anyone make you feel as though it is nothing. Anything about your body that is out of whack is worth looking into. Just to find a doctor that actually cares. Big hugs.",
