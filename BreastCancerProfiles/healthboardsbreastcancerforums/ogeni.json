This is absolute torture for her, as it is for us to watch her go through this. I have been doing numerous searches on line at an endless rate only to find very devastating survival numbers. Is there anyone out there who has beaten this a second time, or knows of anyone who has??? There has to be some good news out there somewhere... I am worried sick. My mother has metastatic breast cancer and is on the third recurrence. Her first was breast cancer at 72, her second was lymph and leukemia at 77, and her third at 82 (right now) is lung, liver, brain, lymph, bone. They have been giving her pill chemotherapy and have eliminated the lung, liver, brain, and lymph cancers and are now working on the bone. The leukemia will never be eliminated, but is of a type that is not life threatening and requires no treatment. I also had breast cancer (mastectomy) 3 years ago and now have bone cancer. I just spoke to a woman who has had 6 years of remission from bone cancer. Where there's life, there's hope. xoxo",
