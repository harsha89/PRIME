    "Content": "Hi JC, I just saw this thread after having a similar sounding lump in my underarm (axilla) area biopsied 2 days ago. It turned out to be benign, and what they call a fibroadenoma or benign tumor made of breast tissue. I first found the pea-sized hard lump in 2007, had a mammo & ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a lipoma (fatty tumor - also benign). Well, this past summer I noticed that it was larger (now more of a green bean size, rather than pea sized) and got a bit worried and decided to check it out again. Long story short, this past Friday I went in to have a diagnostic mammogram (more views - ouch) and ultrasound and they decided to do a Fine Needle Aspiration (biopsy). So, now I definitely know it is not cancerous - not a lipoma, either and might possibly shrink when I get into menopause. I hope yours turns out to be nothing as well. I understand your anxiety about it, too. I know the relief I felt after finally finding out EXACTLY what it was. The biopsy wasn't all that bad, either. If you don't have one now, then my advice is to keep an eye on it and if you notice any changes, get back in to have it checked out. Good luck, take care! Kathy",
