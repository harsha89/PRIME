    "Content": "I will be 23 years old in a few months, and I recently found painful lumps in my breasts. After some encouragement from my mother, I went to my physician. She told me that the lumps were probably a result of fibrocystic changes in my breast. She also said that the lumps could be more tender and prominent during menstration. She said she did not believe I needed a mammogram because I am so young. Initially, I was relieved, but the lumps have continued to be prominent and painful even when I am not menstrating. I have a history of cancer in my family, and my grandmother on my mother's side actually had breast cancer. My question to all of you is: Should I accept the diagnosis from my physician, or should I obtain a second opinion? I don't want to go looking for something to be wrong with me, but I would like definitive proof that I truly am alright. I would be grateful for any advice you might have. Thanks!",
