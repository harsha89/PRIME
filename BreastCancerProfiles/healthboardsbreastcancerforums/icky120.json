    "Content": "I have also been getting pain in my left, sharp at times that comes and go. i do have a lump which i have had a biopsy on and it was fine. I am 26 and the women explained to me that during your 20's women can have breast surges. this is where your breast are changing and hormones are changing. its lasts for around 3-4 months. You should get it checked just to be sure. it sounds like what i am experiencing though.",
