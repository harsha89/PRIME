    "Content": "I am 34 years old, mother of 2 kids and I just discovered a lump in my left breast last night at 4:50pm. It is about the size of a grape and about 1 inch to the left of my areola (towards my armpit). It is a little tender and sore. I moves around but feels hard. To make it a little complicated, I have breast implants. I called my gyno who I now have an apt on Tuesday to see me. I called back to see if I could get in today to see one of his associates. I am waiting for his call. I called my plastic surgeon's office and they said I should get a mamo today, which sort of scared me. I have no breast cancer in my family, just other cancers. Is it ok to wait and should I just relax or should I be doing something today?? (today if Friday). I have never had a mamo and am scared of that too since I do have implants and the lump is sore. Any insight would be much appreciated to ease my mind.",
