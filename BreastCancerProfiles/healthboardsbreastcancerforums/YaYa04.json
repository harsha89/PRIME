Especially after your pain went away for a period of time in between. Please see your family doctor so he can initiate the proper work up. A breast exam is what a woman does on her own when checking for lumps. A Mammogram is totally different and normally only started when a woman is 45-50 or has breast cancer in her family. I am 37, my Grandmother (moms mother) died at 42 from breast cancer and my mom was diagnosed with it last year at 64. I was sent for one because it's in my family and I have more of a chance of ending up with it. It is not necessarily to have done unless for the above reasons. Getting one done just to see is not a good idea because of the radiation and there is some pain involved. Kitty24, I would suggest getting a chest x-ray and maybe a CT scan, but you definitely don't need a mammogram yet unless you fall under what I said above.",

She is going to see the doctor today but I'm worried out of my mind. Does anybody know why she is suddenly experiencing this pain? She currently has Hormonal treatments every 6 months - could this be related? I'm so scared that it might be breast cancer. Please help. Breast Cancer doesn't hurt until the woman is going through the treatment. Pain is not a symptom of breast cancer. The symptoms are: A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area, A change in the size or shape of the breast, A discharge from the nipple, A change in the color or feel of the skin of the breast, areola, or nipple (dimpled, puckered, or scaly).",
