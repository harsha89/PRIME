      "Content": "Hi - My friend told me about this board and your unanswered question! I hope you're still checking here. I am an IBC survivor (yeah!) cancer free since at least Dec 2004 (that's when I had surgery - pathology came back cancer free) I didn't have ANY symptoms that I noticed until literally one day I noticed my left breast twice the size of my right. I was wearing a shirt I'd bought just the month before for vacation that had fit me fine then - but I was busting out if it the day that I noticed it. I went to my gyno the next day and had a mammogram and ultrasound the next day - and was pretty much told I had BC at that point - didn't get \"official\" confirmation until after the biopsy and then found out it was IBC - which like most of us, I'd never heard of. (explains why you haven't gotten an answer!) I'd had a mammogram the Sept.2003 before - this all happened the first week of July 2004 - and it was fine. So it happened really fast - although traditional mammograms aren't very good at catching IBC - but it made me feel better to know I'd at least done what I was supposed to do - no \"what if's\". As I read more on IBC I saw where an itchy nipple can sometimes be a symptom - and I had that happen a few times probably about 3 months before diagnosis. I just thought it was dry skin after going to Walt Disney World and swimming at spring break - and maybe it was! Anyway - I'd be glad to answer any other questions or offer support if needed. I didn't find anyone who'd had IBC until well after my treatments were over - when I looked on the internet it was ususally doom and gloom - so I quit looking. I can say that I believe Herceptin saved my life.",
