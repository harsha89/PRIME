      "Content": "Hello to the board, I just recently found this message board and I wonder if someone could give me some advice. Last night, I found a hard, pea-sized lump in my armpit- actually, slightly larger than pea-sized. I checked again this morning and it's still there, and after touching it, now the side of my breast is feeling sore. I'm a week off from my period starting, and have had general aching in my breasts when I'm premenstrual, but this didn't start to feel sore until after I had manipulated this lump with my fingers. Does this sound like something I should make an appt with my doctor over? Or should I wait till after my period comes and goes and see if it's still there? Thanks for any advice you can give! Aims",
