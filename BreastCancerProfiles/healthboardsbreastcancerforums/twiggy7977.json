      "Content": "Hi NicoleMM I completely understand what you are going through. I have found two lumps in my right breast. My doctor also felt them and sent me for an ultrasound and Mammogram. The lab ladies could feel them but nothing showed on either of the tests... I have since gone back to my doctor and he told me because we can feel but not see the lumps then he is sending me to a Breast Surgeon. I see him on the 20th of April....it is then we will determine what to do. I would like to have them Biopsied or removed. I am sure they are nothing more than cysts or breast tissue...but i do want to be 100% sure as we can't prove that on the ultrasound... You aren't alone....let me know what you find out.. Twiggy",

      "Content": "Hi, I would certainly have them feel it while you are standing...in any position that you need to be in to have it felt the best. I had a lump ( benign ) that was felt easier if my arm was relaxed by my side rather than over my head...not sure why... Also I had to find the lump with my fingers first...to give them an idea where to feel....my lump was about the size of a quarter when they removed it...and could still be hard to feel in certain positions.. I guess it the way the breast tissue is around it. ?? I am glad that you are getting a second opinion...i would also ask for an ultra sound...and mammogram... Let me know how it goes.. Twiggy",

I was to be at the hospital at least an hour early...and then of course had to wait longer than that! ha! they were a bit behind. I did have a local...the breast was totally frozen...feels very odd.. I didn't have any sedation...i was pretty calm and didn't want or need any. I can understand your nervousness..i was too...extremely. Mostly cause i didn't know what to expect...with the whole procedure. It was a lot eaiser and better than i expected....we always think the worst right?! My lump was almost under my nipple on the inside of my right breast... I didn't have any pain with it at all. I was at my doctor this morning as i am still having pain under where my incision is...running down to the middle of my ribcage. He thinks it is nerves healing... was odd cause the pain didn't start till a month after my surgery...just feels like a bruise..no color or anything.. guess it is normal.. ha! I hope this helps abit...and please ask as many as you want! glad i can help.. keep me posted!! hugs, Twiggy",

She called this morning to ask about my breast cancer scare...as she had a mammogram this week and got a call that they found a lump. she is so scared as she is in the middle of chemo for cancer already... She goes for an utlrasound soon...see if it is just a cycst or what... I am sure she will be fine...but i am finding it hard...she is still coming to terms with the one cancer..and now this...breaks my heart...Trying to be strong for her... Please pray for her.. thanks for listening.. hugs, Twiggy",

      "Content": "hi.. glad to hear that he thinks it is benign... I did the out paitent as well..it was done in the hospital...had a local. The whole thing took about an hour. I got to watch the whole thing...was quite interesting in a odd way... Saw what the 'lump' looked like... I took the day off work the next day as it is uncomfortable....was very sensative for over a week... My scar is about an inch long...he did the incision around my nipple as the lump was kinda 1/2 under it...so the scar should fade into the nipple...ya! My fibroadenoma was about the size of a quarter...so i am thinking maybe your scar will be smaller?? not sure. When do you go in to get it removed? I think you are doing the right thing...it would have drove me nuts to have it in me and not be 100% sure what it was...even my surgeon said that.. Glad that i did it.. Please let me know how it goes for you! hugs, Twiggy",

I got the results over a week later...but the surgeon was pretty sure by seeing the lump that it was fine...that made me feel good. although I still stressed till the moment i heard it was benign... then i cried... didn't realize how stressed i was about the whole thing till it was over. Must say i am parinoid now....i worry about it more...more aware i guess.. which i supose is good..to a point.. Hang in there! thinking about you! Twiggy",

I did have pain to...mine started a few weeks after my surgery...it went almost in a straight line from my incision to the middle of my ribs. hurt to touch as well...like a brusie but with no discoloration or anything...just an odd pain. I talked to my doc about it..and a few other ladies who had the same thing. It is nerve pain...from them healing. I would still mention it to your doc though..just to be safe.

      "Content": "Hi, I had a lump in my breast back in April that i had removed and biopsied was benign...but it started out the same way...i could feel it..the doc and techs could feel it but couldn't see it on either the ultrasound or mam. Because we couldn't see it my doc sent me to a breast surgeon and we decided for my peace of mind ( he thought all along that it was benign) that we should remove it. Like he said...we can't be 100% sure by just feeling it. So we removed it. It was about the size of a quarter. If it worries you at all...ask for it to be biopsied. That is the only way you will know 100% what it is...and for your own peace. Let us know how things go.. hugs, Twiggy (Oh...i am 32)",

      "Content": "Hi all, Earlier this year i had found a lump in my right breast...after all the tests and waiting i had it removed and it was..thank goodness Benign.. Well i am back here again...found a lump in my Left breast. I am hoping it is the same as the first...but of course will have it looked at. Is it common to have more than one Benign lump? in diff. breasts? I am curious to see if this one will show on the Mammogram or Ultra sound as the last one didn't. I really am not looking forward to this again....and i am amazed how quick it formed. I have been even more fanatical about checking my breast each month since the last experience...and felt nothing until about 2 weeks ago...then this one....it is about the size of a marble. how do they grow so fast? I don't get it. I am really trying hard to not get as worried and as upset as the last time...as the chances are that it is just a benign tumor..but at the same time it is very hard to not. Oh well...see what happens.. hugs, Twiggy",
