    "Content": "Fibrocystic disease can scare you. Your breasts are lumpy and hurt etc...the only piece of advice for you would be if it bothers you, seek second opinion. I feel you can never be too vigilant about breast issues. Docs can be wrong because of many issues, and second opinions should be expected by any doc as a sign of taking care of oneself. If ANY doc seems bothered by you getting a second opinion, then you got a bad doc!! I worked at a cancer center and saw this all the time. Take care of YOU!",
