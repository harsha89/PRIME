      "Content": "For the past couple of months I have had pain on the upper side of my left breast up near my armpit. Sometimes the pain is in my armpit as well. I had my armpit checked by my gen. prac & gyn and both said no lumps in armpit. Gyn sain I had dense breast tissue on right breast which I am having a mommo. tomorrow to check that further. Right nipple is very painful & sensitive as well. Today my left side was aching again and after I has pressed on it a few times it became much worse. The left side is definitely swollen. Of course after searching the net I am concerned of breast cancer. Even though pain is rarely a symptom I can't help but worry and think the worst. I think I am driving my self crazy with the \"What If's\" Does anyone experience this type of breat/armpit pain & tenderness? It seems some days are betyter than others. Today...not a good day Any help appreciated. Thanks..... I posted on Women's Health as well. If not allowed please let me know.",

      "Content": "Did you suspect? Or was it detected only through a routine mammo? Did you have any pain? How soon after your mammo did you find out? Do they call right away? Here we receive a letter about a week or two later if everything was normal. Also can they tell through a mammo if it has spread? Lymph area? Thanks for any info. I really appreciate it. I hate the waiting & the fear of the unknown.",
