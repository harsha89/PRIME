      "Content": "Well, it's been quite a few months since I first posted this thread. Now I have some answers and I would like to provide an update for those people out there still wondering. I know that what I had would probably not be the same for other people but maybe my experience could guide other people in the right direction. I saw my gynecologist last month and after she examined me she said that she doesn't feel any lumps and that what I described to her sounded like normal premenstrual symptoms. However, she said that since I am so worried she's going to send me in for a mammogram. I had my mammo last week, they had a radiologist look at the pictures, then she wanted me to have an ultrasound. After the ultrasound she explained to me that what they are seeing is extra breast tissue in my armpit. She said it's something normal but they want to watch it for a while so I'm going back for a repeat mammo in six months. Today I also saw a breast surgeon as per the recommendation from my gyno. The surgeon agreed with the findings from the mammo and she said the same thing: wait and watch unless I want it removed. So I guess if it grows in the next few months they'll want it removed but otherwise what I'm exeperiencing seems to be something very common. So that's my story, I hope that it could at least help one person.",

I am getting worried about the lump but I'm trying to be logical about this and am forcing myself to wait until after my period. But it's hard not to worry :-( I'm hoping to hear from people with similar experiences. Thanks!",

      "Content": "So, I had my mammogram yesterday. Not too bad, I guess, but my breast are really sore today. Is that normal? They also did an ultrasound and it turns out that I have accessory breast tissue in my armpit area. They told me not to worry about it, but they want me to go back in six months? Why is that? Should I be worried? Can this turn into cancer?",
