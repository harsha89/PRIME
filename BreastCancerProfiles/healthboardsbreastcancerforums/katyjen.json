    "Content": "Hi there, sorry to hear about what you are going through. In 2008 I underwent a bilateral double mast with reconstruction in the same surgery. It was supposed to only last about 10 hours but turned into 13 hours because the left breast stated to die immediately becaue it didn't have adeqaute blood supply. I was 36 when I went thorught this, it is alot to go thorugh. There are 2 additional surgeries to remove the skin graphs and pull everythiing together and then another after that for your nipples and then lastly tattooing. Be prepared to take about 2-3 months off from work after the initial surgery. You have 6 drainage tubes for several weeks. Hope that helps and let me know if you have any additional questions. Jen",
