      "Content": "She said she noticed them a few weeks ago, and they only seem to appear when she is about to start her period. Is that a normal thing? Her breasts also get pretty swollen when she starts. Also when she had our daughter she had a lot of problems with her mils, she got REALLY big and we could not get a lot of it out. She was in a lot of pain becuase of it, could that somehoe be related? We have a doctors appoinment set for a few weeks from now. Both lumps are in the same spot that's why I think it has something to do with her trouble after she gave birth, but i'm scared anyway.",
