My surgeon who is a breast specialist told me that he sees 50-60 patients with what he called \"nuisance\" conditions before he sees any malignancies. He said that there are about 100 things that can happen to breasts and that basically cancer is the only life-threatening one. I had a more minor bleeding and crusting on the other side later, but that was a duct blocked with sebaceous gunk. Cheers, Sera",

(FREAKED OUT MAMA) Then she went into hospital that afternoon (mainly because he had ops listed the next day), and removed it. They did an instant biopsy and by the time she came to, they were able to tell us it was a fibroma. It was very big, though, and it took quite a few years for her little breast to re-shape itself around the space. I am sure that your daughter is the same. These things are common at that age, although they may herald a lifetime of getting them from time to time. My sister had three altogether. Best wishes, Sera.",
