    "Content": "For about a month or two, I've noticed that my left armpit had been a little sore, but I just ignored it because I thought it was just infected hairs. Directly after that, I noticed the pigmentation on my armpit seemed a little weird. Like a purplish color? I then went through an itchy stage, when my armpit was very itchy. I switched deodorants in hope that my skin was just reacting to my deodorant. However, about a week ago, a lump appeared on my left armpit. It has gotten bigger and more painful in the passed week. It hurts to even touch it, and especially hurts when I raise my arm up. You can't see the lump unless my arm is raised. It's very hard and it does not move. Does anyone know what this could be? I am a 19 year old female.",
