    "Content": "Hi....I'm needlessly worried about this, I'm sure.....32 years old, first mammo done 8 or so months ago because lump felt/family history of breast cancer. Was birad 3, ultrasound done, couldn't see well, was told to follow up in 6 months, the breast center doc said possibly a complex cyst. second mammo (diagnostic) today, took several views, left, came back and took a few more. I had assumed there would be an ultrasound again...but they tech said no, that the radiologist said I could go... So I'm thinking that if there was anything on the mammo, they would have done the ultrasound again, right? Don't see the breast doc for a couple weeks (why do they schedule appts that far after the mammo???) so I don't want to stress about it til then......any thoughts?",
