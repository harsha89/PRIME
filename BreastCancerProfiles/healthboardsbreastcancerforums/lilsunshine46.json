      "Content": "Not all military drs are bad. My own Ortho Oncol dr at Wilford Hall in Tx is the best. I go there from Dc all the time , even though they have them here because the ones here won't treat me. But I was misdiagnosed to begin with so I don't trust a lot of drs and My daughter was shuffled around in the beginning.She was supposed to have had a kidney US at 3 yrs but a dr decided that it wasn't needed after all and now she has severe kidney damage to her left kidney. They aren't sure if it's related to her left ovary or if it's congenital or both. That's another thing I'm mad about but we'lll wait til her surgery to find out the extent of the damage.",

      "Content": "You could always Medevac to Wilford Hall if they thought it was worrisome. That is what they said about my daughters and believe me in her case they are worried! She probably does have cancer and there is nothing we can do about it. The drs have all dropped the ball on her for the last 18 months and I am ******! For the last 3 months I have been telling them that she has been sicker and I didn't think it was from the spinal fluid built up in her brain, I shouldn't have to be the dr I didn't go to medical school. For her sake I hope they are wrong and it's just a large benign tumor that is infected. For their sake as well! Good luck to you,",

      "Content": "Yes ,for 4 yrs they told me that having an inverted nipple and \"normal\" mammograms was OK. I even had an MRI /guided biopsy that they said was suggestive of invasive carcinoma but the results came back not as a fibrodaenoma but not malignant. The results were obvisiouly wrong as here I am after 4 yrs of \"normal\"nd I get a full body Pet scan from my Ortho dr and I have 5 lesions in my brain(mets) ,3 mets in my liver,and so many lymph npodes throughout my body enlarged thatthe drs were amazed I didn't realize I was \"sick\". I knew I was dizzy a lot,I was getting headaches which I never got before and I was just in general not feeling well. I am also an above the amputee but exercise uin the 3 times a week but even that was getting to be too much for me. Sorry if I sound bitter but finding out you might only have 18-24 months left to live,although I plan on going against the odds and being one of those who goes for 5-10 yrs. Bonnie",

If you can't be seen within 30 days then they have to let you go to a civilian. I usually don't push it but for my FNB/A of my Thyroid they made me go to a civilian as the drs didn't want me to wait. It will take 3 days for the Tricare people to authorize the referall but unless my math is bad you are within the 30 days time frame. Call now and ask about this. We are military and go to Walter Reed or Bethesda for are big stuff. We have the options of also Andrews AF or some other places but they have to be within 40 miles of my home. WR is about 28 miles as it is. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "No they said my \"benign\" tumor was not a fibroidoma but was not cancer either ,just not significant for them. I even had one BC spec tell me that breast pain sucks! but you don't get breast pain with BC so she basically told me to go away. I think because they thought since I had one bone tumor that I was a hypochondriac, well I think we women know our bodies. I guess I did prove them wrong, sucks for me indeed! I even went back over the course of the 4 yrs for the special digital mammos ,USs you name it, they never did repeat my MRI until this. But the funny thing is with the inverted nipple they just kept saying ,\"it can happen,no big deal\" I think even if that is the only symptom a woman has ,they should do more. Bonnie",

      "Content": "I have this also. I have lost 25 lbs, and I am not trying. I have gone from a size 12 to a size 8 in a yrs time. I have had an MRI which in the 1st one it said I have an 1cm \"mass\" that they thought was a small invasive carcinoma. \"oh my\" I thought so off i Go for a biiopsy. Well the dr that did my biopsy said that none of my symptoms {pain , itching, larger breast, inverted nipple that is new , and nipple that is irritated etc} could be the cause of my breast mass. HUH? so of course my biopsy came back benign. I went for a 2nd opinion this dr said continue with Vit E and Promrose oil {the 1st drs cure} and he might consider estrogen if my next MRI was neg/pos? anyway it came back benign the dr who did my biopsy said. I give up. I said Ok I am supposed to live with this pain and you guys are just going to ignore the fact that my nipple all of sudden decided to invert? I take Lyrica and Celebrex twice a day already for pain so I doubt the Vit E and EP oil are going to touch the pain. HaHa. I am 47 and 4 yrs without a period. I don't buy the hormonal thing but I might buy into it being throid related IF this is possible as I have Hashimotos and have never been put on meds. Bonnie",

I do think that my weight loss could be due to my throid but none of my drsd seem to be real upset about it although they all comment on how I have lost such a large amount of weigt etc. MY GI dr is the only one who was concerned but my colonoscopy came back neg , it was my 3rd in 8 yrs. My 1st they found precancerous polyps so I was supposed to have 1 every 5 yrs but I was having bleeding problems so required more often. I will ask the Endo Dr when I get seen about the weight loss /inverted nipple thing. Bonnie",

I was told that the Rad Dr saw clear fluid come out of mine when she did my breast exam and she told me that an inverted nipple sometimes means there is a tumor behind the nipple drawing it in. I had Us and mammogram but they wanted and MRI of my breasts. I was told they found a small \"mass\" and it needed biopsy as the Rad Dr said possible invasive carcinoma. My biopsy said benign but not a fibroid adenoma. HUH? I still have the inversion and pain. I know they say breast pain usually does not signify BC but what else can it be. I have itching around my shoulder and back on the left side. I also have what I think are swollen lymph nodes. I hope that your testing will provide answers. Bonnie",

The biopsy was apparently normal and I was told the inverting was no big deal. Fastforward to 2011 and I have now been diagnosed stage iv breast cancer with mets to the brain ,liver and lymph nodes. How did this happen????To say I am angry is an understatement.If I were any of you I would not give up. I even got 2nd and 3rd opinions. I finally said , Oh well I guess when I get breast cancer they will finally see what I am talking about. Little did I know I would really get cancer!Esp so soon.",

I am having pain and itching around my clavicle, the same spot always for the itching. My nipple does itch somewhat. Anyway I went to the breast care clinic and nothing on the Mammogram or US but the radiology dr saw somw clear fluid coming out when she examined me so they sent me for an MRI. It showed a small\"mass\" that the radioly dr said COULD be a tumor behind the nipple pulling it in. So I had a biopsy and it came back benign. So they sent me on my merry way, yet I stil have the same symptoms. I too lost 25 lbs without trying and went from a size 12 to size 6 and 8. I went back to see a breast care dr (although she was a Gen Surgery dr) and she told me \"breast pain sucks\" . I didn't feel this was the right answer , do you? Hopefully your tests come back normal, benign but that still leaves you the question of why does my nipple invert?I feel like eventually mine will assert itself and bring on some kind of diagnosis other than it sucks!

Mine came back negative but they say I might need an excisional biopsy as they feel that the drs don't feel they got the right samples cells versus tissue{I guess} and with my symptoms or signs I have to agree with them. I think that they need to rethink me waiting 6 months for a new MRI as well. I am certanily not going to.
