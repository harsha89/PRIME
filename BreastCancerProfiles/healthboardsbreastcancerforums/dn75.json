      "Content": "Please forgive me if I'm missing something - I was just diagnosed with BC in May and have had 2 surgeries (the dr. didn't get a clear enough margin the first time and went in the 2nd to be sure he had it all). Anyway - I was told it was stage 0 and he took 2 lymph nodes which were clear. I've been told I'll only need radiation and I had a lumpectomy - why would your sister have a double masectomy and why would she need chemo also? Do they think there might be cancer cells somewhere else that they want to do a pet scan? As I said, this is all new to me and I'm scared to death but am also wanting to learn as much as I can. Thank you",
