    "Content": "Hi there, don't know the answer to your question but when I went to my doctor with several questions plus the lump on my breast which I left to the end of my visit she took one look and almost fainted or at least turned white. So here is the clue. Cancer is heavy and it will hang onto the ducts and cause dimples above the area of the nipple. Sure sign I think. Hope that helps.",
