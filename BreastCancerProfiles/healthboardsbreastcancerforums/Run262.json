      "Content": "If you are this worried and have the history that you do with your mother - go and get your films/reports and go ahead and see a breast surgeon. If they can see \"it\" on the ultrasound then they can stick a needle in \"it\" to tell you for sure what \"it\" is or isn't. You need piece of mind, waiting 6 months is going to drive you nuts. Be proactive in your heath, take charge and DEMAND resolution NOW. No need to wait 6months. Good luck.",

After the tests you describe above STILL show nothing and you/doctors can still feel the lump - have someone biopsy it for crying out loud...that's what they are going to do ANYWAY, even if the MRI shows something. You might even just want to say, \"look enough with the expensive tests, someone biopsy the damn thing, let's get an answer!\" Good luck and keep us posted.",
