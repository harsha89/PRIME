    "Content": "Hi goldenmommy, I did some reading and happened to see yours and wanted to try and help relieve some of your anxiety if I can. I have been going for Mammograms every year with ultra sound after the mammo and then an MRI of breasts 4 months after mammo and then seeing my breast specialtist for a hands on exam so that I'm always being checked being i'm high risk due to my family history. BOTH of my sisters had breast cancer and my maternal aunt did too, and grandmother of ovarian cancer. I haven't had a genetic test performed yet. from what I've learned about cysts is that they are round looking and not solid on the radiology picture. Cancer is not perfectly round and is dense. the radiologists use all these hard terms to explain to us folks who haven't gone to med school.. lol I'm sure they will keep an eye on your cyst and the lymph node. I was just told I have that too, plus other things that I didn't find comforting once I researched it because the radiologist made it sound like it's nothing even though I keep getting a Birads 2. which means something is there but is benign. It will tell you at the bottom of last written report of your tests what Birad yours is. What is your Birads? Do you have a family history of breast cancer? they say that if they find something suspicious looking on mammo that the ultra sound can tell the radiologist whether it's solid or fluid filled. If you feel uncomfortable with the results from your radiologist and DR, then maybe you should seek a 2nd opinion. sorry you are going through all this at such a young age. It's important to be diligent about your yearly mammo's and ultra sounds so I'm glad to see you go. I think they suggest woman start getting mammo's in their 30's for a baseline so they can compare future ones to the first one to see if there is any changes. they found a few atypical cells( pre-malignant) in my biopsy so I just make sure I go ever time I'm supposed to. They cut it out in a surgical biopsy and I\"ve had biopsies by a needle guided one and a needle core biopsy, all within 3 yrs in a row. I was like WOW! biopsies every year? Its a good thing my gyno referred me to this cancer group for their breast surgeons, because all I was seeing prior to the specialists was a general surgeon who didn't even specialize in breasts. so maybe you can go to a breast cancer cntr? if you have dense breasts it's hard for the radiologist to see a small mass because it lights up as white and dense tissue lights up as white which can block a dangerous mass. THAT scares me. it's manadatory now that radiologists tell their patients they have dense breasts. so that they can get MRI's to see better. your doctor is doing everything correct according to what they're to do. I was worried about the lymph nodes being enlarged in my breast as well and in the underarm. yet my radiologist and Dr. aren't concerned, and I too am considering a 2nd opinion being I'm such high risk. Please keep us updated about your problem. I hope you find peace of mind. anxiety can make it worst for you. Be well.",
